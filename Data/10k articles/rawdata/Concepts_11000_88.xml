{{Black Power sidebar}}
During their medal ceremony in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]] on October 16, 1968, [[African Americans|African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] each [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]] during the playing of the US national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". While on the podium, Smith and Carlos, who had won gold and bronze medals respectively in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metres|200-meter]] running event of the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], turned to face the US flag and then kept their hands raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human-rights badges on their jackets.

In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute but rather a "human rights salute". The demonstration is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's [[Peter Norman]] finished second with a time of 20.06&amp;nbsp;seconds, and the US's John Carlos won third place with a time of 20.10&amp;nbsp;seconds. After the race was completed, the three went to the podium for their medals to be presented by [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter]]. The two US athletes received their medals shoeless, but wearing black socks, to represent black poverty.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |publisher=BBC |title=1968: Black athletes make silent protest |accessdate=9 November 2008 |date=17 October 1968 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq5SLffC?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith wore a black scarf around his neck to represent black pride, Carlos had his tracksuit top unzipped to show solidarity with all [[blue-collar worker]]s in the US and wore a necklace of beads which he described "were for those individuals that were lynched, or killed and that no-one said a prayer for, that were hung and [[Tarred and feathered|tarred]]."

The famous picture of the event was taken by photographer [[John Dominis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://life.time.com/culture/black-power-salute-tommie-smith-and-john-carlos-at-the-1968-olympics/#1 | publisher=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | title=Hope and Defiance: The Black Power Salute That Rocked the 1968 Olympics | accessdate=13 November 2013 | date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both US athletes intended to bring black gloves to the event, but Carlos forgot his, leaving them in the Olympic Village. It was Peter Norman who suggested Carlos wear Smith's left-handed glove. For this reason, Carlos raised his left hand as opposed to his right, differing from the traditional Black Power salute.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm |publisher=BBC | title=The other man on the podium | accessdate=9 November 2008 | date=17 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081020092915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm| archivedate=20 October 2008| deadurl= no | first=Caroline | last=Frost}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' played, Smith and Carlos delivered the salute with heads bowed, a gesture which became front-page news around the world.

But if I did something bad, then they would say I am a Negro. We are black and we are proud of being black. Black America will understand what we did tonight."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Tommie Smith stated in later years that "We were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches. About how [[Muhammad Ali]] got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/erika-smith/2015/03/18/smith-tried-make-moment-movement/24983931/|title=Smith: 'They tried to make it a moment, but it was a movement'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Olympic Committee response ==
[[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president [[Avery Brundage]] deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/September-October-08/On-this-Day--US-Athletes-Give-Black-Power-Salute-on-Olympic-Podium.html On This Day: Tommie Smith and John Carlos Give Black Power Salute on Olympic Podium]. Findingdulcinea.com. Retrieved on 13 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the IOC said Smith and Carlos's actions were "a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Brundage, who was president of the United States Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against [[Nazi salute]]s during the [[1936 Berlin Olympics|Berlin Olympics]]. He argued that the Nazi salute, being a national salute at the time, was acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes' salute was not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Olympic Story", editor James E. Churchill, Jr., published 1983 by Grolier Enterprises Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brundage had been accused of being one of the United States' most prominent Nazi sympathisers even after the outbreak of the Second World War,&lt;ref&gt;Documentary "Hitler's Pawn: The Margeret Lambert Story", produced by HBO and Black Canyon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/31/sport/germany-berlin-jewish-olympics-maccabi/index.html|title=Adolf Hitler and the man 'who beat Jesse Owens' - CNN|first=James Masters,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his removal as president of the IOC had been one of the three stated objectives of the Olympic Project for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XGA7LZuDbbgC Silent Gesture – Autobiography of Tommie Smith]'' (excerpt via [[Google Books]]) – Smith, Tommie &amp; Steele, David, [[Temple University Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59213-639-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the official IOC website stated that "Over and above winning medals, the black American athletes made names for themselves by an act of racial protest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/mexico-1968-summer-olympics Mexico 1968] (official [[International Olympic Committee]] website.

== Aftermath ==
Smith and Carlos were largely ostracized by the US sporting establishment and they were subject to criticism. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on October 25, 1968, wrote: "[[Citius, Altius, Fortius (Olympic motto)|'Faster, Higher, Stronger']] is the motto of the Olympic Games. 'Angrier, nastier, uglier' better describes the scene in Mexico City last week."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/vault/issue/1968-10-25/page/78/|title=The TIME Vault: October 25, 1968|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1968&gt;{{cite news |title=The Olympics: Black Complaint|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900397,00.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=Time|date=25 October 1968|quote="Faster, Higher, Stronger" is the motto of the Olympic Games.

Smith continued in athletics, playing in the [[National Football League|NFL]] with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/tommie-smith-9487382 Tommie Smith]. biography.com&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming an assistant professor of physical education at [[Oberlin College]]. In 1995, he helped coach the US team at the World Indoor Championships at [[Barcelona]]. In 1999 he was awarded the California Black Sportsman of the Millennium Award. He is now a public speaker.

Carlos' career followed a similar path. He tied the [[100&amp;nbsp;yard dash]] world record the following year. Carlos also tried professional football, was a 15th round selection in the [[1970 NFL Draft]], but a knee injury curtailed his tryout with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref name="DidingerLyons2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ray Didinger|author2=Robert S.

In 1985, he became a track and field coach at [[Palm Springs High School]]. As of 2012, Carlos works as a counselor at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Former Olympians: No regrets over 1968 protest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/21/oly-athl-usa-protest-adv-idUSL2E8IC65M20120721|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman, who was sympathetic to his competitors' protest, was criticized by conservatives in the Australian media. [[Julius Patching]], the Australian Chef de Mission, was amused and semi-jokingly told Norman off in private with the words, "They're screaming out for your blood, so consider yourself severely reprimanded.

However Australian officials say he was not picked because he came third in the Australian trials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Norman not shunned by AOC|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/news/peter-norman-not-shunned-by-aoc|publisher=Australian Olympic Committee|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to a knee injury which severely affected his performance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Ron|title=Peter may have lost team place|url=http://aoc-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/corporate/live/files/dmfile/Peter%20Norman%20-%20Ron%20Carter%20article%20-%20The%20Age%201972.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2016|agency=The Age|date=27 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was only cautioned after the 1968 incident, and he had been profiled "one of our finest Olympians". Norman also represented Australia at the [[Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970 Commonwealth Games]].

When Norman died in 2006, Smith and Carlos were [[pallbearers]] at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin|last=Flanagan|authorlink=Martin Flanagan (journalist)|title=Olympic protest heroes praise Norman's courage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/olympic-protest-heroes-praise-normans-courage/2006/10/09/1160246069969.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Australia formally apologized to Norman, with one MP telling Parliament that Norman's gesture "was a moment of heroism and humility that advanced international awareness for racial inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewleigh.com/3389|title=Parliament Apologises to Peter Norman|author=|date=|website=andrewleigh.com|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary films ==
The 2008 [[Sydney Film Festival]] featured a documentary about the protest entitled ''[[Salute (2008 film)|Salute]]''. The film was written, directed and produced by [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]], a nephew of Peter Norman.&lt;ref name="SydneyFilmFestival_2008_ProgramRevealed_MattNorman_Salute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/content.asp?id=21&amp;nid=116&amp;p=20|title=2008 Program Revealed!|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=17 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125152931/http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/content.asp?id=21&amp;nid=116&amp;p=20 |archivedate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2008, [[BBC Four]] broadcast a documentary, ''Black Power Salute'', by Geoff Small, about the protest. In an article, Small noted that the athletes of the British team attending the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in Beijing had been asked to sign gagging clauses which would have restricted their right to make political statements but that they had refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/09/olympicgames2008.humanrights |work=The Guardian |location=UK | last=Small | first=Geoff | date=9 July 2008 | title=Remembering the Black Power protest | accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tributes ==
In a 2011 speech to the [[University of Guelph]], Akaash Maharaj, a member of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] and head of Canada's [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic equestrian team]], said, "In that moment, Tommie Smith, Peter Norman, and John Carlos became the living embodiments of Olympic idealism. Ever since, they have been inspirations to generations of athletes like myself, who can only aspire to their example of putting principle before personal interest. It was their misfortune to be far greater human beings than the leaders of the IOC of the day."&lt;ref&gt;Speech to the Ontario Equine Center at the University of Guelph, Akaash Maharaj, 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington, DC also features a statue to honor the athletes' tribute.

=== San Jose ===
In 2005, [[San Jose State University]] honored former students Smith and Carlos with a 22-foot high statue of their protest titled ''Victory Salute'', created by artist [[Rigo 23]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen|last=Slot|title=America finally honours rebels as clenched fist becomes salute|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article580095.ece|work=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=19 October 2005|accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A student, Erik Grotz, initiated the project; "One of my professors was talking about unsung heroes and he mentioned Tommie Smith and John Carlos. He said these men had done a courageous thing to advance civil rights, and, yet, they had never been honored by their own school." The statues are located in a central part of the campus at {{coord |37.335495 |-121.882556 |display=inline |name=Olympic Black Power Statue}}, next to Robert D. Clark Hall and Tower Hall.

Those who come to view the statue are allowed to participate by standing on the monument. Peter Norman is not included in the monument so viewers can be in his place; there is a plaque in the empty spot inviting those to "Take a Stand." Norman requested that his space was left empty so visitors could stand in his place and feel what he felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 2: John Carlos, 1968 U.S. Olympic Medalist, On the Response to His Iconic Black Power Salute|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/10/12/part_2_john_carlos_1968_olympic_us_medalist_on_the_response_to_his_iconic_black_power_salute|publisher=Democracy Now!|accessdate=8 October 2015|date=12 October 2011|quote=I would like to have a blank spot there and have a commemorative plaque stating that I was in that spot. But anyone that comes thereafter from around the world and going to San Jose State that support the movement, what you guys had in '68, they could stand in my spot and take the picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bronze figures are shoeless but there are two shoes included at the base of the monument. The right shoe, a bronze, blue Puma, is next to Carlos; while the left shoe is placed behind Smith. The signature of the artist is on the back of Smith's shoe, and the year 2005 is on Carlos's shoe.

The faces of the statues are realistic and emotional. "The statue is made of fiberglass stretched over steel supports with an exoskeleton of ceramic tiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/OLYMPIC-PROTEST-Smith-and-Carlos-Statue-2601229.php|title=SF GATE - Olympic Protest|last=Crumpacker|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigo 23 used 3D scanning technology and computer-assisted virtual imaging to take full-body scans of the men.

=== Sydney mural ===
In Australia, an airbrush mural of the trio on podium was painted in 2000 in the inner-city suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] in Sydney. Silvio Offria, who allowed the mural to be painted on his house in Leamington Lane by an artist known only as "Donald," said that Norman, a short time before he died in 2006, came to see the mural. "He came and had his photo taken; he was very happy," he said.&lt;ref name=Newtown_10&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/last-stand-for-newtowns-three-proud-people-20100726-10smr.html "Last stand for Newtown's 'three proud people'"] by Josephine Tovey, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 27 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The monochrome tribute, captioned "&lt;small&gt;THREE PROUD PEOPLE MEXICO 68&lt;/small&gt;," was under threat of demolition in 2010 to make way for a rail tunnel&lt;ref name=Newtown_10/&gt; but is now listed as an item of heritage significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetings.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/meetings/documents/meetings/2012/CSPC/120308/120308_CSPC_ITEM06_ATTACHMENTJ.PDF Heritage Assessment of the Three Proud People mural 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041030/http://meetings.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/meetings/documents/meetings/2012/CSPC/120308/120308_CSPC_ITEM06_ATTACHMENTJ.PDF |date=October 2, 2013 }}.

=== West Oakland mural ===
In the historically [[African-American neighborhood]] of [[West Oakland, California]] there was a large mural depicting Smith and Carlos on the corner of 12th Street and Mandela Parkway.

Above the life-sized depictions read "Born with insight, raised with a fist" ([[Rage Against the Machine]] lyrics); previously it read "It only takes a pair of gloves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaklandwiki.org/It_Only_Takes_a_Pair_of_Gloves_Mural It Only Takes a Pair of Gloves Mural]. oaklandwiki.org&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 2015, the mural was razed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bayareaintifada.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/west-oakland-mural-bulldozed/ West Oakland Mural Bulldozed | bayareaintifada]. Bayareaintifada.wordpress.com (3 February 2015). Retrieved on 2015-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The private lot was once a gas station, and the mural was on the outside wall of an abandoned building or shed. The owner wanted to pay respect to the men and the moment but also wanted a mural to prevent tagging. The State was monitoring water contamination levels at this site; the testing became within normal levels "so the state ordered the removal of the tanks, testing equipment, and demolition of the shed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bayareaintifada.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/west-oakland-mural-bulldozed/|title=West Oakland Mural Bulldozed|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
The song "Mr. John Carlos" by the Swedish group [[Nationalteatern]] on their 1974 album ''Livet är en fest'' is about the event and its aftermath.

[[Rage Against the Machine]] used a cropped photo of the salute on the cover art for the "[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]" single (2000).  The image has both men wearing shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://go.distance.ncsu.edu/gd203/?p=17750|title=Tropes in Media – The Clinched Fist  -  GD 203|website=go.distance.ncsu.edu}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover art for the single "[[HiiiPoWeR]]" (2011) by American rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] features a cropped photo of the salute.

The song "Hoarse" (2013) by American rapper [[Earl Sweatshirt]] features the lines "pinnacle of titillating crispate, fists clenched, emulating '68 Olympics".

The music video for "[[The Story of O.J.]]" (2017) by American rapper [[Jay-Z]] features a depiction of the protest.

The song "Shivers" by [[Peter Perrett]], best known as the frontman of The Only Ones, features the lines "The torch of liberty, Tommie Smith's black glove".

The music video for "[[The Space Program]]" (2017) by American Hip-Hop group [[A Tribe Called Quest]] features Pharrell Williams imitating the salute.

In [[Indian religions]] and society, an '''acharya''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|''ācārya''}}) is a preceptor or instructor in religious matters; founder, or leader of a sect; or a highly learned person or a title affixed to the names of learned people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platts|first=John T.|title=A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English|publisher=W. H. Allen &amp; Co.|location=London|year=1884|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1246.platts}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation has different meanings in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and secular contexts. It is also a Vishwabrahmin/brahmin surname found in Nepal and across India, including [[Odisha]], [[Karnataka]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Maharashtra]].{{Cn|date=January 2017}}

Acharya is sometimes used to address a teacher or a scholar in any discipline, e.g.: [[Bhaskaracharya]], the mathematician.

==Etymology==
The term "acharya" is most often said to include the root "char" or "charya" (conduct). Thus it literally connotes "one who teaches by conduct (example)", i.e. an exemplar.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==In Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], an ''acharya'' (आचार्य) is a formal title of a teacher or guru, who has attained a degree in Veda and Vedanga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Education in India|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqtAAgS3NSEC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Ram Nath Sharma|author2=Rajendra Kumar Sharma|year=1996|publisher=Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2018}}

Prominent acharyas in the  Hindu tradition are as given below :
*[[Adi Sankara]]charya&lt;ref&gt;[viswakarma community] Although famous for being the proponent of ''[[advaita]] vad'', he established the supremecy of ''[[bhakti]]'' to [[Krishn]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ramanuja]]charya&lt;ref&gt;He propagated the ''[[bhakti]]'' of ''[[Bhagwan]]'' ''[[Vishnu]]''. Source: [http://www.jagatguru.in/ramanuj.htm Ramanujacharya] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826200921/http://www.jagatguru.in/ramanuj.htm |date=26 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Madhvacharya]]&lt;ref&gt;His philosophy is called ''[[dvaita]] vad''. His primary teaching is that "the only goal of a soul is to selflessly and wholeheartedly love and surrender to God" Source: [http://www.encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/70_saints_acharyas.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nimbarka]]charya&lt;ref&gt;His writings say that Radha Krishn are the supreme form of God.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=March 2014}} 
*[[Vallabhacharya]]

*[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]

*[[Sandipani|Acharya Sandipani]]
*[[Bhadreshdas Swami]]

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, acharya is a senior teacher. Notable acharyas:
* [[Pema Chödrön]] (b. 1936) acharya at [[Gampo Abbey]]&lt;ref name="gampoabbey"&gt;{{cite web

==In Jainism==
{{main|Acharya (Jainism)}}

[[File:Acharya_KundaKunda.jpg|thumb|Image of Āchārya [[Kundakunda]], author of [[Jain texts]] like [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Niyamasara]]]]
In [[Jainism]], an ''acharya'' is the highest leader of a Jain order. ''Acharya'' is one of the [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]] (five supreme beings) and thus worthy of worship. They are the final authority in the monastic order and has the authority to ordain new monks and nuns. They are also authorized to consecrate new idols, although this authority is sometimes delegated to scholars designated by them.

An acharya, like any other Jain monk, is expected to wander except for the [[Chaturmas]]. [[Bhattaraka|Bhaṭṭāraka]]s, who head institutions, are technically junior monks, and thus permitted to stay in the same place.

==In scientific/mathematical scholarship==
* [[Bhaskaracharya]]
* [[Mahaviracharya]]
* [[Bhaskaracharya I]]

==Acharya (degree)==
In Sanskrit institutions, acharya is a post-graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/33943525/?formInput=acharya%20degree%20equivalent%20to|title=Nandan Mishra vs University Of Delhi &amp; Ors on 12 May, 2015|website=indiankanoon.org|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-art''' is a loosely used term applied to an array of concepts and attitudes that reject prior definitions of art and question art in general. Somewhat paradoxically, anti-art tends to conduct this questioning and rejection from the vantage point of art.&lt;ref&gt;David Graver. ''The aesthetics of disturbance: anti-art in avant-garde drama''. University of Michigan Press, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is associated with the [[Dada]] movement and is generally accepted as attributable to [[Marcel Duchamp]] pre-[[World War I]] around 1914, when he began to use [[found object]]s as art. It was used to describe revolutionary forms of art. The term was used later by the Conceptual artists of the 1960s to describe the work of those who claimed to have retired altogether from the practice of art, from the production of works which could be sold.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book |last=...|first=contributors Rachel Barnes|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|page=505|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expression of anti-art may or may not take traditional form or meet the criteria for being defined as a work of art according to conventional standards.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art" &gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory".

"Poetry of the revolution: Marx, manifestos, and the avant-gardes". Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, works of anti-art may express an outright rejection of having conventionally defined criteria as a means of defining what art is, and what it is not. Anti-artworks may reject conventional artistic standards altogether,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Atwood. "The Triumph of Anti-Art: Conceptual and Performance Art in the Formation of Post-Modernism". Afterimage, Sep 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or focus criticism only on certain aspects of art, such as the art market and [[high culture#High art|high art]]. Some anti-artworks may reject individualism in art,&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"&gt;Peter Bürger "Theory of the Avant-Garde". Trans. Michael Shaw. Minneapolis: Minnesota. 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"&gt;An Paenhuysen.

Guest edited by: Gray Kochhar-Lindgren, Image and Narrative, Vol.VI, issue 2 (12.) August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some may reject "universality" as an accepted factor in art. Additionally, some forms of anti-art reject art entirely, or reject the idea that art is a separate realm or specialization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sadie Plant]]. "The most radical gesture: the Situationist International in a postmodern age". Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-artworks may also reject art based upon a consideration of art as being oppressive of a segment of the population.&lt;ref name="Art_Is_Like_Cancer"&gt;Interview of Roger Taylor by Stewart Home. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm "Art Is Like Cancer".] Mute Magazine. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art artworks may articulate a disagreement with the generally supposed notion of there being a separation between art and life. Indeed, anti-art artworks may voice a question as to whether "art" really exists or not.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002. Page 244&lt;/ref&gt; "Anti-art" has been referred to as a "paradoxical neologism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aristos.org/whatart/lights.htm|title=The Lights Go On and Off - WHAT ART IS Online, February 2002|website=www.aristos.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that its obvious opposition to art has been observed concurring with staples of twentieth-century art or "modern art", in particular [[art movement]]s that have self-consciously sought to transgress traditions or institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Ernst Van Alphen, a Clark scholar from the Netherlands, suggested that Modernism itself can be characterized as anti-art in that since the earliest gestures of Dada and Futurism, art is seen as transformative and productive, breaking with institutions rather than destructive of images." Source: http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/?page=article&amp;article_id=128&amp;catID=3&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-art itself is not a distinct art movement, however. This would tend to be indicated by the time it spans—longer than that usually spanned by art movements. Some art movements though, are labeled "anti-art". The [[Dada]] movement is generally considered the first anti-art movement; the term anti-art itself is said to have been coined by Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]] around 1914, and his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]s have been cited as early examples of anti-art objects.&lt;ref&gt;This is one dictionary definition of anti-art: ''"A loosely used term that has been applied to works or attitudes that debunk traditional concepts of art. The term is said to have been coined by Marcel Duchamp in about 1914, and his ready-mades can be cited as early examples of the genre. Dada was the first anti-art movement, and subsequently the denunciation of art became commonplace—almost de rigueur—among the avant-garde."'' Note the emphasis on the fact that most art adopts the same principles attributed to the concept of "anti-art". Source: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-antiart.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in ''Aesthetic Theory'' (1970) stated that "...even the abolition of art is respectful of art because it takes the truth claim of art seriously".&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Adorno. "Aesthetic Theory". 1970, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-art has become generally accepted by the artworld to be art, although some people still reject Duchamp's readymades as art, for instance the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists,&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/anti-art "Glossary: Anti-art"], [[Tate]].

Anti-art can take the form of art or not.&lt;ref name="Anti-Art_and_the_Concept_of_Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; It is posited that anti-art need not even take the form of art, in order to embody its function as anti-art. This point is disputed. Some of the forms of anti-art which are art strive to reveal the conventional limits of art by expanding its properties.&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1" &gt;Hal Foster. "What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde?". October, Vol. 70, "The Duchamp Effect", Autumn, 1994. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of anti-art are suggestive of a reduction to what might seem to be fundamental elements or building blocks of art. Examples of this sort of phenomenon might include [[monochrome painting]]s, empty frames, [[list of silent musical compositions|silence as music]], [[aleatoricism|chance art]]. Anti-art is also often seen to make use of highly innovative materials and techniques, and well beyond—to include hitherto unheard of elements in visual art. These types of anti-art can be [[readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]], [[found object]] art, [[détournement]], [[combine painting]]s, [[appropriation (art)]], [[happening]]s, [[performance art]], and [[body art]].&lt;ref name="What's Neo about the Neo-Avant-Garde1"/&gt;

Anti-art can involve the renouncement of making art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; This can be accomplished through an art strike and this can also be accomplished through [[revolution]]ary [[activism]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; An aim of anti-art can be to undermine or understate individual creativity. This may be accomplished through the utilization of [[found art|readymades]].&lt;ref name="Theory of the Avant-Garde1"/&gt; Individual creativity can be further downplayed by the use of [[industrial process]]es in the making of art. ''Anti-artists'' may seek to undermine individual creativity by producing their artworks anonymously.&lt;ref name="Pop art1" &gt;Tilman Osterwold. "Pop art". Taschen, 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; They may refuse to show their artworks. They may refuse public recognition.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt; Anti-artists may choose to work collectively, in order to place less emphasis on individual identity and individual creativity. This can be seen in the instance of [[happening]]s. This is sometimes the case with "supertemporal" artworks, which are by design impermanent. Anti-artists will sometimes destroy their works of art.&lt;ref name="Strategies of Fame1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Towards an Acognitive Culture1" &gt;[[Henry Flynt]] interviewed by [[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/interviews/flynt.htm "Towards an Acognitive Culture".] New York 8 March 1989. Smile 11, London Summer 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Some artworks made by anti-artists are purposely created to be destroyed. This can be seen in [[auto-destructive art]].

[[André Malraux]] has developed a concept of anti-art quite different from that outlined above. For Malraux, anti-art began with the 'Salon' or 'Academic' art of the nineteenth century which rejected the basic ambition of art in favour of a semi-photographic illusionism (often prettified). Of Academic painting, Malraux writes, 'All true painters, all those for whom painting is a value, were nauseated by these pictures – "Portrait of a Great Surgeon Operating" and the like – because they saw in them not a form of painting, but the negation of painting'. For Malraux, anti-art is still very much with us, though in a different form. Its descendants are commercial cinema and television, and popular music and fiction. The 'Salon', Malraux writes, 'has been expelled from painting, but elsewhere it reigns supreme'.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure. André Malraux's Theory of Art''. Amsterdam, Rodopi, 2009. pp.275-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Anti-art is also a tendency in the theoretical understanding of art and [[fine art]].

The philosopher Roger Taylor puts forward that art is a bourgeois ideology that has its origins with capitalism in "Art, an Enemy of the People". Holding a strong anti-essentialist position he states also that art has not always existed and is not universal but peculiar to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/pol/taylor.htm|title=philosopher Roger Taylor on why art is an enemy of the people|website=www.stewarthomesociety.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that is factually inaccurate as proven by many substantial archaeological findings on the Asian and African continents.

''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' by Larry Shiner is an art history book which fundamentally questions our understanding of art.
"The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old." (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)
Shiner presents (fine) art as a social construction that has not always existed throughout human history and could also disappear in its turn.

==History==

===Pre World War I===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the separation between performer and spectator, life and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;North West Arts Association (Great Britain), Alexander Schouvaloff. "Place for the arts". Seel House Press, 1970, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] posited that art was a consequence of the [[social class|class system]] and therefore concluded that, in a [[communism|communist]] society, there would only be people who engage in the making of art and no "artists".&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''. University of Chicago Press, 2003, pp. 234, 236, 245,&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Le rire'' (1887). First shown 1883 at an "Incohérents" exhibition by Arthur Sapeck (Eugène Bataille).|200px]]
Arguably the first movement that deliberately set itself in opposition to established art were the [[Incoherents]] in late 19th. century Paris. Founded by [[Jules Lévy]] in 1882, the Incoherents organized charitable art exhibitions intended to be satirical and humoristic, they presented "...drawings by people who can't draw..."&lt;ref&gt;"''...dessins exécutés par des gens qui ne savent pas dessiner...''"&lt;/ref&gt; and held masked balls with artistic themes, all in the greater tradition of [[Montmartre]] cabaret culture. While short lived – the last Incoherent show took place in 1896 – the movement was popular for its entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsincoherents.info/|title=Les arts Incohérents|language=French|accessdate=2009-05-06 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501185839/http://www.artsincoherents.info/ |archivedate= 1 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their commitment to satire, irreverence and ridicule they produced a number of works that show remarkable formal similarities to creations of the avant-garde of the 20th century: ready-mades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/things/readymade/index.html|title=Les Expositions des Arts Incohérents |work=Readymades (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; monochromes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/monochrome/Incoherents/index.html|title=Early monochrome painting: Les Incohérents. |work=Monochromes (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; empty frames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radicalart.info/nothing/space/frames/index.html|title=Mey-Sonier: Tableau d'à Venir, 1883|work=Empty frames (at Radical Art, Amsterdam)|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and silence as music.&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse Allais: Marche Funèbre Composée pour les Funérailles d'un Grand Homme Sourd, 1884.

Bremen: Institut Français, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada and constructivism===

Beginning in Switzerland, during [[World War I]], much of [[Dada]], and some aspects of the art movements it inspired, such as [[Neo-Dada]], [[Nouveau réalisme]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tinguely]]: Art is revolution. National-Zeitung, Basle, 13 October 1967. "All machines are art. Even old, abandoned, rusty machines for sifting stones. (...) A beautiful oil refinery or your Johanniterbrücke, which are supposed to be solely functional, are important additions to modern art. So, art is also: the achievements of engineers and technicians, even if they express themselves unconsciously or purely functionally. Art is everything. (Do you think art ought to be made only by 'artists'?) And: art is everywhere – at my grandmother's – in the most incredible kitsch or under a rotten plank."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fluxus]], is considered anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;"Art is dead. Long live Dada."—[[Walter Serner]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Dada is like your hopes: nothing, like your paradise: nothing, like your idols: nothing; like your heroes: nothing, like your artists: nothing, like your religions: nothing' -[[Francis Picabia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dadaists rejected cultural and intellectual conformity in art and more broadly in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richter |first=Hans |year=1965 |title=Dada: Art and Anti-art |location= New York and Toronto |publisher= Oxford University Press |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For everything that art stood for, Dada was to represent the opposite.

Where art was concerned with traditional [[aesthetics]], Dada ignored aesthetics completely. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend. Through their rejection of traditional culture and aesthetics the Dadaists hoped to destroy traditional culture and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;"We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the "[[tabula rasa]]". At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order." — [[Marcel Janco]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were more politicized, the Berlin dadas were the most radically anti-art within Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Shiner. "[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]". University of Chicago Press, 2003, p. 254. "the Berlin [[dada]]s were more radical (compared to the other dadas), believing that the only way to reintegrate art and life was to place both at the service of the socialist revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, in the Berlin group, [[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|the Dadaist revolutionary central council]] outlined the Dadaist ideals of radical [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution|The Dadaist revolutionary central council]]. [http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf "What is Dadaism and what does it want in Germany?".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913093050/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/DadaSurrealism/DadaSurrReadings/DadaGrmny.pdf |date=2008-09-13 }} Tract, 1919. "Dadaism demands: 1) The international revolutionary union of all creative and intellectual men and women on the basis of radical Communism; (...) The immediate expropriation of property (socialization) and the communal feeding of all (...) Introduction of the simultaneist poem as a Communist state prayer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1913 [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] challenged individual creativity and redefined art as a nominal rather than an intrinsic object.&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by Arturo Schwarz."The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp'. London, Thames and Hudson, 1969, p.33."For me there is something else in addition to yes, no or indifferent – that is, for instance – the absence of investigations of that type. ... I am against the word 'anti' because it's a bit like atheist, as compared to believer. And the atheist is just as much of a religious man as the believer is, and an anti-artist is just as much of an artist as the other artist. Anartist would be much better, if I could change it, instead of anti-artist. Anartist, meaning no artist at all. That would be my conception. I don't mind being an anartist ... What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art is still art in the same way as a bad emotion is still an emotion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchamp quoted by [[Dalia Judovitz]]. "Unpacking Duchamp: Art in Transit". Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995. "No, no the word 'anti' annoys me a little, because whether you are anti or for, it's two sides of the same thing. And I would like to be completely – I don't know what you say – nonexistent, instead of being for or against... The idea of the artist as a sort of superman is comparatively recent. This I was going against. In fact, since I've stopped my artistic activity, I feel that I'm against this attitude of reverence the world has. Art, etymologically speaking, means to 'make.' Everybody is making, not only artists, and maybe in coming centuries there will be a making without the noticing"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tristan Tzara]] indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=2008-09-15 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=2008-03-27 }}; retrieved April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Tristan Tzara|Tzara]], who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Pop, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X.

Originating in [[Russia]] in 1919, [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]] rejected art in its entirety and as a specific activity creating a universal aesthetic&lt;ref&gt;Varvara Stepanova: Lecture on Constructivism, 22 December 1921. In: Peter Noever: Aleksandr M. Rodchenko - Varvara F. Stepanova. The Future Is Our Only Goal. Munich: Prestel, 1991, pp. 174-178. "From here, Constructivism proceeds to the negation of all art in its entirety, and calls into question the necessity of a specific activity of art as creator of a universal aesthetic."&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of practices directed towards social purposes, "useful" to everyday life, such as graphic design, advertising and photography. In 1921, exhibiting at the [[5x5=25|5x5=25 exhibition]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]] created monochromes and proclaimed the end of painting.&lt;ref&gt;"I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, and yellow. I affirmed: this is the end of painting." — [[Alexander Rodchenko]].&lt;/ref&gt; For artists of the Russian Revolution, Rodchenko's radical action was full of utopian possibility. It marked the end of art along with the end of bourgeois norms and practices. It cleared the way for the beginning of a new Russian life, a new mode of production, a new culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rodchenko, A. and V. Stepanova (1975) [1920] 'The Programme of the Productivist Group', in Benton and Benton (eds), pp. 91-2. "1. Down with art, long live technical science. 2. Religion is a lie. Art is a lie. 3. Destroy the last remaining attachment of human thought to art. ... 6. The collective art of today is constructive life."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrealism===
Beginning in the early 1920s, many [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. [[Surrealism]] as a political force developed unevenly around the world, in some places more emphasis being put on artistic practices, while in others political practises outweighed. In other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to overshadow both the arts and politics. Politically, [[Surrealism]] was ultra-leftist, [[communist]], or [[anarchist]]. The split from Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] as communist. In 1925, the [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] declared their affinity for revolutionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of January 27, 1925". [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism.&lt;ref&gt;"Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II.

Leader [[André Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that [[Surrealism]] was above all a revolutionary movement. [[André Breton|Breton]] believed the tenets of [[Surrealism]] could be applied in any circumstance of life, and is not merely restricted to the artistic realm.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]]. "The [[Surrealist Manifesto|first manifesto]]". 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Breton|Breton]]'s followers, along with the [[Communist Party]], were working for the "liberation of man." However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with [[André Breton|Breton]], notably [[Louis Aragon]], left his group to work more closely with the Communists. In 1929, [[André Breton|Breton]] asked Surrealists to assess their "degree of moral competence", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surréalisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action&lt;ref name="pompidou"&gt;[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=September 18, 2012 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]].

By the end of World War II the surrealist group led by André Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote "It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself."&lt;ref name="anarchosurrealism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919–1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Letterism and the Situationist International===
{{Situationists |expanded=Concepts}}

Founded in the mid-1940s in France by [[Isidore Isou]], the [[Lettrism|Letterists]] utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in [[Situationist International|Situationist]] films. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. The most radical of the [[Lettrism|Letterist]] films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and [[Guy Debord|Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' abandoned images altogether.

In 1956, recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1960, [[Isidore Isou]] created supertemporal art: a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

In Japan in the late 1950s, [[Group Kyushu]] was an edgy, experimental and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, nuts, springs, metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.

Other similar anti-art groups included [http://www.artfact.com/features/viewStyle.cfm?genreRef=K714FO8OVR Neo-Dada] (Neo-Dadaizumu Oganaizazu), [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/g/gutai Gutai] ([[Gutai]] Bijutsu Kyokai), and Hi-Red-Center. Influenced in various ways by [[L'Art Informel]], these groups and their members worked to foreground material in their work: rather than seeing the art work as representing some remote referent, the material itself and the artists' interaction with it became the main point. The freeing up of gesture was another legacy of L'Art Informel, and the members of Group Kyushu took to it with great verve, throwing, dripping, and breaking material, sometimes destroying the work in the process.

Beginning in the 1950s in France, the [[Letterist International]] and after the [[Situationist International]] developed a [[dialectic]]al viewpoint, seeing their task as ''superseding'' art, abolishing the notion of art as a separate, specialized activity and transforming it so it became part of the fabric of everyday life. From the Situationist's viewpoint, art is [[revolution]]ary or it is nothing. In this way, the Situationists saw their efforts as completing the work of both Dada and [[surrealism]] while abolishing both.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord/8.htm " The Society of the Spectacle"]. Thesis 187 and 191. 1967. Translation by [[Ken Knabb]] in 2002."The ''positive'' significance of the modern decomposition and destruction of all art is that the language of communication has been lost. The ''negative'' implication of this development is that a common language can no longer take the form of the unilateral conclusions that characterized the art of historical societies — ''belated'' portrayals of ''someone else's'' dialogueless life which accepted this lack as inevitable — but must now be found in a praxis that unifies direct activity with its own appropriate language.
The point is to actually participate in the community of dialogue and the game with time that up till now have merely been ''represented'' by poetic and artistic works." "Dadaism and surrealism were the two currents that marked the end of modern art. Though they were only partially conscious of it, they were contemporaries of the last great offensive of the revolutionary proletarian movement, and the defeat of that movement, which left them trapped within the very artistic sphere whose decrepitude they had denounced, was the fundamental reason for their immobilization. Dadaism and surrealism were historically linked yet also opposed to each other. This opposition involved the most important and radical contributions of the two movements, but it also revealed the internal inadequacy of their one-sided critiques. Dadaism sought to ''abolish art without realizing it''; surrealism sought to ''realize art without abolishing it''. The critical position since developed by the ''situationists'' has shown that the abolition and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single ''transcendence of art''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationist (no. 1, Paris, June 1958) "Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us."&lt;/ref&gt;
The situationists renounced the making of art entirely.&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

The members of the [[Situationist International]] liked to think they were probably the most radical,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Kaufman. "The Columbia history of twentieth-century French thought". Editor: Lawrence D. Kritzman, Columbia University Press, 2007, p. 104. "In the view of some (including the principal protagonists of the movement themselves), Situationism was the century's finest and most radical form of subversion. It is claimed to have been at the heart of the events of May 1968, whose spirit it embodied, with its radical critique of all forms of alienation imposed by capitalist society (renamed the "society of spectacle" by the Situationists)".&lt;/ref&gt; politicized,&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt; well organized, and theoretically productive anti-art movement, reaching their apex with the student protests and [[general strike]] of [[May 1968 in France]], a view endorsed by others including the academic [[Martin Puchner]].&lt;ref name="Poetry_of_the_revolution2"/&gt;

In 1959 [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]] proposed [[Industrial Painting]] as an "industrial-inflationist art"&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]]. [http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art]. ''[[Notizie Arti Figurative]]'' No. 9 (1959). In French: ''[[Situationist International|Internationale Situationniste]]'' no.3 (1959). In English: [[Molly Klein]] translated the [[original]] Italian version into English (1997). "The machine may very well be the appropriate instrument for the creation of an industrial-inflationist art, based on the Anti-Patent; the new industrial culture will be strictly "Made Amongst People" or not at all! The time of the Scribes is over."(...) "When thousands of painters who today labor at the non-sense of detail will have the possibilities which machines offer, there will be no more giant stamps, called paintings to satisfy the investment of value, but thousands of kilometers of fabric offered in the streets, in markets, for barter, allowing millions of people to enjoy them and exciting the experience of arrangement."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Dada and later===
{{Main|Neo-Dada}}
Similar to Dada, in the 1960s, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to blur the distinction between life and art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolf Vostell]], 1972 (Postcard). "[[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] has qualified the object into art. I have qualified life into art."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Vautier]]. [http://radicalart.info/concept/ArtAgainstArt/Ben/index.html "Pas d'Art" (No art).] 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 [[Henry Flynt]] began to campaign for an anti-art position.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Oren (1993) Anti-Art as the End of Cultural History, [[Performing Arts Journal]], volume 15, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Flynt wanted [[avant-garde]] [[art]] to become superseded by the terms of ''veramusement'' and ''brend'' – [[neologism]]s meaning approximately pure [[recreation]].

In 1963 [[George Maciunas]] advocated revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Maciunas]]. [http://www.artnotart.com/fluxus/gmaciunas-manifesto.html Fluxus Manifesto], 1963. "Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, – purge the world of "Europanism"! [...] PROMOTE A REVOLUTIONARY FLOOD AND TIDE IN ART, [...] promote NON ART REALITY to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals ... FUSE the cadres of cultural, social &amp; political revolutionaries into united front &amp; action."&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Maciunas|Maciunas]] strived to uphold his stated aims of demonstrating the artist's 'non-professional status...his dispensability and inclusiveness' and that 'anything can be art and anyone can do it.'&lt;ref&gt;A 1965 Inventory list by Maciunas, quoted in Mr Fluxus, p88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth".&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mask disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|0-948518-88-X}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] were to grow out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts.

The BBC aired an interview with Duchamp conducted by Joan Bakewell in 1966 which expressed some of Duchamps more explicit Anti-Art ideas.
Duchamp compared art with religion, whereby he stated that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that "the word art etymologically means to do", that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates "purely artificial" distinctions of being an artist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H3EwaV7Wt5&amp;sig=btLMQ2GJA3YOwZIPQNU-Oe0KFRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9bjcUJiqJaKN0wXCk4DAAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century] edited by Rudolf E.

During the 1970s, [[King Mob]] was responsible for various attacks on art galleries. According to the philosopher Roger Taylor the concept of art is not universal but is an invention of bourgeois ideology helping to promote this social order. He compares it to a cancer that colonises other forms of life so that it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other.&lt;ref name=Art_Is_Like_Cancer/&gt;

[[Stewart Home]] called for an Art Strike between 1990 and 1993. Unlike earlier art-strike proposals such as that of [[Gustav Metzger]] in the 1970s, it was not intended as an opportunity for artists to seize control of the means of distributing their own work, but rather as an exercise in propaganda and psychic warfare aimed at smashing the entire art world rather than just the gallery system. As [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] had done in the 1960s, [[Stewart Home]] disrupted cultural events in London in the 1990s by giving made up flyers of literary events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"/&gt;

The [[K Foundation]] was an art foundation that published a series of [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world. Most notoriously, when their plans to use [[banknotes]] as part of a work of art fell through, they burnt a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] in cash.

[[Punk visual art|Punk]] has developed anti-art positions. Some "industrial music" bands describe their work as a form of "cultural terrorism" or as a form of "anti-art". The term is also used to describe other intentionally provocative art forms, such as [[nonsense verse]].

==As art==

Paradoxically, most forms of anti-art have gradually been completely accepted by the art establishment as normal and conventional forms of art.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Humble. "Anti-Art and the Concept of Art". In: "A companion to art theory". Editors: Paul Smith and Carolyn Wilde, Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 246. "the readymade has been appropriated as a theoretical paradigm in much contemporary art-school theory."&lt;/ref&gt; Even the movements which rejected art with the most virulence are now collected by the most prestigious cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gallix. [http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 "The resurrection of Guy Debord".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704124307/http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20090416120529166 |date=2009-07-04 }} ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2009. "Guy-Ernest Debord would be spinning in his grave – had he not been cremated following his suicide in 1994. The arch-rebel who prided himself on fully deserving society's "universal hatred" has now officially been recognised as a "national treasure" in his homeland. The French government has duly stepped in to prevent Yale University from acquiring his personal archives (...) It's difficult to convey how bizarre it is to hear Christine Albanel – Sarkozy's minister of culture – describing the revolutionary Debord as 'one of the last great French intellectuals' of the second half of the 20th century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's readymades are still regarded as anti-art by the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]],&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; who also say that anti-art has become conformist, and describe themselves as [[anti-anti-art]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuck on the Turner Prize"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14919">In [[computer science]], a '''binary decision diagram''' ('''BDD''') or '''branching program''' is a [[data structure]] that is used to represent a [[Boolean function]]. On a more abstract level, BDDs can be considered as a [[data compression|compressed]] representation of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s. Unlike other compressed representations, operations are performed directly on the compressed representation, i.e. without decompression. Other [[data structures]] used to represent a [[Boolean function]] include [[negation normal form]] (NNF), and [[propositional directed acyclic graph]] (PDAG).

== Definition ==

A Boolean function can be represented as a [[Rooted_graph|rooted]], directed, acyclic [[graph theory|graph]], which consists of several decision nodes and terminal nodes. There are two types of terminal nodes called 0-terminal and 1-terminal. Each decision node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is labeled by  Boolean variable &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; and has two [[child node]]s called low child and high child. The edge from node &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; to a low (or high) child represents an assignment of &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; to 0 (resp. 1).
Such a '''BDD''' is called 'ordered' if different variables appear in the same order on all paths from the root. A BDD is said to be 'reduced' if the following two rules have been applied to its graph:
* Merge any [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] subgraphs.
* Eliminate any node whose two children are [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]].

In popular usage, the term '''BDD''' almost always refers to '''Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram''' ('''ROBDD''' in the literature, used when the ordering and reduction aspects need to be emphasized). The advantage of an ROBDD is that it is canonical (unique) for a particular function and variable order.&lt;ref name="Bryant1986"&gt;Graph-Based Algorithms
for Boolean Function Manipulation, Randal E. Bryant, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; This property makes it useful in functional equivalence checking and other operations like functional technology mapping.

A path from the root node to the 1-terminal represents a (possibly partial) variable assignment for which the represented Boolean function is true. As the path descends to a low (or high) child from a node, then that node's variable is assigned to 0 (resp. 1).

=== Example ===
The left figure below shows a binary [[decision tree|decision ''tree'']] (the reduction rules are not applied), and a [[truth table]], each representing the function f (x1, x2, x3).  In the tree on the left, the value of the function can be determined for a given variable assignment by following a path down the graph to a terminal. In the figures below, dotted lines represent edges to a low child, while solid lines represent edges to a high child. Therefore, to find (x1=0, x2=1, x3=1), begin at x1, traverse down the dotted line to x2 (since x1 has an assignment to 0), then down two solid lines (since x2 and x3 each have an assignment to one).  This leads to the terminal 1, which is the value of f (x1=0, x2=1, x3=1).

The binary decision ''tree'' of the left figure can be transformed into a binary decision ''diagram'' by maximally reducing it according to the two reduction rules. The resulting '''BDD''' is shown in the right figure.

== History ==
The basic idea from which the data structure was created is the [[Shannon expansion]]. A [[switching function]] is split into two sub-functions (cofactors) by assigning one variable (cf. ''if-then-else normal form'').  If such a sub-function is considered as a sub-tree, it can be represented by a ''[[binary decision tree]]''. Binary decision diagrams (BDD) were introduced by Lee,&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;C. Y. Lee. "Representation of Switching Circuits by Binary-Decision Programs". Bell System Technical Journal, 38:985–999, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and further studied and made known by Akers&lt;ref name="Akers"&gt;[[Sheldon B. Akers|Sheldon B.&lt;!-- Buckingham --&gt; Akers, Jr.]]. Binary Decision Diagrams, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-27(6):509–516, June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and Boute.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Boute, "The Binary Decision Machine as a programmable controller". [[EUROMICRO]] Newsletter, Vol. 1(2):16–22, January 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full potential for efficient algorithms based on the data structure was investigated by [[Randal Bryant]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]: his key extensions were to use a fixed variable ordering (for canonical representation) and shared sub-graphs (for compression).  Applying these two concepts results in an efficient data structure and algorithms for the representation of sets and relations.&lt;ref name="Bryant-1986"&gt;Randal E. Bryant. "[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant/pubdir/ieeetc86.ps Graph-Based Algorithms for Boolean Function Manipulation]". IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-35(8):677–691, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant-1992"&gt;Randal E. Bryant, "[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant/pubdir/acmcs92.ps Symbolic Boolean Manipulation with Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams"], ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 24, No. 3 (September, 1992), pp. 293–318.
&lt;/ref&gt;  By extending the sharing to several BDDs, i.e. one sub-graph is used by several BDDs, the data structure ''Shared Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram'' is defined.&lt;ref name="Brace"&gt;Karl S. Brace, Richard L. Rudell and Randal E. Bryant. "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=123222&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM Efficient Implementation of a BDD Package"]. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC 1990), pages 40–45. IEEE Computer Society Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of a BDD is now generally used to refer to that particular data structure.

In his video lecture ''Fun With Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scpd.stanford.edu/knuth/index.jsp|title=Stanford Center for Professional Development|author=|date=|website=scpd.stanford.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Knuth]] calls BDDs "one of the only really fundamental data structures that came out in the last twenty-five years" and mentions that Bryant's 1986 paper was for some time one of the most-cited papers in computer science.

[[Adnan Darwiche (computer scientist)|Adnan Darwiche]] and his collaborators have shown that BDDs are one of several normal forms for Boolean functions, each induced by a different combination of requirements. Another important normal form identified by Darwiche is [[Decomposable Negation Normal Form]] or DNNF.

== Applications ==

BDDs are extensively used in [[Computer Aided Design|CAD]] software to synthesize circuits ([[logic synthesis]]) and in [[formal verification]]. There are several lesser known applications of BDD, including [[fault tree]] analysis, [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] reasoning, product configuration, and [[private information retrieval]].&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;R.

Every arbitrary BDD (even if it is not reduced or ordered) can be directly implemented in hardware by replacing each node with a 2 to 1 [[Multiplexer#Digital multiplexers|multiplexer]]; each multiplexer can be directly implemented by a 4-LUT in a [[FPGA]]. It is not so simple to convert from an arbitrary network of logic gates to a BDD{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} (unlike the [[and-inverter graph]]).

== Variable ordering ==
The size of the BDD is determined both by the function being represented and the chosen ordering of the variables. There exist Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x_{n})&lt;/math&gt; for which depending upon the ordering of the variables we would end up getting a graph whose number of nodes would be linear (in&amp;nbsp;''n'') at the best and exponential at the worst case (e.g., a [[ripple carry adder]]).  Let us consider the Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x_{2n}) = x_1x_2 + x_3x_4 + \cdots + x_{2n-1}x_{2n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the variable ordering &lt;math&gt;x_1 &lt; x_3 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{2n-1} &lt; x_2 &lt; x_4 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the BDD needs 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; nodes to represent the function.  Using the ordering &lt;math&gt;x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; x_3 &lt; x_4 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{2n-1} &lt; x_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the BDD consists of 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 nodes.

It is of crucial importance to care about variable ordering when applying this data structure in practice.
The problem of finding the best variable ordering is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name="Bollig"&gt;Beate Bollig, Ingo Wegener. {{doi-inline|10.1109/12.537122|Improving the Variable Ordering of OBDDs Is NP-Complete}}, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 45(9):993–1002, September 1996.
&lt;/ref&gt; For any constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 it is even NP-hard to compute a variable ordering resulting in an OBDD with a size that is at most c times larger than an optimal one.&lt;ref name="Sieling"&gt;Detlef Sieling. "The nonapproximability of OBDD minimization." Information and Computation 172, 103–138. 2002.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist efficient heuristics to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Michael|title=A Survey of Static Variable Ordering Heuristics for Efficient BDD/MDD Construction|url=http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~skulhari/StaticHeuristics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are functions for which the graph size is always exponential — independent of variable ordering. This holds e.g. for the multiplication function.&lt;ref name="Bryant1986"/&gt; In fact, the function computing the middle bit of the product of two &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-bit numbers does not have an OBDD smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} / 61 - 4&lt;/math&gt; vertices.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Woelfel. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200000500067X Bounds on the OBDD-size of integer multiplication via universal hashing]." ''Journal of Computer and System Sciences'' 71, pp. 520-534, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (If the multiplication function had polynomial-size OBDDs, it would show that [[integer factorization]] is in [[P/poly]], which is not known to be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Lipton]]. [https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/bdds-and-factoring/ "BDD's and Factoring"]. ''Gödel's Lost Letter and P=NP'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Researchers have suggested refinements on the BDD data structure giving way to a number of related graphs, such as BMD ([[binary moment diagram]]s), ZDD ([[zero-suppressed decision diagram]]), FDD ([[free binary decision diagram]]s), PDD ([[parity decision diagram]]s), and MTBDDs (multiple terminal BDDs).

== Logical operations on BDDs ==
Many logical operations on BDDs can be implemented by polynomial-time graph manipulation algorithms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=H. R. |last=Andersen |url= http://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/courses/verification-2011/andersen-bdd.pdf |title=An Introduction to Binary Decision Diagrams |work=Lecture Notes |year=1999 |publisher=IT University of Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}}
* [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]
* [[logical disjunction|disjunction]]
* [[negation]]
* existential abstraction{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}
* universal abstraction{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

However, repeating these operations several times, for example forming the conjunction or disjunction of a set of BDDs, may in the worst case result in an exponentially big BDD. This is because any of the preceding operations for two BDDs may result in a BDD with a size proportional to the product of the BDDs' sizes, and consequently for several BDDs the size may be exponential. Also, since constructing the BDD of a Boolean function solves the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] and the co-NP-complete [[Tautology (logic)|tautology problem]], constructing the BDD can take exponential time in the size of the Boolean formula even when the resulting BDD is small.

'''Change''' refers to a difference in a state of affairs at different points in [[time]]. Although it is a familiar experience, an analysis of change provides subtle problems which have occupied [[philosopher]]s since the [[Presocratics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change and Inconsistency|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/#intro|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heraclitus]] is the first philosopher known to have directly raised such issues, with [[aphorism]]s such as "one cannot step into the same river twice". The [[Eleatics]] were particularly concerned with change and raised a number of problems, including [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno's]] [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], which caused them to go as far as insisting that change was impossible, and that reality was one and unchanging. Later philosophers would reject this conclusion, instead developing systems such as [[atomism]] in attempts to circumvent the Eleatic problems. In the [[modernity|modern era]], some of these problems would enter the domain of [[mathematics]], with the development of [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. These developments were regarded by some as solving problems of change, but others maintain that philosophical issues persist.

==In Chinese philosophy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The Chinese philosophy of change was described in centuries of commentary on the ''[[I Ching]]'', the Book of Changes.

== In Greek philosophy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[Heraclitus]] is the first philosopher for whom there exists an extant written account of an enquiry into change. Writing in an [[aphorism|aphoristic]] and esoteric style, Heraclitus remarked that, "On those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow". Or, more popularly: "One cannot step into the same river twice." This is generally taken to refer to the seeming contradiction between our calling a river "the same", while knowing that the material constituents of a river, the "waters", have completely changed. (A later follower amended the final word in the saying from "twice" to "once".)

It is unclear what reaction Heraclitus intends to induce by this statement, and he provides no exposition. It is however but one of many examples of a more general theme which Heraclitus termed the "unity of opposites" - the fact that opposing [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s could be asserted of the same thing, another example being, "the road up and the road down is one and the same".

=== The Eleatics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Change was one of the chief concerns of the [[Eleatic]] school of thought founded by [[Parmenides]]. Parmenides considered non-existence to be absurd, and thus asserted that it was impossible for something to come into existence out of nothing, or for something to pass out of existence into nothing. By "something", he was referring not just to material, but to any general predicate; rejecting, for instance, changes of colour, as they involved the new colour arising from nothing and the old colour passing into nothing. He therefore rejected all change as impossible, and claimed that reality was an undifferentiated and unchanging whole.

These ideas were taken up by various followers of Parmenides, most notably [[Melissus of Samos|Melissus]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], who provided additional arguments, specifically for the impossibility of [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Melissus claimed that reality was "full" (nonexistence being impossible), and that therefore nothing could move. Zeno gave a series of arguments which were particularly influential. Among the simplest was his observation that to move from A to B, one must first reach the halfway point between A and B; but then in order to do this, one must get halfway from A to this halfway point; and so on. Thus all motion involves an infinite number of steps, which Zeno held to be impossible. A similar argument involved a footrace between [[Achilles]] and a [[tortoise]]. The tortoise is given a headstart. Achilles quickly reaches the point where the tortoise stood, but by this time the tortoise has moved on a little, so Achilles must now reach this new point, and so on. A different argument involved the flight of an [[arrow]]. Zeno observed that if one considers a single moment of time, the arrow is not moving in that moment. He then claimed it was impossible that an arrow in motion could arise as the result of a sequence of motionless arrows.

=== Responses to the Eleatics ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] can be seen as a response to the Eleatic denial of change. The atomists conceded that something coming from or becoming nothing was impossible, but only with respect to [[matter|material substance]], not to general qualities. They hypothesised that every visible object was in fact a composite of unseen indivisible particles of different shapes and sizes. These particles were held to be eternal and unchanging, but by rearranging themselves, the composite objects which they formed could come into and go out of being. These composite objects and their properties were not taken as truly real; in the words of Democritus, "by convention sweet, by convention bitter; by convention hot, by convention cold; by convention colour: but in reality atoms and void." Any perceived change in an object's properties was therefore illusory and not susceptible to the objections of Parmenides.

[[Anaxagoras]] provided a similar response, but instead of atoms, he hypothesised a number of eternal, primal "ingredients" which were mixed together in a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]]. No material object was made of a pure ingredient; rather, it had its material character due to a preponderance of various ingredients over every other. In this way, Anaxagoras could assert that nowhere did any ingredient ever fully come into or go out of being.

[[File:Chemotaxis1.jpg|thumb|Capillary tube assay for chemotaxis. Motile prokaryotes sense chemicals in their environment and change their motility accordingly. Absent chemicals, movement is completely random. When an attractant or repellent is present, runs become longer and tumbles become less frequent. The result is net movement towards or away from the chemical (i.e., up or down the chemical gradient). The net movement can be seen in the beaker, where the bacteria accumulate around the origin of the attractant, and away from the origin of the repellent.]]
'''Chemotaxis''' (from ''[[chemical substance|chemo-]]'' + ''[[taxis]]'') is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chemotaxis|volume=6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somatic cell]]s, [[bacteria]], and other [[single-cell organism|single-cell]] or [[multicellular]] organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g., [[glucose]]) by swimming toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from [[poison]]s (e.g., [[phenol]]). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g., movement of [[sperm]] towards the egg during [[fertilization]]) and subsequent phases of development (e.g., migration of [[neuron]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s) as well as in normal function and health (e.g., migration of [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] during injury or infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Oliveira S, Rosowski EE, Huttenlocher A | title = Neutrophil migration in infection and wound repair: going forward in reverse | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 378–91 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27231052 | pmc = 5367630 | doi = 10.1038/nri.2016.49  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been recognized that mechanisms that allow chemotaxis in animals can be subverted during [[cancer]] [[metastasis]].

''Positive'' chemotaxis occurs if the movement is toward a higher concentration of the chemical in question; ''negative'' chemotaxis if the movement is in the opposite direction. Chemically prompted [[kinesis (biology)|kinesis]] (randomly directed or nondirectional) can be called [[chemokinesis]].

== History of chemotaxis research ==

Although migration of cells was detected from the early days of the development of microscopy by [[Leeuwenhoek]], a Caltech lecture regarding chemotaxis propounds that 'erudite description of chemotaxis was only first made by [[Theodor Wilhelm Engelmann|T. W. Engelmann]] (1881) and [[Wilhelm Pfeffer|W. F. Pfeffer]] (1884) in bacteria, and [[Herbert Spencer Jennings|H. S. Jennings]] (1906) in [[ciliate]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Chemotaxis Lecture. Uploaded in 2007. available at: http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/aph161/2007/lectures/ChemotaxisLecture.pdf (Last inspected: 15/04/17)&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Prize laureate [[Élie Metchnikoff|I. Metchnikoff]] also contributed to the study of the field during 1882 to 1886, with investigations of the process as an initial step of [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Élie Metchnikoff".

[[Image:ChtxCCW CW (Fixed).png|right|350 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Correlation of swimming behaviour and flagellar rotation&lt;/div&gt;]]
Some [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', have several [[flagellum|flagella]] per cell (4–10 typically). These can rotate in two ways:
# Counter-clockwise rotation aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in a straight line; and
# Clockwise rotation breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yuan |first1=Junhua |last2=Fahrner |first2=Karen A. |last3=Turner |first3=Linda |last4=Berg |first4=Howard C. |title=Asymmetry in the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the bacterial flagellar motor |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2919929/ |website=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |accessdate=19 October 2018 |pages=12846–12849 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1007333107 |date=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The directions of rotation are given for an observer outside the cell looking down the flagella toward the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_16_17/Biophysics_of_Systems/013_BakterChemotaxis_DB_WS16.pdf|title=Bacterial Chemotaxis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior ===
The overall movement of a bacterium is the result of alternating tumble and swim phases.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If one watches a bacterium swimming in a uniform environment, its movement will look like a [[random walk]] with relatively straight swims interrupted by random tumbles that reorient the bacterium.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' are unable to choose the direction in which they swim, and are unable to swim in a straight line for more than a few seconds due to rotational [[diffusion]]; in other words, bacteria "forget" the direction in which they are going.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} By repeatedly evaluating their course, and adjusting if they are moving in the wrong direction, bacteria can direct their motion to find favorable locations with high concentrations of attractants (usually food) and avoid repellents (usually poisons).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the presence of a chemical [[gradient]] bacteria will chemotax, or direct their overall motion based on the gradient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If the bacterium senses that it is moving in the correct direction (toward attractant/away from repellent), it will keep swimming in a straight line for a longer time before tumbling; however, if it is moving in the wrong direction, it will tumble sooner and try a new direction at random.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In other words, bacteria like ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' use temporal sensing to decide whether their situation is improving or not, and in this way, find the location with the highest concentration of attractant (usually the source) quite well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Even under very high concentrations, it can still distinguish very small differences in concentration, and fleeing from a repellent works with the same efficiency.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

This biased random walk is a result of simply choosing between two methods of random movement; namely tumbling and straight swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macnab RM, Koshland DE | title = The gradient-sensing mechanism in bacterial chemotaxis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 69 | issue = 9 | pages = 2509–12 | date = September 1972 | pmid = 4560688 | pmc = 426976 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.9.2509 | bibcode = 1972PNAS...69.2509M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, chemotactic responses such as ''forgetting'' direction and ''choosing'' movements resemble the decision-making abilities of higher life-forms with brains that process sensory data.{{according to whom|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The helical nature of the individual flagellar filament is critical for this movement to occur, and the protein that makes up the flagellar filament, [[flagellin]], is quite similar among all flagellated bacteria.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Vertebrates seem to have taken advantage of this fact by possessing an immune receptor ([[Toll-like receptor|TLR5]]) designed to recognize this conserved protein.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

As in many instances in biology, there are bacteria that do not follow this rule. Many bacteria, such as ''Vibrio'', are monoflagellated and have a single flagellum at one pole of the cell. Their method of chemotaxis is different. Others possess a single flagellum that is kept inside the cell wall. These bacteria move by spinning the whole cell, which is shaped like a corkscrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard C. |last=Berg | name-list-format = vanc | title=''E. coli'' in motion | year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-387-00888-2 |publisher=Springer | location=New York, NY }}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

===Signal transduction===
[[Image:ChtxAspRec.png|right|350 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Domain structure of chemotaxis receptor for Asp&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemical gradients are sensed through multiple [[transmembrane receptor]]s, called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which vary in the molecules that they detect.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} These receptors may bind attractants or repellents directly or indirectly through interaction with proteins of [[periplasmatic space]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The signals from these receptors are transmitted across the [[plasma membrane]] into the [[cytosol]], where ''[[Che proteins]]'' are activated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Che proteins alter the tumbling frequency, and alter the receptors.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Flagellum regulation====
The proteins CheW and CheA bind to the receptor. The absence of receptor activation results in [[phosphorylation|autophosphorylation]] in the histidine kinase, CheA, at a single highly conserved histidine residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4lv7cBYVug|title=Chemotaxis|first=|last=ToxCafe|date=2 June 2011|publisher=|accessdate=March 23, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} CheA, in turn, transfers phosphoryl groups to conserved aspartate residues in the response regulators CheB and CheY; CheA is a histidine kinase and it does not actively transfer the phosphoryl group, rather, the response regulator [[Protein-glutamate methylesterase|CheB]] takes the phosphoryl group from CheA.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This mechanism of signal transduction is called a [[two-component regulatory system|two-component system]], and it is a common form of signal transduction in bacteria.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} CheY induces tumbling by interacting with the flagellar switch protein FliM, inducing a change from counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation of the flagellum. Change in the rotation state of a single flagellum can disrupt the entire flagella bundle and cause a tumble.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Receptor regulation====
[[Image:Chtxbactsign1.png|right|450 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Signalling pathways of E.coli&lt;/div&gt;]]
CheB, when activated by CheA, acts as a [[demethylase|methylesterase]], removing methyl groups from [[glutamate]] residues on the [[cytosol]]ic side of the receptor; it works antagonistically with CheR, a methyl[[transferase]], which adds methyl residues to the same glutamate residues.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If the level of an attractant remains high, the level of phosphorylation of CheA (and, therefore, CheY and CheB) will remain low, the cell will swim smoothly, and the level of methylation of the MCPs will increase (because CheB-P is not present to demethylate).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The MCPs no longer respond to the attractant when they are fully methylated; therefore, even though the level of attractant might remain high, the level of CheA-P (and CheB-P) increases and the cell begins to tumble.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The MCPs can be demethylated by CheB-P, and, when this happens, the receptors can once again respond to attractants.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The situation is the opposite with regard to repellents: fully methylated MCPs respond best to repellents, while least-methylated MCPs respond worst to repellents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This regulation allows the bacterium to 'remember' chemical concentrations from the recent past, a few seconds, and compare them to those it is currently experiencing, thus 'know' whether it is traveling up or down a gradient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Although the methylation system accounts for the wide range of sensitivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mello BA, Tu Y | title = Effects of adaptation in maintaining high sensitivity over a wide range of backgrounds for Escherichia coli chemotaxis | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 2329–37 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17208965 | pmc = 1864821 | doi = 10.1529/biophysj.106.097808 | bibcode = 2007BpJ....92.2329M }}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} that bacteria have to chemical gradients, other mechanisms are involved in increasing the absolute value of the sensitivity on a given background.

== Chemoattractants and chemorepellents ==
Chemoattractants and chemorepellents are [[inorganic]] or [[Organic compound|organic]] substances possessing chemotaxis-inducer effect in motile cells. These chemotactic [[ligand]]s create chemical concentration gradients that organisms, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, move toward or away from, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Xu | first = Feifei | last2 = Bierman | first2 = Robert | last3 = Healy | first3 = Frank | last4 = Nguyen | first4 = Hoa | name-list-format = vanc |title=A multi-scale model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis from intracellular signaling pathway to motility and nutrient uptake in nutrient gradient and isotropic fluid environments|doi = 10.1016/j.camwa.2015.12.019 |journal=Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications|volume=71| issue = 11 |pages=2466–2478 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tap and Tsr recognize [[dipeptide]]s and [[serine]] as chemoattractants, respectively.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

Chemoattractants or chemorepellents bind MCPs at its extracellular domain; an intracellular signaling domain relays the changes in concentration of these chemotactic ligands to downstream proteins like that of CheA which then relays this signal to flagellar motors via phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P).&lt;ref name="twenty" /&gt; CheY-P can then control flagellar rotation influencing the direction of cell motility.&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt;

For ''E.coli'', ''[[S. meliloti]]'', and ''[[R. spheroids]],'' the binding of chemoattractants to MCPs inhibit CheA and therefore CheY-P activity, resulting in smooth runs, but for ''[[Bacillus subtilis|B. substilis]]'', CheA activity increases.&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt; Methylation events in ''E.coli'' cause MCPs to have lower affinity to chemoattractants which causes increased activity of CheA and CheY-P resulting in tumbles.&lt;ref name="twenty" /&gt; In this way cells are able to adapt to the immediate chemoattractant concentration and detect further changes to modulate cell motility.&lt;ref name="twenty"/&gt;

Chemoattractants in eukaryotes are well characterized for immune cells. [[Formyl]] [[peptide]]s, such as [[N-formylmethioninyl]], attract [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] such as [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s, causing movement toward infection sites.&lt;ref name="shiffmann"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffmann E, Corcoran BA, Wahl SM | title = N-formylmethionyl peptides as chemoattractants for leucocytes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 1059–62 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1093163 | pmc = 432465 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.72.3.1059| url = http://www.pnas.org/content/72/3/1059.full.pdf | bibcode = 1975PNAS...72.1059S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-acylated methioninyl peptides do not act as chemoattractants to neutrophils and macrophages.&lt;ref name="shiffmann" /&gt; Leukocytes also move toward chemoattractants C5a, a [[Complement system|complement]] component, and [[pathogen]]-specific ligands on bacteria.&lt;ref name="shiffmann" /&gt;

Mechanisms concerning chemorepellents are less known than chemoattractants. Although chemorepellents work to confer an avoidance response in organisms, [[Tetrahymena|''Tetrahymena thermophila'']]  adapt to a chemorepellent, [[Netrin-1 peptide]], within 10 minutes of exposure; however, exposure to chemorepellents such as [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], [[PACAP-38]], and [[nociceptin]] show no such adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuruvilla H, Schmidt B, Song S, Bhajjan M, Merical M, Alley C, Griffin C, Yoder D, Hein J, Kohl D, Puffenberger C, Petroff D, Newcomer E, Good K, Heston G, Hurtubise A | title = Netrin-1 Peptide Is a Chemorepellent in Tetrahymena thermophila | journal = International Journal of Peptides | volume = 2016 | pages = 1–7 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27123011 | doi = 10.1155/2016/7142868 | pmc=4830718}}&lt;/ref&gt; GTP and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] are chemorepellents in micro-molar concentrations to both ''Tetrahymena'' and ''[[Paramecium]]''.

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotes and have receptors embedded uniformly throughout the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name="Levine2013" /&gt; Eukaryotic chemotaxis involves detecting a concentration gradient spatially by comparing the asymmetric activation of these receptors at the different ends of the cell.&lt;ref name="Levine2013" /&gt; Activation of these receptors results in migration towards chemoattractants, or away from chemorepellants.&lt;ref name="Levine2013" /&gt;

Levels of receptors, intracellular signalling pathways and the effector mechanisms all represent diverse, eukaryotic-type components.

Besides immune competent cells ([[granulocyte]], [[monocyte]], [[lymphocyte]]) a large group of cells—considered previously to be fixed into tissues—are also motile in special physiological (e.g., [[mast cell]], [[fibroblast]], [[endothelial cells]]) or pathological conditions (e.g., [[metastases]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kedrin D, van Rheenen J, Hernandez L, Condeelis J, Segall JE | title = Cell motility and cytoskeletal regulation in invasion and metastasis | journal = Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia | volume = 12 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–52 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17557195 | doi = 10.1007/s10911-007-9046-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotaxis has high significance in the early phases of [[embryogenesis]] as development of [[germ layers]] is guided by gradients of signal molecules.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Motility===
Unlike motility in bacterial chemotaxis, the mechanism by which eukaryotic cells physically move is unclear. There appear to be mechanisms by which an external chemotactic gradient is sensed and turned into an intracellular [[PIP3]] gradient, which results in a gradient and the activation of a signaling pathway, culminating in the [[polymerisation]] of [[actin]] filaments. The growing distal end of actin filaments develops connections with the internal surface of the plasma membrane via different sets of peptides and results in the formation of anterior[[pseudopods]] and posterior [[Uropod (immunology)|uropods]].
[[Cilium|Cilia]] of eukaryotic cells can also produce chemotaxis; in this case, it is mainly a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent induction of the [[microtubule|microtubular]] system of the [[basal body]] and the beat of the 9+2 microtubules within cilia. The orchestrated beating of hundreds of cilia is synchronized by a submembranous system built between basal bodies.
The details of the signaling pathways are still not totally clear.

====Chemotaxis-related migratory responses====
[[Image:Chtxphenomen1.png|right|400 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Chemotaxis related migratory responses&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemotaxis refers to the directional migration of cells in response to chemical gradients; several variations of chemical-induced migration exist as listed below. 
* ''[[Chemokinesis]]'' refers to an increase in cellular motility in response to chemicals in the surrounding environment. Unlike chemotaxis, the migration stimulated by chemokinesis lacks directionality, and instead increases environmental scanning behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker EL | title = Stimulated neutrophil locomotion: chemokinesis and chemotaxis | journal = Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | volume = 101 | issue = 10 | pages = 509–13 | date = October 1977 | pmid = 199132  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In ''[[haptotaxis]]'' the [[gradient]] of the chemoattractant is expressed or bound on a surface, in contrast to the classical model of chemotaxis, in which the gradient develops in a soluble fluid.&lt;ref name="pmid6030602"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter SB | title = Haptotaxis and the mechanism of cell motility | journal = Nature | volume = 213 | issue = 5073 | pages = 256–60 | year = 1967 | pmid = 6030602 | doi = 10.1038/213256a0 | bibcode = 1967Natur.213..256C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common biologically active haptotactic surface is the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM); the presence of bound [[ligands]] is responsible for induction of transendothelial migration and [[angiogenesis]].
* ''[[Necrotaxis]]'' embodies a special type of chemotaxis when the chemoattractant molecules are released from [[necrosis|necrotic]] or [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] cells. Depending on the chemical character of released substances, necrotaxis can accumulate or repel cells, which underlines the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon.

In general, eukaryotic cells sense the presence of chemotactic stimuli through the use of 7-transmembrane (or serpentine) heterotrimeric [[G protein|G-protein]]-coupled receptors, a class representing a significant portion of the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim JY, Haastert PV, Devreotes PN | title = Social senses: G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways in Dictyostelium discoideum | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–43 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8807851 | doi=10.1016/s1074-5521(96)90103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of this gene superfamily are used in eyesight (rhodopsins) as well as in olfaction (smelling).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montell C | title = Visual transduction in Drosophila | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | pages = 231–68 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10611962 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.231  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Antunes G, Simoes de Souza FM | title = Olfactory receptor signaling | journal = Methods in Cell Biology | volume = 132 | pages = 127–45 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26928542 | doi = 10.1016/bs.mcb.2015.11.003  | isbn = 9780128035955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main classes of chemotaxis receptors are triggered by:
* formyl peptides - [[formyl peptide receptor]]s (FPR), 
* [[chemokines]] - [[chemokine receptor]]s (CCR or CXCR), and 
* [[leukotrienes]] - [[leukotriene receptor]]s (BLT).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
However, induction of a wide set of membrane receptors (e.g., [[cyclic nucleotide]]s, [[amino acids]], [[insulin]], vasoactive peptides) also elicit migration of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Haastert PJ, De Wit RJ, Konijn TM | title = Antagonists of chemoattractants reveal separate receptors for cAMP, folic acid and pterin in Dictyostelium | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 140 | issue = 2 | pages = 453–6 | date = August 1982 | pmid = 7117406 | doi=10.1016/0014-4827(82)90139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of molecules capable of eliciting chemotactic responses is relatively high, and we can distinguish primary and secondary chemotactic molecules.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The main groups of the primary ligands are as follows:
* ''Formyl peptides'' are di-, tri-, tetrapeptides of bacterial origin, formylated on the N-terminus of the peptide.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2109936|title=Ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to orient in gradients of chemotactic factors|volume=75|issue=2|pages=606–616|last=Zigmond|first=Sally|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|year=1977|pmid=264125}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are released from bacteria in vivo or after decomposition of the cell[ a typical member of this group is the N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (abbreviated fMLF or fMLP).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Bacterial fMLF is a key component of inflammation has characteristic chemoattractant effects in neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The chemotactic factor ligands and receptors related to formyl peptides are summarized in the related article, [[Formyl peptide receptors]].

* ''[[Chemokines]]'' belong to a special class of [[cytokines]]; not only do their groups (C, CC, CXC, CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C chemokines) represent structurally related molecules with a special arrangement of disulfide bridges but also their target cell specificity is diverse.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} CC chemokines act on monocytes (e.g., [[RANTES]]), and CXC chemokines are neutrophil granulocyte-specific (e.g., [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Investigations of the three-dimensional structures of chemokines provided evidence that a characteristic composition of beta-sheets and an alpha helix provides expression of sequences required for interaction with the chemokine receptors.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Formation of dimers and their increased biological activity was demonstrated by crystallography of several chemokines, e.g. IL-8.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
*Metabolites of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s
** ''[[Leukotrienes]]'' are [[eicosanoid]] lipid mediators made by the metabolism of [[arachidonic acid]] by [[ALOX5]] (also termed 5-lipoxygenase). Their most prominent member with chemotactic factor activity is [[leukotriene B4]], which elicits adhesion, chemotaxis, and aggregation of leukocytes. The chemoattractant action of LTB4 is induced via either of two [[G protein–coupled receptor]]s, [[BLT]]1 and [[BLT2]], which are highly expressed in cells involved in [[inflammation]] and [[allergy]].&lt;ref name="pmid25449650"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biosynthesis, biological effects, and receptors of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and oxoeicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs) derived from arachidonic acid | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 340–55 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25449650 | pmc = 5710736 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The family of [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid]] eicosanoids are arachidonic acid metabolites also formed by ALOX5. Three members of the family form naturally and have prominent chemotactic activity. These, listed in order of decreasing potency, are: ''[[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]]'', ''5-oxo-15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid'', and ''[[5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]''. This family of agonists stimulates chemotactic responses in human [[eosinophils]], [[neutrophils]], and [[monocytes]] by binding to the [[Oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]], which like the receptors for leukotriene B4, is a G protein-coupled receptor.&lt;ref name="pmid25449650"/&gt; Aside from the skin, [[neutrophils]] are the body's first line of defense against [[bacterial]] infections.

==== Chemotactic range fitting ====
[[Image:chtxCRF2.png|right|250 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;[[Chemotactic range fitting]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemotactic responses elicited by the ligand-receptor interactions are, in general, distinguished upon the optimal effective concentration(s) of the ligand. Nevertheless, correlation of the amplitude elicited and ratio of the responder cells compared to the total number are also characteristic features of the chemotactic signaling. Investigations of ligand families (e.g., amino acids or oligo peptides) proved that there is a fitting of ranges (amplitudes; number of responder cells) and chemotactic activities: Chemoattractant moiety is accompanied by wide ranges, whereas chemorepellent character by narrow ranges.

==Clinical significance==
A changed migratory potential of cells has relatively high importance in the development of several clinical symptoms and syndromes.
Altered chemotactic activity of extracellular (e.g., [[Escherichia coli]]) or intracellular (e.g., [[Listeria monocytogenes]]) pathogens itself represents a significant clinical target. Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.
Apart from infections, there are some other diseases wherein impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.

==Mathematical models==
Several mathematical models of chemotaxis were developed depending on the type of
* migration (e.g., basic differences of bacterial swimming, movement of unicellular eukaryotes with [[cilia]]/[[flagellum]] and [[ameboid|amoeboid]] migration)
* physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals (e.g., [[diffusion]]) working as ligands
* biological characteristics of the ligands (attractant, neutral, and repellent molecules)
* assay systems applied to evaluate chemotaxis (see incubation times, development, and stability of concentration gradients)
* other environmental effects possessing direct or indirect influence on the migration (lighting, temperature, magnetic fields, etc.)

Although interactions of the factors listed above make the behavior of the solutions of mathematical models of chemotaxis rather complex, it is possible to describe the basic phenomenon of chemotaxis-driven motion in a straightforward way.
Indeed, let us denote with &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the spatially non-uniform concentration of the chemo-attractant and with &lt;math&gt;\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; its gradient. Then the chemotactic cellular flow (also called current) &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; that is generated by the chemotaxis is linked to the above gradient by the law: &lt;math&gt; J = \chi C \nabla\varphi &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the spatial density of the cells and &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ’Chemotactic coefficient’. However, note that in many cases &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is not constant: It is, instead, a decreasing function of the concentration of the chemo-attractant &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \chi(\varphi) &lt;/math&gt;.

[[Spatial ecology]] of soil microorganisms is a function of their chemotactic sensitivities towards substrate and fellow organisms.&lt;ref name="Gharasoo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.11.019|title=How the chemotactic characteristics of bacteria can determine their population patterns|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=69 |pages=346–358 |year=2014 |last1=Gharasoo |first1=Mehdi |last2=Centler |first2=Florian|last3=Fetzer|first3=Ingo|last4=Thullner|first4=Martin | name-list-format = vanc }}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} The chemotactic behavior of the bacteria was proven to lead to non-trivial population patterns even in the absence of environmental heterogeneities. The presence of structural pore scale heterogeneities has an extra impact on the emerging bacterial patterns.

==Measurement of chemotaxis==
{{main|Chemotaxis assay}}
A wide range of techniques is available to evaluate chemotactic activity of cells or the chemoattractant and chemorepellent character of ligands.
The basic requirements of the measurement are as follows:
* concentration gradients can develop relatively quickly and persist for a long time in the system
* chemotactic and chemokinetic activities are distinguished
* migration of cells is free toward and away on the axis of the concentration gradient
* detected responses are the results of active migration of cells

Despite the fact that an ideal [[chemotaxis assay]] is still not available, there are several protocols and pieces of equipment that offer good correspondence with the conditions described above. The most commonly used are summarised in the table below:

''Chemical robots'' that use artificial chemotaxis to navigate autonomously have been designed. Applications include targeted delivery of drugs in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lagzi|first=István|title=Chemical Robotics—Chemotactic Drug Carriers|journal=Central European Journal of Medicine|year=2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=377–382|doi=10.2478/s11536-012-0130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, enzyme molecules have also shown positive chemotactic behavior in a gradient of their substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Samudra|last2=Dey|first2=Krishna K.|last3=Muddana|first3=Hari S.|last4=Tabouillot|first4=Tristan|last5=Ibele|first5=Michael E.|last6=Butler|first6=Peter J.|last7=Sen|first7=Ayusman|date=2013-01-22|title=Enzyme Molecules as Nanomotors|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=135|issue=4|pages=1406–1414|doi=10.1021/ja3091615|pmid=23308365|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, enzymes in cascades have also shown substrate-driven chemotactic aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Xi|last2=Palacci|first2=Henri|last3=Yadav|first3=Vinita|last4=Spiering|first4=Michelle M.|last5=Gilson|first5=Michael K.|last6=Butler|first6=Peter J.|last7=Hess|first7=Henry|last8=Benkovic|first8=Stephen J.|last9=Sen|first9=Ayusman|date=2017-12-18|title=Substrate-driven chemotactic assembly in an enzyme cascade|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2905|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=10|issue=3|pages=311–317|doi=10.1038/nchem.2905|pmid=29461522|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guha|first=Rajarshi|last2=Mohajerani|first2=Farzad|last3=Collins|first3=Matthew|last4=Ghosh|first4=Subhadip|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|date=2017-10-24|title=Chemotaxis of Molecular Dyes in Polymer Gradients in Solution|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=139|issue=44|pages=15588–15591|doi=10.1021/jacs.7b08783|pmid=29064685|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 
&lt;/ref&gt; It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a [[zero-sum game]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.G., Ferrier, W.J. and Ndofor, H., 2001. Competitive dynamics research: Critique and future directions. Handbook of strategic management, pp.315-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition occurs [[nature|naturally]] between living organisms which co-exist in the same [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2001. ''Competition'', 2nd ed., Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other [[resource (biology)|biological resources]]. Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of [[wealth]], power, prestige, and [[celebrity|fame]].

Competition is often considered to be the opposite of [[cooperation]], however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Competition.php Competition], Sociology guide&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as [[game theory]].

Competition is also a major tenet of [[market economy|market economies]] and business. It is often associated with business competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. Also competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.

== Consequences ==
Competition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving force of [[adaptation]], and ultimately of [[evolution]]. However, some biologists disagree, citing competition as a driving force only on a small scale, and citing the larger scale drivers of evolution to be abiotic factors (termed 'Room to Roam').&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–47 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] prefers to think of evolution in terms of competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for replication (termed the 'selfish gene').

Some [[social Darwinist]]s claim that competition also serves as a mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of [[recreation]] or a challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.

== Biology and ecology ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Natural selection]] --&gt;
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}
Competition within, between, and among species is one of the most important forces in biology, especially in the field of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt;

Competition between members of a species ("intraspecific") for resources such as [[food]], [[water]], [[Territory (animal)|territory]], and [[sunlight]] may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition among resources also has a strong tendency for diversification between members of the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high competitiveness. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh ([[evolutionary suicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldauf|first1=Sebastian A.|last2=Engqvist|first2=Leif|last3=Weissing|first3=Franz J.|title=Diversifying evolution of competitiveness|journal=Nature Communications|date=29 October 2014|volume=5|pages=5233|doi=10.1038/ncomms6233|pmid=25351604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition is also present between species ("interspecific"). When resources are limited, several species may depend on these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may [[extinction|die out]] unless they [[adaptation|adapt]] by character dislocation, for instance. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources plays a significant role in [[natural selection]]. At shorter time scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling diversity in ecological communities, but at larger scales expansion and contraction of ecological space is a much more larger factor than competition.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"/&gt; This is illustrated by living plant communities where asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt; Multiple examples of symmetric and asymmetric competition also exist for animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Jun Young|last3=Jang|first3=Yikweon|title=Asymmetric competition over calling sites in two closely related treefrog species|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 Sep 2016|volume=6|page=32569|doi=10.1038/srep32569|pmc=5013533|pmid=27599461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game theory==
{{main|Game theory}}
Game theory is "the study of [[mathematical model]]s of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."&lt;ref name=Myerson&gt;[[Roger B. Myerson|Myerson, Roger B.]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7 vii–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Game theory is mainly used in [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[psychology]], as well as [[logic]], [[computer science]], [[biology]] and [[poker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323610704578625812355516182|title=The Science of Winning Poker|author=Christopher Chabris|date=26 July 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it mainly addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants.

Game theory is a major method used in [[mathematical economics]] and business for [[Economic model|modeling]] competing behaviors of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agent]]s.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as [[auction]]s, [[bargaining]], [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]] pricing,&lt;ref name="GT-A-E-00"/&gt; [[fair division]], [[Duopoly|duopolies]], [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], [[social network]] formation, [[agent-based computational economics]],&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; [[general equilibrium]], [[mechanism design]],&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; and [[voting system]]s;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; and across such broad areas as [[experimental economics]],&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; [[Behavioral game theory|behavioral economics]],&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; [[information economics]],&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; [[industrial organization]],&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; and [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as [[Solution concept|"solution concepts" or "equilibria"]]. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-09"&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |date=2013-05-24 }} Research paper [[INSEAD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-10"&gt;[http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |date=June 20, 2013 }}.

==Economics and business==
{{Main|Competition (economics)}}

Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as "the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favorable terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/competition m-w.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was described by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and later economists as allocating productive [[resource]]s to their most highly valued uses and encouraging [[X-inefficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Stigler]] ([[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987]]] 2008). "competition," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000261&amp;q=competition&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=6 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[microeconomic theory]] distinguished between [[perfect competition]] and [[imperfect competition]], concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than [[perfect competition]]. Competition, according to the theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition ([[monopoly]]) or little competition ([[oligopoly]]).

However, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to increased [[cost]]s (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense competition for the small number of [[superstar|top jobs in music and movie acting]] leads many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful. Critics have also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition between certain financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative responses to changes in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf |title=The Profitability of Winning |author1=J. Scott Armstrong |author2=Fred Collopy |journal=Chief Executive |pages=61–63 |year=1994 |access-date=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622023252/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20(2).pdf |archive-date=2010-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the strong desire to defeat rival firms with competitive prices has the strong possibility of causing price wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Profitability%20of%20winning.pdf | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share |author1=J. Scott Armstrong |author2=Kesten C. Greene | journal = International Journal of Business | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–34 | year = 2007 | issn= 1083-4346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three levels of economic competition have been classified:

* The most narrow form is '''direct competition''' (also called category competition or brand competition), where [[product (business)|products]] which perform the same function compete against each other. For example, one brand of pick-up trucks competes with several other brands of pick-up trucks. Sometimes, two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line, which leads to the other company distributing the same new things, and in this manner they compete.
* The next form is '''substitute''' or '''indirect competition''', where products which are close substitutes for one another compete. For example, butter competes with margarine, mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads.
* The broadest form of competition is typically called '''budget competition'''. Included in this category is anything on which the [[consumer]] might want to spend their available [[income|money]]. For example, a family which has $20,000 available may choose to spend it on many different items, which can all be seen as competing with each other for the family's expenditure. This form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of "share of wallet".

In addition, companies also compete for [[finance|financing]] on the capital markets (equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations. An [[investor]] typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product ('''direct competitors'''). Enlarging the investment universe to include '''indirect competitors''' leads to a broader peer universe of comparable, indirectly competing companies.

Competition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example, business writers sometimes refer to '''internal competition'''. This is competition within companies. The idea was first introduced by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions. For example, the [[Chevrolet]] division would compete with the [[Pontiac]] division for some [[market segment]]s. The competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions, for example parts designed by Chevrolet would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in 1931, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. The company was organized around different [[brand]]s, with each brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly.

Finally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales) over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer. This is also known as '''intra-brand competition.'''

Shalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of [[reverse auction]]s correlated most closely with competition. The literature widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse auctions success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1727409 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings appear to support that argument, as competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as with the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39032383/Electronic-Reverse-Auction-and-the-Public-Sector-Factors-of-Success-Moshe-E-Shalev-Stee-Asbjorensen |publisher= Shalev Moshe and Asbjornsen Stee |title=Electronic reverse auctions and the public sector – Factors of success |work=Journal of Public Procurement |pages=428–52 |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most [[country|countries]] is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a [[government monopoly]] or a [[government-granted monopoly]]. [[Tariffs]], [[subsidies]] or other [[protectionist]] measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by [[competition policy]] and [[competition law]].  Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher [[government regulation]]s typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=884&amp;full=1 Competition, Regulation, and the Market Process: An "Austrian" Perspective, Sept. 30, 1982] by [[Israel M. Kirzner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate===
{{See also|Race to the bottom}}
Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the [[world economy]]. Countries compete to provide the best possible business environment for [[multinational corporations]]. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as [[gifted education]].

===Law===
{{Main|Competition law}}
[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to the influential [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] enforcers of U.S. competition laws]]
Competition [[law]], known in the [[United States]] as antitrust law, has three main functions. First, it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between business entities and their customers. For example, a [[cartel]] of sports shops who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;''JJB Sports v OFT [2004] CAT 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Second, competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who through its [[monopoly]] on computer platforms makes consumers use its media player.&lt;ref&gt;in the E.U. side of the saga, see [http://europa.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&amp;num=79958777T1904%20R0201_2&amp;doc=T&amp;ouvert=T&amp;seance=ORD&amp;where=() Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Third, to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of very large corporations. Competition authorities could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle [[license]]s to competitors before taking over a major [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-12/03 P, Commission v. Tetra Laval&lt;/ref&gt; In this case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the [[consumer welfare|welfare of consumers]] by ensuring business must compete for its share of the [[market economy]].

In recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to provide better [[public services]], traditionally funded by [[tax]] payers and administered by [[Democracy|democratically]] accountable [[government]]s. Hence competition law is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets, providing state aids and subsidies, the [[privatisation]] of state-owned assets and the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom telecommunications watchdog [[Ofcom]]. Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by [[neo-classical economics]]. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes [[market failure|they fail]], and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the [[Roman Empire]]. The business practices of market traders, [[guilds]] and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are [[United States antitrust law]] and [[European Community competition law]]. The respective national authorities, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) in the United States and the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|European Commission's Competition Directorate General]] (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.

== Trade ==

Competition is also found in [[trade]]. For nations, as well as firms it is important to understand trade dynamics in order to market their goods and services effectively in international markets. [[Balance of trade]] can be considered a crude, but widely used proxy for international competitiveness across levels: [[country]], [[industry]] or even [[business|firm]]. Research data hints that exporting firms have a higher survival rate and achieve greater employment growth compared with non-exporters.

Using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International competitiveness can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kmomaya.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ijm_pranusha_bhokray_momaya_export_competitiveness_pre-publication_review.pdf | title = Export Competitiveness of Select Firms from India: Glimpse of Trends and Implications |author1=Manthri P. |author2=Bhokray K. |author3=Momaya K. S. | journal = Indian Journal of Marketing | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 7–13 | year = 2015 | doi=10.17010/ijom/2015/v45/i5/79934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Competition is also found in [[politics]]. In [[democracy|democracies]], an [[election]] is a competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time, towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next holder of the office.

In addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a limited amount of resources, such as for [[budget|funding]]. Finally, where there are [[party systems]], elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete against the other parties for [[law]]s, [[funding]] and [[political power|power]].

Finally, competition also exists between [[government]]s. Each [[country]] or [[nationality]] struggles for world dominance, power, or [[military]] strength. For example, the [[United States]] competed against the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of government (in these cases [[representative democracy]] and [[communism]]). The result of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may sometimes erupt into [[war]]fare.

== Sports ==
{{Anchor|Competitive sports}}&lt;!-- Previous title. 2013-07-01 --&gt;
[[File:US Olympic Committee Headquarters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The [[Olympic Games]] are regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.]]
While some [[sport]]s and [[game]]s (such as [[fishing]] or [[hiking]]) have been viewed as primarily recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve competition between two or more persons (sometimes using [[horse racing|horses]] or [[auto racing|cars]]). For example, in a game of [[basketball]], two teams compete against one another to determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the winning team, many players gain a sense of [[pride]]. In addition, extrinsic rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans, also compete against [[nature]] in sports such as [[whitewater kayaking]] or [[mountaineering]], where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual) competition meant to determine the "best" competitor of that cycle is called a [[championship]].
[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baseball]], a competitive sport]]
Competitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the participants. Violating these rules is considered to be [[unfair competition]]. Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example, competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as [[gymnastics]] and competitive [[Diving (sport)|diving]] compete against each other in order to come closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings and scores by appointed judges.

Sports competition is generally broken down into three categories: '''individual''' sports, such as [[archery]]; '''dual''' sports, such as [[tennis|doubles tennis]], and '''team''' sports competition, such as [[cricket]] or [[football]]. While most sports competitions are recreation, there exist several [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league|minor]] professional sports leagues throughout the world. The [[Olympic Games]], held every four years, is usually regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.

== Education ==
Competition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation, encourage competitiveness among students through [[scholarships]]. Countries such as England and Singapore have [[special education]] programmes which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of [[academic elitism]]. Upon receipt of their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example (see [[Education in Japan]]). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of examinations as a whole by educationalists {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students, and that it "turns all of us into losers" (Kohn 1986). Economist [[Richard Layard]] has commented on the harmful effects, stating "people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their main objective in life is to do better than other people. That is certainly what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good basis for a society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13052639 ''Group dedicated to happiness launched in UK'', BBC video, April 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies such as the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] show that the effect of competition on students depends on each individual's level of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Students with a high level of agency thrive on competition, are self-motivated, and are willing to risk failure. Compared to their counterparts who are low in agency, these students are more likely to be flexible, adaptable and creative as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Literature ==
Literary competitions, such as contests sponsored by [[literary journals]], publishing houses and theaters, have increasingly become a means for aspiring writers to gain recognition. Awards for fiction include those sponsored by the ''[[Missouri Review]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', ''[[Indiana Review]]'', ''[[North American Review]]'' and ''[[Southwest Review]]''. The [[Edward Albee|Albee]] Award, sponsored by the Yale Drama Series, is among the most prestigious playwriting awards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Consumer competitions - games of luck or skill==
{{further|Game of chance}}
In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are the equivalent of what are commonly known as [[sweepstakes]] in the United States. The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade promotion lottery or lottos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/promos_trade_promos.asp |title=OLGR &gt; Promotions and competitions &gt; Trade promotion lotteries |publisher=Olgr.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes, hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number of prizes.

A trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.

Such competitions can be games of luck (randomly drawn) or skill (judged on an entry question or submission), or possibly a combination of both.

People that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 members of the online competitions community of lottos.com.au from around Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lottos.com.au/competitions/viewthreadlite.php?tid=275933 |title=NATIONAL LOTTOS MEET GOLD COAST 16TH SEPTEMBER 2012 :) |publisher=Lottos.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amv7jMwbHIw&amp;t=6s |title=Comp Queens |publisher=Aca.ninemsn.com.au |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
Competition has been studied in several fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. Social [[psychologist]]s, for instance, study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study [[group dynamics]], to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. [[Sociologist]]s, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. In addition, [[anthropologist]]s study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various [[culture|cultural]] settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

==Competitiveness==
{{Main|Competitiveness}}
Many [[philosopher]]s and [[psychologist]]s have identified a trait in most living organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait, called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate [[biology|biological]] [[Trait (biological)|trait]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and ambition in the [[English language]]. More advanced [[civilization]]s integrate aggressiveness and competitiveness into their [[Social interaction|interactions]], as a way to distribute resources and adapt. Many plants compete with neighboring ones for sunlight.

However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that as one ascends the evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less innate, and more a learned behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The same could be said for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are considered learned behaviors{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, because the human species learns to adapt to environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore, aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The term also applies to [[econometrics]]. Here, it is a comparative measure of the ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on the assessment of competitiveness are the '''Structure Conduct Performance Paradigm''' and the more contemporary '''New Empirical Industrial Organisation''' model. Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness.

=== Hypercompetitiveness ===
The tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed '''hypercompetitiveness'''. This concept originated in [[Karen Horney]]'s theories on [[neurosis]]; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is characterized as "moving against people". In her view, some people have a need to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their [[self-esteem|self-worth]]. These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and less psychologically healthy than those who score low on the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ryckman, R. M. |author2=Thornton, B. |author3=Butler, J. C. |year=1994 |title= Personality correlates of the hypercompetitive attitude scale: Validity tests of Horney's theory of neurosis |work=[[Journal of Personality Assessment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypercompetitive individuals generally believe that "[[winning isn't everything; it's the only thing]]".{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] insisted that "the capitalist system fosters competition and egoism in all its members and thoroughly undermines all genuine forms of community".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes a "climate of competitive egoism and individualism", with competition for jobs and competition between employees; Marx said competition between workers exceeds that demonstrated by company owners.&lt;ref name="allenb"&gt;
Allen E. Buchanan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j1AOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marx and justice: the radical critique of liberalism]'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1982
&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that competition separates individuals from one another and while concentration of workers and development of better communication alleviate this, they are not a decision.&lt;ref name="allenb"/&gt;

===Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]] explained competition as a primal dilemma in which all infants find themselves. The infant competes with other family members for the attention and affection of the parent of the opposite sex or the primary caregiving parent. During this time, a boy develops a deep fear that the father (the son's prime rival) will punish him for these feelings of desire for the mother, by castrating  him. Girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl’s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father in competitive rivalry with her mother. This constellation of feelings is known as [[Oedipus Complex]] ( after the Greek Mythology figure who accidentally killed his father and married his mother). This is associated with the [[phallic stage]] of childhood development where intense primal emotions of competitive rivalry with (usually) the parent of the same sex are rampant and create a crisis that must be negotiated successfully for healthy psychological development to proceed. Unresolved Oedipus complex competitiveness issues can lead to lifelong neuroses manifesting in various ways related to an overdetermined relationship to competition.

===Mahatma Gandhi===
[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] speaks of egoistic competition.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;
Parmeshwari Dayal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FemHmw5fGQUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gandhian Theory of Social Reconstruction], Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For him, such qualities glorified and/or left unbridled, can lead to violence, conflict, discord and destructiveness. For Gandhi, competition comes from the ego, and therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for the well-being of humanity.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; In the society desired by Gandhi, each individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life. For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have fewer tendencies toward egoism and selfishness.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt;

“'''Control''' has been one of the most widely explored topics in the social and psychological sciences”&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Bachrach, Rapp, Grewal, and Beitelspacher. (2015).''Journal of Applied Psychology.''Vol. 100, No. 4, 1076&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]] it can refer to one’s perception regarding her/his ability to achieve outcomes (Perceived Control), the ability to select one’s thoughts and actions (cognitive control), the ability to regulate one’s feelings or attitudes toward something (emotional control), one’s ability to act on prescribed behaviors (motivational control), the amount of control one seeks within a relationship (control desire), the ability to inhibit thoughts or actions in favor of others (inhibitory control), selecting one’s social environment for one’s benefit (social control), the attempt to regulate impulses or attentional processes (Ego control), and the ability to regulate how much effort one invests into a goal (effortful control).

==Perceived control==

'''Perceived control''' in [[psychology]] is a “person’s belief  that he or she is capable of obtaining desired outcomes, avoiding undesired outcomes, and achieving goals.” High perceived control is associated with better health, relationships, and adjustment. Strategies for restoring perceived control are called '''Compensatory control strategies.'''&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Kay and Whitson. (2015). “Compensatory Control and the Appeal of a Structured World”. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Vol. 141, No. 3, p. 695&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control desire==

'''Control desire''' in the context of a sales relationship refers to the amount of control a customer wants within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Bachrach, Rapp, Grewal, and Beitelspacher. (2015).''Journal of Applied Psychology.''Vol. 100, No. 4, 1073-1088&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive control==

'''Cognitive control''' in psychology describes “the ability to control one’s thoughts and actions.” It is also known as ''controlled processing, executive attention, and supervisory attention''. Controlled behaviors are guided by maintenance, updating, and representing task goals, and inhibiting information irrelevant to the task goal.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Radvansky, Lorsbach and Armendarez. (2015). “Event Structure and Cognitive Control”. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology.''Vol. 41, No. 5, 1374-1387&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional control==

'''Emotional control''' is a term from the [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] [[psychology]] literature and refers to “the ability to self-manage or regulate attitudes and feelings that directly affect participant receptiveness to, and implementation of, training activities.”&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). “Intervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.” ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivational control==

'''Motivational control''' in [[psychology]] “refers to the [[Self-control|self-regulatory]] mechanism by which individuals are able to act on prescribed behaviors to implement training activities.” For example, a student who studies for an hour each morning for two months before a test, whether or not the student likes studying.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). “Intervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.” ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inhibitory control==

'''Inhibitory control or “IC”''' in [[psychology]] it refers to a type of [[self-control|self-regulation]] defined as “the ability to inhibit prepotent thoughts or actions flexibly, often in favor of a subdominant action, typically in goal-directed behavior”.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington and Lonigan. (2014). “Relations Between inhibitory Control and the Development of Academic Skills in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Meta-Analysis”. '' Developmental Psychology''. Vol. 50, No. 10, 2368.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two types of IC: hot and cold. Hot IC involves activities or tasks related to emotion regulation, and cold IC involves abstract activities or tasks.

==Social control==

'''Social control''' is [[learning psychology]] “refers to an individual’s skills in engaging the social environment in ways that help to support and reinforce his or her learning activities.”&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Oh, Le and Button. (2009). “Intervention Effects on College Performance and Retention as Mediated by Motivational, Emotional, and Social Control Factors: Integrated Meta-Analytic Path Analysis.” ''Journal of Applied Psychology'' Vol. 94, No. 5, 1163-1184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ego control==

'''Ego control''' in [[psychology]] refers to “the efforts of the individual to control ‘thoughts, emotions, impulses or appetites… task performances [and] attentional processes.’ ”&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, Murawski and Kucharski. (2008). “Using the Delay Discounting Task to test for failures in ego control in substance abusers.”''Psychoanalytic Psychology''Vol. 25, 3, 533-549&lt;/ref&gt; Failure of ego control is seen as a central problem in individuals who suffer from substance abuse disorders.

==Situational control==

'''Situational control''' in [[psychology]] is part of [[leadership psychology]] that refers to “the degree to which the situation provides the leader “with potential influence over the group’s behavior”.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, F.E. (1971). “Validation and extension of the contingency model of leadership effectiveness: A review of empirical findings. ''Psychological Bulletin'', '''76''', 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effortful control==

'''Effortful control''' in [[psychology]] refers to a type of [[Self-control|self regulation]]. It is a broader construct than inhibitory control, and encompasses working memory and attention shifting.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington and Lonigan. (2014). “Relations Between inhibitory Control and the Development of Academic Skills in Preschool and Kindergarten: A Meta-Analysis”. '' Developmental Psychology''. Vol. 50, No. 10, 2368-2379.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Method of capital punishment in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang until eventual death}}
[[File:Christ at the Cross - Cristo en la Cruz.jpg|thumb|''Christ at the Cross'' by [[Carl Bloch]], painting c. 1870]]
'''Crucifixion''' is a method of [[capital punishment]] in which the victim is tied or nailed to a large wooden beam and left to hang for several days until eventual death from exhaustion and [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name=josephus-jewishwars-5.11.1&gt;{{cite Josephus | PACEJ=1 | text=wars | bookno=5 | chap=11 | sec=1 |Perseus=1 | 1=J. | 2=BJ | 3=5.11.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=William D. |title=On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ |journal=JAMA |date=March 21, 1986 |volume=255 |issue=11 |pages=1455 |doi=10.1001/jama.1986.03370110077025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byard |first1=Roger W. |title=Forensic and historical aspects of crucifixion |journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology |date=March 5, 2016 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=206–208 |doi=10.1007/s12024-016-9758-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] is a central narrative in [[Christianity]], and the [[Christian cross|cross]] (sometimes [[crucifix|depicting Jesus nailed onto it]]) is the main religious symbol for many Christian churches.

==Terminology==
{{further|Cross#Name}}
Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: ''ana-stauro'' (ἀνασταυρόω), from ''stauros'', "stake", and ''apo-tumpanizo'' (ἀποτυμπανίζω) "crucify on a plank",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)potumpani%2Fzw&amp;highlight=crucify LSJ apotumpanizo] ἀποτυμπα^ν-ίζω (later ἀποτύμπα^ν-τυπ- UPZ119 (2nd century BC), POxy.1798.1.7), A. crucify on a plank, D.8.61,9.61:—Pass., Lys.13.56, D.19.137, Arist. Rh. 1383a5, Beros. ap. J.Ap.1.20. 2. generally, destroy, Plu.2.1049d.&lt;/ref&gt; together with ''anaskolopizo'' (ἀνασκολοπίζω "impale"). In earlier pre-Roman Greek texts ''anastauro'' usually means "impale".&lt;ref&gt;LSJ anastauro ἀνασταυρ-όω, = foreg., Hdt.3.125, 6.30, al.; identical with ἀνασκολοπίζω, 9.78:—Pass., Th. 1.110, Pl.Grg.473c.

Polybius. Theodorus Büttner-Wobst after L. Dindorf. Leipzig. Teubner. 1893-.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Testament Greek uses four verbs, three of them based upon ''stauros'' (σταυρός), usually translated "cross". The most common term is ''stauroo'' (σταυρόω), "to crucify", occurring 43 times; ''sustauroo'' (συσταυρόω), "to crucify with" or "alongside" occurs five times, while ''anastauroo'' (ἀνασταυρόω), "to crucify again" occurs only once at the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:6. ''prospegnumi'' (προσπήγνυμι), "to fix or fasten to, impale, crucify" occurs only once at the Acts of the Apostles 2:23.

The English term ''[[cross]]'' derives from the Latin word ''crux''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cross |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "cross" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term ''crux'' classically referred to a tree or any construction of wood used to hang criminals as a form of execution. The term later came to refer specifically to a cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcrux Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'':] crux, ŭcis, f. (m., Enn. ap. Non. p. 195, 13; Gracch. ap. Fest. s. v. masculino, p. 150, 24, and 151, 12 Müll.) [perh. kindred with circus].

The English term ''[[crucifix]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''crucifixus'' or ''cruci fixus'', past participle passive of ''crucifigere'' or ''cruci figere'', meaning "to crucify" or "to fasten to a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/crucify |title=Collins English Dictionary, "crucify" |publisher=Collins |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crucify?view=uk |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary, "crucify" |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websters.yourdictionary.com/crucify |title=Webster New World College Dictionary, "crucify" |work=yourdictionary.com/ |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crucify |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "crucify"|publisher=Etymonline.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santo_Spirito,_sagrestia,_crocifisso_di_michelangelo_04.JPG|thumb|This crucifix is attributed to [[Michelangelo]], notable for showing naked crucifixion.]]
Crucifixion was most often performed to dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating similar (usually particularly heinous) crimes. Victims were sometimes left on display after death as a warning to any other potential criminals. Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term ''excruciating'', literally "out of crucifying"), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.

The Greek and Latin words corresponding to "crucifixion" applied to many different forms of painful execution, including [[impalement|being impaled on a stake]], or affixed to a tree, upright pole (a [[crux simplex]]), or (most famous now) to a combination of an upright (in Latin, ''stipes'') and a crossbeam (in Latin, ''patibulum''). [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/sen.consolatione2.shtml+stipitem+patibulo|title=Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", 6.20.3 |publisher=[[The Latin Library]] |language=la|author=|date=|website=googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam to the place of execution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cross and Crucifixion |volume=7 |page=506 |first=Thomas Macall |last=Fallow |authorlink=Thomas Macall Fallow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A whole cross would weigh well over 135&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=Mississippi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=DA|title=The crucifixion and death of a man called Jesus|journal=Journal of the Mississippi State Medical Association|year=1989|volume=30|issue=3|pages=77–83|pmid=2651675}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the [[Esquiline Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann2.shtml#32 |title=Annales 2:32.2 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ann15.shtml#60 |title=Annales 15:60.1 |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.

The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails and other sharp materials are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian [[Josephus]], where he states that at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)]], "the soldiers out of rage and hatred, ''nailed'' those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flavius|first1=Josephus|title=Jewish War, Book V Chapter 11|url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-5.htm|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as [[amulets]] with perceived medicinal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna, Shabbath 6.10: see [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C&amp;pg=PA182 David W. Chapman, ''Ancient Jewish and Christian Perceptions of Crucifixion''] (Mohn Siebeck 2008 {{ISBN|978-31-6149579-3}}), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Although artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, the person being crucified was usually stripped naked. Writings by [[Seneca the Younger]] state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin.&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946"&gt;Seneca, Dialogue "To Marcia on Consolation", in ''Moral Essays'', 6.20.3, trans. John W. Basore, The Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1946) 2:69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Of Consolation: To Marcia#XX.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape criticism by some eminent Roman orators. [[Cicero]], for example, described crucifixion as "a most cruel and disgusting punishment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Licona|first=Michael|title=The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach|year=2010|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-2719-0|oclc=620836940|authorlink=Michael Licona|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that "the very mention of the cross should be far removed not only from a Roman citizen's body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Colleen M.|title=Behold the Man: Jesus and Greco-Roman Masculinity |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532532-4|page=67}} (citing Cicero, ''pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo'' [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Cic.%20Rab.%20Perd.%2019 5.16]).&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he says, "It is a crime to bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is a wickedness; to put him to death is almost parricide. What shall I say of crucifying him? So guilty an action cannot by any possibility be adequately expressed by any name bad enough for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0018:text=Ver.:actio=2:book=5:section=170|title=M.

Frequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called ''crurifragium'', which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves.&lt;ref name="Wine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koskenniemi|first=Erkki|author2=Kirsi Nisula|author3=Jorma Toppari|title=Wine Mixed with Myrrh (Mark 15.23) and Crurifragium (John 19.31-32): Two Details of the Passion Narratives|journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament|volume=27|issue=4|pages=379–391|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2005|url=http://jnt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/27/4/379|doi=10.1177/0142064X05055745|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to [[Punishment#Deterrence (prevention)|deter]] those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.&lt;ref name="Wine"/&gt;

The [[gibbet]] on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes. [[Josephus]] describes several tortures and positions of crucifixion during the [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as [[Titus]] crucified the rebels;&lt;ref name=josephus-jewishwars-5.11.1/&gt; and [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946"/&gt;

At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin ''crux simplex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBOqGJc6tpcC&amp;pg=PA78 |first=William |last=Barclay |title=The Apostles' Creed |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-664-25826-9 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (''crux commissa'') or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (''crux immissa'').&lt;ref&gt;"The&amp;nbsp;... oldest depiction of a crucifixion&amp;nbsp;... was uncovered by archaeologists more than a century ago on the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome. It is a second-century [[graffiti]] scratched into a wall that was part of the imperial palace complex. It includes a caption&amp;nbsp;— not by a Christian, but by someone taunting and deriding Christians and the crucifixions they underwent. It shows crude [[stick figure|stick-figures]] of a boy reverencing his 'God', who has the head of a [[donkey|jackass]] and is upon a cross with arms spread wide and with hands nailed to the crossbeam. Here we have a Roman sketch of a Roman crucifixion, and it is in the traditional cross shape." Clayton F. Bower, Jr. [http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9110fea1.asp "Cross or Torture Stake?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion depicts an individual on a T-shaped cross. It is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of [[Trajan]] or [[Hadrian]] (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John Granger|year=2012|title=Crucifixion as Spectacle in Roman Campania|journal=Novum Testamentum|volume=54|issue=1|pages=60, 92–98|jstor=23253630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 2nd-century writers took it for granted that a crucified person's arms would be stretched out, not connected to a single stake: [[Lucian]] speaks of [[Prometheus]] as crucified "above the ravine with his hands outstretched" and explains that the letter T (the Greek letter [[tau]]) was looked upon as an unlucky letter or sign (similar to the way the number thirteen is looked upon today as an unlucky number), saying that the letter got its "evil significance" because of the "evil instrument" which had that shape, an instrument on which tyrants crucified people. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es argue that Jesus was crucified on a ''crux simplex'', and that the ''crux immissa'' was first used as a Christian symbol near the time of the supposed conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do Watch Tower publications show Jesus on a stake with hands over his head instead of on the traditional cross?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101989219|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.

The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year AD 100 on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau)&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[wikisource:Epistle of Barnabas#Chapter 9|Chapter 9]]. The document no doubt belongs to the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd century.[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas-intro.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright.&lt;ref&gt;"The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails" ([[Irenaeus]] (c. 130–202), ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' II, xxiv, 4 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165) [[Dialogue with Trypho]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xc.html "Chapter XC – The stretched-out hands of Moses signified beforehand the cross"], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xci.html "Chapter XCI"] "For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn." &lt;br&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.cxi.html "Chapter CXI"] "stretching out his hands, remained till evening on the hill, his hands being supported; and this reveals a type of no other thing than of the cross"&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of {{bibleverse||John|20:25}} the wounds are described as being "in his hands"), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word "χείρ", usually translated as "hand", could refer to the entire portion of the arm below the elbow,&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Homeric Greek]] of the [[Iliad]] XX, 478–480, a spear-point is said to have pierced the χεῖρ "where the sinews of the elbow join" (ἵνα τε ξενέχουσι τένοντες / ἀγκῶνος, τῇ τόν γε φίλης διὰ χειρὸς ἔπειρεν / αἰχμῇ χακλκείῃ).&lt;/ref&gt; and to denote the ''hand'' as distinct from the ''arm'' some other word could be added, as "ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα" (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., "he wounded her in the hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|xe/ir|χείρ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and the [[ulna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Wynne-Jones |title=Why the BBC thinks Christ did not die this way |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/16/nrowan216.xml |work= |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7291066/#storyContinued/ |title=a brief news article|publisher=MSNBC|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that nailed feet provided enough support for the body, and that the hands could have been merely tied. Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.

Another possibility, suggested by [[Frederick Zugibe]], is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the [[carpal tunnel]].

A foot-rest (''suppedaneum'') attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the [[Alexamenos graffito]], the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The beauty of the cross: the passion of Christ in theology and the arts, from the catacombs to the eve of the Renaissance |last=Viladesau |first=Richard|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518811-0|oclc=58791208|page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cTFh4tm9cMwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources also mention the ''sedile'', a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=905&amp;letter=C|title=Crucifixion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=2018-03-06|first1=Kaufmann|last1=Kohler|first2=Emil G.|last2=Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have served a similar purpose.

In 1968, archaeologists discovered at [[Giv'at ha-Mivtar]] in northeast [[Jerusalem]] the remains of one [[Jehohanan]], who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.53&amp;nbsp;inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf|title=Some Notes on Crucifixion|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-19|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110718171841/http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C David W.

A theory attributed to [[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]] holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/barbet.html|title=Columbia University page of Pierre Barbet on Crucifixion|author=|date=|website=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by the arms, leading to [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]], or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. Some scholars, including [[Frederick Zugibe]], posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zugibe|first=Frederick T|authorlink=Frederick Zugibe|title=The cross and the shroud: a medical inquiry into the crucifixion|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|year=1988|isbn=0-913729-75-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zugibe, Frederick T. |title=The Crucifixion Of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry |publisher=M. Evans and Company |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59077-070-6}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death. However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet is not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1420788|pmid=16574970|doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.4.185|volume=99|issue=4|title=Medical theories on the cause of death in crucifixion|year=2006|journal=J R Soc Med|pages=185–8|last1=Maslen|first1=MW|last2=Mitchell|first2=PD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survival===
Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year [[#As a devotional practice|as a devotional practice]] to be non-lethally crucified.

There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. [[Josephus]] recounts: "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to [[Titus]], and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/autobiog.htm The Life Of Flavius Josephus], 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.

==Archaeological evidence==
Although the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources,{{which|date=June 2015}} refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a [[Jehohanan|crucified body]] dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus. This was discovered at [[Givat HaMivtar]], Jerusalem in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Tzaferis, V. 1970 Jewish Tombs at and near Giv'at ha-Mivtar. Israel Exploration Journal Vol. 20 pp. 18-32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved. The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.

The remains were found accidentally in an [[ossuary]] with the crucified man's name on it, '[[Jehohanan]], the son of Hagakol'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Nicu.

Maier|publisher=Google Books|isbn=978-0-8254-3329-0|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.

Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.

Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position. However, many of Haas' findings have been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic – and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion – while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Zias J. &amp; Sekeles, E. |year=1985 |title=The Crucified Man from Giv'at ha-Mivtar: A Reappraisal. |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |issue=35 |pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and religious texts==
===Pre-Roman states===
Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by [[Achaemenid Persia|Persians]], [[Carthaginians]], and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]].

The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/Stavros.html Stavros, Scolops (σταῦρός, σκόλοψ). The cross;] encyclopedia Hellinica&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''Histories'', ix.120–122, the Greek writer [[Herodotus]] describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: "They nailed him to a plank and hung him up&amp;nbsp;... this [[Artayctes]] who suffered death by crucifixion."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Aubrey de Selincourt. The original, "σανίδα προσπασσαλεύσαντες, ἀνεκρέμασαν&amp;nbsp;... Τούτου δὲ τοῦ Ἀρταύκτεω τοῦ ἀνακρεμασθέντος&amp;nbsp;...", is translated by Henry Cary (Bohn's Classical Library: ''Herodotus Literally Translated''. London, G. Bell and Sons 1917, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–592) as: "They nailed him to a plank and hoisted him aloft&amp;nbsp;... this Artayctes who was hoisted aloft".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Commentary on Herodotus'' by How and Wells remarks: "They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling."&lt;ref&gt;W.W. How and J. Wells, ''A Commentary on Herodotus'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1912), vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian [[theologian]]s, beginning with [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] writing in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Gal|3:13}}, have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|21:22-23}}. This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with [[lynching]] or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;See Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7:1, translated in Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation 591 (1988), supra note 8, at 595-96 (indicating that court ordered execution by stoning, burning, decapitation, or strangulation only)&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: "God ... (partially legible)-''will set'' ... right errors. ... (partially legible)-''He will judge'' ... revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-''crucifixion'' ... Let not the nail touch him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/scrolls_deadsea/uncovered/uncovered05.htm Levi,''Aramaic Testament of Levi'' 4Q541 column 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish king [[Alexander Jannaeus]], king of Judea from 103 BC to 76 BC, crucified 800 rebels, said to be [[Pharisees]], in the middle of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbpSjsz_uY8C&amp;pg=PA46 |first=Wenhua |last=Shi |title=Paul's Message of the Cross As Body Language |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-16-149706-3 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2g7hBhKI31QC&amp;pg=PA110 |first=James C. |last=VanderKam |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Bible |publisher=Eerdmans |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-8028-6679-0 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] is reputed to have crucified 2,000 survivors from his [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege]] of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t09.html Quintus Curtius Rufus, ''History of Alexander the Great of Macedonia'' 4.4.21]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander's friend [[Hephaestion]]. Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified [[Callisthenes]], his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander's adoption of the Persian ceremony of [[Proskynesis|royal adoration]].

In [[Carthage]], crucifixion was an established mode of execution, which could even be imposed on generals for suffering a major defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-VlDC4Jt6gC&amp;pg=PT92&amp;lpg=PT92|first=Richard A.|last=Gabriel |title=Hannibal |publisher=Potomac Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-59797-766-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGQBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA302|first=Henry George|last=Liddell|title=A History of Rome|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1855|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_pZEpbG498C&amp;pg=PA23|first=Robin|last=Waterfield|title=Polybius.

The oldest crucifixion may be a post-mortem one mentioned by [[Herodotus]]. [[Polycrates]], the tyrant of [[Samos]], was put to death in 522 B.C. by Persians, and his dead body was then crucified.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'', {{Herodotus|en|3|125}} ("Having killed him in some way not fit to be told, Oroetes then crucified him")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===

==== History ====
The hypothesis that the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of ''arbori suspendere''—hanging on an ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|arbor infelix]]'' ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the ''supplicium more maiorum'', punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/TAPA/39/Supplicium_de_More_Maiorum*.html|title=Livy I.26 and the Supplicium de More Maiorum|publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=200&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tertullian&amp;URL=http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticus.htm |title=''Apologia'', IX, 1 |publisher=Grtbooks.com|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Seneca the Younger]] earlier used the phrase ''infelix lignum'' (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross.&lt;ref&gt;After quoting a poem by [[Maecenas]] that speaks of preferring life to death even when life is burdened with all the disadvantages of old age or even with acute torture ("vel acuta si sedeam cruce"), Seneca disagrees with the sentiment, saying death would be better for a crucified person hanging from the patibulum: "I should deem him most despicable had he wished to live to the point of crucifixion&amp;nbsp;... Is it worth so much to weigh down upon one's own wound, and hang stretched out from a patibulum?&amp;nbsp;... Is anyone found who, after being fastened to that accursed wood, already weakened, already deformed, swelling with ugly weals on shoulders and chest, with many reasons for dying even before getting to the cross, would wish to prolong a life-breath that is about to experience so many torments?" ("Contemptissimum putarem, si vivere vellet usque ad crucem&amp;nbsp;... Est tanti vulnus suum premere et patibulo pendere districtum&amp;nbsp;... Invenitur, qui velit adactus ad illud infelix lignum, iam debilis, iam pravus et in foedum scapularum ac pectoris tuber elisus, cui multae moriendi causae etiam citra crucem fuerant, trahere animam tot tormenta tracturam?" - [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep17-18.shtml Letter 101, 12-14])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plautus]] and [[Plutarch]] are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibula to the upright ''stipes''.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Maccius Plautus ''Miles gloriosus'' Mason Hammond, Arthur M. Mack - 1997 Page 109, "The patibulum (in the next line) was a crossbar which the convicted criminal carried on his shoulders, with his arms fastened to it, to the place for&amp;nbsp;... Hoisted up on an upright post, the patibulum became the crossbar of the cross"&lt;/ref&gt;

Notorious mass crucifixions followed the [[Third Servile War]] in 73–71 BC (the slave rebellion under [[Spartacus]]), other [[Roman civil wars]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in AD 70.

==== Process ====
Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding [[centurion]] and his soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; First, the condemned would be stripped naked&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Doctor at Calvary: The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ as Described by a Surgeon|last=Barbet|first=P|publisher=Doubleday Image Books|year=1953|isbn=|location=New York|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flagellation|scourged.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would cause the person to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (''patibulum'' in [[Latin]]) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the death march, the prisoner, probably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cross and Crucifixion|volume=7|page=506|first=Thomas Macall|last=Fallow|authorlink=Thomas Macall Fallow}} Macall believes that the person would be given back his or her clothing following the scourging.&lt;/ref&gt; still [[nude]] after the scourging,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; would be led through the most crowded streets&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cojs.org/joe-zias-crucifixion-in-antiquity-the-anthropological-evidence/|title=Crucifixion in Antiquity: The Anthropological Evidence|last=Zias|first=Joseph|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310074322/http://cojs.org/joe-zias-crucifixion-in-antiquity-the-anthropological-evidence/|archive-date=2018-03-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing a ''titulus'' — a sign board proclaiming the prisoner's name and crime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Upon arrival at the place of execution, selected to be especially public,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joezias.com:80/MelGibsonControversy.htm|title=Postscript - The Mel Gibson Controversy|last=Zias|first=Joseph|date=|website=JoeZias.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306140009/http://www.joezias.com:80/MelGibsonControversy.htm|archive-date=2004-03-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the convict would be stripped of any remaining clothing, then nailed to the cross naked.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; If the crucifixion took place in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (''stipes'') might be permanently embedded in the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, the condemned person's wrists would first be nailed to the ''patibulum'', and then he or she would be hoisted off the ground with ropes to hang from the elevated ''patibulum'' while it was fastened to the ''stipes''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Next the feet or ankles would be nailed to the upright stake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately {{convert|5|to|7|in|cm}} long, with a square shaft {{convert|3/8|in|mm|0}} across.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''titulus'' would also be fastened to the cross to notify onlookers of the person's name and crime as they hung on the cross, further maximizing the public impact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There may have been considerable variation in the position in which prisoners were nailed to their crosses and how their bodies were supported while they died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some [[Impalement|impale]] their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."&lt;ref name="Seneca 1946" /&gt; One source claims that for Jews (apparently not for others), a man would be crucified with his back to the cross as is traditionally depicted, while a woman would be nailed facing her cross, probably with her back to onlookers, or at least with the ''stipes'' providing some semblance of [[modesty]] if viewed from the front.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Such concessions were "unique" and not made outside a Jewish context.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Several sources mention some sort of seat fastened to the ''stipes'' to help support the person's body,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Justin Martyr ''Dialogue with Trypho, a Jew'' 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus ''Against Heresies'' II.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''To the Nations'' I.12&lt;/ref&gt; thereby prolonging the person's [[suffering]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and humiliation&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; by preventing the [[asphyxia]]tion caused by hanging without support. Justin Martyr calls the seat a ''cornu'', or "horn,"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; leading some scholars to believe it may have had a pointed shape designed to torment the crucified person.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet, 45; Zugibe, 57; Vassilios Tzaferis, “Crucifixion—The Archaeological Evidence,” ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' 11.1 (Jan./Feb. 1985), 44-53 (p. 49)&lt;/ref&gt; This would be consistent with Seneca's observation of victims with their private parts impaled.

In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die, but death was sometimes hastened by human action. "The attending Roman guards could leave the site only after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim."&lt;ref name="patho" /&gt; The Romans sometimes broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the other hand, the person was often deliberately kept alive as long as possible to prolong their suffering and humiliation, so as to provide the maximum deterrent effect.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and be eaten by animals.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Jesus became God: The exaltation of a Jewish preacher from Galilee|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart D.|date=2014|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0061778186|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=133–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one condemned to crucifixion died in prison, his body was pickled and the punishment executed on the dead body. Under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], one of the great 16th-century unifiers, crucifixion upside down (i.e, ''sakasaharitsuke'') was frequently used. Water crucifixion (''mizuharitsuke'') awaited mostly Christians: a cross was raised at low tide; when the high tide came, the convict was submerged under water up to the head, prolonging death for many days}}

[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Twenty Six Martyrs of Japan]]
In 1597 [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|twenty-six]] [[Christian]] Martyrs were nailed to crosses at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan. Among those executed were Saints [[Paulo Miki]], [[Philip of Jesus]] and [[Pedro Bautista]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Franciscan]] who had worked about ten years in the [[Philippines]]. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of [[Japanese Martyrs|persecution of Christianity in Japan]], which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.

Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during [[World War II]]. [[Ringer Edwards]], an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.

{{quotation|Four or five persons, after being nailed through their hands and feet to a scaffold, had first their tongues cut out, then their mouths slit open from ear to ear, then their ears cut off, and finally their bellies ripped open.

Six people were crucified in the following manner: their hands and feet nailed to a scaffold; then their eyes were extracted with a blunt hook; and in this condition they were left to expire; two died in the course of four days; the rest were liberated, but died of mortification on the sixth or seventh day.

Four persons were crucified, viz. not nailed but tied with their hands and feet stretched out at full length, in an erect posture. In this posture they were to remain till death; every thing they wished to eat was ordered them with a view to prolong their lives and misery. In cases like this, the legs and feet of the criminals begin to swell and mortify at the expiration of three or four days; some are said to live in this state for a fortnight, and expire at last from fatigue and mortification. Those which I saw, were liberated at the end of three or four days.}}

Most recently, in March 2013, a robber was set to be executed by being crucified for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Saudi seven face crucifixion and firing squad for armed robbery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/saudi-seven-crucifixion-armed-robbery|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 March 2013|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the method was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=AP|title=Saudi Arabia Reportedly Executes 7 Men Convicted of Robbery by Firing Squad Skipping Originally Planned Crucifixion|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/13/saudi-arabia-reportedly-executes-7-men-convicted-of-robbery-by-firing-squad-skipping-originally-planned-crucifixion|newspaper=[[The Blaze]]|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jihadism===
On 5 February 2015 the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) reported that the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) had committed "several cases of mass executions of boys, as well as reports of beheadings, crucifixions of children and burying children alive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CBS News|title=ISIS is killing, torturing and raping children in Iraq, U.N. says|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-is-killing-torturing-and-raping-children-in-iraq-u-n-says/|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2014 [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic extremists]] carried out a total of seven public executions in [[Raqqa]], northern [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death and desecration in Syria: Jihadist group 'crucifies' bodies to send message |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/01/world/meast/syria-bodies-crucifixions/index.html?hpt=hp_c1|accessdate=May 2, 2014|agency=CNN/Associated Press|date=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures, originally posted to [[Twitter]] by a student at [[Oxford University]], were retweeted by a Twitter account owned by a known member of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) causing major media outlets to incorrectly attribute the crucifixions to the militant group.&lt;ref name=TDB-Extremists&gt;{{cite news|last=Siegel|first=Jacob|title=Islamic Extremists Now Crucifying People in Syria—and Tweeting Out the Pictures|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/30/islamic-extremists-now-crucifying-people-in-syria-and-tweeting-out-the-pictures.html|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=30 April 2014|quote=CORRECTION: This story misidentified the origin of a tweet and attributed it to an ISIS member when it actually came from Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a student at Oxford University who has no affiliation with ISIS.

===Other terrorist incidents===
The human rights group Karen Women Organization documented a case of [[Tatmadaw]] forces crucifying several [[Karen people|Karen]] villagers in 2000 in the [[Dooplaya District]] in [[Burma]]'s [[Kayin State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karenwomen.org/Reports/WalkingAmongstSharpKnives.pdf|title=Walking amongst sharp knives |date=February 2010 |work= |publisher=Karen Women Organization|accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110421224711/http://www.karenwomen.org/Reports/WalkingAmongstSharpKnives.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/35194/regime-human-rights|title=Regime's human rights abuses go unpunished|date=28 March 2010|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2014, an anti-government activist and member of [[AutoMaidan]] was kidnapped by unknown parties and tortured for a week. His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut off a piece of his ear, and nailed him to a cross. His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside [[Kiev]] after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian protestor shows scars where he was nailed to a cross when he was crucified by government supporters 'and forced to declare he was a US spy'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2553159/Ukrainian-protestor-shows-scars-nailed-cross-crucified-government-supporters-forced-declare-US-spy.html|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a video surfaced depicting members of the [[Azov Battalion]], an official regiment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, allegedly crucifying a separatist rebel of [[Novorossiya (confederation)|Novorossiya]] and burning him alive. Therein they declare, "all the separatists, traitors of Ukraine and militia fighters [sic] will be treated the same". The Azov Battalion is [[Azov Battalion#Organisation#Neo-Nazi ideology and symbols|associated with neo-Nazism]] and flaunts symbols associated with the SS such as the [[wolfsangel]] and [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|black sun]]. They allegedly sent the video to the pro-Russian [[hacktivist]] organization CyberBerkut, which responded by threatening to take no Ukrainian Army soldiers or militia fighters as prisoners from then on. The authenticity of this video is unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian neo-nazis from Azov batallion burned alive a Novorossia resistance fighter on a cross (video 18+)|url=http://www.fort-russ.com/2015/04/ukrainian-neo-nazis-from-azov-batallion.html|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=Fort Russ|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] frowns upon self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: "Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html Directory on Popular Piety 144] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623013300/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html|date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the practice is not unknown.

In the [[Philippines]], some Catholics are [[Crucifixion in the Philippines|voluntarily, non-lethally crucified]] for a limited time on [[Good Friday]] to imitate the sufferings of Christ. Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, while there is a footrest to which the feet are nailed. Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in [[Pampanga]], vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiousfreaks.com/2006/04/12/man-crucifies-himself-every-good-friday/|title=Man Crucifies Himself Every Good Friday|publisher=Religious Freaks|date=2006-04-12|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[San Pedro Cutud]], [[Ruben Enaje]] has been crucified 27 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filipino devotees reenact Christ's crucifixion on Good Friday|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/filipino-devotees-reenact-christ-crucifixion-good-friday-article-1.1302347|accessdate=January 22, 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=March 29, 2013|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Church in the Philippines]] has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-[[flagellation]], while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees. The [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] insists that participants in the rites should have [[tetanus]] shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-540453/Boy-15-nailed-cross-Filipinos-whip-crucify-gory-Good-Friday-ritual.html|title=Boy, 15, nailed to a cross as Filipinos whip and crucify themselves in gory Good Friday ritual |accessdate = November 6, 2010|location=London|work=Daily Mail|date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, a crucifixion is only simulated within a [[passion play]], as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]], on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]], since 1833,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257|title=Religion-Mexico: The Passion According to Iztapalapa|publisher=IPS News|accessdate=2009-12-19|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20091226173652/http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23257|archivedate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the more famous [[Oberammergau Passion Play]]. Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of [[flagellants]] in [[New Mexico]], called ''Hermanos de Luz'' ("Brothers of Light"), have annually conducted reenactments of Christ's crucifixion during [[Holy Week]], in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aragon |first1=Ray John De |title=The Penitentes of New Mexico: Hermanos de la Luz |date=2006 |publisher=Sunstone Press |isbn=9780865345041 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noimuXOCtFgC&amp;pg=pa58 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous crucifixions==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
*The rebel slaves of the [[Third Servile War]]: Between 73 BC and 71 BC a band of slaves, eventually numbering about 120,000, under the (at least partial) leadership of [[Spartacus]] were in open revolt against the [[Roman republic]]. The rebellion was eventually crushed and, while Spartacus himself most likely died in the final battle of the revolt, approximately 6,000 of his followers were crucified along the 200&amp;nbsp;km [[Appian Way]] between Capua and Rome as a warning to any other would-be rebels.
* [[Jehohanan]]: Jewish man who was crucified around the same time as Jesus of Nazareth and it is widely accepted that his ankles were nailed to the side of the ''stipes'' of the cross 
*[[Jesus of Nazareth]]: his [[crucifixion of Jesus|death by crucifixion]] under [[Pontius Pilate]] (c. AD 30 or 33), recounted in the four 1st-century canonical [[Gospel]]s, is referred to repeatedly as something well known in the earlier letters of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], for instance, five times in his First Letter to the Corinthians, written in 57 AD (1:13, 1:18, 1:23, 2:2, 2:8). Pilate was the Roman governor of [[Iudaea province]] at the time, and he is explicitly linked with the condemnation of Jesus not only by the Gospels but also by [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annals'', 15.44.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus]] for details). The civil charge was a claim to be [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]].
*[[Saint Peter]]: Christian apostle, who according to tradition was crucified upside-down at his own request (hence the [[Cross of St. Peter]]), because he did not feel worthy enough to die the same way as Jesus.
*[[Saint Andrew]]: Christian apostle and [[Saint Peter]]'s brother, who is traditionally said to have been crucified on an X-shaped cross (hence the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]]).
*[[Simeon of Jerusalem]]: second [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]], crucified in either 106 or 107.
*[[Mani (prophet)|Mani]]: the founder of [[Manicheanism]], he was depicted by followers as having died by crucifixion in 274 AD.
*[[Eulalia of Barcelona]] was venerated as a saint. According to her hagiography, she was stripped naked, tortured, and ultimately crucified on an X-shaped cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friesen |first1=Ilse E. |title=The Female Crucifix: Images of St. Wilgefortis Since the Middle Ages |date=2006 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

*[[Wilgefortis]] was venerated as a saint and represented as a crucified woman, however her legend comes from a misinterpretation of a full-clothed crucifix known as the [[Volto Santo of Lucca]].

A '''diagram''' is a symbolic [[Depiction|representation]] of [[information]] according to some [[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] technique. Diagrams have been used since ancient times, but became more prevalent during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178–196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, the technique uses a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] visualization which is then [[graphical projection|projected]] onto a two-dimensional surface. The word ''[[graphics|graph]]'' is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for diagram.

== Overview ==
The term "diagram" in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning: 
* ''visual information device'' : Like the term "[[illustration]]", "diagram" is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including [[graphics|graphs]], technical drawings and [[table (information)|tables]].&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt;
* ''specific kind of visual display'' : This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.

In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: "diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and [[map]]s, [[line graph]]s, [[bar chart]]s, [[engineering]] [[blueprint]]s, and [[architect]]s' [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not".&lt;ref name="MA97"&gt;Michael Anderson (1997). "Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning," at ''cs.hartford.edu.'' Retrieved 21 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically "abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent".&lt;ref name= "RKL 93"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lowe |first=Richard K. |year=1993 |title=Diagrammatic information: techniques for exploring its mental representation and processing |journal=Information Design Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–18 |doi=10.1075/idj.7.1.01low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with [[computer graphics]], technical illustrations, [[infographics]], maps, and [[technical drawing]]s, by showing "abstract rather than [[literal translation|literal]] representations of information".&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee E. |last=Brasseur |authorlink=Lee E. Brasseur |title=Visualizing technical information: a cultural critique |publisher=Baywood Pub |location=Amityville, N.Y |year=2003 |isbn=0-89503-240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of a diagram can be seen as:&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt;
* a ''form'' of visual [[Content format|format]]ting devices
* a ''display'' that does not show [[quantitative data]] (numerical data), but rather relationships and abstract information
* with ''building blocks'' such as geometrical shapes connected by [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[arrow]]s, or other visual links.
Or in Hall's (1996) words "diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning".&lt;ref name="BSH96"&gt;Bert S. Hall (1996). "The Didactic and the Elegant: Some Thoughts on Scientific and Technological Illustrations in the Middle Ages and Renaissance". in: B. Braigie (ed.) ''Picturing knowledge: historical and philosophical problems concerning the use of art in science''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; These simplified figures are often based on a set of rules. The basic shape according to White (1984) can be characterized in terms of "elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity".&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt; Elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is "the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Jan V. |title=Using charts and graphs: 1000 ideas for visual persuasion |publisher=Bowker |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-8352-1894-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main diagram types ==
There are at least the following types of diagrams:
*[[Chart]]-like diagrams, which take a collection of items and relationships between them, and express them by giving each item a 2D position, while the relationships are expressed as connections between the items or overlaps between the items; examples of such techniques:

{|style="width:100%"

Many of these types of diagrams are commonly generated using diagramming software such as [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] and [[Gliffy]]. Thousands of diagram techniques exist.  Some more examples follow.

Diagrams may also be classified according to use or purpose, for example, explanatory and/or [[how to]] diagrams.

{{About|dignity as a matter of philosophy, religion, human rights, law and medicine}}

'''Dignity''' is the [[Rights|right]] of a person to be valued and respected for their own sake, and to be treated ethically. It is of significance in [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[law]] and [[politics]] as an extension of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concepts of [[Inalienable right#Debate|inherent, inalienable rights]]. The term may also be used to describe personal conduct, as in "behaving with dignity".

== Etymology ==
The English word "dignity", attested from the early 13th century, comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''dignitas'' (worthiness)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
by way of [[French language|French]] ''dignité''.&lt;ref name = "DIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dignity|title=Dignity - Define Dignity at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
English-speakers often use the word "dignity" in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example, in politics it can be used to critique the treatment of oppressed and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, and even to animals used for food or research.

"Dignity" also has descriptive meanings pertaining to the ''worth'' of human beings. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.&lt;ref name="Shultziner, D. Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings. Global Jurist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|title=Human Dignity - Functions and Meanings|journal=Global Jurist|date=2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–21|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doron_Shultziner/publication/241002874_Human_Dignity_Functions_and_Meanings/links/00b7d522ad17e53070000000.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordinary modern usage, the word denotes "respect" and "status", and it is often used to suggest that someone is not receiving a proper degree of respect, or even that they are failing to treat themselves with proper self-respect. There is also a long history of special [[philosophical]] use of this term. However, it is rarely defined outright in political, legal, and scientific discussions.  International proclamations have thus far left dignity undefined,&lt;ref&gt;
"Those provisions concerning human dignity have not been authoritatively interpreted or applied by any of the competent, independent, international institutions." Bartha Maria Knoppers, ''Human Dignity and Genetic Heritage: Study Paper'' (Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1991), note, at 23. None of the international proclamations make dignity the rare quality that some commentators say it should be.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980), note, at 376.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and scientific commentators, such as those arguing against genetic research and [[algeny]], cite dignity as a reason but are ambiguous about its application.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Comment added 29 March 2011: I searched through several major libraries including Harvard and the US Library of Congress, and did not find this title&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Aldergrove says dignity means ''the set of attributes that distinguish an intelligent, solemn, sober, healthy, independent, adult homo sapiens (the model adult) from someone else, especially a young child or a lunatic''. J. R. Aldergrove, ''Why We Are Not Obsolete Yet: Genetics, Algeny, and the Future'' (Stentorian: Burnaby, 2000) at 71.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- hiding ref for the moment&lt;ref&gt; Thurber says dignity "has gleamed only now and then and here and there, in lonely splendor, throughout the ages, a hope of the better men, never an achievement of the majority."

(Harper &amp; Row, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Violations ==

=== Categories ===
Human dignity can be violated in multiple ways.  The main categories of violations are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Humiliation, Degradation, Dehumanization: Human Dignity Violated | isbn=9789048196616 | editors=Paulus Kaufmann, Hannes Kuch, Christian Neuhäuser, and Elaine Webster | publisher=Springer }} &lt;!-- Entire book, but especially pages 51–52, 151, 168 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Humiliation]]
Violations of human dignity in terms of humiliation refer to acts that humiliate or diminish the self-worth of a person or a group. Acts of humiliation are context dependent but we normally have an intuitive understanding where such a violation occurs. As Schachter noted, “it has been generally assumed that a violation of human dignity can be recognized even if the abstract term cannot be defined. ‘I know it when I see it even if I cannot tell you what it is’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=Oskar|title=Human dignity as a normative concept|journal=American Journal of International Law|date=1983|volume=77|issue=4|page=849|doi=10.2307/2202536|jstor=2202536}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, etymology of the word “humiliation” has a universal characteristic in the sense that in all languages the word involves “downward spatial orientation” in which “something or someone is pushed down and forcefully held there”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linder|first1=Evelin|title=Making enemies: Humiliation and international conflict|date=2006|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is common in judicial decisions where judges refer to violations of human dignity as injuries to people's self-worth or their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shultziner|first1=Doron|last2=Rabinovici|first2=Itai|title=Human Dignity, Self-Worth and Humiliation: A Comparative Legal–Psychological Approach|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105|doi=10.1037/a0024585}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Instrumentalization or [[objectification]]
This aspect refers to treating a person as an instrument or as means to achieve some other goal. This approach builds on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s moral imperative stipulating that we should treat people as ends or goals in themselves, namely as having ultimate moral worth which should not be instrumentalized.  
* Degradation
Violations of human dignity as degradation refer to acts that degrade the value of human beings. These are acts that, even if done by consent, convey a message that diminishes the importance or value of all human beings. They consist of practices that human beings should not be subjected to, regardless of whether subjective humiliation is involved, such as selling oneself to slavery, or when a state authority deliberately puts prisoners in inhuman living conditions. 
* [[Dehumanization]]
These are acts that strip a person or a group of their human characteristics. It may involve describing or treating them as animals or as a lower type of human beings. This has occurred in genocides such as the Holocaust and in Rwanda where the minority were compared to insects.

=== Examples ===
Some of the practices that violate human dignity include [[torture]], [[rape]], [[social exclusion]], [[labor exploitation]], [[bonded labor]], and [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  &lt;!-- If you add something to this list, please also add a source for it. --&gt;

Both absolute and relative poverty are violations of human dignity, although they also have other significant dimensions, such as social injustice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Absolute poverty]] is associated with overt exploitation and connected to humiliation (for example, being forced to eat food from other people's garbage), but being dependent upon others to stay alive is a violation of dignity even in the absence of more direct violations. [[Relative poverty]], on the other hand, is a violation because the cumulative experience of not being able to afford the same clothes, entertainment, social events, education, or other features of typical life in that society results in subtle humiliation; social rejection; marginalization; and consequently, a diminished self-respect.

Another example of violation of human dignity, especially for women in developing countries, is lack of [[sanitation]]. Having no access to [[toilet]]s leaves currently about 1 billion people of the world with no choice other than to [[open defecation|defecation in the open]], which has been declared by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations as an affront to personal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;JMP (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2036 Progress on drinking water and sanitation, 2014 Update]. WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), {{ISBN|978 92 4 150724 0}}, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Human dignity is also violated by the practice of employing people in India for "[[manual scavenging]]" of [[human excreta]] from unsanitary toilets{{snd}}usually by people of a lower [[caste]], and more often by women than men.&lt;ref name="HRW2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/india0814_ForUpload_0.pdf|title=Cleaning Human Waste: "manual scavenging", Caste and Discrimination in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example of violation of human dignity, affecting women mainly in developing countries, is [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).

The movie ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]'' depicts a wealthy man ([[Peter Sellers]]) and his son ([[Ringo Starr]]) who test the limits of dignity by forcing people to perform self-degrading acts for money.  The ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer vs. Dignity]]" has a similar plot.

==Philosophical history==
[[File:Ripa dignity allegory.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Statue Depicting Dignity|Woodcut from [[Cesare Ripa|Cesare Ripa's]] Iconologia depicting the Allegory of Dignity]]

===Pico della Mirandola===
A philosopher of the Renaissance, [[Mirandola, Giovanni Francesco Pico della|Pico della Mirandola]], granted dignity to ideas and to beings. In his "[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]", he told hostile clerics about the dignity of the liberal arts and about the dignity and the glory of [[angel]]s. His comments implied the dignity of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Mirandola/|title=Redirection|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oration is commonly seen as one of the central texts of the [[Renaissance]], intimately tied with the growth of humanist philosophies.&lt;ref name="CrossLamm1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Neal Miller|author2=Robert Carson Lamm|author3=Rudy H.

===Kant===
A philosopher of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (18th century), [[Immanuel Kant]] held that there were things that should not be discussed in terms of value, and that these things could be said to have dignity.  '[[Value (ethics)|Value]]' is necessarily relative, because the value of something depends on a particular observer's judgment of that thing. Things that are ''not'' relative{{snd}}that are ''"ends in themselves"'', in Kant's terminology{{snd}}are by extension beyond all value, and a thing is an ''end in itself'' only if it has a moral dimension; if it represents a choice between right and wrong. In Kant's words: "[[Morality]], and [[human nature|humanity]] as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals'', trans. by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (Second Section: Transition From Popular Moral Philosophy To The Metaphysic Of Morals).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically with respect to human dignity, which his writings brought from relative obscurity in Western philosophy into a focal point for philosophers, Kant held that "free will" is essential; human dignity is related to human agency, the ability of humans to choose their own actions.&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip Anthony|title=Encyclopedia of political economy|chapter=Human dignity|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-18717-6|page=471}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortimer Adler and Alan Gewirth===
Philosophers of the late 20th century who have written significant works on the subject of dignity include [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Alan Gewirth]].&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt; Gewirth's views on human dignity are typically compared and contrasted with Kant's, for like Kant he theorizes that human dignity arises from agency.&lt;ref name="Peil2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Mark D.|chapter=Dignity|editor=Jan Peil|title=Handbook of Economics and Ethics|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-936-2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeyleveldBrownsword2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beyleveld|first1=Deryck|author2=Roger Brownsword|title=Human dignity in bioethics and biolaw|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-826826-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while sharing Kant's view that rights arise from dignity, Gewirth focused far more than Kant on the positive obligations that dignity imposed on humans, the moral requirement not only to avoid harming but to actively assist one another in achieving and maintaining a state of "well being".&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt;

Among other topics, including the dignity of labor,&lt;ref name="AdlerWeismann2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=Mortimer Jerome|author2=Max Weismann|title=How to think about the great ideas: from the great books of western civilization|date=1 March 2000|publisher=Open Court Publishing|isbn=978-0-8126-9412-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler extensively explored the question of human equality and equal right to dignity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last=Adler |first=Mortimer |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |title=The Dignity of Man and the 21st century |date=1952-10-10 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620172623/http://cooperativeindividualism.org/adler-mortimer_dignity-of-man.html |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}; {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes|year=1993|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-1535-5}}, {{cite book|author=Mortimer Jerome Adler|title=Six Great Ideas|date=1 December 1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82681-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 June 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, the question of whether humans have equal right to dignity is intrinsically bound in the question of whether human beings are truly equal, which itself is bound in the question of whether human beings are a distinct class from all things, including animals, or vary from other things only by degree. Adler wrote that the only sense in which it is true that all human beings are equal is that they are equally distinct from animals.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dignity of man," he said, "is the dignity of the human being as a person—a dignity that is not possessed by things."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; To Adler, failure to recognize the distinction challenged the right of humans to equal dignity and equal treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1993), 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (1997), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Egonsson, followed by Roger Wertheimer, argued that while it is conventional for people to equate dignity with 'being human' (Egonsson's 'Standard Attitude', Wertheimer's 'Standard Belief'), people generally also import something other than mere humanness to their idea of dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Egonsson, ''Dimensions of Dignity: The Moral Importance of Being Human'' (Dordrecht, Sweden: Kluwer Academic, 1998) 132,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wertheimer, "Philosophy on Humanity," in ''Abortion: Pro and Con'', R. L. Perkins ed. (Cambridge, Mass.: Schenkman, 1974) 107-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Egonsson suggested that an entity must be both human and ''alive'' to merit an ascription of dignity, while Wertheimer states "it is not a definitional truth that human beings have human status."

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], dignity is opinion of others about our worth and subjective definition of dignity is our fear from this opinion of others.&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer. Essays and Aphorisms&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Philippe-André Rodriguez has argued that human dignity is best understood as an essentially contested concept. As he argues, "it seems that it is this very nature of the concept that has allowed, on the one hand, human rights to receive such international acceptance as a theoretical enterprise and, on the other hand, has led the concept to be constantly challenged by different cultures worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Philippe-André|title=Human dignity as an essentially contested concept|journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs|date=2015|volume=28|issue=2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Human dignity is a central consideration of [[Christian philosophy]]&lt;ref name="O'Hara1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Gal|3:28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:35-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] insists the "dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and [[Image of God|likeness]] of [[God]]." "All human beings," says the Church, "in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person." The catechism says, "The right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/index.htm|title=Vatican|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's view of human dignity is like Kant's insofar as it springs from human agency and free will,&lt;ref name="Peil2009"/&gt; with the further understanding that free will in turn springs from human creation in the image of God.&lt;ref name="ccc1705"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect1.shtml|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|work=usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity, or ''kevod ha-beriyot'', is also a central consideration of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="WaxmanGinor1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waxman|first1=Mordecai|authorlink1=Mordecai Waxman|author2=Tseviyah Ben-Yosef Ginor|author3=Zvia Ginor|title=Yakar le'Mordecai|date=November 1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-632-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Talmud]]'' cautions against giving charity publicly rather than in private to avoid offending the dignity of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The political culture of Judaism|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97257-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] in his codification of ''[[Halakha]]'' cautioned judges to preserve the self-respect of people who came before them: "Let not human dignity be light in his eyes; for the respect due to man supersedes a negative rabbinical command".&lt;ref name="Sicker2001"/&gt;

An [[Islam]]ic view of dignity is crystallized in the Quran through the selected biographies of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, David, Moses, Mary, Jesus and others (differing from the narratives in the Bible, which the Quran claims were corrupted). Individuals such as these are presented as role-models of dignity because they did not abandon their self-respect by bowing to social pressures. When faced with the fear of disapproval, poverty, hunger, death etc. these individuals held firm in their sense of right and wrong, which was in-line with Divine ordinances. ''"The right course is that on which one keeps his attitudes, ambitions and requirements subjected to the Divine Laws; and in this way leads a balanced and graceful life. Such a person has grasped the most trustworthy support which will never fail him"'' (Quran 31:22)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405162608/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_031.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals are given the title of Muhsineen, who faced immense pressures but held firm in their positive actions. God awarded these individuals with authority and status in the land, and this reward is open to anyone who proves themselves worthy: ''"We bestow such honour and position on all those who lead their lives according to Our Laws."'' (Quran 37:80)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405163507/http://www.tolueislam.org/Parwez/expo/expo_037.htm |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall into this category are also afforded Divine protection from their mistakes: ''"Therefore We have saved you and your son from this.  We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps."'' (37:104-105)&lt;ref name="tolueislam.org"/&gt; The Quranic State that Muhammad began in Medinah sought to protect human dignity, since in a Quranic Welfare State individuals are free to work and live without the pressures faced by the threat of poverty, and thus can obey God's Laws as free individuals, contributing as part of a unified brotherhood working towards achieving humanity's full potential. Elaborations on dignity have been made by many scholars of Islam, such as [[Mohammad-Ali Taskhiri]], head of the Islamic Culture and Communications Organization in [[Iran]], in 1994. According to Taskhiri, dignity is a state to which all humans have equal ''potential'', but which can only be actualized by living a life pleasing to the eyes of God.&lt;ref name="HafezKenny2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hafez|first1=Kai|author2=Mary Ann Kenny|title=The Islamic world and the West: an introduction to political cultures and international relations|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11651-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with the 1990 [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], which states that "True faith is the guarantee for enhancing such [basic human] dignity along the path to human perfection".&lt;ref name="MAYER2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ann Elizabeth|title=Islam and Human Rights: Tradition and Politics|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4335-8|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human dignity is considered as Buddhahood in Mahayana Buddhism in which it is rooted in the idea that we are able to choose the path of self-perfection as a human being.&lt;ref name="Buddhism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgi.org/buddhism/buddhist-concepts/buddhism-and-human-dignity.html|title=Buddhism and Human Dignity|work=sgi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights==
{{quote|
#All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with [[reason]] and [[conscience]] and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

==Medicine==
In the 20th century, dignity became an issue for physicians and medical researchers. It has been invoked in questions of the [[bioethics]] of [[human genetic engineering]], [[human cloning]], and [[end-of-life care]] (particularly in such situations as the [[Terri Schiavo case]], a controversial situation in which life support was withdrawn from a woman diagnosed in a [[persistent vegetative state]]).&lt;ref name="Bernan2008"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Irreducably Religious Character of Human Dignity|last = Gelernter | first= David | editor = Bernan|title=Human Dignity and Bioethics: Essays Commissioned by the President's Council on Bioethics|date=April 2008|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-080071-9|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bodies===
In June 1964, the [[World Medical Association]] issued the ''[[Declaration of Helsinki]]''. The Declaration says at article 11, "It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, [[integrity]], right to [[autonomy|self-determination]], [[privacy]], and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm Declaration of Helsinki by World Medical Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183350/http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] invoked dignity in its effort to govern the progress of biology and medicine. On 4 April 1997, the Council, at Oviedo, approved the ''[[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine]]''. The convention's preamble contains these statements, among others:
{{quote|Conscious of the accelerating developments in biology and medicine;

Convinced of the need to respect the human being both as an individual and as a member of the human species and recognising the importance of ensuring the dignity of the human being;

Conscious that the misuse of biology and medicine may lead to acts endangering human dignity;

Resolving to take such measures as are necessary to safeguard human dignity and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual with regard to the application of biology and medicine.}}
The Convention states, "Parties to this Convention shall protect the dignity and identity of all human beings and guarantee everyone, without discrimination, respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with regard to the application of biology and medicine."

In 1998, the United Nations mentioned dignity in the ''UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights''. At Article 2, the declaration states, "Everyone has a right to respect for their dignity." At Article 24, the declaration warns that treating a person to remove a genetic defect "could be contrary to human dignity." The ''Commentary'' that accompanies the declaration says that, as a consequence of the possibility of germ-line treatment, "it is the very dignity of the human race which is at stake."

===Canada===
In 1996, the Government of Canada issued a report entitled ''New Reproductive and Genetic Technologies''. The report used "the principles of respect for human life and dignity" as its reason for recommending that various activities associated with genetic research and human reproduction be prohibited. The report said the prohibited activities were "contrary to Canadian values of equality and respect for human life and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2329538&amp;Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;File=28|title=House Government Bill - C-47, Second Reading (35-2)|work=parl.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The Ministry of Health enacted the ''Danish Council Act 1988'', which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned "reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1984, France set up the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences (CCNE) to advise the government about the regulation of medical practices and research. In 1986, the CCNE said, "Respect for human dignity must guide both the development of knowledge and the limits or
rules to be observed by research." The CCNE said that research on human embryos must be subject to "the rule of reason" and must have regard for "undefined dignity in its practical consequences."&lt;ref name=avis008&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 8.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231959/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis008.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCNE insisted that, in research on human embryos, the ethical principles that should apply are "respecting human dignity" and respecting "the dignity of science."&lt;ref name=avis008/&gt;

===Portugal===
The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its ''Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning'' in 1997. The opinion states, "the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Gratton, Brigitte. [http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp ''Survey on the National Regulations in the European Union regarding Research on Human Embryos'' (July 2002), 53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Sweden's ''The Genetic Integrity Act'' (2006:351), ''The Biobanks in Medical Care Act'' (2002:297), ''Health and Medical Services (Professional Activities) Act'' (1998:531), and ''The Health and Medical Services Act'' (1982:763) all express concern for "the integrity of the individual" or "human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx Swedish statutes.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818061730/http://www.smer.se/Bazment/266.aspx |date=2010-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2008, [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] tried to arrive at a consensus about what dignity meant but failed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D., the Council's Chairman, says in the Letter of Transmittal to the President of The United States, "… there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.gov|title=Home Page - Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|work=bioethics.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916023939/http://www.bioethics.gov/|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen studied dignity as a basis for international law.&lt;ref&gt;Myres S. McDougal, Harold D. Lasswell, and Lung-chu Chen, ''Human Rights and World Public Order: The Basic Policies of an International Law of Human Dignity'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; They said that using dignity as the basis for laws was a "[[natural law]] approach."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural law approach, they said, depends upon "exercises of faith."&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen observed:&lt;ref&gt;McDougal et al, note, at 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The abiding difficulty with the natural law approach is that its assumptions, intellectual procedures, and modalities of justification can be employed equally by the proponents of human dignity and the proponents of human indignity in support of diametrically opposed empirical specifications of rights . . . .}}

===Canada===
In 2004, Canada enacted the ''[[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|title=Page not Found - Page non trouvé|date=5 June 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063723/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/A-13.4///en|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2(b) of the Act states, "the benefits of assisted human reproductive technologies and related research for individuals, for families and for society in general can be most effectively secured by taking appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of human health, safety, dignity and rights in the use of these technologies and in related research." The Act prescribes a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both, if someone undertakes a proscribed activity such as the creation of a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]].

=== European Union ===

Article 1 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the inviolability of human dignity.

===France===
In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old.&lt;ref name=avis053&gt;[http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf CCNE Opinion no. 053.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113231600/http://ccne-ethique.fr/docs/en/avis053.pdf |date=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France.&lt;ref name=avis053/&gt; The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after ''in vitro'' fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Cazeau, Bernard. {{fr icon}} [http://www.senat.fr/senfic/cazeau_bernard98029w.html Senat.fr] Retrieved 2009-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Human dignity is the fundamental principle of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Article 1, paragraph 1 reads: ''"Human dignity is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." ''Human dignity is thus mentioned even before the [[right to life]]. This has a significant impact on German law-making and jurisdiction in both serious and trivial items:

*Human dignity is the basis of § 131 [[StGB]], which prohibits the depiction of cruelty against humans in an approving way. § 131 has been used to confiscate [[horror movies]] and to ban [[video game]]s like ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' and the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' series.
*A decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv045187.html|title=DFR - BVerfGE 45, 187 - Lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe|work=unibe.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|German Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1977 said [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[Parole#Criminal justice|parole]] is unconstitutional as a violation of human dignity (and the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' principle). Today, a prisoner serving a life term can be granted parole on good behavior as early as 15 years after being incarcerated, provided that his release is held to constitute little danger to the public. Note that persons deemed still dangerous can be incarcerated indefinitely on a life term, if this judgment is regularly reaffirmed.
*§ 14(3) of the [[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]], which would have allowed the [[Bundeswehr]] to shoot down airliners if they are used as weapons by terrorists, was declared unconstitutional mainly on the grounds of human dignity: killing a small number of innocent people to save a large number cannot be legalized since it treats dignity as if it were a measurable and limited quantity.
*A [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisement showing human buttocks with an "[[H.I.V.]] positive" stamp was declared a violation of human dignity by some courts, but in the end found legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20030311_1bvr042602.html|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht|work=bverfg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/presse/stern/:25.03.2003-Benetton-Werbung:/505780.html Stern.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202172716/http://www.stern.de/presse/stern/%3A25.03.2003-Benetton-Werbung%3A/505780.html |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first German law legalizing [[abortion]] in 1975 was declared unconstitutional because the court held that [[embryo]]s had human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gkpn.de/singer2.htm German law about abortion.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202111015/http://www.gkpn.de/singer2.htm |date=2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new law on abortion was developed in the 1990s. This law makes all abortions ''de jure'' illegal, except if preceded by counseling (§ 219 I GERMAN CRIMINAL CODE).
*In a decision from 1981-12-15, the ''Bundesverwaltungsgericht'' declared that [[peep show]]s violated the human dignity of the performer, regardless of her feelings. The decision was later revised. Peep shows where the performer cannot see the persons who are watching her remain prohibited as a matter of dignity.

===Iran===
The need to respect human dignity has been written in the Iranian constitution law. Article 2 of the Iranian Constitution Law mentions six principles and infrastructures as basic to the governing system which in Article 1 is called the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sixth principle of this Article concerns human dignity and stipulates that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is a system founded on faith in ….6) Human dignity and high value and his/her freedom as well as his responsibility before God”[3]. Besides, in the prelude to the Constitution, human dignity is referred to concerning the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Salehi, Hamid Reza. Human Dignity From the Viewpoint of Iranian Law, Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2013, 135-136. DOI:10.1007/s11673-013-9437-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa]] lists ''"human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms"'' as one of the founding values of the South African state, and the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] is described as affirming the ''"democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom"''. Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly states that ''"Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected."'' In jurisprudence, the right to dignity is often seen as underlying more specific rights, such as equality, security of the person or privacy, but it has been directly applied in a number of cases relating to [[criminal punishment]], the law of [[defamation]], and the right to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta |isbn=978-0-7021-5923-7 |chapter=Chapter Ten: Human dignity |pages=272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provides in article 7 that "Human dignity must be respected and protected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a7.html Official translation] of art. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides, in art. 120, that the state must "take account of the dignity of living beings as well as the safety of human beings, animals and the environment" when legislating on the use of reproductive and genetic material;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a120.html Official translation] of art. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently the Federal Ethics Commission on Non-Human Biotechnology (ECNH) issued, in 2008, a publication entitled "The dignity of living beings with regard to plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekah.admin.ch/fileadmin/ekah-dateien/dokumentation/publikationen/e-Broschure-Wurde-Pflanze-2008.pdf|title=English language publication|website=admin.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fleming's left-hand rule for electric motors''' is one of a pair of visual [[mnemonic]]s, the other being [[Fleming's right-hand rule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When current flows through a conducting wire, and an external magnetic field is applied across that flow, the conducting wire experiences a force perpendicular both to that field and to the direction of the current flow (i.e they are mutually perpendicular) . A left hand can be held, as shown in the illustration, so as to represent three mutually orthogonal axes on the thumb, fore finger and middle finger. Each finger is then assigned to a quantity (mechanical force, magnetic field and electric current). The right and left hand are used for generators and motors respectively.

==Conventions==
* The direction of the mechanical force is the literal one
* The direction of the magnetic field is from north to south.
* The direction of the electric current is that of [[conventional current]]: from positive to negative.

===First variant===
* The '''Th'''u''m''b represents the direction of the '''Th'''rust on the conductor / ''M''otion of the Conductor
* The '''F'''ore finger represents the direction of the magnetic '''F'''ield
* The '''C'''entre finger represents the direction of the '''C'''urrent.

===Second variant===
* The Thu'''m'''b represents the direction of '''M'''otion resulting from the force on the conductor
* The '''F'''irst finger represents the direction of the magnetic '''F'''ield
* The Se'''c'''ond finger represents the direction of the '''C'''urrent.

===Third variant===
[[Robert J. Van de Graaff|Van de Graaff's]] translation of Fleming's rules is the FBI rule, easily remembered because these are the initials of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

===Fourth variant (FBI)===
* The '''F'''(Thumb) represents the direction of Force of the conductor
* The '''B'''(Forefinger) represents the direction of the Magnetic field
* The '''I'''(Centre finger) represents the direction of the Current.

This uses the conventional symbolic parameters of F (for [[Lorentz force]]), B (for [[magnetic flux density]]) and I (for [[electric current]]), and attributing them in that order (FBI) respectively to the thumb, first finger and second finger.
* The thumb is the force, F
* The first finger is the magnetic flux density, B
* The second finger is the electric current, I.

Of course, if the mnemonic is taught (and remembered) with a different arrangement of the parameters to the fingers, it could end up as a mnemonic that also reverses the roles of the two hands (instead of the standard left hand for motors, right hand for generators). These variants are catalogued more fully on the [[FBI mnemonics]] page.

=== Fifth variant (Fire the field, feel the force and kill the current) ===
This approach to remembering which finger represents which quantity uses some actions.  First of all you need to point your fingers like a pretend gun, with the index finger acting as the barrel of the gun and the thumb acting as the hammer. Then go through the following actions:

* "Fire the field" out through your index finger 
* "Feel the force" of the gun recoil up through your thumb 
* Finally you display your middle finger as you "kill the current"

==Distinction between the right-hand and left-hand rule==
[[Image:RightHandOutline.png|Fleming's right-hand rule|thumb|300px]]
Fleming's left-hand rule is used for [[electric motor]]s, while Fleming's right-hand rule is used for electric [[Electric generator|generators]].

Different hands need to be used for motors and generators because of the differences between cause and effect. 

In an electric motor, the electric current and magnetic field exist (which are the causes), and they lead to the force that creates the motion (which is the effect), and so the left hand rule is used. In an electric generator, the motion and magnetic field exist (causes), and they lead to the creation of the electric current (effect), and so the right hand rule is used.

To illustrate why, consider that many types of electric motors can also be used as electric generators. A vehicle powered by such a motor can be accelerated up to high speed by connecting the motor to a fully charged [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. If the motor is then disconnected from the fully charged battery, and connected instead to a completely flat battery, the vehicle will decelerate.  The motor will act as a generator and convert the vehicle's [[kinetic energy]] back to [[electrical energy]], which is then stored in the battery. Since neither the direction of motion nor the direction of the magnetic field (inside the motor/generator) has changed, the direction of the electric current in the motor/generator has reversed.  This follows from the [[second law of thermodynamics]] (the generator current must oppose the motor current, and the stronger current outweighs the other to allow the energy to flow from the more energetic source to the less energetic source).

The rule for motors can be recalled by remembering that "motors drive on the left in Britain". The rule for generators can be recalled by remembering that either the letters "g" and "r" is common to both "right" and "generator", or the phrase "Jenny is always right" ("Genny" being a common shortened version of Generator).

==Physical basis for the rules==
[[File:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|Prediction of direction of flux density (''B''), given that the current ''I'' flows in the direction of the thumb.]]

When electrons, or any [[charged particle]]s, flow in the same direction (for example, as an [[electric current]] in an [[electrical conductor]], such as a [[metal]] [[wire]]) they generate a cylindrical [[magnetic field]] that wraps round the conductor (as discovered by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]). 

The direction of the induced magnetic field is sometimes remembered by ''Maxwell's corkscrew rule''. That is, if the conventional current is flowing away from the viewer, the magnetic field runs clockwise round the conductor, in the same direction that a [[corkscrew]] would have to turn in order to move away from the viewer. The direction of the induced magnetic field is also sometimes remembered by the [[right-hand grip rule]], as depicted in the illustration, with the thumb showing the direction of the conventional current, and the fingers showing the direction of the magnetic field. The existence of this magnetic field can be confirmed by placing magnetic compasses at various points round the periphery of an electrical conductor that is carrying a relatively large electric current.

If an external magnetic field is applied horizontally, so that it crosses the flow of electrons (in the wire conductor, or in the electron beam), the two magnetic fields will interact. [[Michael Faraday]] introduced a visual analogy for this, in the form of imaginary magnetic [[lines of force]]: those in the conductor form concentric circles round the conductor; those in the externally applied magnetic field run in parallel lines. If those on one side of the conductor are running (from the north to south magnetic pole) in the opposite direction to those surrounding the conductor, they will be deflected so that they pass on the other side the conductor (because magnetic lines of force cannot cross or run contrary to each other). Consequently, there will be a large number of magnetic field lines in a small space on that side of the conductor, and a dearth of them on the original side of the conductor. Since the magnetic field lines of force are no longer straight lines, but curved to run around the electrical conductor, they are under tension (like stretched elastic bands), with energy bound up in the magnetic field. Since this energetic field is now mostly unopposed, its build-up or expulsion in one direction creates — in a manner analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] — a force in the opposite direction. Since there is only one moveable object in this system (the electrical conductor) for this force to work upon, the net effect is a physical force working to expel the electrical conductor out of the externally applied magnetic field in the direction opposite to that which the magnetic flux is being redirected to — in this case (motors), if the conductor is carrying conventional current ''upwards'', and the external magnetic field is moving ''away from'' the viewer, the physical force will work to push the conductor to the '''left'''. This is the reason for [[torque]] in an electric motor. (The electric motor is then constructed so that the expulsion of the conductor out of the magnetic field causes it be placed inside the next magnetic field, and for this switching to be continued indefinitely.)

Faraday's Law: the induced [[electromotive force]] in a conductor is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the conductor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">In mathematics, '''Fraïssé's theorem''', named after [[Roland Fraïssé]], states that a [[class (set theory)|class]] ''K'' of finite [[relational structure]]s is the [[age (model theory)|age]] of a [[countable set|countable]] homogeneous relational structure if and only if it satisfies the following four conditions:

* ''K'' is closed under [[isomorphism]];
* ''K'' is closed under taking induced substructures;
* ''K'' has only countably many members up to isomorphism;
* ''K'' has the [[amalgamation property]].

If these conditions hold, then the countable homogeneous structure whose age is ''K'' is unique up to isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meenaxi Bhattacharjee |author2=Dugald Macpherson |author3=Rögnvaldur G.

&lt;!--If the artwork has a proper title, then it should be italicized here and in the title of the article above--&gt;'''''Free Basket''''' is a public artwork by the [[Cuba]]n artist group [[Los Carpinteros]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork is in the form of an international basketball court with twenty-four red or blue steel arches that travel throughout the court, mimicking the trajectory of two bouncing basketballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the arches terminate with their own regulation size basketball hoop, netting, and backboard.

==Description==
''Free Basket'' is located outside the boundary of the 100 Acres park on city property.  The parking loop surrounding the artwork is situated just south of the Lake and west of the museum.  The artwork can be accessed by means of the IWC Canal Greenway (Central Canal Trail), W 38th Street, and the 100 Acres Park walkway.  ''Free Basket'' is a site-specific work consisting of twenty-four red- or blue-painted steel tubular arches that mimic the trajectory of two bouncing basketballs.  The arches travel throughout the court and are of varying heights and span widths.  Two of the arches (one red and one blue) are capped at midpoint, each with their own basketball backboard fashioned with: backboard, metal rim, and nylon net.  The steel arches have been mounted on a level, rectangular concrete surface that is size of an international basketball court, where they have been filled and secured with concrete cement.  The concrete court has been surfaced with Rhino Guard colored plastic and has been painted to the standards of an international basketball court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary court color is yellow, the “goal lines” are painted white, and sections of black and green flank both sides of the court, and a black border surrounds entire court.  There are also built-in lighting systems that have been sunk into the court to illuminate the sculpture.

==Historical information==
Los Carpinteros sought to portray the juxtaposition of the practical and the imaginary with ''Free Basket'', and drew on the history of sports in Indianapolis to merge art, sports, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ArtBabble: Play Art Loud|title=Los Carpinteros: In the Factory|url=http://www.artbabble.org/video/ima/los-carpinteros-factory|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
This artwork was installed at the IMA in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Free Basket'' has been acquired by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Condition==
In general, the artwork requires regular cleaning of both the steel and court components to discourage the buildup of damaging materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center, Los Angeles, Getty Conservation Institute|year=2010|publisher=Getty Publications, Gregory M.

== Legal meaning in the United States ==
Though many fundamental rights are also widely considered human rights, the classification of a right as "fundamental" invokes specific legal tests courts use to determine the constrained conditions under which the United States government and various state governments may limit these rights. In such legal contexts, courts determine whether rights are fundamental by examining the historical foundations of those rights and by determining whether their protection is part of a longstanding tradition. Individual states may guarantee other rights as fundamental. That is, States may add to fundamental rights but can never diminish or infringe upon fundamental rights by legislative processes. Any such attempt, if challenged, may involve a "strict scrutiny" review in court.

== Specific jurisdictions ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}
In [[Canada]], the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] outlines four Fundamental Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html |title=Canadian Charter Of Rights And Freedoms |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are freedom of:
* [[Freedom of conscience|Conscience]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]]
* Thought, belief, opinion, and expression, including [[freedom of the press]] and other media of communication
* Peaceful assembly
* Association.

=== European Union ===
{{Main|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
Europe has no identical doctrine (It would be incompatible with the more restrained role of judicial review in European law.) However, EU law recognizes many of the same human rights and protects them through other means.

See also: [[Copenhagen criteria#Human rights|Copenhagen criteria]], and [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which every member state of the EU has to comply with and for which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has final appellate jurisdiction.

=== India ===
The Indian fundamental rights, contrasted with such rights contained in the US bill of rights, present several peculiarities.The fundamental rights in India are far more elaborate than in the United States. Thus, for example, the US bill of rights (first ten amendments) only names some rights. The Supreme Court, through the process of judicial review, decides the limitations on these rights.
{{Main|Fundamental Rights in India}}

There are seven main fundamental rights of India:
* right to [[equality before the law|equality]]
* right to freedom, which includes [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression|expression]], right to assemble peacefully, freedom to form associations or unions, right to move freely throughout the territory of [[India]], right to reside or settle in any part of the territory of [[India]], right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation. 
* right to [[freedom of religion]]
* right against [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]
* cultural and [[right to education|educational rights]]
* right to constitutional remedies
* right to vote(but above 18 years)

Newly implemented 7th Fundamental right in India is
* right to education

It was added in the constitution after the 86th amendment in the year 2002 under article 21A. It is the most recently implemented fundamental right. The RTE Act enabled this right in the year 2010.

A recent addition was made to the list of fundamental rights in India in 2017.
* right to privacy.

=== United States ===
In American [[United States constitutional law|Constitutional Law]], ''fundamental rights'' have special significance under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Those rights enumerated in the U.S. Constitution are recognized as "fundamental" by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. According to the Supreme Court, enumerated rights that are incorporated are so fundamental that any law restricting such a right must both serve a compelling state purpose and be [[narrowly tailored]] to that [[compelling purpose]].

The original interpretation of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was that only the Federal Government was bound by it. In 1835, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Barron v Baltimore]]'' unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. During post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was adopted in 1868 to rectify this condition, and to specifically apply the whole of the Constitution to all U.S. states. In 1873, the Supreme Court essentially nullified the key language of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment that guaranteed all "[[Privileges and Immunities Clause|privileges and immunities]]" to all U.S. persons, in a series of cases called the [[Slaughter-House Cases|Slaughterhouse cases]]. This decision and others allowed post-emancipation racial discrimination to continue largely unabated.

Later Supreme Court justices found a way around these limitations without overturning the Slaughterhouse precedent: they created a concept called Selective Incorporation. Under this legal theory, the court used the remaining 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment protections for equal protection and due process to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|"incorporate" individual elements of the Bill of Rights against the states]]. "The test usually articulated for determining fundamentality under the Due Process Clause is that the putative right must be '[[Palko v. Connecticut#Court.27s Decision|implicit in the concept of ordered liberty]]', or '[[Moore v. East Cleveland|deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.]]'" [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14074967920400304312&amp;q=lutz+york&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 Compare page 267 Lutz v. City of York, Pa., 899 F. 2d 255 - United States Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit, 1990].

This set in motion a continuous process under which each individual right under the Bill of Rights was incorporated, one by one. That process has extended more than half a century, with the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment]] first incorporated in 1925 in [[Gitlow v New York]]. The most recent amendment completely incorporated as fundamental was the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to possess and [[bear arms]] for personal self-defense, in [[McDonald v Chicago]], handed down in 2010.

Not all clauses of all amendments have been incorporated. For example, states are not required to obey the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s requirement of indictment by [[grand jury]]. Many states choose to use [[preliminary hearing]]s instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate additional clauses of the Bill of Rights against the states.

The Bill of Rights lists specifically enumerated rights. The Supreme Court has extended fundamental rights by recognizing several fundamental rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, including but not limited to:
* The right to interstate travel
* The right to parent one's children&lt;ref&gt;''[[Troxel v. Granville]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[right to privacy]]&lt;ref&gt;see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=right+to+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,10&amp;case=12998230422916570030&amp;scilh=0 ''Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford''], 141 U.S. 250 (1891)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to marriage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' &amp; ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right of self-defense  
Any restrictions a government statute or policy places on these rights are evaluated with [[strict scrutiny]].  If a right is denied to everyone, it is an issue of [[substantive due process]]. If a right is denied to some individuals but not others, it is also an issue of [[equal protection]]. However, any action that abridges a right deemed fundamental, when also violating equal protection, is still held to the more exacting standard of strict scrutiny, instead of the less demanding rational basis test.

During the [[Lochner era]], the right to [[freedom of contract]] was considered fundamental, and thus restrictions on that right were subject to [[strict scrutiny]].  Following the 1937 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', though, the right to contract became considerably less important in the context of [[substantive due process]] and restrictions on it were evaluated under the [[rational basis]] standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16456">'''Holacracy''' is a method of decentralized management and organizational [[Corporate governance|governance]], in which authority and decision-making are distributed throughout a [[holarchy]] of self-organizing teams rather than being vested in a management hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rudd | first = Olivia | title = Business Intelligence Success Factors: Tools for Aligning Your Business in the Global Economy | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | date = 2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holacracy has been adopted by for-profit and non-profit organizations in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Röll|first=Martin|title=Organisations running on Holacracy|url=http://structureprocess.com/holacracy-cases|work=structureprocess.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The Holacracy system was developed at [[Ternary Software]], an [[Exton, Pennsylvania]] company that was noted for experimenting with more democratic forms of organizational governance.&lt;ref name="Badal07"&gt;{{cite news |last=Badal |first=Jaclyne |date=April 23, 2008 |title=Can a Company Be Run as a Democracy? |url= |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternary founder Brian Robertson distilled the company's best practices into an organizational system that became known as Holacracy in 2007.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=Brian |last2= |first2= |date=June 2007 |title=Evolving Organization |url= |journal=Integral Leadership Review |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages= |doi= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson later developed the "[http://holacracy.org/constitution Holacracy Constitution]", which lays out the core principles and practices of the system. In June 2015, he released the book ''Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World,'' that details and explains his practices.

The term holacracy is derived from the term [[holarchy]], coined by [[Arthur Koestler]] in his 1967 book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895500921|title=Holacracy : the new management system for a rapidly changing world|last=J.|first=Robertson, Brian|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781627794282|edition= First|location=New York|pages=38|oclc=895500921}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holarchy is composed of [[Holon (philosophy)|holons]] (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos "whole") or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part.&lt;ref name="Koestler67"&gt;{{cite book |last= Koestler|first= Arthur|year= 1967|title=The Ghost in the Machine |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts.&lt;ref name="Koestler67" /&gt;

== Influences and comparable systems ==

Holacracy is one of several systems of [[flat organization]]. It has been compared to [[sociocracy]], a system of governance developed in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="steele12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=Robert David |date=June 5, 2012 |title=The Open-Source Everything Manifesto |url= |location= |publisher=North Atlantic Books | page = 47 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocracy had a significant early influence during the incubation of Holacracy,&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Brian Robertson on Holacracy (2006): https://web.archive.org/web/20060630101107/http://www.ternarysoftware.com/pages/downloads/BrianRobertsonInterview2006-02-08v3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; though Holacracy has increasingly differentiated away from it since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adeeperdemocracy.org/holacracy-sociocracy/ |title=Holacracy and Sociocracy |author= |year=2010 |website=http://www.adeeperdemocracy.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocracy particularly inspired the development of the circle structure and governance processes (described in more detail later) within Holacracy. Holacracy is designed for organizations and fundamentally differentiates the roles of the organization from the people working in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://holacracy.org/resources/sociocracy-holacracy |title=Sociocracy &amp; Holacracy |author= |year=2013 |website=http://holacracy.org |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its emphasis on iterative governance, adaptive processes, and self-organization, {{cnspan|text=Holacracy draws inspiration from [[agile software development]] principles and the [[lean manufacturing]] process|date=November 2015}}. Holacracy is highly compatible with [[stakeholder theory]] as its board structure allows for multiple stakeholders to be represented in the governance of an organization and for multiple organizations with shared interests to be linked at the governance level.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Essential elements ==

=== Roles instead of job descriptions ===
The building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy constitution, definition of a role|url=http://holacracy.org/constitution#art11|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles are defined by each circle —or team— via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.

=== Circle structure ===
Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as "lead link" and "rep link", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization’s mission and strategy.

=== Governance process ===
Each circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as "integrative decision making" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy governance meetings|url=http://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational process ===
Holacracy specifies processes for aligning teams around operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partner duties in Holacracy|url=http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Partner_Duties|work=wiki.holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Röll|first=Martin|title=Energizing Project Roles (Holacracy Basics, Part 1)|url=http://structureprocess.com/blog/energizing-roles/|work=structureprocess.com|accessdate=23 January 2015|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Work|title=Part 2: Permission Cultures|url=https://medium.com/about-holacracy/part-2-permission-cultures-738b20a8ce3c|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy constitution, definition of a role|url=http://holacracy.org/constitution#art14|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holacracy is thus highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental.

Holacracy specifies a tactical meeting process that every circle goes through usually on a weekly basis. This process includes different phases to report on relevant data, share updates on projects, and open discussions where any circle member can add to the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holacracy tactical meetings|url=http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings|work=holacracy.org|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular feature of this last phase, known as "triage", is to focus discussions on the concrete next steps needed by the individual who added the agenda item to address his or her issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Olivier|last=Compagne|title=One Thread at a Time|url=https://medium.com/about-holacracy/one-thread-at-a-time-7b297718bc59|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is to avoid large, unproductive discussions dominated by the louder voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristy|last=Meade|title=Holacracy: A Step Toward Equality|url=https://medium.com/@_Kristy_/holacracy-a-step-toward-equality-447898ae4c73|work=medium.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holacracy in contemporary practice ==
In the U.S., for-profit and not-for-profit organizations have adopted and practiced Holacracy. Examples include [[Zappos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last =  Groth | title = Zappos is going holacratic: no job titles, no managers, no hierarchy | url = http://qz.com/161210/zappos-is-going-holacratic-no-job-titles-no-managers-no-hierarchy/ | work = Quartz | date = 2013-12-30 | accessdate = 2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[David Allen Company]], [[Precision Nutrition]], and nonprofit [[Conscious Capitalism (organization)|Conscious Capitalism]]. [[Medium (service)|Medium]] used Holacracy for several years before abandoning it in 2016.&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.medium.com/management-and-organization-at-medium-2228cc9d93e9#.80p0z3d3j |title=Management and Organization at Medium |last=Doyle |first=Andy |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Holacracy is claimed{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} to increase agility, efficiency, transparency, innovation and accountability within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Michelle |year=2012 |title=Navigating the New Work Paradigm |url= |location= |publisher=Center for Creative Emergence |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach encourages individual team members to take initiative and gives them a process in which their concerns or ideas can be addressed.&lt;ref name="Badal07" /&gt; The system of distributed authority reduces the burden on leaders to make every decision.

According to [[Zappos]]'s CEO [[Tony Hsieh]], Holacracy makes individuals more responsible for their own thoughts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hsieh | first =Tony  | title =A Memo From Tony Hsieh | work =Zappos Insights| publisher =Zappos | date =April 8, 2015 | url =http://www.zapposinsights.com/blog/item/a-memo-from-tony-hsieh | accessdate = June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[Steve Denning]] warned against viewing Holacracy as a panacea, claiming that instead of removing hierarchy, decisions are funneled down from circle to circle in a clear hierarchy, with each subsequent circle knowing less about the big picture than the one above.&lt;ref name="Denning"&gt;{{cite web | first = Steve | last =  Denning | title = Making sense of Zappos and Holacracy | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/01/15/making-sense-of-zappos-and-holacracy/ | work = Forbes | date = 2014-01-15 | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the rules and procedures laid out in the founding documents of Holacracy such as Robertson's originating article&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; are very detailed and focused on "administrivia."&lt;ref name="Denning"/&gt; Lastly, Denning added that the voice of the customer was missing from the Holacracy model, concluding that for agile and customer-focused companies such as [[Zappos]], Holacracy is a way to add administrative rigor, but that Holacracy would not necessarily work well in an organization that did not already have agility and passion for the customer.&lt;ref name="Denning"/&gt; HolacracyOne partner Olivier Compagne replied to those criticisms on the company's blog, claiming that Denning's criticisms misunderstand Holacracy, and explaining how the rules of Holacracy address or avoid those alleged pitfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Olivier | last =  Compagne | title = Holacracy Is Not What You Think | url = https://medium.com/holacracyone-blog/67144c3adf8 | work = HolacracyOne's Blog | date = 2014-01-21 | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In moving away from Holacracy, ''Medium'' noted that "for larger initiatives, which require coordination across functions, it can be time-consuming and divisive to gain alignment" and that Medium believed that "the act of codifying responsibilities in explicit detail hindered a proactive attitude and sense of communal ownership". They also noted that the inaccurate media coverage of Holacracy created a challenge for recruitment.&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt;

At Zappos, about 14% of the company left voluntarily in 2015 in a deliberate attempt by Zappos to have only retain employees who believed in holacracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last = Groth | title = Zappos has now lost 18% of its employees to its radical buyout offer | url = http://qz.com/590632/zappos-has-now-lost-18-of-its-employees-to-its-radical-buyout-offer/ | work = Quartz | date = 2016-01-13 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include a "one-size-fits-all" approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Julia | last = Culen | title = Holacracy: not safe enough to try | url = https://pazifika.com/2016/04/03/holacracy-not-safe-enough-to-try/ | date = 2016-04-03 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; layers of bureaucracy and more psychological weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Aimee | last = Groth | title = Zappos is struggling with Holacracy because humans aren’t designed to operate like software | url = http://qz.com/849980/zappos-is-struggling-with-holacracy-because-humans-arent-designed-to-operate-like-software/ | work = Quartz | date = 2016-12-21 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Hypermodernity''' ('''supermodernity''') is a type, mode, or stage of [[society]] that reflects an inversion of [[modernity]] in which the function of an object has its reference point in the form of an object rather than function being the reference point for form.  Hypermodernism stipulates a world in which the object has been replaced by the attributes of the object.  The new attribute-driven world is driven by the rise of [[technology]] and aspires to a convergence between technology and [[biology]] and more importantly information and matter.  Hypermodernism finds its validation in [[Technocentrism|emphasis on the value of new technology]] to overcome natural limitations and emphasizes a dismissal of an object-driven past in favor of a flexible, attribute-driven heuristic. 

==Hypermodernity==
Hypermodernity emphasizes a hyperbolic separation between past and present due to the fact that:
# The past oriented attributes and their functions around objects 
# Objects that do exist in the present are only extant due to some useful attribute in the hypermodern era.

Hypermodernity inverts [[Modernity]] to allow the attributes of an object to provide even more individuality than modernism. Modernity trapped form within the bounds of limited function; hypermodernity posits that function is now evolving so rapidly, it must take its reference point from form itself.  Both positive and negative societal changes occur due to hyper-individualism and increased personal choice. 

[[Postmodernity]] rejected the idea of the past as a reference point and curated objects from the past for the sole purpose of freeing form from function.  In postmodernism, truth was ephemeral as the focus was to avoid non-falsifiable tenets. Postmodernity described a total collapse of Modernity and its faith in progress and improvement in empowering the individual.

==Supermodernity==
If distinguished from hypermodernity, '''supermodernity''' is a step beyond the ontological emptiness of [[postmodernism]] and relies upon plausible heuristic truths.  Whereas [[modernism]] focused upon the creation of great truths (or what [[Lyotard]] called "[[master narrative]]s" or "[[metanarrative]]s"), and postmodernity was intent upon their destruction ([[deconstruction]]); supermodernity operates extraneously of meta-truth.  Instead, attributes are extracted from objects of the past based on their present relevance.  Since attributes are both true and false, a  [[truth value]] is not necessary including falsifiability.  Supermodernity curates useful attributes from modern and postmodern objects in order to escape nihilistic postmodern [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].  The touchscreen phone is an excellent example of supermodernism in action. Related authors are [[Terry Eagleton]] ''After Theory'', and [[Marc Augé]] ''Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17815">'''Illusion of validity''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which a person overestimates his or her ability to interpret and predict accurately the outcome when analyzing a set of data, in particular when the data analyzed show a very consistent pattern&amp;mdash;that is, when the data "tell" a coherent story.{{sfn|Kahneman|Tversky|1973}}{{sfn|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}

This effect persists even when the person is aware of all the factors that limit the accuracy of his or her predictions, that is when the data and/or methods used to judge them lead to highly fallible predictions.{{sfn|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}

[[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Paul Slovic]], and [[Amos Tversky]] explain the illusion as follows: "people often predict by selecting the output...that is most representative of the input....The confidence they have in their prediction depends primarily on the degree of representativeness...with little or no regard for the factors that limit predictive accuracy. Thus, people express great confidence in the prediction that a person is a librarian when given a description of his personality which matches the stereotype of librarians, even if the description is scanty, unreliable, or outdated. The unwarranted confidence which is produced by a good fit between the predicted outcome and the input information may be called the illusion of validity."&lt;ref name="Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Slovic|first2=Paul|last3=Tversky|first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521284147|pages=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22illusion+of+validity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YDia9RP-0M&amp;sig=HSvRPFIoeSCnI-FQx5gBZplKmL8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtwr3Wwu7QAhUFkSwKHbfIBc44ChDoAQgeMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22illusion%20of%20validity%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, for example, subjects reported higher confidence in a prediction of the final [[grade point average]] of a student after seeing a first-year record of consistent ''B''&amp;apos;s than a first-year record of an even number of ''A''&amp;apos;s and ''C''&amp;apos;s.{{sfn|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}} Consistent patterns may be observed when input variables are highly redundant or correlated, which may increase subjective confidence. However, a number of highly correlated inputs should not increase confidence much more than only one of the inputs; instead higher confidence should be merited when a number of highly ''independent'' inputs show a consistent pattern.{{sfn|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}

==Discovery and description==
This bias was first described by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in their 1973 paper "[[#CITEREFKahnemanTversky1973|On the Psychology of Prediction]]".{{sfn|Kahneman|Tversky|1973}}

In a 2011 article, Kahneman recounted the story of his discovery of the illusion of validity. After completing an undergraduate psychology degree and spending a year as an infantry officer in the Israeli Army, he was assigned to the army's Psychology Branch, where he helped evaluate candidates for officer training using a test called the Leaderless Group Challenge. Candidates were taken to an obstacle field and assigned a group task so that Kahneman and his fellow evaluators could discern their individual leadership qualities or lack thereof.

But although Kahneman and his colleagues emerged from the exercise with very clear judgments as to who was and wasn't a potential leader, their forecasts proved "largely useless" in the long term. Comparing their original evaluations of candidates with the judgments of their officer-training school commanders months later, Kahneman and his colleagues found that their own "ability to predict performance at the school was negligible. Our forecasts were better than blind guesses, but not by much."

Yet when asked to again to assess yet another group of candidates, their judgments were as clear as before. "The dismal truth about the quality of our predictions," recalled Kahneman, "had no effect whatsoever on how we evaluated new candidates and very little effect on the confidence we had in our judgments and predictions." Kahneman found this striking: "The statistical evidence of our failure should have shaken our confidence in our judgments of particular candidates, but it did not. It should also have caused us to moderate our predictions, but it did not." Kahneman named this cognitive fallacy "the illusion of validity".

Decades later, Kahneman reflected that at least part of the reason for his and his colleagues' failure in assessing the officer candidates was that they had been confronted with a difficult question but had instead, without realizing it, answered an easier one instead. "We were required to predict a soldier's performance in officer training and in combat, but we did so by evaluating his behavior over one hour in an artificial situation. This was a perfect instance of a general rule that I call WYSIATI, 'What you see is all there is.' We had made up a story from the little we knew but had no way to allow for what we did not know about the individual’s future, which was almost everything that would actually matter."&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|title=Don’t Blink!

== Other examples ==

Comparing the results of 25 wealth advisers over an eight-year period, Kahneman found that none of them stood out consistently as better or worse than the others. "The results," as he put it, "resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill." Yet at the firm for which all these advisers worked, no one seemed to be aware of this: "The advisers themselves felt they were competent professionals performing a task that was difficult but not impossible, and their superiors agreed." Kahneman informed the firm's directors that they were "rewarding luck as if it were skill." The directors believed this, yet "life in the firm went on just as before." The directors clung to the "illusion of skill," as did the advisers themselves.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

The scientist Freeman Dyson has recalled his experience as a British Army statistician during World War II, performing an analysis of the operations of the Bomber Command. At the time, an officer argue that because of the heavy gun turrets they carried, the bombers were too slow and could not fly high enough to avoid being shot down. He suggested they remove the turrets and gunners. But the commander in chief rejected the suggestion – because, said Dyson, "he was blinded by the illusion of validity." He was not alone: everyone in the command "saw every bomber crew as a tightly knit team of seven, with the gunners playing an essential role defending their comrades against fighter attack." Part of this illusion "was the belief that the team learned by experience. As they became more skillful and more closely bonded, their chances of survival would improve." Yet statistics, Dyson found, proved that all this was an illusion: deaths occurred randomly, having nothing to do with experience. Members of the bomber command, he realized, were dying unnecessarily because everyone was taken in by an illusion.&lt;ref name="The New York Review of Books"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|title=How to Dispel Your Illusions|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/12/22/how-dispel-your-illusions/|accessdate=23 June 2017|publisher=The New York Review of Books|date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' presented as fact an accusation of rape at the [[University of Virginia]] that proved to be false. Rolling Stone's writers and editors, the university president and other administrators, and many U.Va. students were quick to believe the false charges. Harlan Loeb later explained this as an example of the illusion of validity in action.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loeb|first1=Harlan|title=The University of Virginia and the Risky Illusion of Validity|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harlan-loeb/the-university-of-virgini_b_6303958.html|accessdate=23 June 2017|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a sportswriter who described Kahneman as his "favorite scientist" wrote: "The illusion of validity is why I get deeply suspicious whenever a fan, sportswriter, coach, or GM says anything to the effect of 'the numbers don’t tell the whole story.' This is, in fact, true, but what the person saying this usually means is 'I don't care what the numbers say because I am convinced that what I have seen is correct.' Which is, thanks to this illusion, almost never true. If I make an argument that the data says a player isn't good, and someone points out 'Yes, but if you watch the games you will notice that this year they are only shooting threes from the slot, and rarely from the corner, where he used to excel,' then that person is pointing out a hole in the data that's worth investigating. If the argument is along the lines of  'anyone who's watching him can clearly see he's much better than that,' then I'm certain the illusion of validity is doing its dirty work."&lt;ref name="The Wages of Wins Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|title="I know what the stats say but…": The illusion of validity in basketball fandom|journal=The Wages of Wins Journal|date=January 13, 2012|url=http://wagesofwins.com/2012/01/13/i-know-what-the-stats-say-but-the-illusion-of-validity-in-basketball-fandom/|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1981 paper, J.B. Bushyhead and J.J. Christensen-Szalanski studied data from an outpatient clinic showing that doctors there ordered chest radiographs only on patients who manifested clinical attributes linked to some pneumonia cases, rather than on patients manifesting clinical attributes associated with all pneumonia cases. They attributed this behavior to the illusion of validity.&lt;ref name="Med Decis Making"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushyhead|first1=J.B.|last2=Christensen-Szalanski|first2=J.J.|title=Feedback and the illusion of validity in a medical clinic.|journal=Med Decis Making|date=1981|pages=115–23|doi=10.1177/0272989X8100100203|pmid=7052406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases where this phenomenon appears include job interviews, wine tasting, stock markets, political strategy.{{sfn|Kahneman|2007}}{{sfn|Kahneman|2011}}

== Causes ==
The illusion of validity may be caused in part by [[confirmation bias]] and/or the [[representativeness heuristic]], and could in turn cause the [[overconfidence effect]].{{sfn|Einhorn|Hogarth|1978}}{{how | October = 2013|date=October 2013}}

Among the factors contributing to the illusion of validity, according to Meinolf Dierkes, Ariane Berthoin Antal, John Child, and Ikujiro Nonaka, are "a person's tendency to register the frequency of events more than their probability"; "the impossibility of gathering information about alternative assumptions if action is based on a hypothesis"; a "disregard of base-rate information"; and "the self-fulfilling prophecy," or "a behavior manifested in individuals or groups because it was expected."&lt;ref name="Handbook of Organizational Learning and Knowledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dierkes|first1=Meinolf|last2=Antal|first2=Ariane|last3=Child|first3=John|last4=Nonaka|first4=Ikujiro|title=Handbook of Organizational Learning and Knowledge|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRd7RZzzw_wC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22illusion+of+validity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EVHE97C6zZ&amp;sig=swGmrBrBnKWVUyOaJZyp8ANnGPU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtwr3Wwu7QAhUFkSwKHbfIBc44ChDoAQg4MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22illusion%20of%20validity%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming the illusion==

If one wishes to try to avoid being traduced by the illusion of validity, according to Kahneman, one should ask two questions: "Is the environment in which the judgment is made sufficiently regular to enable predictions from the available evidence? The answer is yes for diagnosticians, no for stock pickers. Do the professionals have an adequate opportunity to learn the cues and the regularities? The answer here depends on the professionals' experience and on the quality and speed with which they discover their mistakes." While many professionals "easily pass both tests," meaning that their "off-the-cuff judgments" are of value, in general judgments by "assertive and confident people" should be taken with a grain of salt "unless you have independent reason to believe that they know what they are talking about." This can be difficult, however, because  "overconfident professionals...act as experts and look like experts," and it can be a "struggle to remind yourself that they may be in the grip of an illusion."&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

In his article on the false rape case at the University of Virginia, Harlan Loeb outlined an approach to avoiding the illusion of validity in cases which, like that one, involve “a highly emotional and personal issue that has national resonance, high-profile media coverage and an organization already on the defensive with recent issues.” He advised, first: "Always challenge (appropriately, of course) facts and assumptions that many rely on to inform their thinking and decision-making about risk and crisis management." Second: "In situations with palpable unknowns, where the illusion of validity in decision-making is a material threat, push hard to do research, polling and active listening to help identify the levers and pulleys that shape the operating and environmental realities of the present risk." Third: "Determine existing organizational challenges that will prevent leadership from making decisions consistently, effectively, and quickly in the face of uncertainty." Fourth: "Be aware of how current actions could dictate future strategy." Fifth: "Be ready to take on current risk to manage future risk."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"/&gt;

Phil Thornton has offered the following advice for avoiding the illusion of validity in the financial sector. First, "remember that just because previous generations were successful following certain approaches, replicating their actions may not necessarily be a good idea." Second, "remember that the consequences of decisions being wrong can be more important than the probability of them being correct."&lt;ref name="ezonomics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thornton|first1=Phil|title=What is the illusion of validity?|url=https://www.ezonomics.com/whatis/the_illusion_of_validity/|website=ezonomics|publisher=ezonomics|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General Definition ==
Given a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; and a [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; in  &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;, the '''image'''

of &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;m\colon I\to Y&lt;/math&gt;  satisfying the following [[universal property]]:
#There exists a morphism &lt;math&gt;e\colon X\to I&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f = m\, e&lt;/math&gt;.
#For any object &lt;math&gt; I' &lt;/math&gt; with a morphism &lt;math&gt;e'\colon X\to I'&lt;/math&gt; and a monomorphism &lt;math&gt;m'\colon I'\to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f = m'\, e'&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;v\colon I\to I'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;m = m'\, v&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remarks:'''
# such a factorization does not necessarily exist.
# &lt;math&gt; e&lt;/math&gt; is unique by definition of &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; [[Monomorphism|monic]].
# &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; is monic.
#  &lt;math&gt;m = m'\, v&lt;/math&gt; already implies that &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; is unique.

The image of &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{Im} f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\text{Im} (f)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proposition:''' If &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; has all equalizers then the &lt;math&gt; e&lt;/math&gt; in the factorization &lt;math&gt; f= m\, e&lt;/math&gt; of ''(1)'' is an [[epimorphism]].

{{Math proof|
Let  &lt;math&gt; \alpha,\, \beta&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt; \alpha\, e =\beta\, e&lt;/math&gt;, one needs to show that  &lt;math&gt; \alpha=\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Since the equalizer of &lt;math&gt; (\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; exists, &lt;math&gt; e&lt;/math&gt; factorizes as &lt;math&gt; e= q\, e'&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; q&lt;/math&gt; monic. But then &lt;math&gt; f= (m\, q)\, e'&lt;/math&gt; is a factorization of &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; (m\, q)&lt;/math&gt; monomorphism. Hence by the universal property of the image there exists a unique arrow &lt;math&gt; v: I \to Eq_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt; m = m\,q\, v&lt;/math&gt; and since  &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; is monic &lt;math&gt;  \text{id}_I = q\, v&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, one has &lt;math&gt; m\, q = (m q v)\,q &lt;/math&gt; and by the monomorphism property of &lt;math&gt; mq&lt;/math&gt; one obtains &lt;math&gt; \text{id}_{Eq_{\alpha,\beta}}= v\, q&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Image:E epimorphism.png|300px|center]]
This means that &lt;math&gt; I \equiv Eq_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and thus that &lt;math&gt; \text{id}_I = q\, v&lt;/math&gt; equalizes &lt;math&gt; (\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;, whence &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

== Second definition ==
In a category &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; with all finite [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[colimits]], the '''image''' is defined as the [[Equaliser (mathematics)#In category theory|equalizer]] &lt;math&gt;(Im,m)&lt;/math&gt; of the so-called '''cokernel pair''' &lt;math&gt; (Y \sqcup_X Y, i_1, i_2)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Cokernel pair.png|500px|center]]
[[Image:Image, Equalizer of the cokernel pair.png|500px|center]]

'''Remarks:''' 
# Finite bicompleteness of the category ensures that pushouts and equalizers exist.
# &lt;math&gt;(Im,m)&lt;/math&gt; can be called '''regular image''' as &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a [[regular monomorphism]], i.e. the equalizer of a pair of morphism. (Recall also that an equalizer is automatically a monomorphism).
# In an abelian category, the cokernel pair property can be written &lt;math&gt;i_1\, f = i_2\, f\ \Leftrightarrow\ (i_1 - i_2)\, f = 0 = 0\, f &lt;/math&gt; and the equalizer condition &lt;math&gt; i_1\, m = i_2\, m\ \Leftrightarrow\ (i_1 - i_2)\, m = 0 \, m&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, all monomorphisms are regular.

{{Math theorem|If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; always factorizes through regular monomorphisms, then the two definitions coincide.

{{Math proof|

'''First definition implies the second:''' Assume that ''(1)'' holds with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; regular monomorphism.
   &lt;!-- I got the proof from this site, dual statement
   https://qchu.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/regular-and-effective-monomorphisms-and-epimorphisms/
   "Proposition: Let f : a \to b be a morphism with a kernel pair a \times_b a. Then f is a regular epimorphism if and only if it is an effective epimorphism."
   --&gt;
* '''Equalization:''' one needs to show that &lt;math&gt; i_1\, m= i_2\, m&lt;/math&gt; . As the cokernel pair of &lt;math&gt;f,\ i_1\, f= i_2\, f&lt;/math&gt; and by previous proposition, since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has all equalizers, the arrow &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; in the factorization &lt;math&gt; f= m\, e&lt;/math&gt; is an [[epimorphism]], hence &lt;math&gt; i_1\, f= i_2\, f\ \Rightarrow \ i_1\, m= i_2\, m&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Universality:''' in a category with all colimits (or at least all pushouts) &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; itself admits a cokernel pair &lt;math&gt; (Y \sqcup_{I}Y, c_1, c_2) &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Cokernel pair m.png|450px|center]]
:Moreover, as a regular monomorphism, &lt;math&gt;(I,m)&lt;/math&gt; is the equalizer of a pair of morphisms &lt;math&gt; b_1, b_2: Y \longrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; but we claim here that it is also the equalizer of &lt;math&gt; c_1, c_2: Y \longrightarrow Y \sqcup_{I}Y&lt;/math&gt;. 
:Indeed, by construction &lt;math&gt; b_1\, m = b_2\, m&lt;/math&gt; thus the "cokernel pair" diagram for &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; yields a unique morphism &lt;math&gt; u': Y \sqcup_{I}Y \longrightarrow B &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; b_1 = u'\, c_1,\ b_2 = u'\, c_2&lt;/math&gt;. Now, a map &lt;math&gt; m': I'\longrightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; which equalizes &lt;math&gt; (c_1, c_2)&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt; b_1\, m'= u'\, c_1 \, m'= u'\, c_2\, m'= b_2\, m'&lt;/math&gt;, hence by the equalizer diagram for  &lt;math&gt; (b_1, b_2)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique map &lt;math&gt; h': I'\to I &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; m'= m\, h'&lt;/math&gt;.
:Finally, use the cokernel pair diagram (of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;j_1 := c_1,\ j_2 := c_2,\ Z:= Y\sqcup_I Y&lt;/math&gt; : there exists a unique &lt;math&gt; u: Y \sqcup_{X}Y \longrightarrow Y\sqcup_I Y &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; c_1 = u\, i_1,\ c_2 = u\, i_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, any map &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; which equalizes &lt;math&gt; (i_1, i_2)&lt;/math&gt; also equalizes &lt;math&gt; (c_1, c_2)&lt;/math&gt; and thus uniquely factorizes as &lt;math&gt;g= m\, h' &lt;/math&gt;. This exactly means that &lt;math&gt; (I,m) &lt;/math&gt; is the equalizer of &lt;math&gt; (i_1, i_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second definition implies the first:'''
    &lt;!-- Again, I dualized the proof from
    http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1783932/regular-coimages-in-a-finitely-complete-and-finitely-cocomplete-category --&gt;
* '''Factorization:''' taking &lt;math&gt; m' := f&lt;/math&gt; in the equalizer diagram (&lt;math&gt; m' &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt;), one obtains the factorization &lt;math&gt; f = m\, h &lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Universality:''' let &lt;math&gt; f = m'\, e' &lt;/math&gt; be a factorization with &lt;math&gt;m' &lt;/math&gt; regular monomorphism, i.e. the equalizer of some pair &lt;math&gt; (d_1, d_2) &lt;/math&gt;.

:Then  &lt;math&gt; d_1\, m'= d_2\, m'\ \Rightarrow \ d_1\, f=d_1\, m'\, e= d_2\, m'\, e= d_2\, f&lt;/math&gt; so that by the "cokernel pair" diagram (of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;), with &lt;math&gt;j_1 := d_1,\ j_2 := d_2,\ Z:= D&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique &lt;math&gt; u'': Y \sqcup_{X}Y \longrightarrow D &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; d_1 = u''\, i_1,\ d_2 = u''\, i_2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
 
In the [[category of sets]] the image of a morphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion from the ordinary [[image (mathematics)|image]] &lt;math&gt;\{f(x) ~|~ x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. In many [[Concrete category|concrete categories]] such as [[Category of groups|groups]], [[Category of abelian groups|abelian groups]] and (left- or right) [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], the image of a morphism is the image of the correspondent morphism in the category of sets.

In any [[normal category]] with a [[zero object]] and [[Kernel (category theory)|kernels]] and [[Cokernel (category theory)|cokernels]] for every morphism, the image of a morphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as follows:
 
:im ''f'' = ker coker ''f''
  
In an [[abelian category]] (which is in particular binormal), if ''f'' is a monomorphism then ''f'' = ker coker ''f'', and so ''f'' = im ''f''.

About six months after the [[invasion of Iraq]] rumors of '''Iraq prison abuse scandals''' started to emerge.

The best known abuse incidents occurred at the large [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. Graphic pictures of some of those abuse incidents were made public. Less well-known abuse incidents have been documented at American prisons throughout [[Iraq]].

==Timeline of events==
According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the coalition forces regularly use "[[torture]]-like" methods during the interrogation of suspects. Such methods were reportedly applied to people to find the hiding place of [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]]. [[British troops]] have also on occasion been accused of abusing Iraqi detainees. Such treatment violates article 17 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] and the [[United States|USA]] and [[UK|Britain]]'s official policies on [[combat]] and [[Military occupation|occupation]]. Despite numerous complaints by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], it took a year before the first US soldier was [[court-martial]]ed for their actions concerning abuse of Iraqis.

===Unknown date===
Eight [[United States Marine Corps|marine]] reservists were investigated for abuse and the death of a prisoner, outside [[Nasiriyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2555551 |date=May 7, 2004 |title=Details emerge of past cases |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913182100/http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2555551 |archivedate=September 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph leaked after the initial set shows Spc. [[Sabrina Harman]] smiling and giving a [[thumbs signal|thumbs up]] next to the body of [[Manadel al-Jamadi]]. Jamadi was reportedly beaten to death during interrogations in the prison's showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6988054/| title=Reports detail Abu Ghraib prison death; was it torture?| first=Seth| last=Hettena| date=February 17, 2005| publisher=MSNBC| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Death certificates repeatedly stated that prisoners had died "while sleeping", and of "natural reasons". Iraqi doctors are not allowed to investigate the deaths of prisoners, even if death certificates are allegedly forged. No investigations against US military doctors who are alleged to have forged death certificates have been reported.

===Spring 2003===
A US veteran sergeant reports witnessing torture of journalists and writers all over Iraq. Kurdistan region was not an exception. Writers without Borders embarrassed the Iraqi government quite frequently in reports covering minority, women and marginalised Iraqis from all over the country but with much focus on Baghdad, Karkuk, Salahedin and Mosul.

Honorably discharged US veteran, Sergeant Frank "Greg" Ford reports that he witnessed war crimes in Samarra, Iraq. According to Ford, several members of his own unit, the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade participated in the torture of Iraqi detainees as young as 14.&lt;ref name="Whitewashing Torture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/041209.html |title=Democracy Now! |publisher=Pacifica.org |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205174712/http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/041209.html |archivedate=February 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:n:Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup|Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup]] (Wikinews)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ather Karen al-Mowafakia died in [[Basra]], while in British custody. Details about the investigation are not known.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14210212&amp;method=full |title=18 Cases That Need Answers |publisher=Mirror |date=5 May 2004 |first=Tom Newton |last=Dunn |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509234030/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14210212&amp;method=full |archivedate=May 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Bartlam, a British soldier of the [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade]], was arrested after submitting film to a photo developers shop in [[Tamworth, England]] while on leave. The photographs depict a gagged Iraqi POW suspended hanging by rope from a fork lift, and other pictures seem to show prisoners being forced to perform sexual acts. Bartlam and two other soldiers were convicted at court martial of abuse - a fourth soldier was cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/4283255.stm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710195815/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/4283255.stm| archive-date=10 July 2012| date=23 February 2005| title=Photos led to abuse convictions| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2007-01-11 | location=London| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

British Lieutenant Colonel [[Tim Collins (soldier)|Tim Collins]] was alleged by US Army Major [[Re Biastre]] to have been responsible for mistreatment of Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. Lieutenant Colonel Collins was later cleared of any wrongdoing by an MOD investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/3198047.stm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720013037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/3198047.stm| archive-date=20 July 2012| date=1 September 2003| title=Officer cleared of Iraqi war crimes| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2007-01-11 | location=London| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2003===
In separate incidents, the Royal Military Police declared that Radhi Natna died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while in British custody, yet his family reports that he had no heart trouble; and the [[Royal Highland Regiment|Black Watch regiment]] arrested the 17-year-old Ahmad Jabber Kareem Ali in Basra, who then drowned after being ordered to swim across a river despite not being able to swim, according to his friend Ayad Salim Hanoon.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"/&gt;

[[United States Army Reserve|Army Reservists]] abused Prisoners at [[Camp Bucca]], and were later [[court-martial]]ed.

[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ennis Whitehead III]] reported that [[Master Sergeant]] [[Lisa Marie Girman]], a state trooper, "repeatedly kick[ed a prisoner] in the [[groin]], [[abdomen]] and head, and encouraging her subordinate [[soldier]]s to do the same,"

[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Vic Harris reported that [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Scott A. McKenzie]] who worked at a [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]] [[Basic Combat Training|boot-camp]]-style [[prison]], and  [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] [[Timothy F. Canjar]]: held prisoners' legs, encouraged others to then kick them in the groin, stepped on their previously injured arms, and made false sworn statements to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army Criminal Investigation Division]].

They received [[Military discharge|"general under honorable conditions" discharges]], were ordered to forfeit two months' salary, and returned to the United States.

[[Sergeant]] [[Shawna Edmondson]], also involved in the case, received an "other-than-honorable" discharge, after she requested it instead of being court-martialed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001830549_discharge06.html |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=January 6, 2004 |title=3 reservists discharged from Army after abuse |first=Diana |last=Elias |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010024050/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001830549_discharge06.html |archivedate=October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hossam Shaltout]] said the abuse at Camp Bucca was similar to that at [[Abu Ghraib (prison)|Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], and that his torture included [[scorpion]]s placed on his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/08/1083911446364.html| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald| title=Ex-prisoners tells of more abuses| date=May 10, 2004| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Said Shabram died in custody, but no information of the investigation were made public.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"/&gt;

===July to December 2003===
American forces detained the family of an unidentified lieutenant general to induce him to turn himself in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A54345-2003Jul27| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918100436/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A54345-2003Jul27| dead-url=yes| archive-date=September 18, 2012|  title=U.S. Adopts Aggressive Tactics on Iraqi Fighters| first=Thomas E.| last=Ricks| publisher=Washington Post| date=July 28, 2003| page=A01| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|abuses at Abu Ghraib prison]] were reportedly committed by MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/05/06/AR2005040206744.html| title=New Prison Images Emerge| first= Christian| last=Davenport| date=May 6, 2004| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are allegations that private contractors contributed to them as well and that intelligence agencies such as the [[CIA]] ordered them to do so in order to break prisoners for interrogations. It is said to be a usual practice in other US prisons as well, such as in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Camp X-Ray|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11017-2004May8.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022030050/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11017-2004May8.html| archive-date=2012-10-22| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-27 | work=The Washington Post| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] submitted a detailed report to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in October 2003 about abuses in prisons, and the president of the Red Cross stated he had informed high-ranking members of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration about the abuses during a meeting in the [[White House]] in January 2004. A soldier came forward that month with photos of abuse that he found disturbing, some showed the stacking of prisoners into a human pyramid, with one prisoner's skin visibly bearing a slur written in English. Another showed a prisoner being forced to stand on a box with wires attached to his head and hands, who had reportedly been told that if he fell off the box, he would be electrocuted. Photos released to the public later included a person being attacked by a guard dog, which the soldier involved described as being useful for intimidation of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorker.com/printable/?fact/040517fa_fact2 |title=404 error |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205005825/http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?fact%2F040517fa_fact2 |archivedate=February  5, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that an Iraqi hired as a translator raped a juvenile male prisoner while a female soldier took pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43783-2004May20.html| title=New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge| author=Scott Higham and Joe Stephens| publisher=Washington Post| date=May 21, 2004| page=A01| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mg.co.za/Content/l3.asp?ao=66729| title=US general linked to Abu Ghraib abuse| date=22 May 2004| publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian Online| accessdate=2006-05-28| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603013743/http://www.mg.co.za/Content/l3.asp?ao=66729| archivedate=3 June 2004| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges have been brought against the contractor because he does not fall under military jurisdiction; it is questionable whether any charges will or even can be brought against him.

In March 2004, 6 soldiers in Abu Ghraib were charged with dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and sexual abuse. 17 others were suspended from duty, including the seven U.S. officers who ran the prison. Also recommended for discipline was [[Brigadier general|Brig. Gen]] [[Janis Karpinski]], the commander of the 800th brigade. The [[International Red Cross|Red Cross]], which had access to these prisons, has stated that the instances of torture were not aberrations but were systemic. Some officers have attempted to defend themselves by saying that they were only doing their duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4907419/ns/msnbc-about_msnbc_tv/t/deborah-norville-tonight-may/#.Uzh6cPldWSp | title=Deborah Norville MSNBC | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to ongoing complaints, the US military initiated a program to reform the internment and treatment systems. The reforms are expected to increase safeguards for prisoners' rights, to ensure each prisoner receives a copy of their internment order, and has their charges explained to them within 72 hours. They additionally plan to publicly post information about detainees so that family members can know what happened to their loved ones. Reforms were made in March 2004.

Theft of prisoner's possessions by soldiers, dirty, cramped quarters and bad food, prisoners forced into uncomfortable positions for prolonged periods of time, extreme exposure to the elements, and excessive jailings of people based on the paid testimony of individual informants were reported. 55-year-old cafe owner Mahmoud Khodair, who was arrested and held for six months before being released in early march without ever knowing what he was charged with, stated, "It was just like hell", and "Nothing has changed since Saddam. Before, the Mukhabarat [secret police] would take us away, and at least they wouldn't blow down the door. Now, some informant fingers you and gets $100 even if you're innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/28/iraqi_detentions_fuel_anti_us_sentiment?mode=PF| title= Iraqi detentions fuel anti-US sentiment| first=Thanassis| last=Cambanis| newspaper=Boston Globe| date=2004-03-28| accessdate=2006-05-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060116163920/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/28/iraqi_detentions_fuel_anti_us_sentiment?mode=PF |archivedate = January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During April 2004 the media started to report on the abuse. The journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] (who was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his disclosure of the [[Vietnam War]] tragedy at the hamlet of [[My Lai]]) published a series of articles in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' with photo coverage of U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] on 2004-04-30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hersh |first=Seymour |date=May 10, 2004 |title=Torture at Abu Ghraib |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Dan Rather, the deputy director of operations for the US-led coalition, Brig. Gen. [[Mark Kimmitt]], stated "We're appalled. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day. They represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down. If we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect, we can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers."

On May 1, 2004, photos of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq being abused and humiliated by United States soldiers provoke an international outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1207572,00.html| title=British investigate 10 claims of abuse| date=May 1, 2004| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-05-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthering the charges, excerpts from the [[Abu Ghraib]] [[Taguba report]]  were published on May 3, 2004.

The release of the photographs and reports had led to renewed calls for investigations into the abuses reported in other US military prisons, such as [[Camp X-Ray]] and [[Camp Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=14042696_method=full_siteid=50143_headline=-MY-HELL-IN-CAMP-X-RAY-name_page.html| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2004, reporters for the Guardian documented a coercive technique which soldiers called "bitch in a box". The prisoner was shoved into the trunk of a car on a hot day, and driven around until the prisoner was near ready to pass out. Another technique documented was "waterboarding", which involves water being poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. They also interviewed many soldiers not involved in the current scandal, who claimed that they were taught to use [[sleep deprivation]], to stage mock executions, and to use other procedures. One platoon leader who objected to these practices was reportedly told that his stand could end his military career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1216579,00.html| title=US forces were taught torture techniques| first=Suzanne| last=Goldenberg| date=May 14, 2004| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-05-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Secretary of Defense|USA Defence Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] told an armed services committee of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on 2004-05-07 that "There are a lot more photographs and videos that exist [...] I looked at them last night and they're hard to believe [...] The pictures I've seen depict conduct, behaviour that is so brutal and so cruel and so inhumane that anyone engaged in it or involved in it would have to be brought to justice."

In a scene described as "surreal" by AFP, it was found in mid May, 2004 that US troops were handing out cash to freed prisoners along with a note stating "You have not been mistreated.". A reporter visiting the prison Camp War Horse described the tour:

:"Have you been mistreated?" the governor asks the detainees, dressed in orange boilersuits.

:"No. We have never been tortured," chorused those behind bars as some 50 soldiers stood nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/05/17/d40517130288.htm| volume=4| issue=342 | date=May 17, 2004| title=US military now trying to buy abused prisoners| newspaper=The Daily Star| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Daily Mirror'' false allegations====
Alleged photographs of prisoner abuses by UK troops were published by the ''[[The Daily Mirror|Daily Mirror]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/newspapers/1_may_2004/html/3.stm| title=Daily Mirror front page| date=1 May 2004| accessdate=2006-05-28 | work=BBC News | location=London}} (appears to be missing as of last access date)&lt;/ref&gt; within 48 hours of the breaking of the story of abuses by US troops in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq.

[[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|General Sir Mike Jackson]], [[British Army|Chief of the General Staff]], said "if proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen's uniform and they have besmirched the Army's good name and conduct".

The authenticity of the photographs was called into question a day later. In particular, a number of specifics in the images, such as the type of rifles the soldiers in the pictures are carrying and the type of truck pictured did not match the equipment used by UK troops in Iraq. The ''Mirror'' responded to these criticisms of the photographs on May 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14205311&amp;method=full |date=3 May 2004 |title=xxxx |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305090751/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14205311&amp;method=full |archivedate=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist Tara McKelvey, writing for the magazine The American Prospect, interviewed an Iraqi sheik in the fall of 2004 about this issue and he told her that "he had seen a young girl, 15 years old, with internal bleeding. She had been raped over and over again by the soldiers, and she could no longer talk. He is a deeply religious man. But that night, he shouted at Allah. ‘How is it possible that you are there and these things are happening?!' he said.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prospect.org/article/unusual-suspects | title=Usual Subjects | publisher=The American Prospect | accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 2004===
The International Red Cross reports that more than 100 children were kept in six different prisons of the coalition. Witnesses say US forces also abused children and youths. Soldier Samuel Provance from Abu Ghraib reported the harassment of a 15- to 16-year-old girl in her cell as well as a 16-year-old boy who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then covered with mud. Allegations have been made that children have been subjected to torture and rape. This has been used to make detained parents talk in cases where other interrogation methods have failed. Seymour Hersh told a San Francisco audience: "what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys, children, in cases that have been [video] recorded, the boys were sodomized, with the cameras rolling... the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking." An unpublished [[UNICEF]] report is said to include statements about children that were arrested in Basra and Kerbela and routinely detained in Umm Kasr.

===December 2004===
Reports of mock executions by the US Marines in Iraq have surfaced in December 2004, as the [[ACLU]] published internal documents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) obtained through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17206&amp;c=206 ACLU]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several torture cases were also reported, notably torture by electricity, beatings, and sprayings of prisoners with fire extinguishers.

On 21 December, the [[ACLU]] released further documents&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17224&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union : Newly Released Documents Show Possible Interference by Army Commander In Investigation Into Murder of Iraqi Detainee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; documenting tortures. Notably, in a case of shooting of suspects without warning, Army commanders are reported to have interfered with the investigation. Procedures of autopsy of detainees who died in unclear circumstances have been canceled by battalion and group commands. Other cases include 
*An apparent attempt by a soldier in Baghdad to force a detainee to hold a gun to create the appearance of a justifiable homicide.
*Two mock executions of Iraqi juveniles by Army personnel (documents obtained by the ACLU two weeks ago showed that U.S. Marines had also conducted a mock execution of juvenile detainees).
*Allegations of a competition among Army dog handlers at Abu Ghraib prison to see who could make Iraqi detainees urinate themselves the fastest.
*The use of death threats during interrogations. Command failures in providing appropriate training to military interrogators in Baghdad detention facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/doa.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116124849/http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/doa.html |date=November 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2005, the ACLU accused the Pentagon of deliberately closing investigations over Human Rights violations and torture cases before they were over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17350&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union : Newly Released Investigative Files Provide Further Evidence Soldiers Not Held Accountable for Abuse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch accused Iraqi security forces of using torture and improper treatments on prisoners. Arbitrary arrests and long periods of isolation are now common. Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 said they had been tortured during interrogation. [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: 
"A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity" . 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn't even see the paper and I don't know what I signed."  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, arbitrary detention, refusal of trials, access to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/26/iraq10053.htm Iraq: Torture Continues at Hands of New Government (Human Rights Watch, 25-1-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4203637.stm Iraqi forces 'committing abuse' (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6863916/ Torture in Iraq still routine, report says (MSNBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2005===
A Pentagon order is mentioned in a military report filed on May 16, 2005 ordering U.S. personnel to turn a blind eye to Iraqi torture by refraining from investigating instances of apparent detainee abuse by Iraqi personnel, unless the investigation is first approved by U.S. headquarters: "Provided the initial report confirms US forces were not involved in the detainee abuse, no further investigation will be conducted unless directed by HHQ." Such approval was rarely granted.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 2010 Oct. 24, "The Secret Iraq Files: The War US Turned Blind Eye to Torture; Leaked Documents on Iraq War Contain Thousands of Allegations of Abuse, But a Pentagon Order Told Troops to Ignore Them," http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/20101022161828428516.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report published by Human Rights Watch in September 2005, U.S. Troops are accused to routinely torture prisoners in Iraq. Two sergeants and a captain describe e.g. the breaking of a detainee’s leg, and applying chemical substances to detainees’ skin and eyes. Capt. [[Ian Fishback]] of the 82nd Airborne who made persistent efforts over 17 months to raise concerns about detainee abuse with his chain of command was consistently told to ignore abuses and to “consider your career.” When he made an appointment with Senate staff members of Senators [[John McCain]] and [[John Warner]], he says his commanding officer denied him a pass to leave his base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/09/25/usint11776.htm New Accounts of Torture by U.S. Troops (Human Rights Watch, 24-9-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/politics/24abuse.html | work=The New York Times | title=3 in 82nd Airborne Say Beating Iraqi Prisoners Was Routine | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=2005-09-24 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"the difficulties [our troops face] come from the two decisions that I had the most insight into that were made in this more or less alternative decision-making process. And those two decisions were the inept and incompetent planning for post-invasion Iraq, and [...] the decision... from that alternative decision-making process to depart from the Geneva Conventions and from international law, in general.

:"[The President's memorandum said] the spirit of Geneva would be adhered to... consistent with military necessity. [...] It did not say 'consistent with national security demands.' It did not say 'consistent with the demands of the war on terror.' It said 'consistent with military needs.' Now, military needs are very simple and clear to a man like me who spent 31 years in the military. It means that if one of my buddy's life is threatened or my life is threatened, I can take drastic action. I can even shoot a detainee. And I can expect not to be punished under Geneva, or at least if I am court-martialed, I have a defense. It doesn't mean that I can take a detainee in a cold, dark cell in Bagram, Afghanistan, for example, in December 2002, shackled to the wall, and pour cold water on him at intervals when the outside temperature is 50 degrees anyway, and eventually kill him, which is what happened."''

The [[Haditha killings]] occurred on November 19 in the town of [[Haditha, Iraq]]. A convoy of [[United States Marines]] was attacked with an [[improvised explosive device]] which killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. Up to twenty-four Iraqis were subsequently killed; it is alleged that they were non-combatant local residents who were massacred by Marines in the aftermath of the insurgent attack.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/01/military.training/index.html U.S. military mourns 'tragic' Haditha deaths]'', CNN.

===December 2005===
John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), told [[Reuters]] that there were an estimated 14,000 people being held in prison in Iraq contrary to UN Resolution 1546, according to which the US government claims legal permission to occupy Iraq. In a December 5, 2005, interview, Pace said,

:"All [prisoners in Iraq] except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison.

:"Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.

:"It's very rare to get judges ordering you to be released and effectively the police respecting that order.

:"We have cases also where the judge who has ordered a group of people to be released, about 50-60 people, and the police, the Interior Ministry simply refuses.

:"We have another case in another part of the country where the judge was actually the subject of reprisal for having found people not getting, as ordered, their release.

:"The judge is now in jail.

:"The judiciary has a lot to answer for in this country. It is really not carrying out its duties," he said, adding that bribes were sometimes paid for jobs in the judiciary and police.

:"This is not denied," Pace said. "This is symptomatic of the corruption problems in this country and stands in the way of any kind of rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US detentions abuse Iraq mandate: UN |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/US-detentions-abuse-Iraq-mandate-UN/2005/12/05/1133631177030.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2006===
According to the Iraqi Defense Ministry, Private First Class Thomas Tucker and Private First Class Kristian Menchaca were reportedly "killed in a barbaric way," "slaughtered," and tortured to death, and their bodies were so mutilated that DNA tests are being performed to help identify their remains. The alleged group has said it was a revenge for the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl who was dishonoured by soldiers of the same brigade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/35231?page_no=2 'Jihadi Porn' Puts Beheadings Online - June 28, 2006 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2009===
In 2009, an additional 21 color photographs surfaced, showing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq being abused by their U.S. captors.
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) said, "[T]he government had long argued that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated and was an aberration. The new photos would show that the abuse was more widespread." President [[Barack Obama]] initially indicated he would not fight the release of the photographs, but "reversed course in May and authorized an appeal to the high court." "The Obama administration believe[d] giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] would short-circuit a lawsuit filed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] under the Freedom of Information Act." On Oct 10, 2009 the US "Congress [was] set to allow [[the Pentagon]] to keep new pictures ... from the public"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress could thwart bid to view abuse photos |author=Mark Sherman |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 10, 2009 |url=https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/congress-could-thwart-bid-to-view-abuse-photos-1.1515034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010-present===
On February 3, 2010, David A. Larson, an elected official in California who has a relationship with government contract personnel, made disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) alleging that under the Bush Administration, prisoners detained at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and undisclosed "black sites" were being used as involuntary research subjects for human biomedical experimentation, behavior modification research, and drug-testosterone delivery in a manner similar to past CIA [[Project MKULTRA]] activities investigated in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and Inuoye. The allegation supports information contained in an International Red Cross report relative to the expanded role of CIA medical personnel in torture and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130102094447/http://www.electlarson.com/issues.htm On the Issues, David A.

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghriab- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=15 July 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the US detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, in which [[human rights]] abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the security forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say that "Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. US authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by US forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2010 nearly 400,000 secret [[United States]] army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, [[the Guardian]] and several other [[international]] media organisations through the [[whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. Among others, the logs detail how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, [[torture]], [[rape]] and even [[murder]] by [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] police and soldiers, whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished and that US troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html WikiLeaks' Iraq War Logs: US Troops Abused Prisoners For Years After Abu Ghraib]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the UK and the US have condemned the unauthorised release of classified material, but did not question its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11612731 Wikileaks: Iraq war logs 'reveal truth about conflict']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Several sets of investigations, both congressional via the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], military via [[courts-martial]], and criminal for non-military contractors, were launched in response to the scandal.

[[Seymour Hersh]], who exposed the Abu Ghraib scandal, and reports in Newsweek, has taken the case even further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact Annals of National Security: The Gray Zone: The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302212815/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact |date=March 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989438/ The Roots of Torture - Newsweek: World News - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415220915/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989438/ |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] instituted a policy that "encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq.". This policy stemmed from an earlier policy taken toward al-Qaeda prisoners. A memo to the Bush White House from counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] claimed that the new sort of war renders the Geneva Conventions' limitations on interrogating enemy prisoners "obsolete". The program was approved by the [[CIA]], [[NSA]], and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. President [[George W. Bush]] was informed of it. The [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] [[Steven Cambone]] administered the operation. His deputy, [[William Boykin]], instructed the head of operations at [[Camp X-ray]] [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Geoffrey Miller (MG)|Geoffrey Miller]] to do the same at [[Abu Ghraib]]. Miller told Brig. Gen. [[Janis Karpinski]] that the prison would now be dedicated to gathering intelligence.   [[Douglas Feith]] and [[William J. Haynes, II|William Haynes]] were also involved in the operation.

On May 18, 2004, a military intelligence analyst named [[Samuel Provance]] came out to the press, stating "There's definitely a cover-up". Provance, who ran a computer network used by military intelligence in the prison and who had been ordered not to speak to the press, told ABC News "Anything [the MPs] were to do legally or otherwise, they were to take those commands from the interrogators," and that the sexual humiliation began as a technique ordered by the investigators. He described several of the goings-on in the prison that he witnessed, such as the punching people in the neck hard enough to knock them unconscious after assuring them they weren't going to be hit, in order to catch them off guard. He also stated that Maj. Gen. [[George Fay]], the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, has shown little interest in investigating the interrogators and has gone only after the MPs, and that there is a culture of silence right now among those involved, who fear that if they say anything, the investigations will turn to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/Investigation/abu_ghraib_cover_up_040518.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2004, a court martial hearing was held for Cpl. [[Charles Graner|Charles A. Graner Jr.]], who has been accused of being the ringleader of the group employing torture at Abu Ghraib. In an unexpected move, all three key witnesses - Lt. Col. [[Steven L. Jordan]], Capt. Donald J. Reese, and contractor Adel L. Nakhla - refused to testify. This is an almost unheard of action. Under court martial proceedings, one cannot refuse to testify unless they have a belief that they will be exposed to criminal charges for doing so. Consequently, it is likely that the investigative proceedings will be forced to move higher up the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-prison19may19,1,5951548,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | archive-url=https://archive.is/20040609204053/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-prison19may19,1,5951548,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2004-06-09 | work=Los Angeles Times }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jesus and the Disinherited''''' is a 1949 book by [[African-American]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], theologian, and [[civil rights]] leader [[Howard Thurman]].

In the book, Thurman interprets the teachings of [[Jesus]] through the experience of the oppressed and discusses [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] responses to oppression. The book developed out of a series of lectures that Thurman presented at [[Huston–Tillotson University|Samuel Huston College]] in [[Austin, Texas]] during April 1948."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thurman |first=Howard |date=2012 |title=Jesus and the Disinherited |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Beacon Press |page=8 |isbn=0807010294 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2017}}

The '''Kanun''' is a set of traditional [[Albania]]n laws. The Kanun was primarily oral and only in the 20th century was it published in writing.&lt;ref name="Co22"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cook| first = Bernard| title = Europe since 1945 an encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;pg=PA22| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 2001| publisher = Garland Publishing| isbn = 0-8153-4057-5| page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kanun of [[Lekë Dukagjini]] ({{lang|sq|Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit}}) was codified in the 15th century.  Six later variations eventually evolved:
*The Old Kanun ({{lang-sq|Kanun i vjetër}});
*The Kanun of [[Mirdita]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Mirditës}});
*The Kanun of [[Pukë]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Pukës}});
*The Kanun of [[Çermenikë]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Çermenikës}});
*The Kanun of Pope Julius ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Papa Zhulit}});
*The Kanun of [[Labëria]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Labërisë}});&lt;ref&gt;R. Zojzi The Code of Labëria ({{lang-sq|"Kanuni i Labërisë" Tirana}} (Institute of Folk Culture Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Kanun of [[Skanderbeg]] ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Skënderbeut}})&lt;ref&gt;Ilia, I.F. Kanuni i Skenderbegut (1993) The Code of Skanderbeg Shkoder Publisher:Archbishop of Shkodra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Young| first = Antonia| title = Women Who Become Men Albanian Sworn Virgins| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jDgqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA732| year = 2000| publisher = Bloomsbury Academic| isbn = 978-1-85973-340-0| page = 732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as The Kanun of Arbëria ({{lang-sq|Kanuni i Arbërisë}}).

The Kanun of Skanderbeg is the closest in similarity with the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, and the latter is usually the most known and is also regarded as a synonym of the word ''kanun''. The Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini was developed by Lekë Dukagjini, who codified the existing customary laws.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt; It has been used mostly in northern and central [[Albania]] and surrounding areas formerly in Yugoslavia where there is a large [[ethnic Albanian]] population; [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It was first codified in the 15th century but the use of it has been outspread much earlier in time. It was used under that form until the 20th century, and revived recently after the fall of the [[History of Communist Albania|communist regime]] in the early 1990s.

==Etymology==
The term ''kanun'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "{{lang|el|κανών}}" ("canon"), meaning amongst others "pole" or "rule"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkanw%2Fn κανών], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and was transported from Greek to Arabic and then into early Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marii͡a Nikolaeva Todorova| title = Balkan Identities Nation and Memory| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4EVGvQNFD7gC&amp;pg=PA111| year = 2004| publisher = NYU Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-8279-8| page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanun was also known by the word of ''Doke''.

== Origin ==
The practice of the oral laws that [[Lekë Dukagjini]] codified in the Kanun was suggested by [[Edith Durham]] as dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="kolor"&gt;{{cite book| last = Foyer-Merib| first = the| title = Kolor. Journal on moving communities| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SZqcmmn2YsgC&amp;pg=PA10| year = 2006| publisher = Garant| isbn = 90-441-2008-5| page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have conjectured that the Kanun may derive from ancient Illyrian tribal laws.&lt;ref&gt;Dukagjini, L., Gjecov, S., Fox, L. ''Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit''. Gjonlekaj Publishing Co., 1989. p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have suggested that the Kanun has retained elements from Indo-European prehistoric eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Cancik| first1 = Hubert| last2 = Schneider| first2 = Helmuth| title = Brill's New Pauly Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical Tradition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UqE5SwAACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Brill| isbn = 90-04-14221-5| page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However several stratifications can be easily observed in the code, beginning with pre-Indo-European, Indo-European, Ancient Greek, Roman, general Balkan and Osmanli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Sellers| first1 = Mortimer| last2 = Tomaszewski| first2 = Tadeusz| title = The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspective| year = 2010| publisher = Springer Verlag| isbn = 978-90-481-3748-0| page = 205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Serbian authors T. O. Oraovac&lt;ref&gt;T. O. Oraovac, Albansko pitanje i srpsko pravo, Beograd, 1913, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and S. S. Djuric, it is largely based on [[Dušan's Code]], the constitution of the [[Serbian Empire]] (enacted 1349), which at the time [[Albania under the Serbian Empire|held the whole of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilhelm-Stempin| first = Nikolaus| title = Das albanische Gewohnheitsrecht aus der Perspektive der rechtlichen Volkskunde| year = 2009| publisher = GRIN Verlag| isbn = 3-640-40128-X| page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noel Malcolm speculates that an article in Dušan's Code was an early attempt to clamp down on the self-administered customary law of the mountains, as later codified in the Kanun of Lek Dukagjin, and if so, this would be the earliest evidence that such [[customary law]]s were in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Malcolm| first = Noel| title = Kosovo A short history| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vcrWnQEACAAJ| year = 1998| publisher = New York University Press| isbn = 0-8147-5598-4| page = 54| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the similarities the majority of scientists agree that the Code of Leke Dukagjini is not the same as Dusans Code and that such conclusions are "far-fetched". When the Turkish invaders conquered the medieval Serbian state many customary laws of social life amongst the Balkan peoples were brought back to use, this included the Albanians.&lt;ref name="The Code of Leke Dukagjini"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trnavci|first1=Professor Genc|title=Dr Genc Trnavci - The Code of Leke Dukajgini|url=http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|website=www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|page=13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615120555/http://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~hoken/Kazuhiko/2008Customarylaw.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The town of Shkodra had for example, before Dušan's Code, its own customary laws and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lala|first1=Etleva|title=Women's Status in Medieval Albanian Laws|url=https://www.docdroid.net/vB0Ly5t/womens-status-in-medieval-albanian-laws.pdf.html|website=Etleva Lala, Sixth conference of the International Research Network, "Gender differences in the History of European Legal Cultures"|publisher=Solivagus, Kiel 2014|accessdate=5 February 2016}} P. 3-4 of the PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and usage ==
The Law of Lek Dukagjini (kanun) was named after a medieval prince [[Lekë Dukagjini]] of the fifteenth century who ruled in northern Albania and codified the customary laws of the highlands.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt; The code was written down only in the 19th century by [[Shtjefën Gjeçovi]] and partially published in the ''[[Hylli i Drites]]'' periodical in 1913.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; The full version appeared only in 1933 after Gjeçovi's death in 1926.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; In 1989 a dual English-Albanian version was published.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author4=Shtjefën Gjeçovi |author5=Leonard Fox| last1 = Dukagjini| first1 = Lekë| last2 = Gjeçov| first2 = Shtjefën| last3 = Fox| first3 = Leonard| title = Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dZ-RAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1989| publisher = Gjonlekaj Pub. Co| isbn = 978-0-9622141-0-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then replicated in a 1992 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Anton Logoreci |translator=Martin Camaj  |last1 = Dukagjini| first1 = Lekë| last2 = Gjeçov| first2 = Shtjefën| last3 = Fox| first3 = Leonard| title = Code of Leke Dukagjini| url = http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/ISBNInquiry.asp?r=1&amp;IF=N&amp;EAN=9780962214103&amp;cm_mmc=Google%20Book%20Search-_-k118169-_-j14953980-_-Googe%20Book%20Search%20(non-B%26N%20Imprint)| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1992| publisher = Gjonlekaj Publishing Company| isbn = 0-9622141-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the laws are attributed to Lekë Dukagjini, the laws evolved over time as a way to bring law and rule to these lands. The Kanun is divided into [[Kanun (Albania)#Content|12 sections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/yoa01/ Religion and Society in Present-Day Albania] by Antonia Young&lt;/ref&gt; and Gjeçovi's version has 1,262 articles which regulate all aspects of the mountainous life: economic organisation of the household, hospitality, brotherhood, clan, boundaries, work, marriage, land, and so on.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt; The ''[[Besa (Albanian culture)|Besa]]'' (personal honour, compare with [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''fides'') and [[Honour#Cultures of honour and cultures of law|nderi]] (family honour, [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''honor'') are of prime importance throughout the code as the cornerstone of personal and social conduct.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych115"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=115.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kanun applies to both Christian and Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name=Co22/&gt;

Some of the most controversial rules of the Kanun (in particular book 10 section 3) specify how murder is supposed to be handled, which often in the past and sometimes still now led to [[blood feud]]s that last until all the men of the two involved families are killed.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014/&gt; In situations of murder tribal law stipulates the principle of ''koka për kokë'' (head for a head) where the relatives of the victim are obliged to seek ''gjakmarje'' (blood vengeance).&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"/&gt;  Women are only seen as producers of offspring and are referred to in a [[Misogyny|discriminatory manner]] and so are not considered worthy targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014&gt;{{cite news|title='We'll Get You': An Albanian Boy's Life Ruined by Blood Feuds|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/blood-feuds-still-prevalent-in-albania-a-973498.html|accessdate=12 June 2014|work=[[Spiegel Online]]|publisher=Spiegel Online GmbH|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian name for blood feud is ''[[Gjakmarrja]]''. In some parts of the country, the Kanun resembles the Italian vendetta.&lt;ref name="kanun"&gt;{{cite news |title=Reportage : Albanie, la Bible contre la vendetta |author=Angélique Kourounis |author2=Thomas Iacobi |author3= Jean Christophe Georgoustsos|author4=Nikos Arapoglou|url=http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/religion/faut-pas-croire/4439559-reportage-albanie-la-bible-contre-la-vendetta.html |format=video|newspaper=Faut pas croire |publisher= [[Radio télévision suisse]]|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date= 17 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2013 |language=French}} Des jeunes catholiques, soutenus par une religieuse, ont brisé la loi du silence pour combattre le « kanun », un code d'honneur ancestral qui justifie la vengeance et le meurtre.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules have resurfaced during the 1990s in Northern Albania, since people had no faith in the powerless local government and police. There are organizations that try to mediate between feuding families and try to get them to "pardon the blood" ({{lang-sq|Falja e Gjakut}}), but often the only resort is for men of age to stay in their homes, which are considered a safe refuge by the Kanuni, or flee the country. Tribal also held that thieves would need to pay fines to the relative amount that was stolen.&lt;ref name="Gawrych30"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former communist leader of Albania [[Enver Hoxha]] effectively stopped the practice of Kanun with hard repression and a very strong state police. However, after the fall of communism, some communities have tried to rediscover the old traditions, but some of their parts have been lost, leading to fears of misinterpretation.

Notably, the current Albanian Penal Code does not contain any provisions from the Kanun that deal with blood feuds, and no acknowledgment of this code is made in the contemporary Albanian legal system.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 2014 about 3,000 Albanian families were estimated to be involved in blood feuds and this since the fall of Communism has led to the deaths of 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=spiegel_06June2014/&gt;

== Pillars of the Kanun ==
The Kanun is based on four pillars:
* Honour ({{lang-sq|Nderi}})
* Hospitality ({{lang-sq|Mikpritja}})
* Right Conduct ({{lang-sq|Sjellja}})

==Kanun in literature and film==
Albanian writer [[Ismail Kadare]] evokes the Kanun several times in his books and has it as the main theme in his novel [[Broken April]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longitudebooks.com/find/p/67067/mcms.html|title=Broken April - Ismail Kadare|publisher=Longitude|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also evoques the kanun in his novel {{lang|sq|Komisioni i festës}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Komisioni i festës|last=Kadare|first=Ismail|year=1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHIOgAACAAJ|location=Prishtinë|publisher=Rilindja}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|The Celebration Commission}}), where Kadare literally describes the [[Monastir massacre of 1830]] as the struggle between two empires: the Albanian Kanun with its code of ''besa'' and the Ottoman Empire itself.&lt;ref name="Co82"&gt;{{cite book| last = Colafato| first = Michele| title = Emozioni e confini per una sociologia delle relazioni etniche| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KS5NwIa3Pc0C| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 1998| publisher = Meltemi Editore srl| isbn = 88-86479-69-7| page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kadare in his [[Literary criticism|literary critique]] book {{lang|sq|Eskili, ky humbës i madh}} ({{lang-en|Aeschylus, this big loser}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kadare| first = Ismail| title = Eskili, ky humbës i madh| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1t6eLAAACAAJ| accessdate = 2010-07-01| year = 2006| publisher = Onufri| location = Tirana| isbn = 99943-32-63-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''loser'' refers to the great number of tragedies that were lost from [[Aeschylus]], there are evident similarities between the ''kanun'' and the [[feud|vendetta]]&lt;ref name="kanun" /&gt; customs in all the Mediterranean countries.

[[Barbara Nadel]]'s ''Deep Waters''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Nadel| first = Barbara| title = Deep Waters| url = https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Waters-Inspector-Ikmen-Mysteries/dp/0747267197| year = 2002| publisher = Headline Book Pub Limited| isbn = 0-7472-6719-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kanun and [[Gjakmarrja]].

[[Joshua Marston]]'s 2011 film [[The Forgiveness of Blood]], a drama set in modern-day Albania, deals with the Kanun. The film relates a blood feud between two families in Northern Albania, focusing primarily on how the feud affects the children of one family.

The Kanun is referred to in season 6, episode 9 of [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]] ("[[Blasters (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|Blasters]]") as the explanation for the sudden retreat of a group of Albanian assassins.

The Kanun plays a major role in the Belgian movie [[Dossier K]].

[[Elvira Dones]]'s ''Sworn Virgin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Dones| first = Elvira| title = Sworn Virgin| url = https://www.amazon.com/Sworn-Virgin-Elvira-Dones-ebook/dp/B00IHH2NZI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400792599&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sworn+virgin| year = 2014| publisher = And Other Stories| isbn = 978-1-908276-34-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Kanun and women's practice of swearing celibacy in return to being accepted as men by all local villagers.

Belgian TV maker Tom Waes visited Albania during one of the shows in his series Reizen Waes. He was served spit roasted goat and was offered the head of the goat. According to Kanun rules, this is how they honor a guest during dinner.&lt;ref&gt;http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/media/1.2235741&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kanun is referred to in "The Closer" Season 6 | Episode 14 "The investigation into the Albanian blood feud" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1626048/

{{Main|Cutthroat trout}}
'''Lahontan cutthroat trout''' (''Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi'') is the largest [[subspecies]] of [[cutthroat trout]], and the [[List of U.S. state fish|state fish]] of [[Nevada]]. It is one of three subspecies of cutthroat trout that are listed as [[Endangered Species Act|federally threatened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lahontan cutthroat trout |publisher=U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Nevada Office |url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/protected_species/fish/species/lct.html |accessdate=2012-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history==
[[File:lahontan pyramid.jpg|thumb |right |250px |Lahontan cutthroat trout, lake form, from [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], [[Nevada]].]]
[[File:Informal Remarks of the President in Imlay, Nevada - NARA - 197812.tif|250px |right |thumb |1938 remarks by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|FDR]] on the taste of Nevada trout.]]

The Lahontan cutthroat is native to the drainages of the [[Truckee River]], [[Humboldt River]], [[Carson River]], [[Walker River (Nevada)|Walker River]], [[Quinn River]] and several smaller rivers in the [[Great Basin]] of [[North America]].&lt;ref name=Behnke&gt;{{cite book |title=Native Trout of Western North America |author=Robert J. Behnke |location=Bethesda, Maryland |publisher=American Fisheries Society Press |year=1992 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iMWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=lahontan#search_anchor |accessdate=2012-10-27 |isbn=9780913235799 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were tributaries of ancient [[Lake Lahontan]] during the [[ice age]]s until the lake shrank to remnants such as [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] and [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]] about 7,000 years ago, although [[Lake Tahoe]]&amp;mdash;from which the Truckee flows to Pyramid Lake&amp;mdash;is still a large mountain lake.

Lahontan cutthroats evolved into a large (up to 1 m or 39 in) and moderately long-lived predator of [[Tui chub|chub]], [[Catostomidae|suckers]], and other fish as long as 30 or {{convert|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.  The trout was able to remain a predator in the larger remnant lakes where [[prey fish]] continued to flourish, but upstream populations were forced to adapt to eating smaller fish and insects.  Some experts consider ''O. c. henshawi'' in the upper [[Humboldt River]] and tributaries to be a separate subspecies, ''O. clarkii humboldtensis'' or the [[Humboldt cutthroat trout]], adapted to living in small streams rather than large lakes.&lt;ref name=BT&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume=68 |number=1 |title=The case for ''humboldtensis'': A subspecies name for the indigenous cutthroat trout, ''Oncorhynchus clarkii'' of the Humboldt River, Upper Quinn River, and Coyote Basin Drainages, Nevada and Oregon |authors= Trotter, Patrick C. and [[Robert J. Behnke|Behnke, Robert J.]] |publisher=|pages=58–65 |year=2008 |jstor=41717657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record size cutthroat trout of any subspecies was a Lahontan caught in Pyramid Lake weighing {{convert|41|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}, although anecdotal and photographic evidence exists of even larger fish from this lake.

==Human history==
The Lahontan cutthroats of Pyramid and Walker Lakes were of considerable importance to the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] tribe. These trout, as well as [[cui-ui]], a sucker found only in Pyramid Lake, were dietary mainstays and were used by other tribes in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fishes of the Great Basin |authors=William F. Sigler and John W. Sigler |location=Reno, Nevada |publisher=University of Nevada Press |year=1987 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZC2dAGvtjQC&amp;dq=%22Gasterosteidae%22&amp;q=pyramid+lake#v=snippet&amp;q=paiute&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[John C. Frémont]] and [[Kit Carson]] ascended the [[Truckee River]] on January 16, 1844, they called it the 'Salmon Trout River', after the huge Lahontan cutthroat trout that ran up the river from Pyramid Lake to spawn.&lt;ref name=Fremont&gt;{{cite book |title=Narrative of the exploring expedition to the Rocky mountains: in the year 1842, and to Oregon and north California in the years 1843-44 |author=John Charles Fremont |year=1847 |publisher=Hall &amp; Dickson |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-ZKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=beaver+dam+rocky+mountains+altitude#v=onepage&amp;q=salmon%20trout%20river&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American settlement in the Great Basin nearly [[Extinction|extirpated]] these remarkable fish. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Lahontan cutthroats were caught in tremendous numbers and shipped to towns and [[California Gold Rush|mining camps]] throughout the West; estimates have ranged as high as {{convert|1000000|lb|kg|-4|abbr=on}} annually between 1860 and 1920. A dam in [[Mason Valley (Nevada)|Mason Valley]] blocked spawning runs from Walker Lake. By 1905, [[Derby Dam]] on the Truckee River below [[Reno]] interfered with Pyramid Lake's spawning runs. A poorly designed [[fish ladder]] washed away in 1907, then badly timed [[Newlands Reclamation Act|water diversions]] to farms in the [[Fallon, Nevada]], area stranded spawning fish and desiccated eggs below the dam. By 1943, Pyramid Lake's population was extinct. Lake Tahoe's population was extinct by 1930 from competition and inbreeding with introduced [[rainbow trout]] (creating [[cutbow]]s), predation by introduced [[lake trout]], and diseases introduced along with these exotic species.

Upstream populations have been isolated and decimated by poorly managed [[Managed intensive grazing|grazing]] and excessive water withdrawals for [[irrigation]], as well as by [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]], competition, and predation by non-native [[salmonid]]s. This is important, as although Lahontan cutthroat trout can inhabit either lakes or streams, they are obligatory stream spawners.&lt;ref name=Register&gt;{{cite journal |title=90-Day Finding on a Petition To Delist the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |author=Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office |publisher=Federal Register |volume=73 |number=175 |date=2008-09-09 |url=http://www.fws.gov/nevada/protected_species/fish/documents/lct/090908_lct_fed_reg.pdf |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid Lake and Truckee River water quality==
Pyramid Lake, the second-largest natural lake in the western U.S. prior to construction of the [[Derby Dam]], which diverted water from the lake, has been the focus of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under direction of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] a comprehensive dynamic [[hydrology transport model]], the Dynamic Stream Simulation and Assessment Model ([[DSSAM]]), was applied to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and wastewater management decisions throughout the {{convert|3120|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} [[Truckee River]] Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River |author=C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau of Earth Metrics Inc. |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series |location=Washington D.C. |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses allowed more competent decisions to be made regarding the watersheds, as well as management of treated effluent discharged to the Truckee River.

==Conservation==
Lahontan cutthroat trout currently occupy a small fraction of their historic range. The primary obstacle to their recovery is non-native salmonid predation by [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis'') on [[fluvial]] cutthroat and [[lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush'') on [[lacustrine]] cutthroat.&lt;ref name=Behnke/&gt; Also, hybridization of cutthroat with non-native [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') continues to threaten recovery of the pure Lahontan cutthroat. Only [[Independence Lake (California)|Independence Lake]] has continuously harbored its historic native Lahontan cutthroat population, although precariously low spawner numbers there have recently increased along with five years of brook trout removal.&lt;ref name=Independence&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of Brook Trout Removal from a Spawning Stream on an Adfluvial Population of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |authors=G. Gary Scoppettone, Peter H. Rissler, Sean P. Shea, William Somer |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |pages=586–596 |volume=32 |number=3 |year=2012 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02755947.2012.675958 |accessdate=28 October 2012 |doi=10.1080/02755947.2012.675958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyramid and Walker Lakes have been restocked with fish captured in [[Summit Lake (Nevada)]] and Lake Heenan, and those populations are maintained by fish [[Hatchery|hatcheries]]. Unfortunately, the Summit Lake strain does not live as long or grow as large as the original strain of fish. However, in the 1970s, fish believed to have been stocked almost a century ago from the Pyramid Lake strain were discovered in a small stream along the [[Pilot Peak (Nevada)|Pilot Peak]] area of western Utah border, and are a genetic match to the original strain. This Pilot Peak strain is now integral to the reintroduction and planting programs maintained by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bringing Home the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout |author=Mike Caltagirone |journal=Blood Knot Magazine |date=2010-01-19 |url=http://bloodknot.net/?p=1667 |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation of highly complementary habitats is crucial for survival of the different age classes of cutthroat trout, with clean gravels needed for spawning, slow-moving side channel habitats used by juvenile fish, and deeper pool habitats such as beaver ponds for larger adult fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Complementation of Habitats for Bonneville Cutthroat Trout in Watersheds Influenced by Beavers, Livestock, and Drought |authors=Seth M. White, Frank J. Rahel |journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society |volume=137 |pages=881–894 |year=2008 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/T06-207.1 |accessdate=2012-10-28 |doi=10.1577/T06-207.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were classified as an [[endangered species]] between 1970 and 1975, then the classification was relaxed to [[threatened species]] in 1975, and reaffirmed as threatened in 2008.&lt;ref name=Register/&gt;

Although Lahontan cutthroat trout stand little chance of surviving for long in [[Lake Tahoe]], the [[Nevada Department of Wildlife]] (NDOW) planted them instead of rainbow trout on the lake's Nevada shore in summer 2011. The goal is to enable anglers to catch Lake Tahoe's native trout for the first time since 1939. The California state record was caught in Lake Tahoe in 1911 by William Pomin, weighing in at an impressive {{convert|31|lb|kg|abbr=out}}, {{convert|8|oz|g|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reintroduction of Lahontan cutthroat trout should benefit anglers |author=Bruce Ajari |newspaper=Tahoe Daily Tribune |date=2011-08-11 |url=http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/article/20110811/NEWS/110819959 |accessdate=2012-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it tolerates water too [[alkaline]] for other trout, Lahontan cutthroats are stocked in alkaline lakes outside its native range, including [[Lake Lenore (Washington)|Lake Lenore]] (alternately Lenore Lake), [[Grimes Lake]] and [[Omak Lake]] in central [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/may/11/lahontans-still-thrive-at-lake-lenore-despite-net/|title=Lahontans still thrive at Lake Lenore despite net poaching|author=Rich Landers|date=11 May 2016|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mann Lake]]&lt;ref name="Sheehan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Madelynne Diness|title=Fishing in Oregon: The Complete Oregon Fishing Guide|edition=10th|publisher=Flying Pencil Publications|location=Scappoose, Oregon|pages=282&amp;ndash;83|isbn=0-916473-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oregon's [[Alvord Desert]] east of [[Steens Mountain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">In [[economics]], the '''lump of labour fallacy''' is the idea that there is a fixed amount of work—a lump of labour—to be done within an economy which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs. It was considered a [[fallacy]] in 1891 by economist [[David Frederick Schloss]], who held that the amount of work is not fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/l|title=Economics A-Z terms beginning with L|website=The Economist|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated to rebut the idea that reducing the number of hours employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term is also commonly used to describe the belief that increasing labour productivity, immigration, or automation causes an increase in [[unemployment]]. Whereas some argue immigrants displace a country's workers, others believe this to be a fallacy by arguing that the number of jobs in the economy is not fixed and that immigration increases the size of the economy, thus creating more jobs.&lt;ref&gt;John Bercow [http://www.smf.co.uk/index.php?name=UpDownload&amp;req=getit&amp;lid=136 Incoming assets: Why Tories should change policy on immigration and asylum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105552/http://www.smf.co.uk/index.php?name=UpDownload&amp;req=getit&amp;lid=136 |date=28 September 2007 }}, [[Social Market Foundation]], October 2005, accessed 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Cooley, Macha Farrant and Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah [http://www.ippr.org.uk/members/download.asp?f=/ecomm/files/selecting_wisely.pdf&amp;a=skip Selecting wisely: Making managed migration work for Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022019/http://www.ippr.org.uk/members/download.asp?f=%2Fecomm%2Ffiles%2Fselecting_wisely.pdf&amp;a=skip |date=11 March 2007 }}, [[Institute for Public Policy Research]], November 2005, accessed 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The lump of labor fallacy is also known as the '''lump of jobs fallacy''', '''fallacy of labour scarcity''', '''fixed pie fallacy''' or the '''zero-sum fallacy''' – due to its ties to [[zero-sum game]]s. Some economics studies have noted criticism and complexities with the fallacy claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Tom|year=2007|title=Why economists dislike a lump of labor|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafrsocec/v_3a65_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a279-291.htm|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=65|issue=3|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigration ==
The lump of labour fallacy has been applied to concerns around immigration and labour. Given a fixed availability of employment, the lump of labour position argues that allowing immigration of working-age people reduces the availability of work for native-born workers ("they are taking our jobs").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/08/24/do-immigrants-steal-jobs-from-american-workers/|title=Do immigrants “steal” jobs from American workers?|last=Hoban|first=Brennan|date=2017-08-24|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, skilled immigrating workers can bring capabilities that are not available in the native workforce, for example in academic research or [[information technology]]. Additionally, immigrating workforces also create new jobs by expanding demand, thus creating more jobs, either directly by setting up businesses (therefore requiring local services or workers), or indirectly by raising consumption. As an example, a greater population that eats more groceries will increase demand from shops, which will therefore require additional shop staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Simply the best? Highly-skilled migrants and the UK's knowledge economy|date=28 June 2012|url=http://www.theworkfoundation.com/Reports/315/Simply-the-best-Highlyskilled-migrants-and-the-UKs-knowledge-economy|author1=Laurence Hopkins|author2=Charles Levy|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment regulations ==
Advocates of restricting working hours regulation may assume that there is a fixed amount of work to be done within the economy. By reducing the amount that those who are already employed are allowed to work, the remaining amount will then accrue to the unemployed. This policy was adopted by the governments of [[Herbert Hoover]] in the [[United States]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] in [[France]], in the [[35-hour workweek|35-hour working week]] (though in France various exemptions to the law were granted by later centre-right governments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-08-12/france-s-35-hour-week-has-done-its-job|title=France's 35-Hour Week Has Done Its Job|last=Bershidsky|first=Leonid|date=2015-08-12|newspaper=Bloomberg View|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economists contend that such proposals are likely to be ineffective, alleging that there are usually substantial administrative costs associated with employing more workers. These can include additional costs in recruitment, training, and management that would increase average cost per unit of output. This overall would lead to a reduced production per worker, and may even result in higher unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/3230|title=The 35-hour workweek in France: Straightjacket or welfare improvement?|last=Estevão, Sá|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Economic Policy July 2008 pp. 417–463 Printed in Great Britain © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2008.|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early retirement ==
[[Early retirement]] has been used to induce workers to accept termination of employment before retirement age following the employer's diminished labour needs. Government support for the practice has come from the belief that this should lead to a reduction in unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The unsustainability of this practice has now been recognised, and the trend in Europe is now towards postponement of the retirement age.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In an editorial in ''[[The Economist]]'' a thought experiment is proposed in which old people leave the workforce in favour of young people, on whom they become dependent for their living through state benefits. It is then argued that since growth depends on having either more workers or greater productivity, the society cannot really become more prosperous by paying an increasing number of its citizens unproductively. The article also points out that even early retirees with private pension funds become a burden on society as they also depend on equity and bond income generated by workers.&lt;ref name="KeepOT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21547263|title=Keep on trucking: Why the old should not make way for the young|date=11 February 2012|author=Buttonwood|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lunar orbit rendezvous''' ('''LOR''') is a key concept for efficiently landing humans on the Moon and returning them to Earth. It was utilized for the [[Project Apollo]] missions in the 1960s and 1970s. In a LOR mission, a main [[spacecraft]] and a smaller lunar lander travel to [[lunar orbit]]. The lunar lander then independently descends to the surface of the Moon, while the main spacecraft remains in lunar orbit. After completion of the mission there, the lander returns to lunar orbit to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and re-[[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the main spacecraft, then is discarded after transfer of crew and payload. Only the main spacecraft returns to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vB7AA7B9hTI|"Lunar Orbit Rendezvous" - 1968 - NASA Mission Planning and Analysis Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LOR Gravity Well.png|thumb|Representation of the lunar [[gravity well]], illustrating how resources needed only for the trip home don't have to be carried down and back up the "well"]]
Lunar orbit rendezvous was first known to be proposed in 1919 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] engineer [[Yuri Kondratyuk]],{{sfnp|Harvey|2007|p=6—7}} as the most economical way of sending a human on a round-trip journey to the Moon.{{sfnp|Wilford|1969|p=41-48}}

[[File:Shuttleclunar.svg|thumb|LOR using [[Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle]]]]
The most famous example involved [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo LM]], where they were both sent to a Translunar flight in a single rocket stack. However, variants where the landers and main spacecraft travel separately, such as the lunar landing plan proposed for [[Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle]] and [[Golden Spike Company|Golden Spike]], are also considered as Lunar Orbit rendezvous.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
[[File:Comparison of Lander Sizes - Direct vs LOR.gif|thumb|Comparison of lunar lander sizes, from an early Langley study]]
The main advantage of LOR is the spacecraft payload saving, due to the fact that the propellant necessary to return from lunar orbit back to Earth need not be carried as dead weight down to the Moon and back into lunar orbit. This has a multiplicative effect, because each pound of "dead weight" propellant used later has to be propelled by more propellant sooner, and also because increased propellant requires increased tankage weight. The resultant weight increase would also require more thrust for lunar landing, which means larger and heavier engines.{{sfnp|Reeves|2005}}

Another advantage is that the lunar lander can be designed for just that purpose, rather than requiring the main spacecraft to also be made suitable for a lunar landing. Finally, the second set of life support systems that the lunar lander requires can serve as a backup for the systems in the main spacecraft.

===Disadvantage===
Lunar-orbit rendezvous was considered risky as of 1962, because [[space rendezvous]] had not been achieved, even in Earth orbit. If the LEM could not reach the CSM, two astronauts would be stranded with no way to get back to Earth or survive [[atmospheric entry|re-entry into the atmosphere]]. The fear proved to be unfounded, as rendezvous was successfully demonstrated in 1965 and 1966 on six [[Project Gemini]] missions{{refn|group=Note|[[Gemini 6A]], [[Gemini 8]], [[Gemini 9A]], [[Gemini 10]], [[Gemini 11]], and [[Gemini 12]]}} with the aid of radar and on-board computers. It was also successfully done each of the eight times it was tried on Apollo missions.{{refn|group=Note|[[Apollo 9]] in Earth orbit; in lunar orbit on [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14]], [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16]], and [[Apollo 17]].}}

== Apollo Mission mode selection ==
[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] Lunar Module rendezvousing with Command Module in lunar orbit]]
When the Apollo Moon landing program was started in 1961, it was assumed that the three-man [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command and Service Module combination]] (CSM) would be used for takeoff from the lunar surface, and return to Earth. It would therefore have to be landed on the Moon by a larger rocket stage with landing gear legs, resulting in a very large spacecraft (in excess of {{convert|100000|lb|kg}}) to be sent to the Moon.

If this were done by [[direct ascent]] (on a single [[launch vehicle]]), the rocket required would have to be extremely large, in the [[Nova rocket|Nova]] class. The alternative to this would have been [[Earth orbit rendezvous]], in which two or more rockets in the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn class]] would launch parts of the complete spacecraft, which would rendezvous in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon. This would possibly include a separately launched Earth departure stage, or require on-orbit refueling of the empty departure stage.

[[Tom Dolan (engineer)|Tom Dolan]]{{sfnp|Brooks|1979}} proposed the alternative of lunar orbit rendezvous, which had been studied and promoted by [[Jim Chamberlin]] and [[Owen Maynard]] at the [[Space Task Group]] in 1960 early Apollo feasibility studies.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|p=62-66}} This mode allowed a single [[Saturn V]] to launch the CSM to the Moon with a smaller [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Excursion Module]] (LEM).{{refn|group=Note|This was shortened to "Lunar Module" (LM) in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, Julian W. (Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, NASA). Memorandum from Project Designation Committee, June 9, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}} When the combined spacecraft reaches [[lunar orbit]], one of the three astronauts remains with the CSM, while the other two enter the LEM, undock and descend to the surface of the Moon. They then use the ascent stage of the LEM to rejoin the CSM in lunar orbit, then discard the LEM and use the CSM for the return to Earth. This method was brought to the attention of NASA Associate Administrator [[Robert Seamans]] by [[Langley Research Center]] engineer [[John Houbolt|John C. Houbolt]], who led a team to develop it.

Besides requiring less payload, the ability to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the LOR approach. The LEM's design gave the astronauts a clear view of their landing site through observation windows approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}} above the surface, as opposed to being on their backs in a Command Module lander, at least {{convert|40|or|50|ft|m}} above the surface, able to see it only through a television screen.

Developing the LEM as a second manned vehicle provided the further advantage of redundant critical systems (electrical power, life support, and propulsion), which enabled it to be used as a "lifeboat" to keep the astronauts alive and get them home safely in the event of a critical CSM system failure. This was envisioned as a contingency, but not made a part of the LEM specifications. As it turned out, this capability proved invaluable in 1970, when just such a critical failure occurred on the [[Apollo 13]] mission when an oxygen tank failure disabled the Service Module.

[[File:John C. Houbolt - GPN-2000-001274.jpg|thumb|[[John Houbolt]] explains Lunar orbit rendezvous]]
Dr. John Houbolt would not let the advantages of LOR be ignored. As a member of Lunar Mission Steering Group, Houbolt had been studying various technical aspects of [[space rendezvous]] since 1959 and was convinced, like several others at [[Langley Research Center]], that LOR was not only the most feasible way to make it to the Moon before the decade was out, it was the only way. He had reported his findings to [[NASA]] on various occasions but felt strongly that the internal task forces (to which he made presentations) were following arbitrarily established "ground rules." According to Houbolt, these ground rules were constraining NASA's thinking about the lunar mission—and causing LOR to be ruled out before it was fairly considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 1961, Houbolt took the bold step of skipping proper channels and writing a private letter, nine pages long, directly to [[Robert C. Seamans]], the associate administrator. "Somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," Houbolt protested LOR's exclusion. "Do we want to go to the Moon or not?" the Langley engineer asked. "Why is Nova, with its ponderous size simply just accepted, and why is a much less grandiose scheme involving rendezvous ostracized or put on the defensive? I fully realize that contacting you in this manner is somewhat unorthodox," Houbolt admitted, "but the issues at stake are crucial enough to us all that an unusual course is warranted."{{sfnp|Tennant|2009}}{{sfnp|Hansen|1995}}

It took two weeks for Seamans to reply to Houbolt's extraordinary letter. The associate administrator agreed that "it would be extremely harmful to our organization and to the country if our qualified staff were unduly limited by restrictive guidelines." He assured Houbolt that NASA would in the future be paying more attention to LOR than it had up to this time.

In the following months, NASA did just that, and to the surprise of many both inside and outside the agency, the dark horse candidate, LOR, quickly became the front runner. Several factors decided the issue in its favor. First, there was growing disenchantment with the idea of [[direct ascent]] due to the time and money it was going to take to develop a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter [[Nova (rocket)|Nova rocket]], compared to the {{convert|33|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter [[Saturn V]]. Second, there was increasing technical apprehension over how the relatively large spacecraft demanded even by Earth-orbit rendezvous would be able to maneuver to a soft landing on the Moon. As one NASA engineer who changed his mind explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;The business of eyeballing that thing down to the Moon really didn't have a satisfactory answer. The best thing about LOR was that it allowed us to build a separate vehicle for landing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first major group to break camp in favor of LOR was [[Robert R. Gilruth|Robert Gilruth]]'s Space Task Group, which was still located at Langley but was soon to move to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Houston]]. The second to come over was the [[Wernher von Braun|Von Braun]] team at the  [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Then these two powerful groups of converts, along with the original true believers at Langley, persuaded key officials at NASA Headquarters, notably Administrator [[James E. Webb|James Webb]], who had been holding out for direct ascent, that LOR was the only way to land on the Moon by 1969. With the key players inside NASA lined up behind the concept, Webb approved LOR in July 1962.{{sfnp|Witkin|1962}} The decision was officially announced at a press conference on July 11, 1962.{{sfnp|NASA|1962|p=1}} President Kennedy's science adviser, [[Jerome Wiesner]], remained firmly opposed to LOR.{{sfnp|Nelson|2009|p=209—210}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program - NASA|last=|first=|date=December 1992|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|id=Fact Sheet NF175|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;!-- This NASA Facts was prepared by the NASA Langley Research Center Office of Public Affairs, with the assistance of Dr. James R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4539">In [[physics]], the '''meter water equivalent''' (often ''m.w.e.'' or ''mwe'') is a standard measure of [[cosmic ray]] attenuation in underground [[laboratory|laboratories]]. A laboratory at a depth of 1000 m.w.e is shielded from cosmic rays equivalent to a lab 1000&amp;nbsp;m below the surface of a body of water. Because laboratories at the same depth (in meters) can have greatly varied levels of cosmic ray penetration, the m.w.e. provides a convenient and consistent way of comparing cosmic ray levels in different underground locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepscience.org/contents/underground_universe.shtml|title=Deep Science|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=2014-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223150019/http://www.deepscience.org/contents/underground_universe.shtml|archivedate=2015-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic ray attenuation is dependent on the density of the material of the [[overburden]], so the m.w.e. is defined as the product of depth and density (also known as an interaction depth). Because the density of water is 1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 m of water gives an interaction depth of 1 hectogram per square centimeter (hg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Some publications use hg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; instead of m.w.e., although the two units are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Grieder2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. K. F. Grieder|title=Cosmic Rays at Earth: Researcher's Reference Manual and Data Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwwRhQ7qEAsC&amp;pg=PA482|year=2001|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-444-50710-5}} 482 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]], located 660&amp;nbsp;m ideep in a [[salt]] formation, achieves 1585&amp;nbsp;m.w.e. shielding.  [[Soudan Mine]], at 713&amp;nbsp;m depth is only 8% deeper, but because it is in iron-rich rock it achieves 2100&amp;nbsp;m.w.e. shielding, 32% more.

Another factor that must be accounted for is the ''shape'' of the overburden.  While some laboratories are located beneath a flat ground surface, many are located in tunnels in mountains.  Thus, the distance to the surface in directions other than straight up is less than it would be assuming a flat surface.

== Standard rock ==
In addition to m.w.e., underground laboratory depth can also be measured in meters of standard rock. Standard rock is defined to have [[mass number]] A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;22, [[atomic number]] Z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[sodium|11]], and density 2.65 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="PDG 28"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1674-1137/38/9/090001| title = Review of Particle Physics| url = http://pdg.lbl.gov/| journal = Chinese Physics C| volume = 38| issue = 9| pages = 090001| year = 2014| author =  K. A. Olive ''et al.'' (PDG)|bibcode = 2014ChPhC..38i0001O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most laboratories are under earth and not underwater, the depth in standard rock is often closer to the actual underground depth of the laboratory.

== Existing underground laboratories ==
Underground laboratories exist at depths ranging from just below ground level to approximately 6000 m.w.e. at [[SNOLAB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.73.053004 |title=Muon-induced background study for underground laboratories |journal=Physical Review D |volume=73 |issue=5 |year=2006 |last1=Mei |first1=D.-M. |last2=Hime |first2=A. |arxiv=astro-ph/0512125 |bibcode=2006PhRvD..73e3004M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6700 m.w.e. at the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory|Jinping Underground Laboratory]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1088/1674-1137/37/8/086001 |arxiv=1305.0899 |bibcode=2013ChPhC..37h6001W |title=Measurement of cosmic ray flux in the China JinPing underground laboratory |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1137/37/8/086001/pdf |journal=Chinese Physics C |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=086001 |date=August 2013 |last1=Wu |first1=Yu-Cheng |last2=Hao |first2=Xi-Qing |last3=Yue |first3=Qian |last4=Li |first4=Yuan-Jing |last5=Cheng |first5=Jian-Ping |last6=Kang |first6=Ke-Jun |last7=Chen |first7=Yun-Hua |last8=Li |first8=Jin |last9=Li |first9=Jian-Min |last10=Li |first10=Yu-Lan |last11=Liu |first11=Shu-Kui |last12=Ma |first12=Hao |last13=Ren |first13=Jin-Bao |last14=Shen |first14=Man-Bin |last15=Wang |first15=Ji-Min |last16=Wu |first16=Shi-Yong |last17=Xue |first17=Tao |last18=Yi |first18=Nan |last19=Zeng |first19=Xiong-Hui |last20=Zeng |first20=Zhi |last21=Zhu |first21=Zhong-Hua }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blink of an eye==
[[File:MBED Top Level Ontology.jpg|thumb|right|This [[NASA]]-generated chart expresses a framework for modeling non-military space systems architectures; but it could be construed as a military taxonomy -- modeling military space systems architectures.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, Peter and Joseph Skipper. (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090227132305/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39851/1/06-0876.pdf  "Toward a Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures."] NASA, JPL.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]] stressed the significance of grasping the fundamentals of any situation in the "blink of an eye" (''[[coup d'œil]]'').  In a military context, the astute tactician can immediately grasp a range of implications and can begin to anticipate plausible and appropriate courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Calusewitz, Carl. (1982). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_La4qTgECD0C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=clausewitz+coup+d%27oeil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8UCKTI28o4&amp;sig=0ntr9cQoagmpsJVuulXii533H8U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result  ''On War,'' p. 141;] [http://www.greenchameleon.com/gc/blog_detail/defining_taxonomy/ "Defining 'Taxonomy',"] Straights Knowledge website.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clauzewitz' conceptual "blink" represents a tentative [[ontology]] which organizes a set of concepts within a [[Domain of discourse|domain]].

A conventional military taxonomy might be an hierarchical set of classifications for a given set of objects; and the progress of reasoning is developed from the general to the more specific. In such taxonomic [[Model (abstract)|schema]], a conflative term is always a [[polyseme]].&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Joseph L. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PEY0U3umLRkC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=conflation&amp;client=firefox-a  ''The Science of Linguistics in the Art of Translation: Some Tools from Linguistics for the Analysis and Practice of Translation,'' p. 112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a less conventional approach might employ an open-ended contextual military taxonomy—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context; and the progress of reasoning is developed form the specific to the more general.&lt;ref&gt;Grossi, Davide, [[Frank Dignum]] and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9yj2lfa5cy67c78m/fulltext.pdf?page=1  "Contextual Taxonomies" in ''Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems,'' pp. 33-51].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive paradigm==
A taxonomy of terms to describe various types of military operations is fundamentally affected by the way all elements are defined and addressed—not unlike [[framing (social sciences)|framing]].

In terms of a specific military operation, a taxonomic approach based on differentiation and categorization of the entities participating would produce results which were quite different from an approach based on functional objective of an operation (such as peacekeeping, disaster relief, or counter-terrorism). An incidental advantage which flows from give-and-take in refining taxonomic terms more accurately and efficiently becomes more than a worthwhile objective in terms of anticipated outcomes or results. In today's nontraditional operations, the discussion about fundamentals also generates greater precision in how the defense and security community understands and discusses integrated operations.&lt;ref&gt;Downie, Richard D. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KNN/is_38/ai_n15631260/pg_3?tag=artBody;col1 "Defining integrated operations,"] ''Joint Force Quarterly'' (Washington, D.C.). July, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyūga class helicopter destroyer===
Military taxonomy in Japan is circumscribed by Japan's pacifist post-war constitution.  For example, this affects classification of the [[Hyūga class helicopter destroyer|''Hyūga'' class helicopter carriers]], which are ships of the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ddh-x.htm |title=16DDH "13,500 ton" ton Class |work=Global Security |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616174940/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ddh-x.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of [[helicopter carrier]] was formally identified as a helicopter [[destroyer]] (DDH) to comply with explicit constitutional limitations written in [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[  "Japan's Largest 'Helicopter Carrier' Commissioned Amid Concerns," Kyodo News International. March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ships of this class, the JS ''Hyūga'' and the JS ''Ise''  resemble a light [[aircraft carrier]] or [[amphibious assault ship]] such as the [[Marina Militare Italiana|Italian Navy]]'s 13,850-ton [[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']], the [[Spanish Navy]]'s 17,000-ton [[Principe de Asturias (R11)|''Principe de Asturias'']] or the [[Royal Navy]]'s 21,000-ton [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible''-class carriers]].&lt;ref name="Hutchison2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htnavai/articles/20070825.aspx|title=Japan's Secret Aircraft Carriers|last=Hutchison |first=Harold C. |date=2007-08-25|work=StrategyPage|accessdate=2008-07-13}}; {{ja}} [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cae_1188504476 JMSDF's new carrier, launch video.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, JS ''Hyūga'' is the "first Japanese aircraft carrier built since WWII;"&lt;ref&gt;PBS/WNET, NYC: [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/japans-about-face/introduction/746/ "Japan's About-Face: The military's shifting role in post-war society."] July 8, 2008; Teslik, Lee Hudson. [http://www.cfr.org/publication/10439/japan_and_its_military.html "Backgrounder; Japan and Its Military,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125200934/http://www.cfr.org/publication/10439/japan_and_its_military.html |date=2010-01-25 }} ''Council on Foreign Relations.'' April 13, 2006; Hsiao, Russell. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA08Ad01.html "China navy floats three-carrier plan,"] ''Asia Times'' (Hong Kong). January 8, 2008; [http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/search?q=hyuga "Meet Japan's New Destroyer - Updated,"] Information Dissemination (blog). August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but this label is controversial.  A taxonomic label of "aircraft carrier" is legally proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&amp;news_id=1101427&amp;pagina_chiamante=corpo%3Dindex.php  "Japan Commissioned Its Biggest Helicopter Carrier,"] ''AvionNews'' (World Aeronautical Press Agency). March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ship in this class has attracted media and Diet attention because of its resemblance to an aircraft carrier.  Until the 1970s, US Navy taxonomy categorized large-scale flattops as "attack aircraft carriers" and small flattops as "antisubmarine aircraft carriers." In Japan, the constitutional prohibition against having "attack" aircraft carries has been construed to encompass small aircraft carriers but not helicopter carriers.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

A uniquely Japanese taxonomic template is applied to these ships and to their missions, which are limited to "[[military operations other than war]]" (MOOTW).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

==Strategic paradigm==
A number of military strategies can be parsed using a taxonomy model.  The comparative theoretical framework might posit a range of criteria, e.g., the character of envisaged political goals, the type of military strategy preferred, and the scope of forces engaged; and this template suggests discrete modes of force.  The taxonomy-model analysis suggests a useful depiction of the spectrum of the use of military force in a political context.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stuart A. and  Efraim Inbar. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a782379359~db=all~order=page  "A taxonomy of Israel's use of military force,"] ''Journal Comparative Strategy,'' Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1991), pp. 121 - 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsing terrorism===
In the 21st century, the ambit of a subset taxonomy of terrorism would include terms related to terrorists, terrorist groups, terrorist attacks, weapons, venues, and characteristics of terrorists and terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="cycorp2"/&gt;

==Limitations==
Taxonomies offer useful, but incomplete means of structuring information.&lt;ref name="e-mapsys1"&gt;Electronic Mapping Systems: [http://www.e-mapsys.com/Taxonomy1.htm  taxonomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for adequate evaluation of a given data set. While the taxonomic categorizations and sub-categorizations do enhance understanding, it may be significant that the lack of detail in describing objects or elements creates room for ambiguity.&lt;ref name="e-mapsys1"/&gt;

In [[social psychology]], a '''motivated tactician''' is someone who shifts between quick-and-dirty cognitively economical tactics and more thoughtful, thorough strategies when processing information, depending on the type and degree of motivation.{{sfn|Fiske|2004}} Such behavior is a type of [[motivated reasoning]]. The idea has been used to explain why people use [[stereotype|stereotyping]], biases and categorization in some situations, and more analytical thinking in others.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==History==
After much research on categorization, and other cognitive shortcuts, psychologists began to describe human beings as [[cognitive miser]]s; which explains that a need to conserve mental resources causes people to use shortcuts to thinking about stimuli, instead of motivations and urges influencing the way humans think about their world. [[Stereotypes]] and [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]] were used as evidence of the economic nature of human thinking. In recent years, the work of {{harvtxt|Fiske|Neuberg|1990}}, {{harvtxt|Higgins|Molden|2003}}, {{harvtxt|Molden|Higgins|2005}} and others has led to the recognition of the importance of motivational thinking. This is due to contemporary research studying the importance of [[motivation]] in cognitive processes, instead of concentrating on cognition versus motivation.{{sfn|Molden|Higgins|2005}} Current research does not deny that people will be cognitively miserly in certain situations, but it takes into account that thorough analytic thought does occur in other situations.  

Using this perspective, researchers have begun to describe human beings as "motivated tacticians" who are tactical about how much cognitive resources will be used depending on the individual's intent and level of motivation. Based on the complex nature of the world and the occasional need for quick thinking, it would be detrimental for a person to be methodical about everything, while other situations require more focus and attention. Considering human beings as motivated tacticians has become popular because it takes both situations into account. This concept also takes into account, and continues to study, what motivates people to use more or less mental resources when processing information about the world. Research has found that intended outcome, relevancy to the individual, culture, and affect can all influence the way a person processes information.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Goal-oriented motivational thinking==
The most prominent explanation of motivational thinking is that the person's desired outcome motivates him to use more or less cognitive resources while processing a situation or thing.{{sfn|Molden|Higgins|2005}} Researchers have divided preferred outcomes into two broad categories: directional and non-directional outcomes. The preferred outcome provides the motivation for the level of processing involved.

Individuals motivated by directional outcomes have the intention of accomplishing a specific goal. These goals can range from appearing smart, courageous or likeable to affirming positive thoughts and feelings about something or someone to whom they are close or find likable. If someone is motivated by non-directional outcomes, he or she wishes to make the most logical and clear decision. Whether a person is motivated by directional or non-directional outcomes depends on the situation and the person's goals. [[Confirmation bias]] is an example of thought-processing motivated by directional outcomes. The goal is to affirm previously held beliefs, so one will use less thorough thinking in order to reach that goal. A person motivated to get the best education, who researches information on colleges and visit schools is motivated by a non-directional outcome. Evidence for outcome-influenced motivation is illustrated by research on [[self-serving bias]]. According to {{harvtxt|Miller|1976}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Independent of expectancies from prior success or failure, the more personally important a success is in any given situation, the stronger is the tendency to claim responsibility for this success but to deny responsibility for failure."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motivation based on strategy==
Though outcome-based motivation is the most prominent approach to motivated thinking, there is evidence that a person can be motivated by his or her preferred strategy of processing information.{{sfn|Molden|Higgins|2005}} However, rather than being an alternative, this idea is actually a compliment to the outcome-based approach. Proponents of this approach feel that a person prefers a specific method of information-processing because it usually yields the results he or she wishes to receive. This relates back to the intended outcome being the primary motivation. "Strategy of information processing" means whether a person makes a decision using bias, categories, or analytical thinking. Regardless of whether the method is best suited for the situation or more thorough is less important to the person than its likelihood of yielding the intended result. People feel that their preferred strategy just "feels right".  What makes the heuristic or method feel "right" is that the strategy accomplishes the desired goal (i.e. affirming positive beliefs of self-efficacy).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Other motivations and approaches==
There has been limited research on motivated tactical thinking outside of Western countries. One theory experts have mentioned is that a person's culture could play a large role in a person's motivations.{{sfn|Baumeister|1998}} Nations like the [[United States]] are considered to be [[Individualism|individualistic]], while many Asian nations are considered to be [[Collectivism|collectivistic]]. An individualist emphasizes importance on the self and is motivated by individual reward and affirmation, while a collectivist sees the world as being more group- or culture-based. The difference in the two ways of thinking could affect motivation in information processing. For example, instead of being motivated by self-affirmation, a collectivist would be motivated by more group-affirming goals.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Another theory is that emotions can affect the way a person processes information {{harvtxt|Forgas|2000}}. has stated that current mood can determine the information processing as well as thoroughness of thought. He also mentioned that achieving a desired emotion can influence the level to which information is processed.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Negative capability''' was a phrase first used by  [[Romantic poet]] [[John Keats]] in 1817 to characterise the capacity of the greatest writers (particularly Shakespeare) to pursue a vision of artistic beauty even when it leads them into intellectual confusion and uncertainty, as opposed to a preference for philosophical certainty over artistic beauty.  The term has been used by poets and philosophers to describe the ability of the individual to perceive, think, and operate beyond any presupposition of a predetermined capacity of the human being.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=no citation offered.}}

==Keats: The poet's turn of phrase==
Keats used the phrase only briefly in a private letter, and it became known only after his correspondence was collected and published.  In a letter to his brothers, George and Thomas, on 22 December 1817, Keats described a conversation he had been engaged in a few days previously:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Ou|title=Keats and Negative Capability|year=2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I had not a dispute but a disquisition with [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|Dilke]], upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which [[Shakespeare]] possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=277| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was, by 1817, a frequent target of criticism by the younger poets of Keats's generation, often ridiculed for his infatuation with German idealistic philosophy.  Against Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, Keats sets up the model of Shakespeare, whose poetry articulated various points of view and never advocated a particular vision of truth.

Keats's ideas here, as was usually the case in his letters, were expressed tersely with no effort to fully expound what he meant, but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme.  In a letter to J.H. Reynolds in February, 1818, he wrote:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=314| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another letter to Reynolds the following May, he contrived the metaphor of 'the chamber of maiden thought' and the notion of the 'burden of mystery', which together express much the same idea as that of negative capability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil.  We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages.  Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them.  he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keats | first = John | title = The Complete Poetical Works and Letters of John Keats, Cambridge Edition | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin and Company | year = 1899 | page=326| isbn = 978-1-146-96754-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keats understood Coleridge as searching for a single, higher-order truth or solution to the mysteries of the natural world. He went on to find the same fault in Dilke and Wordsworth. All these poets, he claimed, lacked objectivity and universality in their view of the human condition and the natural world. In each case, Keats found a mind which was a narrow private path, not a "thoroughfare for all thoughts". Lacking for Keats were the central and indispensable qualities requisite for flexibility and openness to the world, or what he referred to as negative capability.&lt;ref&gt;Wigod, Jacob D. 1952. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness." PMLA 67 (4) (1 June): 384–386&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of Negative Capability is precisely a rejection of set philosophies and preconceived systems of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, N. (1966). Negative Capability in Keats's Diction. Keats-Shelley Journal, 15, 59-68. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30209856&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded that the poet be receptive rather than searching for fact or reason, and to not seek absolute knowledge of every truth, mystery, or doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 5, 11–12. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known why Keats settled on the phrase 'negative capability', but some scholars have hypothesized that Keats was influenced in his studies of medicine and chemistry, and that it refers to the [[electric polarity|negative pole]] of an [[electric current]] which is passive and receptive. In the same way that the negative pole receives the current from the positive pole, the poet receives impulses from a world that is full of mystery and doubt, which cannot be explained but which the poet can translate into art.&lt;ref&gt;Goellnicht, Donald. "Negative Capability and Wise Passiveness" MA Thesis. (McMaster University, 1976), 13. http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/4675.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unger: The thesis of negative capability==
[[Roberto Unger]] appropriated Keats' term in order to explain resistance to rigid social divisions and hierarchies. For Unger, ''negative capability'' is the "denial of whatever in our contexts delivers us over to a fixed scheme of division and hierarchy and to an enforced choice between routine and rebellion." It is thus through ''negative capability'' that we can further empower ourselves against social and institutional constraints, and loosen the bonds that entrap us in a certain social station.&lt;ref name="fn"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=279–280, 632| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of negative capability can be seen at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, but at the same time could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.&lt;ref name="fn 299"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' is a key component in Unger's theory of [[false necessity]] and [[formative context]]. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and [[anti-necessitarian social thought]], Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and [[empowered democracy|empowerment]] (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.&lt;ref name="fn 35"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=35–36, 164, 169, 278–80, 299–301| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thesis of ''negative capability'' addresses the problem of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] in relation to [[social structure|structure]]. It recognizes the constraints of structure and its molding influence upon the individual, but at the same time finds the individual able to resist, deny, and transcend their context. Unlike other theories of [[structure and agency]], ''negative capability'' does not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion, but rather sees him as able to partake in a variety of activities of self empowerment.&lt;ref name="fn 282"&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=282| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bion==
The twentieth-century British psychoanalyst [[Wilfred Bion]] elaborated on Keats's term to illustrate an attitude of openness of mind which he considered of central importance, not only in the psychoanalytic session, but in life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Joan and Neville Symington, ''The Clinical Thinking of Wilfrid Bion'' (1996) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; For Bion, negative capability was the ability to tolerate the pain and confusion of not knowing, rather than imposing ready-made or omnipotent certainties upon an ambiguous situation or emotional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Harris Williams, ''The Aesthetic Development'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 10 and p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychoanalysisdownunder.com.au/issues/8/papers/106]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the context of Zen ==
The notion of negative capability has been associated with the Zen philosophy.  Keats' man of negative capability had qualities that enabled him to "lose his self-identity, his 'imaginative identification' with and submission to things, and his power to achieve a unity with life". The Zen concept of [[satori]] is the outcome of passivity and receptivity, culminating in "sudden insight into the character of the real".  Satori is reached without deliberate striving. The antecedent stages to satori: quest, search, ripening and explosion. The "quest" stage is accompanied by a strong feeling of uneasiness, resembling the capacity to practice negative capability while the mind is in a state of "uncertainties, mysteries and doubts". In the explosive stage (akin to Keats' 'chief intensity'), a man of negative capability effects a "fellowship with essence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=R. P.|date=1966|title=Keats and Zen. Philosophy East and West|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West, 16(1/2), pp. 33–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Stanley Fish]] has expressed strong reservations about the attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He has written in critique of Unger's early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable that can only be expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fish, "Unger and Milton", in ''Doing What Comes Naturally'' (1989): 430&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst.&lt;ref&gt;H. Avram Veeser ed., ''The Stanley Fish Reader'' (Oxford 1999) p.216-7&lt;/ref&gt; Unger has addressed these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Royal we}}

The royal "we" (''pluralis majestatis'') refers to a single person holding a high office, such as a [[monarch]], [[bishop]], or [[pope]].

=={{anchor|Editorial we}} Editorial "we"==
The editorial "we" is a similar phenomenon, in which an [[editorial]] [[columnist]] in a newspaper or a similar commentator in another medium refers to themselves as ''we'' when giving their opinion. Here, the writer casts themselves in the role of a [[spokesperson]]: either for the media institution that employs them, or more generally on behalf of the party or body of citizens who agree with the commentary.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Author's "we" or ''pluralis modestiae'' {{Anchor|pluralis modestiae}}==
Similar to the editorial "we", ''pluralis modestiae'' is the practice common in mathematical and scientific literature of referring to a generic [[Grammatical person|third person]] by ''we'' (instead of the more common ''one'' or the informal ''you''):
* ''By adding four and five, we obtain nine.''
* ''We are thus led also to a definition of "time" in physics.'' – [[Albert Einstein]]

"We" in this sense often refers to "the reader and the author," since the author often assumes that the reader knows and agrees with certain principles or previous theorems for the sake of brevity (or, if not, the reader is prompted to look them up).

This practice is discouraged in the social sciences because it fails to distinguish between sole authorship and co-authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1557982414|page=30|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''padded v-hull''' is a type of high performance [[watercraft]].

==Versions==
They can come in many different configurations from that of a pure race boat to that of a recreational craft. A padded v-hull is very similar in basic shape to the popular v-hull which simply forms a vee when looking at the back of the watercraft. The difference in design with the padded v-hull is that where the point of the vee would be on the bottom of a plain v-hull there is a flat area ranging from six to ten inches wide. When looking at a padded v-hull from underneath, the front of the hull shows a vee which slowly starts to taper and blend back to the flat pad area. This back portion of the hull is the pad and it will protrude from the vee surface one-half to one-full inch. The pad more efficiently provides hydrodynamic lift due to very low deadrise planing surface, compared to the vee hull lifting surfaces.  This highly efficient lift helps to unwet the less efficient vee sections hull which reduces drag tremendously. It uses hydrodynamic pressure to ride higher in the water. As the boats speed increases, water pressure builds on the flat surface of the pad causing the boat to ride higher in the water and ultimately the boat will be riding on just the pad area. At low speeds these hulls ride and handle just the same as a regular v-hull of the same size and weight. Once speeds increase the padded hull will out accelerate and have a higher top speed than a plain v-hull since the padded hull has less drag once speeds increase.

==Driving==
Driving a padded v-hull takes practice and patience. At speed the hull is riding on a small area roughly the size of a paper towel. It is a balancing act to keep the hull on the pad and it requires small steering inputs from the driver to keep the hull flying level. Padded v-hulls will want to [http://www.aeromarineresearch.com/publications/HB_Jan2008.html chine-walk] if no steering corrections are used. Chine-walk is when the boat rocks side to side on the rear portion of the hull. As speeds increase, chine walk becomes more of a factor and can become violent and dangerous if the driver does not know how to compensate for it.

{{statistical mechanics}}

In [[physics]], a '''partition function''' describes the [[statistics|statistical]] properties of a system in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]{{Citation needed|reason=definition of partition function requires referencing|date=December 2016}}. Partition functions are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the thermodynamic [[state function|state variables]],  such as the [[temperature]] and [[volume]]. Most of the aggregate [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] variables of the system, such as the [[energy|total energy]], [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], can be expressed in terms of the partition function or its [[derivative]]s. The partition function is dimensionless, it is a pure number.

Each partition function is constructed to represent a particular [[statistical ensemble]] (which, in turn, corresponds to a particular [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]). The most common statistical ensembles have named partition functions. The '''canonical partition function''' applies to a [[canonical ensemble]], in which the system is allowed to exchange [[heat]] with the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] at fixed temperature, volume, and [[number of particles]]. The '''grand canonical partition function''' applies to a [[grand canonical ensemble]], in which the system can exchange both heat and particles with the environment, at fixed temperature, volume, and [[chemical potential]]. Other types of partition functions can be defined for different circumstances; see [[partition function (mathematics)]] for generalizations. The partition function has many physical meanings, as discussed in [[#Meaning and significance|Meaning and significance]].

== Canonical partition function ==

=== Definition ===
Initially, let us assume that a thermodynamically large system is in [[thermal contact]] with the environment, with a temperature ''T'', and both the volume of the system and the number of constituent particles are fixed. A collection of this kind of systems comprises an ensemble called a [[canonical ensemble]]. The appropriate [[mathematical expression]] for the canonical partition function depends on the [[degrees of freedom]] of the system, whether the context is [[classical mechanics]] or [[quantum mechanics]], and whether the spectrum of states is [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]].{{Citation needed|reason=definition of partition function requires referencing|date=December 2016}}

;Classical discrete system

For a canonical ensemble that is classical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; Z = \sum_{i} \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_i}, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{e} &lt;/math&gt; is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]],
:&lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; is the index for the [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] of the system,
:&lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; E_i &lt;/math&gt; is the total energy of the system in the respective [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]].

The [[Exponential function|exponential]] factor exp(−''βE&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') is known as the [[Boltzmann factor]].

{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
! Derivation of canonical partition function (classical, discrete)
|-
|
There are multiple approaches to deriving the partition function. The following derivation follows the powerful and general [[information theory|information-theoretic]] [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Jaynesian]] [[maximum entropy thermodynamics|maximum entropy]] approach.

According to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], a system assumes a configuration of [[maximum entropy thermodynamics|maximum entropy]] at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]{{Citation needed|reason=important statement with profound consequences|date=December 2016}}. We seek a probability distribution of states &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the discrete [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)#Gibbs entropy formula|Gibbs entropy]]

:&lt;math&gt; S = - k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \ln \rho_i &lt;/math&gt;

subject to two physical constraints:

1. The probabilities of all states add to unity:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i \rho_i = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

2. In the [[canonical ensemble]], the average energy is fixed:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle E \rangle = \sum_i \rho_i E_i \equiv U.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], we write the Lagrangian (or Lagrange function) &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathcal{L} = \left( -k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \ln \rho_i \right) + \lambda_1 \left( \sum_i \rho_i - 1 \right) + \lambda_2 \left( \sum_i \rho_i E_i - U \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating and extremizing &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; leads to

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \rho_i} = -k_\text{B} \ln \rho_i - k_\text{B} + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 E_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

Isolating for &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_i = \exp \left( \frac{-k_\text{B} + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 E_i}{k_\text{B}} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 &lt;/math&gt;, one substitutes the probability into the first constraint:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1 &amp;= \sum_i \rho_i \\
  &amp;= \exp \left( \frac{-k_\text{B} + \lambda_1}{k_\text{B}} \right) Z,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which yields &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1/k_B = \ln(1/Z) + 1 &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the canonical ensemble partition function:

:&lt;math&gt;
Z \equiv \sum_i \exp \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{k_\text{B}} E_i \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_i = \frac{1}{Z} \exp \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{k_\text{B}} E_i \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S &amp;= - k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \ln \rho_i \\
  &amp;= - k_\text{B} \sum_i \rho_i \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{k_\text{B}} E_i - \ln(Z) \right) \\
  &amp;= - \lambda_2 \sum_i \rho_i E_i + k_\text{B} \ln(Z) \sum_i \rho_i \\
  &amp;= - \lambda_2 U + k_\text{B} \ln(Z).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To obtain &lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;, we differentiate &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the average energy &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; and apply the fact that &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial{\ln Z}}{\partial \lambda_2} = \frac{\langle E \rangle}{k_\text{B}} = \frac{U}{k_\text{B}} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial S}{\partial U} = -\lambda_2 \equiv \frac{1}{T}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the canonical partition function &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
Z \equiv \sum_i \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_i},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \beta \equiv 1/(k_\text{B} T) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]]. Finally, the probability distribution &lt;math&gt; \rho_i &lt;/math&gt; and entropy &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; are respectively

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho_i &amp; = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_i}, \\
S &amp; = \frac{U}{T} + k_\text{B} \ln Z.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Classical continuous system

In [[classical mechanics]], the [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[Momentum vector|momentum]] variables of a particle can vary continuously, so the set of microstates is actually [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. In ''classical'' statistical mechanics, it is rather inaccurate to express the partition function as a [[Sum (mathematics)|sum]] of discrete terms. In this case we must describe the partition function using an [[integral]] rather than a sum. For a canonical ensemble that is classical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as
: &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{1}{h^3} \int \mathrm{e}^{-\beta H(q, p)} \,d^3 q \,d^3 p, &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; H(q, p) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the system,
: &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical position]],
: &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical momentum]].

To make it into a dimensionless quantity, we must divide it by ''h'', which is some quantity with units of [[action (physics)|action]] (usually taken to be [[Planck's constant]]).

;Classical continuous system (multiple identical particles)

For a gas of ''N'' identical classical particles, the partition function is

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \int \exp[-\beta H(p_1, \dots, p_N, x_1,
\dots, x_N)] \,d^3 p_1 \cdots d^3 p_N \,d^3 x_1 \cdots  d^3 x_N, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' indicate particle momenta,
: ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' indicate particle positions,
: ''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a shorthand notation serving as a reminder that the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are vectors in three-dimensional space,
: ''H'' is the classical [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

The reason for the [[factorial]] factor ''N''! is discussed [[#Partition functions of subsystems|below]]. The extra constant factor introduced in the denominator was introduced because, unlike the discrete form, the continuous form shown above is not [[dimensionless]]. As stated in the previous section, to make it into a dimensionless quantity, we must divide it by ''h''&lt;sup&gt;3''N''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''h'' is usually taken to be Planck's constant).

;Quantum mechanical discrete system

For a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined as the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the Boltzmann factor:
: &lt;math&gt; Z = \operatorname{tr} (\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}}), &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{H} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]].
The [[dimension]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} &lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[energy eigenstates]] of the system.

;Quantum mechanical continuous system

For a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as
: &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{1}{h} \int \langle q, p | \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} | q, p \rangle \,dq \,dp, &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic beta]], defined as &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{k_\text{B} T} &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{H} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]],
: &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical position]],
: &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Canonical coordinates|canonical momentum]].

In systems with multiple [[quantum states]] ''s'' sharing the same energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is said that the [[energy levels]] of the system are [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate]]. In the case of degenerate energy levels, we can write the partition function in terms of the contribution from energy levels (indexed by ''j'') as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; Z = \sum_j g_j \cdot \mathrm{e}^{-\beta E_j},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the degeneracy factor, or number of quantum states ''s'' that have the same energy level defined by ''E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The above treatment applies to ''quantum'' [[statistical mechanics]], where a physical system inside a [[Particle in a box|finite-sized box]] will typically have a discrete set of energy eigenstates, which we can use as the states ''s'' above. In quantum mechanics, the partition function can be more formally written as a trace over the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|state space]] (which is independent of the choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]):

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \operatorname{tr} ( \mathrm{e}^{-\beta \hat{H}} ),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Ĥ'' is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian operator]]. The exponential of an operator can be defined using the [[Characterizations of the exponential function|exponential power series]].

The classical form of ''Z'' is recovered when the trace is expressed in terms of [[coherent state]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John R. |last1=Klauder |first2=Bo-Sture |last2=Skagerstam
|title=Coherent States: Applications in Physics and Mathematical Physics
|publisher=World Scientific |date=1985 |pages=71–73 |isbn=978-9971-966-52-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and when quantum-mechanical [[uncertainty principle|uncertainties]] in the position and momentum of a particle 
are regarded as negligible. Formally, using [[bra–ket notation]], one inserts under the trace for each degree of freedom the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{1} = \int |x, p\rangle \langle x,p| \frac{dx \,dp}{h},
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{!}}''x'', ''p''{{rangle}} is a [[Normalizing constant|normalised]] [[Wave packet#Gaussian wave packets in quantum mechanics|Gaussian wavepacket]] centered at
position ''x'' and momentum ''p''. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
 Z = \int \operatorname{tr} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\beta\hat{H}} |x, p\rangle \langle x, p| \right) \frac{dx \,dp}{h}
   = \int \langle x,p| \mathrm{e}^{-\beta\hat{H}} |x, p\rangle \frac{dx \,dp}{h}.
&lt;/math&gt;
A coherent state is an approximate eigenstate of both operators &lt;math&gt; \hat{x} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat{p} &lt;/math&gt;, hence also of the Hamiltonian ''Ĥ'', with errors of the size of the uncertainties. If Δ''x'' and Δ''p'' can be regarded as zero, the action of ''Ĥ'' reduces to multiplication by the classical Hamiltonian, and ''Z'' reduces to the classical configuration integral.

=== Connection to probability theory ===

For simplicity, we will use the discrete form of the partition function in this section. Our results will apply equally well to the continuous form.

Consider a system ''S'' embedded into a [[heat bath]] ''B''. Let the total [[energy]] of both systems be ''E''. Let ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the [[probability]] that the [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] that system ''S'' is in has energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. According to the [[Statistical mechanics#Fundamental postulate|fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics]] (which states that all attainable microstates of a system are equally probable), the probability ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be proportional to the number of microstates of the total [[Closed system (thermodynamics)|closed system]] (''S'', ''B'') in which ''S'' is in microstate ''i'' with energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Equivalently, ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be proportional to the number of microstates of the heat bath ''B'' with energy ''E'' − ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;
 p_i = \frac{\Omega_B(E - E_i)}{\Omega_B(E)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that the heat bath's internal energy is much larger than the energy of ''S'' (''E'' ≫ ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), we can [[Taylor expansion|Taylor-expand]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega_B&lt;/math&gt; to first order in ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and use the thermodynamic relation &lt;math&gt;\partial S_B/\partial E = 1/T&lt;/math&gt;, where here &lt;math&gt;S_B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are the entropy and temperature of the bath respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 k \ln p_i &amp;= k \ln \Omega_B(E - E_i) - k \ln \Omega_B(E) \\
  &amp;\approx -\frac{\partial\big(k \ln \Omega_B(E)\big)}{\partial E} E_i \\
  &amp;\approx -\frac{\partial S_B}{\partial E} E_i \\
  &amp;\approx -\frac{E_i}{T} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
 p_i \propto e^{-\frac{E_i}{kT}} = e^{-\beta E_i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the total probability to find the system in ''some'' microstate (the sum of all ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') must be equal to 1, we can define the partition function as the [[Normalizing constant|normalization constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
 Z =  \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Calculating the thermodynamic total energy ===

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the partition function, let us calculate the thermodynamic value of the total energy. This is simply the [[expected value]], or [[ensemble average]] for the energy, which is the sum of the microstate energies weighted by their probabilities:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \sum_s E_s P_s = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_s E_s
e^{- \beta E_s} = - \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}
Z(\beta, E_1, E_2, \cdots) = - \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

: &lt;math&gt;\langle E\rangle = k_B T^2 \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Incidentally, one should note that if the microstate energies depend on a parameter λ in the manner

: &lt;math&gt;E_s = E_s^{(0)} + \lambda A_s \qquad \mbox{for all}\; s &lt;/math&gt;

then the expected value of ''A'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\langle A\rangle = \sum_s A_s P_s = -\frac{1}{\beta}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda} \ln Z(\beta,\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

This provides us with a method for calculating the expected values of many microscopic quantities. We add the quantity artificially to the microstate energies (or, in the language of quantum mechanics, to the Hamiltonian), calculate the new partition function and expected value, and then set ''λ'' to zero in the final expression. This is analogous to the [[source field]] method used in the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum field theory]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Relation to thermodynamic variables ===

In this section, we will state the relationships between the partition function and the various thermodynamic parameters of the system. These results can be derived using the method of the previous section and the various thermodynamic relations.

As we have already seen, the thermodynamic energy is

: &lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = - \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[variance]] in the energy (or "energy fluctuation") is

: &lt;math&gt;\langle (\Delta E)^2 \rangle \equiv \langle (E - \langle
E\rangle)^2 \rangle = \frac{\partial^2 \ln Z}{\partial \beta^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[heat capacity]] is

: &lt;math&gt;C_v = \frac{\partial \langle E\rangle}{\partial T} = \frac{1}{k_B T^2} \langle (\Delta E)^2 \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[entropy]] is

: &lt;math&gt;S \equiv -k_B\sum_s P_s\ln P_s= k_B (\ln Z + \beta \langle E\rangle)=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}(k_B T \ln Z) =-\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the [[Helmholtz free energy]] defined as ''A'' = ''U'' − ''TS'', where ''U'' = {{langle}}''E''{{rangle}} is the total energy and ''S'' is the [[entropy]], so that

: &lt;math&gt;A = \langle E\rangle -TS= - k_B T \ln Z.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Partition functions of subsystems ===

Suppose a system is subdivided into ''N'' sub-systems with negligible interaction energy, that is, we can assume the particles are essentially non-interacting. If the partition functions of the sub-systems are ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, then the partition function of the entire system is the ''product'' of the individual partition functions:

: &lt;math&gt;Z =\prod_{j=1}^{N} \zeta_j.&lt;/math&gt;

If the sub-systems have the same physical properties, then their partition functions are equal, ζ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ζ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ζ, in which case

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \zeta^N.&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is a well-known exception to this rule. If the sub-systems are actually [[identical particles]], in the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] sense that they are impossible to distinguish even in principle, the total partition function must be divided by a ''N''! (''N'' [[factorial]]):

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\zeta^N}{N!}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is to ensure that we do not "over-count" the number of microstates. While this may seem like a strange requirement, it is actually necessary to preserve the existence of a thermodynamic limit for such systems. This is known as the [[Gibbs paradox]].

=== Meaning and significance ===

It may not be obvious why the partition function, as we have defined it above, is an important quantity. First, let us consider what goes into it. The partition function is a function of the temperature ''T'' and the microstate energies ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. The microstate energies are determined by other thermodynamic variables, such as the number of particles and the volume, as well as microscopic quantities like the mass of the constituent particles. This dependence on microscopic variables is the central point of statistical mechanics. With a model of the microscopic constituents of a system, one can calculate the microstate energies, and thus the partition function, which will then allow us to calculate all the other thermodynamic properties of the system.

The partition function can be related to thermodynamic properties because it has a very important statistical meaning. The probability ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' that the system occupies microstate ''s'' is

: &lt;math&gt;P_s = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_s}. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, as shown above, the partition function plays the role of a normalizing constant (note that it does ''not'' depend on ''s''), ensuring that the probabilities sum up to one:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_s P_s = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_s \mathrm{e}^{- \beta E_s} = \frac{1}{Z} Z
= 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the reason for calling ''Z'' the "partition function": it encodes how the probabilities are partitioned among the different microstates, based on their individual energies. The letter ''Z'' stands for the [[German language|German]] word ''Zustandssumme'', "sum over states". The usefulness of the partition function stems from the fact that it can be used to relate macroscopic [[thermodynamic state|thermodynamic quantities]] to the microscopic details of a system through the derivatives of its partition function. Finding the partition function is also equivalent to performing a laplace transform of the density of states function from the energy domain to the β domain, and the inverse laplace transform of the partition function reclaims the state density function of energies.

==Grand canonical partition function==
{{main|Grand canonical ensemble}}

We can define a '''grand canonical partition function''' for a [[grand canonical ensemble]], which describes the statistics of a constant-volume system that can exchange both heat and particles with a reservoir.
The reservoir has a constant temperature ''T'', and a [[chemical potential]] ''μ''.

The grand canonical partition function, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, is the following sum over [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{Z}(\mu, V, T) = \sum_{i} \exp((N_i\mu - E_i)/k_B T).  &lt;/math&gt;
Here, each microstate is labelled by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and has total particle number &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and total energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;.
This partition function is closely related to the [[Grand potential]], &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\rm G}&lt;/math&gt;, by the relation
:&lt;math&gt; -k_B T \ln \mathcal{Z} = \Phi_{\rm G} = \langle E \rangle - TS - \mu \langle N\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;
This can be contrasted to the canonical partition function above, which is related instead to the [[Helmholtz free energy]].

It is important to note that the number of microstates in the grand canonical ensemble may be much larger than in the canonical ensemble,
since here we consider not only variations in energy but also in particle number.
Again, the utility of the grand canonical partition function is that it is related to the probability that the system is in state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; p_i = \frac{1}{\mathcal Z} \exp((N_i\mu - E_i)/k_B T) .&lt;/math&gt;

An important application of the grand canonical ensemble is in deriving exactly the statistics of a non-interacting many-body quantum gas ([[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] for fermions, [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] for bosons), however it is much more generally applicable than that.
The grand canonical ensemble may also be used to describe classical systems, or even interacting quantum gases.

The grand partition function is sometimes written (equivalently) in terms of alternate variables as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780120831807 | title = Exactly solved models in statistical mechanics | last1 = Baxter | first1 = Rodney J. | year = 1982 | publisher = Academic Press Inc.  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{Z}(z, V, T) = \sum_{N_i} z^{N_i} Z(N_i, V, T), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z \equiv \exp(\mu/kT)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the absolute [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] (or [[fugacity]]) and &lt;math&gt;Z(N_i, V, T)&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical partition function.

==Introduction==
During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale [[geomorphology]] was termed "physiography". Unfortunately, physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "'''''physi'''''cal" and "ge'''''ography'''''", and therefore synonymous with [[physical geography]], and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of physiographic regions while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with "pure morphology," separated from its geological heritage. In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many Earth scientists for the term "geomorphology" in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Victor R. |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Introduction |publisher=[[NASA]] |year=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315105147/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In current usage, physiography still lends itself to confusion as to which meaning is meant, the more specialized "geomorphological" definition or the more encompassing "physical geography" definition. For the remainder of this article, emphasis will remain on the more "geomorphological" usage, which is based upon geological landforms, not on climate, vegetation, or other non-geological criteria.

For the purposes of physiographic mapping, landforms are classified according to both their geologic structures and histories. Distinctions based on geologic age also correspond to physiographic distinctions where the forms are so recent as to be in their first [[Cycle of erosion|erosion cycle]], as is generally the case with sheets of [[Glacial Drift|glacial drift]]. Generally, forms which result from similar histories are characterized by certain similar features, and differences in history result in corresponding differences of form, usually resulting in distinctive features which are obvious to the casual observer, but this is not always the case. A maturely [[dissected plateau]] may grade without a break from rugged mountains on the one hand to mildly rolling farm lands on the other. So also, forms which are not classified together may be superficially similar; for example, a young [[coastal plain]] and a [[peneplain]]. In a large number of cases, the boundary lines are also geologic lines, due to differences in the nature or structure of the underlying rocks.&lt;ref name="Fenneman-US" /&gt;

===History===

====19th-century====
The history of "physiography" itself is at best a complicated effort. Much of the complications arise from how the term has evolved over time, both as its own 'science' and as a synonym for other branches of science. In 1848, [[Mary Somerville]] published her book ''Physical Geography'' which gave detailed descriptions of the [[topography]] of each continent, along with the distribution of plant, animals and humans. This work gave impetus to further works along the field. In Germany, Oscar Peschel in 1870, proposed that geographers should study the morphology of the Earth's surface, having an interest in the study of landforms for the development of human beings. As the chair of geography (and a geologist by training) in Bonn, Germany, [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] made the study of landforms the main research field for himself and his students. Elsewhere, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s ''Physiography'' was published in 1877 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="Huxley1877"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Physiography: An Introduction to the Study of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiT_td97DT8C|date=1 June 1877|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-0806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the field of "physical geography" itself was renamed as "physiography". Afterwards, physiography became a very popular school subject in Britain, accounting for roughly 10% of all examination papers in both English and Welsh schools, and physiography was now regarded as an integral, if not the most important aspect of geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt-Jensen |first=Arild |title=Geography, History and Concepts: A Student's Guide |publisher=Sage Publications Inc. |year=1999 |pages=40–42 |isbn=0-7619-6180-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with these 'advances' in physiography, physically and visually mapping these descriptive areas was underway as well. The early photographers and balloonists, [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] and Triboulet, experimented with aerial photography and the view it provided of the landscape. In 1899, [[Albert Heim]] published his photographs and observations made during a balloon flight over the Alps; he is probably the first person to use aerial photography in geomorphological or physiographical research. The block diagrams of Fenneman, Raisz, Lobeck and many others were based in part upon both aerial photography and topographic maps, giving an oblique "birds-eye" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayden |first=Robert S. |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Chapter 11: Mapping |publisher=NASA |year=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_11/index.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====
By 1901, there were clear differences in the definition of the term physiography. "In England, physiography is regarded as the introduction to [[physical science]] in general. It is made to include the elements of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], physical geography, and [[geology]], and sometimes even certain phases of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In America, the term has a somewhat different meaning. It is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for physical geography, and is sometimes defined as the science which describes and explains the physical features of the earth's surface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Student's Reference Work: A Cyclopaedia for Teachers, Students, and Families |publisher=C.B. Beach and Company |year=1901 |location=New York and Chicago |pages=1123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IVkPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1123&amp;dq=subject:%22Encyclopedias+and+dictionaries.%22+%2Bphysiography |author1= Adam, Graeme Mercer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1911, the definition of physiography in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' had evolved to be "In popular usage the words 'physical geography' have come to mean geography viewed from a particular standpoint rather than any special department of the subject. The popular meaning is better conveyed by the word physiography, a term which appears to have been introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], and was reinvented as a substitute for the cosmography of the Middle Ages by Professor Huxley. Although the term has since been limited by some writers to one particular part of the subject, it seems best to maintain the original and literal meaning. In the stricter sense, physical geography is that part of geography which involves the processes of contemporary change in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the circulation of the fluid envelopes. It thus draws upon physics for the explanation of the phenomena with the space-relations of which it is specially concerned. Physical geography naturally falls into three divisions, dealing respectively with the surface of the [[lithosphere]] – geomorphology; the [[hydrosphere]] – [[oceanography]]; and the [[atmosphere]] – [[climatology]]. All these rest upon the facts of mathematical geography, and the three are so closely inter-related that they cannot be rigidly separated in any discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Geography |volume=11 |page=630 |inline=1 |first=Hugh Robert |last=Mill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1919 edition of ''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' further adjusted the definition to be "Physiography (geomorphology), now generally recognized as a science distinct from geology, deals with the origins and development of land forms, traces out the topographic expression of structure, and embodies a logical history of oceanic basins, and continental elevations; of [[mountain]]s, [[plateau]]s and [[plain]]s; of hills and valleys. Physical geography is used loosely as a synonym, but the term is more properly applied to the borderland between geography and physiography; dealing, as it does, largely with the human element as influenced by its physiographic surroundings".

====21st-century====
Even in the 21st century, some confusion remains as to exactly what "physiography" is. One source states "Geomorphology includes quaternary geology, physiography and most of physical geography",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Geomorphology |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/geomorphology/ |accessdate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; treating physiography as a separate field, but subservient to geomorphology. Another source states "Geomorphology (or physiography) refers to the study of the surface features of the earth. It involves looking at the distribution of land, water, soil and rock material that forms the land surface. Land is closely linked to the geomorphology of a particular landscape",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Geomorphology |publisher=[[Government of Alberta]] |year=2006 |url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/land/quality/html/quality/geomorphology.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225004304/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/land/quality/html/quality/geomorphology.html |archivedate=2007-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding physiography as synonymous with geomorphology. Yet another source states "Physiography may be viewed from two distinct angles, the one dynamic, the other passive". The same source continues by stating "In a large fashion [[geodynamics]] is intimately associated with certain branches of geology, as [[sediment]]ation, while geomorphology connects physiography with geography. The dynamic interlude representing the active phase of physiography weaves the basic threads of geologic history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glock |first=Waldo S. |title=Dual Nature of Physiography | journal = Science | volume = 72 | issue = 1853 |pages=3–5 |publisher=|year=1930 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/1853/3 | doi = 10.1126/science.72.1853.3 |accessdate=2007-12-21 |pmid=17769440 |bibcode=1930Sci....72....3G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Geological Survey defines physiography as a study of "Features and attributes of earth's land surface",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Alphabetical index, Physiography |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |url=http://www.usgs.gov/science/science-kwic.php?letter=p |accessdate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212213206/http://www.usgs.gov/science/science-kwic.php?letter=p |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while geomorphology is defined separately as "Branch of geology dealing with surface land features and the processes that create and change them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Subject index, Geomorphology |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=http://www.usgs.gov/science/science.php?term=468 |accessdate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to this confusion over what "physiography" actually means, some scientists have refrained from using the term physiography (and instead use the similar term geomorphology) because the definitions vary from the American Geological Institute's "the study and classification of the surface features of Earth on the basis of similarities in geologic structure and the history of geologic changes" to descriptions that also include vegetation and/or land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belward |first=Alan S. |author2=Valenzuela, Carlos R. |title=Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems for Resource Management in Developing Countries |publisher=Springer |year=1991 |pages=430 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XvOEfo6fX8C&amp;pg=PA430&amp;lpg=PA430&amp;dq=%22geomorphic+mapping%22+physiography |isbn=0-7923-1268-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reduction in rank''' may refer to three separate concepts:
*In [[military law]], a ''reduction in rank'' or ''degradation''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|degrade}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[demotion]] in [[military rank]] as punishment for a [[crime]] or wrongdoing, imposed by a [[court-martial]] or other [[authority]]. It may be imposed in conjunction with other punishments, such as a [[Military discharge|bad conduct or dishonorable discharge]], loss of wages, [[wikt:confinement|confinement]] to [[barracks]], or [[Prison|imprisonment]] in a [[military prison]].
*''Reduction in rank'' may also refer to the voluntary, non-punitive practice of taking a lower rank, often as part of joining another [[military unit]] or [[military service]]. For example, those who join the [[Special Air Service]] or [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] take the rank of [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]], often a lower rank than their previous rank but with greater pay, prestige, and responsibilities.
*There is a ''reversion'' in rank after an officer has been temporarily promoted to a higher rank while occupying a position requiring that rank; the officer reverts to the permanent rank on vacating the position bearing the higher rank. In the US military, this occurs most often to three- or four-star general or flag officers, who can be reduced in rank to no lower than their permanent rank of two stars. This occurs because three- and four-star ranks are always temporary ranks and are linked to their position's office. A three- or four-star officer could revert non-punitively to a lower rank because they no longer hold a position bearing the higher rank. Reversion of this type is less usual for lower US ranks as such temporary promotions are uncommon.

==History==
Reduction in rank ([[Latin]] ''gradus deiectio'' meaning position degradation) was a [[Roman military decorations and punishments|Roman military punishment]].&lt;ref name="Brand2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clarence Eugene Brand|title=Roman Military Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rbh7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172|year=1968|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75817-9|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, [[Courts-martial in the United States|courts-martial]] may adjudge reduction to any enlisted member to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|page=131|chapter=Part II|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Courts-martial in the United States#Summary court-martial|summary court-martial]] may not sentence a person to reduction by more than one grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|pages=191–192|chapter=Part II|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 15 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) authorizes [[commanding officer]]s to "in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand" impose "reduction to the next inferior [[pay grade]], if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction." Additionally, an officer of the grade of [[Major (United States)|major]], [[lieutenant commander]], or above is authorized to impose "reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above [[Pay grade#Pay grades and associated ranks by branch of service|E-4]] may not be reduced more than two pay grades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|pages=5–6|chapter=Appendix 2|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, article 58a of the UCMJ provides that, unless otherwise provided in regulation, an enlisted member above the pay grade of E-1 sentenced by a court-martial to confinement, a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or hard labor without confinement, shall be automatically reduced to the pay grade of E-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|page=19|chapter=Appendix 2|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==
In other countries, there is such a punishment, which is sometimes much more severe than that in the US.  It usually is assigned for serious crimes in peacetime and wartime.

===Russian Empire and USSR===
In the Russian Empire and in the USSR, most often it was a demotion in rank to private. 
In the Russian Empire to this punishment was added also other penalties such as beatings with whips, which were all the staff. Personnel lined up in formation, then each dealt one blow sentenced. Most often, this has led to the death of the convict from his injuries.

====For example====
Lieutenant-General Marquis [[Philip Osipovich Paulucci]], being quartermaster General of the [[Russian Caucasus Forces (before 1865)|Caucasus army]], on 3 November 1810, wrote in his diary: "the Tiflis infantry regiment non-commissioned officer Ermolaev, the former in the recruit depot when you split the party on the shelves, took the recruit 5 rubles brazenly. For any impermissible and intolerable service act, reducted thereof in the ordinary non-commissioned officer, require him to drive the rods through 500 people one time, and taken money from him to take away and give to a recruit. Flogging this very same to do tomorrow in 8 hours. This case put the body on view at the end of the Lord to the heads of regiments are strictly watched so that the lower ranks no one had injustices..."

Demoted in rank, with the exception only of occasions a great military feat, can get officer rank except by  Highest permission about not reading an incurred penalty obstacle to the awards; to enter with the idea of this is permitted no sooner than after three years after a demotion (article 43). On the basis of article 60, 556, 634, and 727&amp;nbsp;kN. SV VII. military. post. demoted cannot be produced in the non-commissioned officers, not assigned to any trip, you don't leave and transferred to the reserve only with a special permission.

===USSR===
In the USSR, demotion in rank to [[Ryadovoy|private]] begin to see use as a punishment immediately after the creation of the [[Soviet Armed Forces|red army]]. As a rule, it punished those who made unforgivable mistakes during combat, especially those who led to serious losses or tactical defeat. In addition, it also punished those who committed serious crimes while serving. In the second case, a demotion in rank was usually not the only punishment administered, and often accompanied an imprisonment or execution.
During the second world war, those demoted in rank were not imprisoned away from the front lines but instead made to serve in the [[Penal military unit|penal divisions]].
After the second world war, the punishment no longer meant execution or service in a penal unit, but did mean dismissal from service and forfeiture of all military awards. Most often it was imposed for serious crimes which entail criminal liability. In modern Russia this post-[[WW2]] version of the punishment is still used.

===Post-Soviet Ukraine===
On December 22, 2015, Konstantin Grishin (better known as [[Semen Semenchenko]]) was demoted in rank while serving as the commander of the voluntary [[Donbas Battalion|Donbass]] battalion.  While all of the other punishments he received. The reason for the demotion in rank was the fact that he does not have the appropriate training and education to carry the title of Lieutenant.

===Germany===
For example, during the Third Reich, the [[SS]] officer [[Helmut Knochen]] was demoted in rank because, during [[Operation Valkyrie|the coup attempt of 20 July 1944]], he did not adequately resist the conspirators, and got himself arrested.

'''The Right to Equal Protection''' is a concept that was introduced into the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] of the [[United States]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It is intended to protect the rights provided by the United States Constitution for all individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, etc.  It is fundamentally based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the Constitution, intended to secure rights for former slaves.  The Constitution is claimed to uphold [[racial equality|racial]] and [[gender equality]], but until the 1950s, enforcing  [[slavery]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and [[gender inequality]] were major aspects of the history of the American federal government.

==Constitutional basis of equal rights==
In 1896, the [[United States Supreme Court]] determined that the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine was constitutional in the case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]].'' Although the Fourteenth Amendment abolished slavery, and intended to end [[racial segregation]], the Southern States initiated [[Jim Crow Laws]], which segregated people of color in public schools, public transportation, restaurants, etc.  The ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson meant that as long as facilities for both colored and white individuals were equal, it was constitutional.  In 1954, the ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was overturned in the Supreme Court case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]. ''The Supreme Court determined that the establishment of separate schools for whites and blacks inherently unequal, and as a result unconstitutional.  This ruling put an end to segregation on the basis of equal rights of protection.

These court cases however had no bearing on [[women's suffrage]] or equality.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution legislates that neither the individual states of the United States nor its federal government may deny a citizen the right to vote because of the citizen's sex.

==Right to equal protection in the workplace==
In recent years equal protection of citizens within the workplace has become a major issue.  As a result of various amendments, citizens can not be discriminated against in work places based on terms of gender, ethnicity, race, height, or other similar differences.  For example, a potential employee who is unusually short and weak can not be denied a job in a police force based upon his size.

==Equal Rights Amendment==
An [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), which would grant [[women's rights|equal rights to women]], has been a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution since 1972. Having failed to meet the deadline requirements for passage incorporated into the original proposed amendment, efforts to reintroduce and ratify similar amendments have come before Congress every year since 1982.

==Opposition to equal rights==
The very existence of equal rights, however, is controversial because it sets boundaries and makes clear the differences among citizens.  In order to declare something as equal, there must exist a comparison to something that is unequal.  In doing this, people are forced to compare equality in terms of education, wage, and many other controversial considerations.

A '''social class''' is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the [[social sciences]] and [[political theory]] centered on models of [[social stratification]] in which people are grouped into a set of [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchical]] social categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grant, J. Andrew |chapter=class, definition of |editor=Jones, R.J. Barry |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-24350-6 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a29qBofx8Y8C&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common being the [[Upper class|upper]], [[Middle class|middle]] and [[Working class|lower classes]].

"Class" is a subject of analysis for [[List of sociologists|sociologists]], [[political scientist]]s, [[anthropologists]] and [[Social history|social historians]]. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of  "class" and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term "social class" is usually synonymous with "[[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic]] class", defined as "people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status", e.g., "the [[working class]]"; "an emerging professional class".&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University. [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=social+class&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h=0 "Social class"]. WordNet Search 3.1. Retrieved on: 2012-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one's relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one's current social and economic situation and consequently being more changeable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3102/0013189X14528373 |authors=Rubin, M., Denson, N., Kilpatrick, S., Matthews, K. E., Stehlik, T., &amp; Zyngier, D. |year=2014 |title="I am working-class": Subjective self-definition as a missing measure of social class and socioeconomic status in higher education research |work=Educational Researcher |volume=43 |pages=196–200 |doi=10.3102/0013189X14528373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. [[Karl Marx]] thought "class" was defined by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His simple understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]] are the [[proletariat]], those who work but do not own the means of production; and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the proletariat's operation of the [[means of production]]. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist [[Max Weber]], who argued "class" is determined by economic position, in contrast to "[[social status]]" or "''Stand''"&lt;!--German term, could be confused with English word, so italics needed--&gt; which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (1921/2015). "Classes, Stände, Parties" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy and Social Stratification.  Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "class" is etymologically derived from the Latin ''classis'', which was used by [[census]] takers to categorize citizens by wealth in order to determine military service obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, D.F. |chapter=Social class and Status |editor=Mey, Jacob |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics |publisher=Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-08-096297-9 |page=952 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmXgeBE7k0C&amp;pg=PA952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the term "class" began to replace classifications such as [[Estates of the realm|estate]]s, [[Nobility|rank]] and [[Religious order|order]]s as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics and increase in the significance of wealth and [[income]] as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Class, Social |editor=Kuper, Adam |title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32096-2 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penney, Robert |chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen &amp; Levinson, David |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Burmese nobles.JPG|thumb|[[Burma|Burmese]] nobles and servants]]
Historically, social class and behavior were sometimes laid down in law. For example, permitted mode of dress in sometimes and places was strictly regulated, with sumptuous dressing only for the high ranks of society and [[aristocracy]], whereas [[sumptuary law]]s stipulated the dress and jewelry appropriate for a person's social rank and [[social status|station]].

==Theoretical models==
Definitions of social classes reflect a number of [[social theory|sociological perspectives]], informed by [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The major perspectives historically have been [[Marxism]] and [[structural functionalism]]. The common stratum model of class divides society into a simple hierarchy of [[working class]], [[middle class]] and [[upper class]]. Within academia, two broad schools of definitions emerge: those aligned with 20th-century sociological stratum models of class society and those aligned with the 19th-century [[historical materialist]] economic models of the [[Marxist]]s and [[anarchist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Serravallo, Vincent|chapter=Class|editor=Parrillo, Vincent N.|title=Encyclopedia of social problems, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = |author2=Stacey C.

Another distinction can be drawn between analytical concepts of social class, such as the Marxist and Weberian traditions, as well as the more empirical traditions such as socio-economic status approach, which notes the correlation of income, education and wealth with social outcomes without necessarily implying a particular theory of social structure.&lt;ref&gt;John Scott, ''Class: critical concepts'' (1996) Volume 2 P. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marx, class is a combination of objective and subjective factors. Objectively, a class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]]. Subjectively, the members will necessarily have some perception ("[[class consciousness]]") of their similarity and common interest. Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest but is also a set of shared views regarding how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically. These class relations are reproduced through time.

In [[Marxist theory]], the [[class structure]] of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is characterized by the conflict between two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the [[means of production]] and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or "working class") who must sell their own labour power ([[wage labour]]). This is the fundamental economic structure of work and property, a state of inequality that is normalized and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]].

Marxists explain the history of "civilized" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and wage-workers (the proletariat). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods—in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels. "Manifesto of the Communist Party", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, "in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels. "Manifesto of the Communist Party", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; "An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers) and sergeants (foremen, over-lookers) who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. ''Capital: An Analysis of Capitalist Production'', Volume 1; Moscow; 1959; p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx makes the argument that, as the bourgeoisie reach a point of wealth accumulation, they hold enough power as the dominant class to shape political institutions and society according to their own interests. Marx then goes on to claim that the non-elite class, owing to their large numbers, have the power to overthrow the elite and create an equal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Manifesto of the Communist Party|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/|website = www.marxists.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all". This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for financial and banking institutions and money.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels. "Manifesto of the Communist Party", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 232-234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx ''Critique of the Gotha Program'' (1875)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weberian===
{{main|Three-component theory of stratification}}
[[Max Weber]] formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] that saw social class as emerging from an interplay between "class", "status" and "power". Weber believed that class position was determined by a person's relationship to the means of production, while status or "Stand" emerged from estimations of honor or prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (2015/1921).  "Classes, Stände, Parties" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber derived many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of many countries. He noted that contrary to Marx's theories, stratification was based on more than simply ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber pointed out that some members of the aristocracy lack economic wealth yet might nevertheless have political power. Likewise in Europe, many wealthy Jewish families lacked prestige and honor because they were considered members of a "pariah group".

* Class: A person's economic position in a society. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own.
* Status: A person's prestige, social honor or popularity in a society. Weber noted that political power was not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's status. Poets and saints, for example, can possess immense influence on society with often little economic worth.
* Power: A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status, but they still hold immense power.

Class was defined and measured according to the amount and kind of economic, cultural and social resources reported. [[Economic capital#Social science|Economic capital]] was defined as [[income]] and [[Asset (economics)|asset]]s; [[cultural capital]] as amount and type of cultural interests and activities; and [[social capital]] as the quantity and [[social status]] of their [[Friendship|friend]]s, [[family]] and personal and business contacts.&lt;ref name=BBCResults4213 /&gt; This theoretical framework was developed by [[Pierre Bourdieu#Bourdieu's theory of class distinction|Pierre Bourdieu]] who first published his [[La Distinction|theory of social distinction]] in 1979.

===Common three-stratum model===

Today, concepts of social class often assume three general categories: a very wealthy and powerful upper class that owns and controls the means of production; a middle class of professional workers, [[small business]] owners and low-level [[managers]]; and a lower class, who rely on low-paying [[wage]] jobs for their livelihood and often experience [[poverty]].

====Upper class====

They usually wield the greatest political power. In some countries, wealth alone is sufficient to allow entry into the upper class. In others, only people who are born or marry into certain aristocratic bloodlines are considered members of the upper class and those who gain great wealth through commercial activity are looked down upon by the aristocracy as ''[[nouveau riche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, "nouveau riche French Usually Disparaging. a person who is newly rich", 1969, Random House&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, for example, the upper classes are the aristocracy and royalty, with wealth playing a less important role in class status. Many aristocratic peerages or titles have seats attached to them, with the holder of the title (e.g. Earl of Bristol) and his family being the custodians of the house, but not the owners. Many of these require high expenditures, so wealth is typically needed. Many aristocratic peerages and their homes are parts of estates, owned and run by the title holder with moneys generated by the land, rents or other sources of wealth. However, in the United States where there is no aristocracy or royalty, the upper class status belongs to the extremely wealthy, the so-called "super-rich", though there is some tendency even in the United States for those with old family wealth to look down on those who have earned their money in business, the struggle between New Money and Old Money.

The upper class is generally contained within the richest one or two percent of the population. Members of the upper class are often born into it and are distinguished by immense wealth which is passed from generation to generation in the form of estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akhbar-Williams, Tahira|chapter=Class Structure|editor=Smith, Jessie C.|title=Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture, Volume 1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=978-0-313-35796-1|page=322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10rEGSIItjgC&amp;pg=PA322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle class====
{{Main|Middle class|Upper middle class|Lower middle class|Bourgeoisie}}
The middle class is the most contested of the three categories, the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the lower and upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Middle class|editor=Stearns, Peter N.|title=Encyclopedia of social history|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8153-0342-8|page=621|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&amp;pg=PA621}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of the contest of this term is that in the United States "middle class" is applied very broadly and includes people who would elsewhere be considered [[working class]]. Middle-class workers are sometimes called "[[white-collar worker]]s".

Theorists such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] have noted the tendency toward an enlarged middle class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological economies.&lt;ref&gt;Dahrendorf, Ralf. (1959) Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspectives concerning [[globalization]] and [[neocolonialism]], such as [[dependency theory]], suggest this is due to the shift of low-level labour to [[developing nation]]s and the [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornschier V. (1996), 'Western society in transition' New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lower class====
[[File:Camden NJ poverty.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|In the United States the lowest stratum of the working class, the [[underclass]], often lives in urban areas with low-quality [[civil services]]]]
{{Main|Working class |Proletariat}}
{{See also|Precarity}}

Lower class (occasionally described as working class) are those employed in low-paying [[wage]] jobs with very little economic security. The term "lower class" also refers to persons with low income.

The working class is sometimes separated into those who are employed but lacking financial security (the "[[working poor]]") and an [[underclass]]—those who are long-term [[unemployment|unemployed]] and/or [[homelessness|homeless]], especially those receiving [[welfare]] from the [[state (polity)|state]]. The latter is analogous to the Marxist term "[[lumpenproletariat]]".&lt;ref name="Brown-2009-953" /&gt; Members of the working class are sometimes called [[blue-collar worker]]s.

==Consequences of class position==
A person's socioeconomic class has wide-ranging effects. It can impact the schools they are able to attend, their health, the jobs open to them, who they may marry and their treatment by police and the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Escarce|first=José J|date=October 2003|title=Socioeconomic Status and the Fates of Adolescents|journal=Health Services Research|volume=38|issue=5|pages=1229–1234|doi=10.1111/1475-6773.00173|issn=0017-9124|pmc=1360943|pmid=14596387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilbur|first=Tabitha G.|last2=Roscigno|first2=Vincent J.|date=2016-08-31|title=First-generation Disadvantage and College Enrollment/Completion|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2378023116664351|journal=Socius|language=en|volume=2|pages=2378023116664351|doi=10.1177/2378023116664351|issn=2378-0231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchmann|first=Claudia|last2=DiPrete|first2=Thomas A.|date=2016-06-23|title=The Growing Female Advantage in College Completion: The Role of Family Background and Academic Achievement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240607100401|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=71|issue=4|pages=515–541|doi=10.1177/000312240607100401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiMaggio|first=Paul|date=1982|title=Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students|jstor=2094962|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=47|issue=2|pages=189–201|doi=10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unequal childhoods: Class, race, and family life.|last=Laureau|first=A.|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurst|first=Allison L.|date=2009|title=The Path to College: Stories of Students from the Working Class|jstor=41658872|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=16|issue=1/2|pages=257–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grodsky|first=Eric|last2=Riegle-Crumb|first2=Catherine|date=2010-01-01|title=Those Who Choose and Those Who Don’t: Social Background and College Orientation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716209348732|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=627|issue=1|pages=14–35|doi=10.1177/0002716209348732|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7758/9781610448550|title=A Pound of Flesh: Monetary Sanctions as Punishment for the Poor|last=Harris|first=Alexes|date=2016|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|isbn=9780871544612|doi=10.7758/9781610448550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angus Deaton and Anne Case have analyzed the mortality rates related to the group of white, middle-aged Americans between the ages of 45 and 54 and its relation to class. There has been a growing number of suicides and deaths by substance abuse in this particular group of [[middle-class Americans]]. This group also has been recorded to have an increase in reports of chronic pain and poor general health. Deaton and Case came to the conclusion from these observation that because of the constant stress that these white, middle aged Americans feel fighting poverty and wavering between the lower and working class, these strains have taken a toll on these people and affected their whole bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Death Rates Rising for Middle-Aged White Americans, Study Finds|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-11-02|access-date = 2015-12-09|issn = 0362-4331|first = Gina|last = Kolata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social classifications can also determine the sporting activities that such classes take part in. It is suggested that those of an upper social class are more likely to take part in sporting activities, whereas those of a lower social background are less likely to participate in sport. However, upper-class people tend to not take part in certain sports that have been commonly known to be linked with the lower class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Thomas C.|year=2002|title=The Paradox of Social Class and Sports Involvement|url=|journal=International Review for the Sociology of Sport|volume=37|pages=5–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
A person's social class has a significant impact on their educational opportunities. Not only are upper-class parents able to send their children to exclusive schools that are perceived to be better, but in many places state-supported schools for children of the upper class are of a much higher quality than those the state provides for children of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kozol, ''Savage Inequalities'', Crown, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McDonough, Patricia M.|title=Choosing colleges: how social class and schools structure opportunity|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7914-3477-2|pages=1–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHdy8ql2mM4C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Shin, Kwang-Yeong &amp; Lee, Byoung-Hoon|chapter=Social class and educational opportunity in South Korea|editors=Attewell, Paul &amp; Newman, Katherine S.|title=Growing gaps: educational inequality around the world|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-973218-0|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqf8ShfYk_YC&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=McNamee, Stephen J. &amp; Miller, Robert K.|title=The meritocracy myth|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7425-6168-7|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6szZEsV-dDEC&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Thomas, Scott L. &amp; Bell, Angela|chapter=Social class and higher education: a reorganization of opportunities|editor=Weis, Lois|title=The Way Class Works: Readings on School, Family, and the Economy|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-95707-6|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sj1HCJaRkHMC&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Sacks, Peter|title=Tearing down the gates: confronting the class divide in American education|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-24588-4|pages=112–114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EE-m0ZwjuqsC&amp;pg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of good schools is one factor that perpetuates the class divide across generations.

In 1977, British [[cultural theorist]] [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]] published a study titled "Learning to Labour" in which he investigated the connection between social class and education. In his study, he found that a group of working-class schoolchildren had developed an antipathy towards the acquisition of knowledge as being outside their class and therefore undesirable, perpetuating their presence in the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Willis, ''Learning to Labor'', Columbia University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===

A recent United Kingdom government study has suggested that a "glass floor" exists in British society which prevents those who are less able, but who come from wealthier backgrounds, from slipping down the social ladder. This is due to the fact that those from wealthier backgrounds have more opportunities available to them. In fact, the article shows that less able, better-off kids are 35% more likely to become high earners than bright poor kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission|title=New research exposes the 'glass floor' in British society|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-research-exposes-the-glass-floor-in-british-society|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class conflict==
{{Main|Class conflict}}

Class conflict, frequently referred to as "class warfare" or "class struggle", is the tension or antagonism which exists in society due to competing [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] interests and desires between people of different classes.

For Marx, the history of class society was a history of class conflict. He pointed to the successful rise of the bourgeoisie and the necessity of revolutionary violence—a heightened form of class conflict—in securing the bourgeoisie rights that supported the capitalist economy.

Marx believed that the exploitation and poverty inherent in capitalism were a pre-existing form of class conflict. Marx believed that wage labourers would need to [[revolt]] to bring about a [[Wealth redistribution|more equitable distribution of wealth]] and political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Streeter, Calvin L.|chapter=Community|editor=Mizrahi, Terry|title=Encyclopedia of social work, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-530661-3|page=352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aF-Mpm9JDogC&amp;pg=PA352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunt, Stephen|chapter=class conflict|editors=Ritzer, George &amp; Ryan, J.

==Classless society==
{{Main|Classless society}}

"Classless society" refers to a society in which no one is born into a social class. Distinctions of [[wealth]], [[income]], [[education]], [[culture]] or [[social network]] might arise and would only be determined by individual experience and achievement in such a society.

Since these distinctions are difficult to avoid, advocates of a classless society (such as [[anarchists]] and [[communists]]) propose various means to achieve and maintain it and attach varying degrees of importance to it as an end in their overall programs/philosophy.

==Relationship between ethnicity and class==
{{Further|Racial inequality}}
[[File:Elizaveta with Black Servant by Grooth (1743, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|upright|Equestrian portrait of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] with a [[Moors|Moor]] servant]]

[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and other large-scale groupings can also influence class standing. The association of particular ethnic groups with class statuses is common in many societies. As a result of conquest or internal ethnic differentiation, a ruling class is often ethnically homogenous and particular races or ethnic groups in some societies are legally or customarily restricted to occupying particular class positions. Which ethnicities are considered as belonging to high or low classes varies from society to society.

In modern societies, strict legal links between ethnicity and class have been drawn, such as in [[apartheid]], the [[caste system in Africa]], the position of the [[Burakumin]] in Japanese society and the [[casta]] system in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The term '''social criticism''' often refers to a mode of criticism that locates the reasons for malicious conditions in a society considered to be in a flawed [[social structure]]. It may also refer to people adhering to a social critic's aims at practical solutions by way of specific measures either for consensual [[reform]] or powerful [[revolution]].

== European roots ==
[[Religious persecution]] was common in Europe and was the reason for many physical and mental exoduses within the continent. Through such experiences, one of the first documents of social criticism was born: the [[Jean Meslier#Social Criticism|''Testament'' of Jean Meslier]].

== Protest experience with political theories==
Repression experienced by a [[minority group|minority]] often leads to [[protest]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Without sufficient resolution of the dispute, a social criticism can be formulated, often covered by political groups (political [[monopoly]]). For protesting people ''within'' a [[social movement]], it is often frustrating to [[experience]] failure of the movement and its own agenda.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[positivism dispute]] between [[critical rationalism]], e.g. between [[Karl Popper]] and  the [[Frankfurt School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Amico|first=Robert|date=1990-12-21|title=Karl Popper and the Frankfurt School|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/1990/86/33|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1990|issue=86|pages=33–48|doi=10.3817/1290086033|issn=0090-6514}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the academic form of the same discrepancy. This dispute deals with the question of whether research in the [[social sciences]] should be "neutral" or consciously adopt a partisan view.

==Academic forms==
Academic works of social criticism can belong to  [[social philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[psychoanalysis]] but also [[cultural studies]] and other disciplines or reject academic forms of [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hhh.gavilan.edu/kwarren/LitCrit.html|title=Types of Literary Criticism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and music==
{{see also|Literary criticism}}
Social criticism can also be expressed in a fictional form, e.g. in a revolutionary novel like ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' by [[Jack London]] or in [[dystopia]]n [[novel]]s like  [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) or [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) or [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), or [[Rafael Grugman]]'s ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008), [[children's books]] or films.

Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] furthered the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery movement]] in the United States, and the 1885 novel ''[[Ramona]]'', by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], brought about changes in laws regarding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Similarly, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' helped create new laws related to public health and food handling, and [[Arthur Morrison]]'s 1896 novel ''A Child of the Jago'' caused England to change its housing laws. George Orwell and [[Charles Dickens]] wrote ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature. ''Animal Farm'', written in 1944, is a book that tells the animal fable of a farm in  which the farm animals revolt against their human masters. It is an  example of social criticism in literature in which Orwell satirized  the events in Russia after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. He anthropomorphises the animals, and alludes each one to a counterpart  in [[Russian history]]. ''A Tale of Two Cities'' also typifies this kind of literature. Besides the central theme of love, is another prevalent theme, that of a revolution gone bad. He shows us that, unfortunately, human nature causes us to be vengeful and, for some of us, overly ambitious. Both these books are similar in that both describe how, even with the best of intentions, our ambitions get the best of us. Both authors also demonstrate that violence and the [[Machiavellian]] attitude of "the ends justifying the means" are deplorable. They also express their authors' disenchantment with the state of evolution of human nature.

According to [[Frederick Douglass]], "Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."&lt;ref&gt;From Douglass´ speech in 1886 on the 24th anniversary of Emancipation, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors imply, that even if we begin with honourable intentions, there will be some who will let their basic instincts take control. ''Animal Farm'' portrays this nature through parodying events in real history. Given the right conditions, these events could happen anywhere. Take for example, a leader becoming overly ambitious, to the point of harming his people for more power.

In ''A Tale of Two Cities'', Dickens examines the inner soul, and shares with us how people are driven to the valley of human emotions, where desperation and anger reign, and what could happen afterwards if we let these emotions build up inside. Every human being is capable of becoming a ruthless, opportunistic being like Napoleon or Madame Defarge, if placed in the right place, at the right time.

Social criticism is certainly present in opera ([[The Cradle Will Rock]], [[Trouble in Tahiti]]) and other types of classical music, such as the [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No.13]], called "[[Babi Yar]]", of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. Other musical expressions of social criticism are  frequent in [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rap]] music, examples being [[Pretty Vacant|"Pretty Vacant"]] by [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Brenda's Got a Baby|"Brenda's Got a Baby"]] by [[2Pac]]. Heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] also use social criticism extensively, particularly in their earlier works.

'''Soku-hi''' ({{lang-ja|即非}}) means "is and is not". The term is primarily used by the representatives of the [[Kyoto School]] of [[Eastern philosophy]].

The logic of soku-hi or "is and is not" represents a balanced logic of symbolization reflecting sensitivity to the mutual determination of universality and particularity in nature, and a corresponding emphasis on nonattachment to [[Predicate (grammar)|linguistic predicates]] and subjects as representations of the real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/axtell1.htm G.

In biology, a '''species complex''' is a group of closely related [[species]] that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: '''cryptic species''' for two or more species hidden under one species name, '''sibling species''' for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and '''species flock''' for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal [[taxonomic ranks]], '''species group''', '''species aggregate''', and '''superspecies''' are also in use.

Two or more taxa once considered [[conspecific]] (of the same species) may later be subdivided into [[infraspecific taxa]] (taxa within a species, such as bacterial [[strain (biology)|strains]] or plant [[variety (botany)|varieties]]), but this is not a species complex.

A species complex is in most cases a [[monophyletic group]] with a common ancestor, although there are exceptions. It may represent an early stage after [[speciation]], but may also have been separated for a long time period without evolving [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences. [[Hybrid speciation]] can be a component in the evolution of a species complex.

Species complexes exist in all groups of organisms. They are identified by the rigorous study of differences between individual species, making use of minute morphological details, tests of [[reproductive isolation]], or [[DNA]]-based methods such as [[molecular phylogenetics]] or [[DNA barcoding]]. The existence of extremely similar species may cause local and global [[species diversity]] to be underestimated. Recognizing similar but distinct species is important for [[Disease prevention|disease]] and [[pest control]], and in [[conservation biology]], although drawing dividing lines between species [[species problem|can be inherently difficult]].

A species complex is typically considered as a group of close, but distinct species.&lt;ref name="Brown 1995" /&gt; Obviously, the concept is closely tied to the definition of a species. Modern biology understands a species as "separately evolving [[metapopulation]] [[lineage (evolution)|lineage]]" but acknowledges that the [[species problem|criteria to delimit species]] may depend on the group studied.&lt;ref name="De Queiroz 2007"/&gt; Thus, many species defined traditionally, based only on morphological similarity, have been found to comprise several distinct species when other criteria, such as genetic differentiation or [[reproductive isolation]] were applied.&lt;ref name="Mayr 1970"/&gt;

A more restricted use applies the term to close species between which [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]] occurred or is occurring, leading to intermediate forms and blurred species boundaries.&lt;ref name="Horandl 2009" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The informal classification, superspecies, can be exemplified by the [[grizzled skipper]] butterfly, a superspecies that is further divided into three subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JONG|first=R.|date=December 1987|title=Superspecies Pyrgus malvae (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) in the East Mediterranean, with notes on phylogenetic and biological relationships|url=|journal=Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie – via Naturalis Repository|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors apply the term also to a species with [[polymorphism (biology)|intraspecific variability]], which might be a sign of ongoing or incipient [[speciation]]. Examples are [[ring species]]&lt;ref name="Moritz 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowen 2001" /&gt; or species with [[subspecies]], where it is often unclear if these should be considered separate species.&lt;ref name="Muñoz 2013" /&gt;

===Included concepts===

Several terms are used synonymously for a species complex, but some of them may also have slightly different, or more narrow meanings. In the [[nomenclature code]]s of zoology and bacteriology, no [[taxonomic rank]]s are defined at the level between [[subgenera]] and species,&lt;ref name="ICZN 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICNB 1992" /&gt; while the botanical code defines four ranks below genera (section, subsections, series and subseries).&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode" /&gt; Different informal taxonomic solutions have been used to indicate a species complex.

{{defn|1=Also ''physiologic race''&lt;ref name="Morris 1992"/&gt; (uncommon).

==Identification==

Distinguishing close species within a complex requires the study of often very small differences. Morphological differences may be minute and only visible using adapted methods, such as [[microscopy]]. However, distinct species may sometimes have no morphological differences.&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; In these cases, other characters, e.g. in the species' [[Life history theory|life history]], [[ethology|behavior]], [[physiology]], or [[karyology]] can be explored. As an example, [[bird vocalization|territorial songs]] are indicative of species in the [[Certhia|treecreepers]], a bird genus with little morphological differences.&lt;ref name="Tietze 2006" /&gt; Mating tests are common in some groups such as fungi to confirm the [[reproductive isolation]] of two species.&lt;ref name="Dai 2003" /&gt;

Analysis of [[DNA sequences]] is becoming increasingly standard for species recognition and may in many cases be the only useful method.&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; Different methods are used to analyse such genetic data, for example [[molecular phylogenetics]] or [[DNA barcoding]]. Such methods have greatly contributed to the discovery of cryptic species,&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marques|first=Isabel|last2=Montgomery|first2=Sean A.|last3=Barker|first3=Michael S.|last4=Macfarlane|first4=Terry D.|last5=Conran|first5=John G.|last6=Catalán|first6=Pilar|last7=Rieseberg|first7=Loren H.|last8=Rudall|first8=Paula J.|last9=Graham|first9=Sean W.|date=2016-04-01|title=Transcriptome-derived evidence supports recent polyploidization and a major phylogeographic division in Trithuria submersa (Hydatellaceae, Nymphaeales)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13755/abstract|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=210|issue=1|pages=310–323|doi=10.1111/nph.13755|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; including such emblematic species as the [[fly agaric]]&lt;ref name="Geml 2008" /&gt; or the [[African elephants]].&lt;ref name="Roca 2001" /&gt;

Species forming a complex have typically diverged very recently from each other, allowing in some cases to retrace the process of [[speciation]]. Species with differentiated populations such as [[ring species]] are sometimes seen as an example of early, ongoing speciation, i.e. a species complex in formation. Nevertheless, similar but distinct species have sometimes been isolated for a long time without evolving differences, a phenomenon called "morphological stasis".&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; As an examples, the Amazonian frog ''[[Pristimantis ockendeni]]'' is actually at least three different species that diverged over 5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Elmer 2007" /&gt;

[[Stabilizing selection]] has been invoked as a force maintaining similarity in species complexes, especially when adaptation to special environments, such as a host in the case of symbionts, or extreme environments, constrains possible directions of evolution: In such cases, strongly divergent selection is not to be expected.&lt;ref name="Bickford2007" /&gt; Also, asexual reproduction, such as through [[apomixis]] in plants, may separate lineages without producing a great degree of morphological differentiation.

[[File:Cryptic speciation.svg|thumb|left|alt=Scheme showing morphological stasis and hybrid speciation, with species presresented by circles, their color indicating morphological similarity or dissimilarity|Possible processes explaining similarity of species in a species complex:&lt;br&gt;'''a''' – morphological stasis&lt;br&gt;'''b''' – [[hybrid speciation]]]]

A species complex is usually a group that has one common ancestor (a [[monophyletic]] group), although closer examination can sometimes disprove this. As an example, the yellow-spotted "fire salamanders" in the genus ''[[Salamandra]]'', formerly all classified as one species ''[[Salamandra salamandra|S. salamandra]]'', are not monophyletic: the [[Corsican fire salamander]]'s closest relative was shown to be the entirely black [[Alpine salamander]].&lt;ref name="Steinfartz 2000" /&gt; In such cases, similarity has arisen from [[convergent evolution]].

[[Hybrid speciation]] can lead to unclear species boundaries through a process of [[reticulate evolution]], where species have two parent species as their [[most recent common ancestor]]s. In such cases, the hybrid species may have intermediate characters, as demonstrated e.g. in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies.&lt;ref name="Mallet 2007" /&gt; Hybrid speciation has been observed in various species complexes, such as insects, fungi, and plants. In plants, hybridization often takes place through [[polyploidization]], and hybrid plant species are called [[nothospecies]].

===Range===
&lt;!-- change to "Range and habitats" --&gt;

In regards to whether or not members of a species group share a [[Range (biology)|range]], sources differ. A source from [[Iowa State University]] Department of [[Agronomy]] says that members of a species group usually have partially overlapping ranges but do not [[interbreed]] with each other.&lt;ref name="iowa" /&gt; ''A Dictionary of Zoology'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 1999) describes a species group as complex of related species that exist [[Allopatric speciation|allopatrically]] and explains that this "grouping can often be supported by experimental crosses in which only certain pairs of species will produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]."&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The examples given below may support both uses of the term "species group."

Often such complexes only become evident when a new species is introduced into the system, breaking down existing species barriers. An example is the introduction of the [[Spanish slug]] in [[Northern Europe]], where interbreeding with the local [[black slug]] and [[red slug]], traditionally considered clearly separate species that did not interbreed, shows they may be actually just subspecies of the same species.&lt;ref name="Engelke 2006" /&gt;

Where closely related species coexist in [[sympatry]], it is often a particular challenge to understand how these similar species persist without outcompeting each other. [[Niche partitioning]] is one mechanism invoked to explain this. Studies in some species complexes indeed suggest that species divergence went in par with ecological differentiation, with species now preferring different microhabitats.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
Similar methods also found that the Amazonian frog ''[[Eleutherodactylus ockendeni]]'' is actually at least 3 different species that diverged over 5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Elmer 2007" /&gt;
A ''species flock'' may arise when a species penetrates a new geographical area and diversifies to occupy a variety of [[ecological niche]]s; this process is known as [[adaptive radiation]]. The first species flock to be recognized as such was the 13 species of [[Darwin's finches]] on the [[Galápagos Islands]] described by [[Charles Darwin]].

==Practical implications==

===Biodiversity estimates===

It has been suggested that cryptic species complexes are very common in the marine environment.&lt;ref name="Knowlton 1993" /&gt; Although this suggestion came before the detailed analysis of many systems using DNA sequence data, it has been proven correct.&lt;ref name="Knowlton 2000" /&gt; The increased use of DNA sequence in the investigation of organismal diversity (also called [[Phylogeography]] and [[DNA barcoding]]) has led to the discovery of a great many cryptic species complexes in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan ''[[Celleporella|Celleporella hyalina]]'',&lt;ref name="Gómez 2007" /&gt; detailed morphological analyses and mating compatibility tests between the isolates identified by DNA sequence analysis were used to confirm that these groups consisted of more than 10 ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many million years.

Evidence from the identification of cryptic species has led some{{Who|date=April 2010}} to conclude that current estimates of global species richness are too low.

===Disease and pathogen control===

[[File:AnophelesGambiaemosquito.jpg|thumb|alt=A mosquito sitting on the tip of a finger|The ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' mosquito complex contains [[malaria]] vector and non-vector species.&lt;ref name="Besansky 1994" /&gt;]]

Pests, species causing diseases, and their vectors, have direct importance for humans. When they are found to be cryptic species complexes, the ecology and virulence of each of these species needs to be reevaluated to devise appropriate control strategies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Examples are cryptic species in the [[malaria]] vector genus of mosquito, ''[[Anopheles]]'', or the fungi causing [[cryptococcosis]].

===Conservation biology===
When a species is found to comprise in fact several phylogenetically distinct species, each of these typically have smaller distribution ranges and population sizes than reckoned before. These different species can also differ in their ecology, e.g. having different breeding strategies or habitat requirements, which has to be taken into account for appropriate management.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For example, [[giraffe]] populations and subspecies differ genetically to such an extent that they may be considered species; while the giraffe as a whole is not considered threatened, considering each cryptic species separately would mean a much higher level of threat.&lt;ref name="Brown 2007" /&gt;

[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|''The Drunkard's Progress'': by [[Nathaniel Currier]] 1846, warns that moderate drinking leads, step-by-step, to total disaster.|upright=1.5]]

The '''temperance movement''' is a [[social movement]] against the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Participants in the movement typically criticize [[alcohol intoxication]] or promote complete abstinence ([[teetotalism]]), with leaders emphasizing alcohol's negative effects on health, personality, and family life. Typically the movement promotes [[alcohol education]], as well as demands new [[alcohol law|laws against the selling of alcohols]], or those regulating the availability of alcohol, or those completely [[prohibition|prohibiting]] it. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Temperance Movement became prominent in many countries, particularly English-speaking and [[Scandinavia]]n ones, and it led to [[Prohibition in the United States]] from 1920 to 1933.

==Context==
In the late-seventeenth century, alcohol was a vital part of colonial life as a beverage, medicine, and commodity for men, women, and children. Drinking was widely accepted and completely integrated in society; however, drunkenness was not. Despite that, drunkenness was common and not often seen as a social problem.&lt;ref name="blocker" /&gt;{{rp|5}} The attitudes towards alcohol began to change in the late eighteenth century. One of the reasons for the shifting attitudes was the necessity for sober laborers to operate heavy machinery that had been developed as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Anthony Benezet]] suggested abstinence from alcohol in 1775.&lt;ref name="blocker" /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|36–37}} As early as the 1790s, physician [[Benjamin Rush]] researched the danger that drinking alcohol could lead to disease that leads to a lack of self-control and he cited abstinence as the only treatment option.&lt;ref name="chavigny"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chavigny |first1=Katherine A. |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Sarah W. |editor2-last=Acker |editor2-first=Caroline Jean |title=Altering American Consciousness: The History of Alcohol and Drug Use in the United States, 1800–2000 |date=2004 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |location=Amherst, MA |isbn=978-1-55849-425-1 |chapter=Reforming Drunkards in Nineteenth-Century America: Religion, Medicine, Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109}} Rush saw benefits in fermented drinks, but condemned the use of distilled spirits.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}} As well as addiction, Rush noticed the correlation that drunkenness had with disease, death, suicide and crime. After the [[American Revolution]], Rush called upon ministers of various churches to act in preaching the messages of temperance.&lt;ref name="deliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Norman H. |title=Deliver Us From Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition |date=1976 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=978-0393091700}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} However, abstinence messages were largely ignored by Americans until the 1820s.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}}

===Origins (pre-1820)===
In the eighteenth century, there was a "[[Gin Craze]]" in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The bourgeoisie became increasingly critical of the widespread drunkenness among the lower classes. Motivated by the bourgeoisie's desire for order, and amplified by the population growth in the cities, the drinking of gin became the subject of critical national debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeomans |first1=Henry |title=Alcohol and Moral Regulation: Public Attitudes, Spirited Measures and Victorian Hangovers. |date=2014 |publisher=[[Policy Press]] |isbn=9781447309932 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hJXhAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth-century United States, alcohol was still regarded as a necessary part of the American diet for both practical and social reasons. On the one hand, water supplies were often polluted, milk was not always available, and coffee and tea was expensive. On the other hand, social construct of the time made it impolite for people (particularly men) to refuse alcohol.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}} Drunkenness was not a problem, because people would only drink small amounts of alcohol throughout the day, but at the turn of the nineteenth-century, overindulgence and subsequent intoxication became an issue that led to the disintegration of the family.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}} Early temperance societies often associated with churches were located in upstate New York and New England, but only lasted a few years. These early temperance societies called for moderate drinking, but had little influence outside of their geographical areas.

In 1743, [[John Wesley]], the founder of the [[Methodist Church]]es, proclaimed  "that buying, selling, and drinking of liquor, unless absolutely necessary, were evils to be avoided".&lt;ref name="Williams1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=William Henry|title=The Garden of American Methodism: The Delmarva Peninsula, 1769-1820|year=1984|publisher=Peninsula Conference of the United Methodist Church|isbn=9780842022279|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, Calvinist ministers met with a seminary in Massachusetts to write articles about abstinence from alcohol to use in preaching to their congregations.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}} The Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance (MSSI) was formed in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hampel |first1=Robert L. |title=Temperance and Prohibition in Massachusetts 1813-1852 |date=1982 |publisher=UMI Research Press |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |isbn=978-0835712910 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization only accepted men of high social standing and encouraged moderation in alcohol consumption. Its peak of influence was in 1818, but the MSSI ended in 1820 and made no significant mark on the future of the temperance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=David J. |title=Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance |url=https://www.alcoholproblemsandsolutions.org/massachusetts-society-for-the-suppression-of-intemperance/ |website=Alcohol Problems and Solutions |publisher=Sociology Department: State University of New York |accessdate=13 June 2018|date=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}} Other small temperance societies appear in the 1810s, but had little impact outside their immediate regions and they disbanded soon after. Their methods had little effect in implementing temperance, and drinking actually increased until after 1830; however, their methods of public pledges and meetings, as well as handing out of pamphlets, were implemented by more lasting temperance societies such as the American Temperance Society.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}}

=== Promoting moderation (1820s–'30s) ===
[[File:Temperance song hand book.jpg|thumb|This is the songbook used at the Women's Temperance Organization from [[Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania]]]]
The temperance movement began at a national level in the 1820s, having been popularized by evangelical temperance reformers and among the middle classes.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|109}}&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}}{{refn|group=note|Or, according to some scholars, in the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Benowitz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Benowitz|editor1-first=June Melby|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Women and Religion|edition=2nd|volume=2|date=2017|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|title=Temperance Movement|isbn=978-1-4408-3987-0|page=590|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jm8tDwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There was a concentration on advice against hard spirits rather than on abstinence from all alcohol and on moral reform rather than legal measures against alcohol.&lt;ref name="Fryer"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Fryer|year=1965|title=Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery|pages=141–4|publisher=[[Corgi (publisher)|Corgi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|One example was [[Benjamin Rush]]'s 1784 pamphlet ''An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human Body and Mind'', which advocated total abstinence of distilled liquors.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu" /&gt;}}  An early temperance movement began during the [[American Revolution]] in [[Connecticut]], [[Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York state]], with farmers forming associations to ban whiskey distilling. The movement spread to eight states, advocating temperance rather than abstinence and taking positions on religious issues such as observance of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="blocker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Revolution]] there was a new emphasis on good citizenship for the new republic.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt; With the Evangelical Protestant religious revival of the 1820s and '30s, called the [[Second Great Awakening]], social movements began aiming for a perfect society. This included [[abolitionism]] and temperance.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clean"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engs|first1=Ruth Clifford|title=Clean Living Movements: American Cycles of Health Reform|date=2000|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-95994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} The Awakening brought with it an optimism about moral reform, achieved through volunteer organizations.&lt;ref name="fahey"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Fahey|first1=David M.|title=Temperance And Racism: John Bull, Johnny Reb, and the Good Templars|date=2015|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|isbn=978-0-8131-6151-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xLIfBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Although the temperance movement was nonsectarian in principle, the movement consisted mostly of church-goers.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;

Beecher described inebriation as a "national sin" as well as suggesting legislation to prohibit the sales of alcohol.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|24–25}} He believed that it was only possible for drinkers to reform in the early stages of addiction, because anyone in advanced stages of addiction, according to Beecher, had damaged their morality and could not be saved.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|110}} Early temperance reformers often viewed drunkards as warnings rather than as victims of a disease, leaving the state to take care of them and their conduct.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|110}} In the same year, the [[American Temperance Society]] (ATS) was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], within 12 years claiming more than 8,000 local groups and over 1,250,000 members.&lt;ref name="woodworth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodworth |first1=Jed |title=The Word of Wisdom |url=https://history.lds.org/article/doctrine-and-covenants-word-of-wisdom?lang=eng |website=Revelations in Context |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cherrington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cherrington |first1=Ernest H. |title=The Evolution of Prohibition in the United States: A chronological history of the liquor problem and the temperance reform in the United States from the earliest settlements to the consummation of national prohibition |date=1920 |publisher=The American Issue Press |location=Westerville, Ohio |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofprohi00cheruoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|93}}Presbyterian preacher [[Charles Grandison Finney]], taught abstinence from [[ardent spirit]]s. In the Rochester, New York revival of 1831, individuals were required to sign a temperance pledge in order to receive salvation. Finney believed and taught that the body represented the "temple of God" and anything that would harm the "temple" including alcohol, must be avoided.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|24}} By 1833, several thousand groups similar to the ATS were formed in most states. In some of the large communities, temperance almanacs were released which gave information about planting and harvesting as well as current information about the temperance issues.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

Temperance societies were being organized in England about the same time, many inspired by a Belfast professor of theology, and Presbyterian Church of Ireland Minister [[John Edgar(Rev.)|John Edgar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgarfamily.angelfire.com/ministers.htm|title=Edgar Ministers in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|accessdate=June 11, 2012|author=John Edgar|author2=Samuel Edgar |author3=David M. Carson |author4=Richard Edgar |date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who poured his stock of whiskey out of his window in 1829. He mainly concentrated his fire on the elimination of spirits rather than wine and beer.&lt;ref name="Fryer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harrison| first = Brian| title = Drink &amp; the Victorians, The Temperance Question in England 1815–1872| publisher = [[Faber and Faber]]| year = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weston, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 1829 he wrote a letter in the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' publicizing his views on [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]. He also formed the [[Ulster Temperance Movement]] with other Presbyterian clergy, initially enduring ridicule from members of his community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evangelical Protestantism in Ulster society 1740–1890|first=David|last=Hempton|location=Myrtle Hill|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1830s saw a tremendous growth in temperance groups, not just in England and the United States, but also in British colonies, especially [[Temperance movement in New Zealand|New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;{{cite web|title=PROHIBITION: The Movement in New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/P/Prohibition/TheMovementInNewZealand/en|work=The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=June 11, 2012|author=A.

Out of the religious revival and reform appeared [[Mormonism]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]], new Christian denominations that established criteria for healthy living as a part of their religious teachings, namely temperance.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

====Latter Day Saints====
The Word of Wisdom is a health code followed by the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Latter Day Saint denominations which advises how to maintain good health: what one should do and what one should abstain from. One of the most prominent items in the Word of Wisdom is the complete abstinence from alcohol.&lt;ref name="ludlow"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Lynn Lyon|authorlink1=Word of Wisdom|editor1-last=Ludlow|editor1-first=Daniel H.|title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0028796055|pages=1584–1585|edition=Vol. 4|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/EoM/id/4352|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Word of Wisdom was written, the Latter Day Saints were residing in Kirtland, Ohio and the Kirtland Temperance Society was organized on October 6, 1830 with 239 members.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shupe|first1=Paul|title=Indulging in Temperance: Prohibition and Political Activism in the RLDS Church|journal=Journal of Mormon History|date=1983|volume=10|pages=21–33|url=https://mormonhistoryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Journal-of-Mormon-History-Vol.-10-1983.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, the Word of Wisdom was influenced by the temperance movement. In June 1830, the ''Millenial Harbinger'' quoted from a book "The Simplicity of Health" which strongly condemned the use of alcohol, tobacco, and the untempered consumption of meat, similar to the provisions in the Word of Wisdom revealed three years later. This gave publicity to the movement and Temperance Societies began to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Thomas G. |title=The Word of Wisdom: From Principle to Requirement |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |date=Autumn 1981 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=85–86 |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/V14N03.pdf |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard J.|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|pages=37–49|date=Winter 1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 1833, a few weeks before the Word of Wisdom came forth, all distilleries in the Kirtland area were shut down.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; During the early history of the Word of Wisdom, temperance and other items in the health code were seen more as wise recommendations than commandments.&lt;ref name="decade"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoskisson |first1=Paul Y. |title=The Word of Wisdom in its First Decade |journal=Journal of Mormon History |date=Winter 2012 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=131–200 |jstor=23292682}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}} 

Although he advocated for temperance, Joseph Smith did not preach complete abstinence from alcohol. According to Paul H. Peterson and Ronald W. Walker, Joseph Smith did not enforce abstinence from alcohol because he believed it would threaten individual choice and agency as well as that forcing the Latter Day Saints to comply would cause separation in the Church.&lt;ref name="brigham"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Ronald W. |last2=Peterson |first2=Paul H. |title=Brigham Young's Word of Wisdom Legacy |journal=BYU Studies Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=3–4 |pages=29–64 |url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/brigham-youngs-word-wisdom-legacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} In Harry M. Beardsley's book ''Joseph Smith and his Mormon Empire'', Beardsley argues that some Mormon historians attempted to portray Joseph Smith as a teetotaler, but according to the testimonies of his contemporaries, Joseph Smith often drank alcohol in his own home or the homes of his friends in Kirtland. In Nauvoo, Illinois Smith was far less discreet with his drinking habits.&lt;ref name="eco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beardsley"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beardsley |first1=Harry M. |title=Joseph Smith and his Mormon Empire |date=1931 |publisher=The Riverside Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end of the nineteenth century, second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Brigham Young said that the Saints could no longer justify disobeying the Word of Wisdom because of the way that it was originally presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='The Word of Wisdom'|url=https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/MStar/id/29019/rec/1 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=The Latter Day Saints' Millennial Star |issue=47 |date=September 21, 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Heber J. Grant]], then president of the LDS church, officially called on the Latter-day Saints to strictly adhere to the Word of Wisdom, including complete abstinence from alcohol.&lt;ref name="woodworth" /&gt;

====Millerites and Seventh-day Adventists====
Founder of the Millerites, William Miller claimed that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ would be in 1843 and that anyone who drank alcohol would be unprepared for the Second Coming.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|29}} After the [[Great Disappointment]] in 1843, the Seventh-day Adventist denomination was formed by Ellen G. White and her husband, a preacher, [[James Springer White]] who did not use alcohol or tobacco.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Ellen preached healthful living to her followers, without specifying abstinence from alcohol, as most of her followers were temperance followers, and that would have been implied.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

As a response to rising social problems in urbanized areas, a stricter form of temperance emerged called [[teetotalism]], which promoted the complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages, this time including wine and beer, not just ardent spirits.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="snodgrass"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|encyclopedia=The Civil War Era and Reconstruction: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural and Economic History|date=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|title=Temperance Movement|isbn=978-1-317-45791-6|pages=600–3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWysBwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|602}} The name "teetotaler" came from the capital "T"s that were written next to the names of people who pledged complete abstinence from alcohol.&lt;ref name="woodworth" /&gt; People were instructed to only drink pure water and the teetotalists were known as the "pure-water army".&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Pilgrims-The Irish-The Sandwich Islanders |journal=The Sailor's Magazine and Naval Journal |date=1843 |volume=15 |pages=270–271 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m9sZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA271&amp;lpg=RA1-PA271&amp;dq=pure+water+army+teetotalism#v=onepage&amp;q=pure%20water%20army%20teetotalism&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[American Temperance Union]] advocated the total abstinence of distilled and fermented liquors.

==== The Washingtonian movement ====
In 1840, a group of artisans in Baltimore, Maryland created their own temperance society that could appeal to hard-drinking men like themselves. Calling themselves the [[Washingtonians]], they pledged complete abstinence, attempting to persuade others through their own experience with alcohol rather than relying on preaching and religious lectures. They argued that sympathy was an overlooked method for helping people with alcohol addictions, citing coercion as an ineffective method. For that reason, they did not support prohibitive legislation of alcohol.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|110}} They were suspicious of the divisiveness of denominational religion and did not use religion in their discussions, emphasizing personal abstinence. They never set up national organizations, believing that concentration of power and distance from citizens causes corruption. Meetings were public and they encouraged equal participation, appealing to both men and women and northerners and southerners.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|111}} Unlike early temperance reformers, the Washingtonians did not believe that intemperance destroyed a drinker's morality.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|112}} They worked on the platform that abstinence communities could be created through sympathizing with drunkards rather than ostracizing them through the belief that they are sinners or diseased.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}} 

On February 22, 1842 in [[Springfield, Illinois]], while a member of the [[Illinois Legislature]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] gave an address to the Springfield Washington Temperance Society on the 110th anniversary of the birth of [[George Washington]]. In the speech, Lincoln criticized early methods of the temperance movement as overly forceful and advocated reason as the solution to the problem of intemperance, praising the current temperance movement methods of the Washingtonian movement.&lt;ref name="lincoln"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morel |first1=Lucas E. |title=Lincoln among the Reformers: Tempering the Temperance Movement |journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |date=1999 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–34 |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0020.103/--lincoln-among-the-reformers-tempering-the-temperance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1845, the Washingtonian movement was no longer as prominent for three reasons. Firstly, the evangelist reformers attacked them for refusing to admit alcoholism was a sin. Secondly, the movement was criticized as unsuccessful due to the number of men who would go back to drinking. Finally, the movement was internally divided by differing views on prohibition legislation.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}} Temperance fraternal societies such as the Sons of Temperance and the Good Samaritans took the place of the Washingtonian movement with largely similar views relating to helping alcoholics by way of sympathy and philanthropy. They, however, differed from the Washingtonians through their closed rather than public meetings, fines, and membership qualifications, believing their methods would be more effective in curbing men's alcohol addictions.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}} After the 1850s, the temperance movement was characterized more by prevention by means of prohibitions laws, than remedial efforts to facilitate the recovery of alcoholics.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}}

==== Gospel temperance ====
By the mid-1850s, the United States was divided from differing views of slavery and prohibition laws and economic depression. This influenced the Third Great Awakening in the United States. The prayer meeting largely characterized this religious revival. Prayer meetings were devotional meetings run by laypeople rather than clergy and consisted of prayed and testimony by attendees. The meetings were held frequently and pledges of temperance were confessed. Prayer meetings and pledges characterized the post-Civil war "gospel" temperance movement. This movement was similar to early temperance movements in that drunkenness was seen as a sin; however, public testimony was used to convert others and convince them to sign the pledge.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|114}} New and revitalized organizations emerged including the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) and the early [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU). The movement relied on the reformed individuals using local evangelical resources to create institutions to reform drunk men. Reformed men in Massachusetts and Maine formed "ribbon" clubs to support men who were interested in stopping drinking. Ribbon reformers traveled throughout the Midwest forming clubs and sharing their experiences with others. Gospel rescue missions or inebriate homes were created that allowed homeless drunkards a safe place to reform and learn to practice total abstinence while receiving food and shelter.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|115}} These movements emphasized sympathy over coercion, yet unlike the Washingtonian movements, emphasized helplessness as well with relief from their addictions as a result from seeking the grace of God.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

As an expression of [[moralism]],&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robins |first1=R. G. |title=A. J. Tomlinson: Plainfolk Modernist |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199883172 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the membership of the temperance movement overlapped with that of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] and [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895 |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195167771 |pages=228 |language=English|quote=These and other African American temperance activists--including James W.C. Pennington, Robert Purvis, William Watkins, William Whipper, Samule Ringgold Ward, Sarah Parker Remond, Francese E. Watkins Harper, William Wells Brown, and Frederick Douglass--increasingly linked temperance to a larger battle against slavery, discrimination, and racism. In churches, coventions, and newspapers, these reformers promoted an absolute and immediate rejection of both alcohol and slavery. The connection between temperance and antislavery views remained strong throughout the 1840s and 1850s. The white abolitionists Arthur Tappan and Gerrit Smith helped lead the American Temperance Union, formed in 1833. Frederick Douglass, who took the teetotaler pledge while in Scotland in 1845, claimed, "I am a temperance man because I am an anti-slavery man." Activists argued that alcohol aided slavery by keeping enslaved men and women addled and by sapping the strength of free black communities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VenturelliFleckenstein2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Venturelli |first1=Peter J. |last2=Fleckenstein |first2=Annette E. |title=Drugs and Society |date=2017 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=9781284110876 |pages=252 |language=English|quote=Because the temperance movement was closely tied to the abolitionist movement as well as to the African American church, African Americans were preeminent promoters of temperance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abolition, Women's Rights, and Temperance Movements |url=https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/abolition-womens-rights-and-temperance-movements.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Department of the Interior]]|year=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian period, the temperance movement became more political, advocating the legal prohibition of all alcohol, rather than only calling for moderation. Proponents of temperance, teetotalism and prohibition came to be known as the "drys".&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

There was still a focus on the working class, but also their children. The [[Band of Hope]] was founded in 1847 in [[Leeds]], UK, by the Reverend [[Jabez Tunnicliff]]. It aimed to save working class children from the drinking parents by teaching them the importance and principles of sobriety and teetotalism. In 1855, a national organisation was formed amidst an explosion of Band of Hope work. Meetings were held in churches throughout the UK and included Christian teaching. The group campaigned politically for the curtailment of the influence of pubs and brewers. The organization became quite radical, organizing rallies, demonstrations and marches to influence as many people as possible to sign the pledge of allegiance to the society and to resolve to abstain "from all liquors of an intoxicating quality, whether ale, porter, wine or spirits, except as medicine."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Brownlee (2002) ''This is Alcohol'': 99&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period there was local success at restricting or banning the sale of alcohol in many parts of the United States. In 1838, [[Massachusetts]] banned certain sales of spirits. The law was repealed two years later, but it set a precedent.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; In 1845, [[Michigan]] allowed its municipalities to decide whether they were going to prohibit.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyons|first1=Mickey|title=Dry Times: Looking Back 100 Years After Prohibition|url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/May-2018/Dry-Times-Looking-Back-100-Years-After-Prohibition/|website=Hour Detroit|accessdate=May 15, 2018|date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, [[Maine law|a law was passed in Maine]] which was a full-fledged prohibition, and this was followed by bans in several other states in the next two decades.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

The movement became more effective, with alcohol consumption in the US being decreased by half between 1830 and 1840. During this time, prohibition laws came into effect in twelve US states, such as [[Maine]]. [[Maine Law]] was passed in 1851 by the efforts of [[Neal Dow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blocker Jr. |first1=Jack S. |title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform |date=1989 |publisher=Twayne Publishers |location=Boston |isbn=978-0805797275 |pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized opposition caused five of these states to eliminate or weaken the laws.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu" /&gt;

=== Transition to a mass movement (1860s–1900s) ===
[[File:Temperance Fountain from north.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[temperance fountain]] in [[Tompkins Square Park]], New York City]]
The Temperance movement was a significant mass movement at this time and encouraged a general abstinence from the consumption of alcohol. A general movement to build alternatives to replace the functions of public bars existed, so the [[Independent Order of Rechabites]] was formed in England, with a branch later opening in America as a [[friendly society]] that did not hold meetings in public bars. There was also a movement to introduce [[temperance fountains]] across the United States—to provide people with reliably safe drinking water rather than saloon alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCTU Drinking Fountains&amp;nbsp;— Then and Now|url=http://www.wctu.org/fountains.html|work=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|publisher=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|accessdate=June 9, 2012|author=Staff|year=1996–2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014112806/http://wctu.org/fountains.html|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Prohibition Party]] led by [[John Russell (prohibitionist)|John Russell]] gradually became more popular, gaining more votes, as they felt that the existing Democrat and Republican parties did not do enough for the temperance cause.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}} The party was associated with the [[Independent Order of Good Templars]], which entertained a [[universalist]] orientation, being more open to blacks and repentant alcoholics than most other organizations.&lt;ref name="fahey" /&gt;{{rp|5–6, 152}}

Reflecting the [[Christian views on alcohol#Methodism|teaching on alcohol]] of their founder [[John Wesley]],&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt; [[Methodist Church]]es were aligned with the temperance movement.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Sigur E.|title=James Allison: A Biography of the Engine Manufacturer and Indianapolis 500 Cofounder|date=31 March 2011|publisher=McFarland|language=English|isbn=9780786486397|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodists believed that despite the supposed economic benefits of liquor traffic because of job creation and taxes, the harm that it causes society through its contribution to murder, gambling, prostitution, crime, and political corruption outweiged the economic benefits.&lt;ref name="timberlake"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Timberlake |first1=James H. |title=Prohibition and the Progressive Movement 1900-1920 |date=1963 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} In Great Britain, both [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]] and [[Primitive Methodist]]s championed the cause of temperance;&lt;ref name="Wheeler1882"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Henry|title=Methodism and the Temperance Reformation|year=1882|publisher=Walden and Stowe|language=English|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals]] was later established in the United States to further the movement.&lt;ref name="Fowler2018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Robert Booth|title=Religion and Politics in America: Faith, Culture, and Strategic Choices|date=4 April 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English |isbn=9780429972799|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the [[Salvation Army]], another denomination in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition, was founded in London with a heavy emphasis on both abstinence from alcohol and ministering to the working class, which led publicans to fund a [[Skeleton Army]] to disrupt their meetings.

In 1870, physicians created the American Association of the Cure of Inebrity (AACI) to treat alcohol addiction. The two goals of the organization were to convince the skeptical medical community of the existence and seriousness of the disease of alcoholism and to prove the efficacy of asylum treatments of alcoholics.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|116}} They argued for more genetic causes of alcohol addictions. Treatment often included restraint of the patient while they reformed both physically and morally.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|117}}

The [[Anti-Saloon League]] was an organization that began in 1893 in Ohio. Reacting to urban growth, it was driven by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestantism]].&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt; Furthermore, the League was strongly supported by the WCTU: in some US states alcoholism had become epidemic and domestic violence rates were high.

Actions of the temperance movement were organizing sobriety lectures and setting up reform clubs for men and children. Some proponents also opened special temperance hotels and lunch wagons, and lobbied for banning liquor during prominent events. The [[Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction|Scientific Temperance Instruction Movement]] published textbooks, promoted alcohol education and held many lectures.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew F.|editor-last1=Smith|editor-first1=Andrew F.|encyclopedia=Savoring Gotham: A Food Lover's Companion to New York City|date=2015|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Dining|isbn=978-0-19-939702-0|page=172|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=NNieCgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political action included lobbying local legislators and creating petition campaigns.&lt;ref name="osborne" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

The movement gained further traction during the First World War, with [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] issuing sharp restrictions on the sale of alcohol in many combatant countries. This was done to preserve grain for food production.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; During this time, prohibitionists used anti-German sentiment related to the war to rally against alcohol sales, since many brewers were of German-American descent.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Temperance movement focused on Catholics from Irish and German descent for their alleged preference for alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|encyclopedia=The Civil War Era and Reconstruction: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural and Economic History|date=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|title=Catholicism|isbn=978-1-317-45791-6|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWysBwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to alcohol researcher Johan Edman, the first country to issue an alcohol prohibition was Russia, as part of war mobilization policies.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|27}} This followed after Russia had made significant losses in the [[Russo-Japanese_War|war against the sober Japanese in 1905]].&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35}} In the UK, the Liberal government passed the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]] when pub hours were licensed, beer was watered down and was subject to a penny a pint extra tax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Brownlee|year=2002|title=This is Alcohol|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1916 a State Management Scheme meant that breweries and pubs in certain areas of Britain were nationalized, especially in places where armaments were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncan|first1=Robert|title=Lord D'Abernon's "Model Farm": The Central Control Board's Carlisle Experiment|journal=Social History of Alcohol &amp; Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2010|volume=24|issue=2|pages=119–140|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSep7Q4y9f3OLCmr1Cep7VSsau4SK6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuskyurK5IuePfgeyx43zx1%2BqE&amp;T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;S=R&amp;D=30h&amp;K=56537243}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1913, the ASL began its efforts for national prohibition.&lt;ref name="deliver" /&gt;{{rp|118}} [[Wayne Wheeler]], a member of the Anti-Saloon League was integral in the prohibition movement in the United States. He used hard political persuasion called "Wheelerism" in the 1920s of legislative bodies. Rather than ask directly for a vote, which Wheeler viewed as weak, Wheeler would cover the desks of legislators in telegrams. He was also accomplished in rallying supporters; the Cincinnati ''Enquirer'' called Wheeler "the strongest political force of his day".&lt;ref name="deliver" /&gt;{{rp|113-114}} His efforts specifically influenced the passing of the eighteenth-amendment.&lt;ref name="deliver" /&gt;{{rp|114}} And in 1920, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] was successfully passed in the United States, introducing [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] of the manufacture, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. The amendment, also called "the noble experiment", was preceded by the [[National Prohibition Act]], which stipulated how the federal government should enforce the amendment.&lt;ref name="History.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibition|url=https://www.history.com/topics/prohibition|website=History.com|publisher=[[A+E Networks]]|accessdate=May 13, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Six o'clock swill|restrictive early closing times for bars]] during and immediately after the First World War.&lt;ref name="WPhillips"&gt;The first state to introduce early closing was [[South Australia]] in 1915 as a war [[austerity]] measure. Six o'clock closing was adopted in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]] in 1916. New Zealand introduced it in 1917.  [[Western Australia]] adopted a 9pm closing time, but [[Queensland]] retained the old closing times until it introduced eight o'clock closing in 1923. {{cite journal |last1= Phillips|first1= Walter|year= 1980|title= 'Six o'clock swill':  the introduction of early closing of hotel bars in Australia |journal= Historical Studies|volume= 19|issue= 75|pages= 250–266|doi= 10.1080/10314618008595637}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Prohibition in Canada|Canada]], in 1916 the [[Ontario Temperance Act]] was passed, prohibiting the sales of alcoholic beverages with more than 2.5% alcohol.&lt;ref name="TVO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradburn|first1=Jamie|title=Booze, Bullying, and Moral Panic: The Temperance Election of 1926|url=https://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/-booze-bullying-and-moral-panic-the-temperance-election-of-1926|website=[[TVOntario]]|publisher=[[Ontario Educational Communications Authority]]|accessdate=18 May 2018|date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s imports of alcohol were cut off by provincial [[referendum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperance Movement in Canada|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/temperance-movement/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway introduced partial prohibition in 1917, which became full prohibition through a [[Norwegian prohibition referendum, 1919|referendum in 1919]], although this was [[Norwegian continued prohibition referendum, 1926|overturned in 1926]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansen|first1=Per Ole|title=The Norwegian Alcohol Prohibition; A Failure|journal=Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention|date=2013|volume=14|pages=46–63|doi=10.1080/14043858.2013.771909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Finland introduced prohibition in 1919, but repealed it in 1932 after an upsurge in violent crime associated with criminal opportunism and the illegal liquor trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wuorinen|first1=John H.|title=Finland's Prohibition Experiment|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1932|volume=163|pages=216–226|jstor=1017701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland introduced prohibition in 1915, but liberalized consumption of spirits in 1933, although beer was still illegal until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billock|first1=Jennifer|title=Illegal in Iceland: Quirky Bans From the Land of Fire and Ice|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/illegal-in-iceland-180957521/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Iceland banned beer|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31622038|accessdate=May 16, 2018|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s, half of the countries in the world had introduced some form of alcohol control in their laws or policies.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

=== Decline (1920s–'60s) ===
[[File:Sankt-Peterburg oldfoto 13616.jpg|thumb|In [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg]], a procession to promote temperance in front of the [[Tsarskoye Selo Railway]] station (1912)]]
The temperance movement started to wane in the 1930s, with prohibition being criticised as creating unhealthy drinking habits,&lt;ref name="WPhillips" /&gt; encouraging criminals and discouraging economic activity. Prohibition would not last long: the legislative tide largely moved away from prohibition when the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution]] was ratified on December 5, 1933, repealing nationwide prohibition. The gradual relaxation of licensing laws went on throughout the 20th century, with Mississippi being the last state to end prohibition in 1966.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; In Australia, early hotel closing times were reverted in the 1950s and 1960s.{{refn|group=note|The last Australian state to do so was South Australia in 1967.}}

Initially, prohibition had some positive effects in some states, with Ford reporting that absenteeism in his companies had decreased by half.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt; Alcohol consumption decreased dramatically. Also, statistical analysis has shown that the temperance movement during this time had a positive, though moderate, effect on later adult educational outcomes through providing a healthy [[pre-natal]] environment.&lt;ref name="francis" /&gt;{{rp|162,165}}&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt;{{rp|157}} However, prohibition had negative effects on the American economy, with thousands of jobs being lost, the catering and entertainment industries losing huge profits. The US and other countries with prohibition saw their tax revenues decrease dramatically, with some estimating this at a loss of 11 billion dollars for the US.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVO" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Taxes on alcohol was the major source of government funding in a time when the income tax had not yet been approved.&lt;ref name="Drager" /&gt;}} Furthermore, enforcement of the alcohol ban was an expensive undertaking for the government. Because the Eighteenth Amendment did not prohibit consumption, but only manufacture, distribution and sale, illegal consumption became commonplace. Illegal production of alcohol rose, and a thousand people per year died of alcohol that was illegally produced with little quality control. Bootlegging was a profitable activity for the mafia, and crime increased rather than decreased as expected and advocated by proponents.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

The temperance movement itself was in decline as well: fundamentalist and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] groups had become dominant in the movement, which led moderate members to leave the movement.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

During this time, in former colonies (such as [[Gujarat]] in India, [[The Temperance movement in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] and Egypt), the temperance movement was associated with [[anti-colonialism]] or religious revival.&lt;ref name="encyclo" /&gt;{{rp|310}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=John D.|title=Cultural nationalism and social reform: The 1904 Temperance Movement in Sri Lanka|journal=The Indian Economic and Social History Review|date=1989|volume=26|issue=3|page=336|doi=10.1177/001946468902600303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foda|first1=Omar|title=Anna and Ahmad|journal=Social Sciences and Missions|date=January 1, 2015|volume=28|issue=1–2|page=passim|nopp=yes|doi=10.1163/18748945-02801015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960s–present ===
The temperance movement still exists in many parts of the world, although it is generally less politically influential than it was in the early 20th century. Its efforts today include disseminating research regarding [[alcohol and health]], in addition to its effects on society and the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Michael |title=The Tyranny of Health: Doctors and the Regulation of Lifestyle |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134563463 |pages=47 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent temperance organizations active today include the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|World Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], [[International Blue Cross]], [[White Ribbon Association]], and [[International Organisation of Good Templars]].&lt;ref name="Fischer-TinéTschurenev2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer-Tiné|first1=Harald|last2=Tschurenev|first2=Jana|title=A History of Alcohol and Drugs in Modern South Asia|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781317916819|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and [[Salvation Army]], for example, are Christian Churches that continue to require that their members refrain from drinking alcohol as well as smoking, taking illegal drugs, and gambling.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/fea4acf97c61102c80256a2200443120?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,doctrines |title=Articles Of War For Salvation Army Soldiers |publisher=.salvationarmy.org |accessdate=April 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610164243/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/fea4acf97c61102c80256a2200443120?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,doctrines |archivedate=June 10, 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In youth culture in the 1990s, temperance was an important part of the [[straight edge]] scene, which also stressed [[abstinence from drugs|abstinence from other drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haenfler|first1=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|date=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=Piscataway, NJ|isbn=978-0-8135-3851-8|page=35|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/byu/reader.action?docID=435053&amp;query=|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs, principles and culture ==
Temperance proponents saw the alcohol problem as the most crucial problem of Western civilization.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|21}} Alcoholism was seen to cause poverty,&lt;ref name="Drager" /&gt; and all types of social problems: alcohol was the enemy of everything good that modernity and science had to offer.&lt;ref name="edman"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Edman|first1=Johan|title=Temperance and Modernity: Alcohol Consumption as a Collective Problem, 1885–1913|journal=[[Journal of Social History]]|date=September 2015|volume=49|issue=1|pages=20–52|doi=10.1093/jsh/shv029|url=https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article/49/1/20/948316}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} They believed that abstinence would help decrease crime, make families stronger, and improve society as a whole.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; Although the temperance movement was non-denominational in principle, the movement consisted mostly of church-goers.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt; Temperance advocates tended to use scientific arguments to back up their views, although at the core the temperance philosophy was moral-religious in nature.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|38}} The alcohol problem was connected with a sense of purpose and modernity of the western nation, and was largely international in nature, in keeping with the international optimism typical for the period preceding the First World War.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|41}}

Historical analysis of conference documents helps create an image of what the temperance movement stood for. The movement believed that alcohol abuse was a threat to scientific progress, as it was believed citizens had to be strong and sober to be ready for the modern age. Progressive themes and causes such as abolition, natural self-determination, worker's rights, and the importance of women in rearing children to be good citizens were key themes of this citizenship ideology.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|25–26}} The movement put itself at service of the state, but was also critical of it. In that sense, it was a radical movement with liberal and socialist aspects, although in some parts of the world, notably the US, allied with conservatism.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|40–41}} Alcohol was often associated with oppression: not only oppression in the West, but also in colonies.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Temperance advocates saw alcohol as a product that "... enables a few to become rich while it impoverishes the very many". Temperance advocates worked closely with the labor movement, as well as the women suffrage movement, partly because there was mutual support and benefit, and the causes were seen as connected.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|41}}

=== Prevention, treatment and restriction ===
Temperance proponents used a variety of means to prevent and treat alcohol abuse and restrict its consumption.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|24}} At the end of the nineteenth century, medically-oriented treatment of alcohol abuse became more common.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|26}} In a trend that was preceded by Rush's writings, alcoholism came to be seen as an illness which could be medically treated. Scientists who were temperance proponents attempted to find the underlying causes of alcohol abuse. At the same time, criticism rose toward use of alcohol in medical care.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|39–40}} The notion of alcohol abuse as a disease would only become widely accepted much later, however, until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|38–39}}

Nevertheless, restriction of consumption was most emphasized in the movement, though ideas on how to accomplish this were varied and conflicting.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|26}} Apart from the prohibition by law, there were also ideas to establish [[state monopoly]] on all alcohol sales,&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|27}} or through law reform remove profit from the alcohol industry.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

During the 1900s decade, the ideal of strong citizens was further developed into the [[hygienism]] ideology.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Through the influence of [[science of heredity|scientific theories on heredity]], temperance proponents came to believe that alcohol problems were not just a personal concern, but would cause later generations of people to "degenerate" as well.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Public hygiene and improving the population through personal lifestyle were therefore promoted.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} A variety of [[temperance halls]] and [[coffee palace]]s were established as replacements for bars. Numerous periodicals devoted to temperance were published{{refn|group=note|For example in Sydney, the [[Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal]] was published between 1856 and 1861.}} and [[temperance theatre]], which had started in the 1820s, became an important part of the American cultural landscape at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frick|first1=John W.|title=Theatre, Culture and Temperance Reform in Nineteenth-Century America|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-81778-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperance movement generated its own popular culture. Popular songwriters such as [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst]], [[George Frederick Root]], [[Henry Clay Work]] and [[Stephen C. Foster]] composed a number of these songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul D. |last=Sanders |title=The Temperance Songs of Stephen C. Foster |journal=American Music |volume=34 |number=3 |year=2016 |pages=279–300 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At temperance inns puppet plays, minstrel acts, parades and other shows were held.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}}

=== Role of women ===
Much of the temperance movement was based on organized religion, which saw women as responsible for edifying their children to be abstaining citizens.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Nevertheless, temperance was tied in with both religious renewal and progressive politics, particularly female suffrage&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; Furthermore, temperance activists were able to promote suffrage more effectively than [[Suffragists|suffrage activists]] themselves, because of their wide-ranging experience as activists, and because they argued for a concrete aim of safety at home, rather than an abstract aim of justice as the suffragists did.&lt;ref name="osborne" /&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

By 1831, there were over 24 women's organizations dedicated to the temperance movement. Women were specifically drawn to the temperance movement, because it represented a fight to end a practice that greatly affected women's quality of life. Temperance was seen as a feminine, religious and moral duty, and when achieved, it was seen as a way to gain familial and domestic security as well as salvation in a religious sense.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|47}} Indeed, scholar Ruth Bordin stated that the temperance movement was "the foremost example of American feminism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/feminist-history-prohibition/|title=The Feminist History of Prohibition|date=2016-01-06|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent women such as [[Amelia Bloomer]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]] were active in temperance and abolitionist movements in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

A myriad of factors contributed to women's interest in the temperance movement. One of the initial contributions was the frequency in which women were victims of alcohol abuse. In a Chicago meeting of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Susan B. Anthony stated that women suffer the most from drunkenness. The inability for women to control wages, vote, or own property added to a woman's vulnerability.&lt;ref name="bordin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bordin |first1=Ruth Birgitta Anderson |title=Woman and temperance: The quest for power and liberty, 1873-1900 |date=1981 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0877221579 |url=https://archive.org/stream/womantemperanceq0000bord#page/6/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Another contribution was related to the role of women in the home in the nineteenth century which was largely to preside over the spiritual and physical needs of the home and the family. Because of this, women believed it was their duty to protect their families from the danger of alcohol and to convert their family members to the ideas of abstinence. This new found calling to temperance, however, did not change the widely held viewpoint at the time that women were only responsible for matters regarding their homes.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Consequently, women had what Ruth Bordin referred to as the "maternal struggle" which was the internal contradiction women felt with the new power to make change they had discovered, but in still believing in their nurturing and domestic roles and they did not yet understand how to use their power.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|8-9}} June Sochen called women who joined movements such as women's temperance organizations "pragmatic feminists", because they took action to solve their grievances, but were not interested in altering traditional sex roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sochen |first1=June |title=Movers and Shakers: American Women Thinkers and Activists 1900-1970 |date=1973 |publisher=Quadrangle/New York Times Book Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0812903607 |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missionary organizations of many Protestant denominations gave women avenue to work from; there were already all-female missionary societies that were easily changed into women's temperance organizations.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|9-10}}

In the 1870s and 1880s, the number of women in the middle and upper classes was large enough to support women participation in the temperance movement. Higher class women did not need to work and could rely on their husbands to support their families and consequently had more leisure time to engage in organizations and associations related to the temperance movement.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The influx of Irish immigrants filled in the servant jobs left by freed African-Americans after the American Civil War, leaving upper and middle class women with even more time to participate in the community with domestic jobs being taken care of. Moreover, the birth rate had fallen, leaving women with an average of four children in 1880 as compared to seven children at the beginning of the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Daniel Scott |editor1-last=Hartman |editor1-first=Mary S. |editor2-last=Banner |editor2-first=Lois W. |title=Clio's Consciousness Raised: New Perspectives on the History of Women |date=1976 |publisher=Octagon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0374937126 |page=123 |chapter=Family Limitation, Sexual Control and Domestic Feminism in Victorian America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|11-12}} The gathering of people in urban areas and the extra leisure time for women contributed to the mass female temperance movement.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|11-12}} 

The [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) grew out of a spontaneous crusade against saloons and liquor stores that began Ohio and spread throughout the Midwestern United States during the winter of 1873-1874. The crusade consisted of over 32,000 women storming into saloons and liquor stores to disrupt business and stop the sales of alcohol.&lt;ref name="miltiancy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dannenbaum |first1=Jed |title=The Origins of Temperance Activism and Militancy among American Women |journal=Journal of Social History |date=1981 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=235–252 |url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?EbscoContent=dGJyMMvl7ESeprA4yOvqOLCmr1Cep7VSsKi4SbOWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuskyurK5IuePfgeyx43zx1%2BqE&amp;T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;S=R&amp;D=aph&amp;K=5015585 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|15}} The WCTU was officially organized in late November 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Elizabeth Putnam |title=Women Torch-Bearers: The Story of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union |date=1924 |publisher=National Woman's Christian Temperance Union Pub.

Willard was interested in suffrage and women's rights as well as temperance, believing that temperance could improve the quality of life on a family and a community level. The WCTU trained women in skills such as public speaking, leadership, and political thinking, using temperance as a springboard to achieve a higher quality of life for women on many levels. In 1881, the WCTU began to lobby for the mandation of instruction of temperance in public schools. In 1901, schools were required to instruct students on temperance ideas, but were accused of perpetuating misinformation, fear mongering, and racist stereotypes. [[Carrie Nation]] was one of the most extremist temperance movement workers and was arrested 30 times for the destruction of property at bars, saloons, and even pharmacies, believing that even alcohol used for medicine was unjustified. At the approach of the 20th century, the temperance movement became more interested in legislative reform as the pressure from the Anti-Saloon League increased. Women, having not yet achieved suffrage became less central to the movement in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prohibition.themobmuseum.org/the-history/the-road-to-prohibition/the-temperance-movement/|title=Women Led the Temperance Charge - Prohibition: An Interactive History|work=Prohibition: An Interactive History|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other causes ===
Prohibition agendas also became popular among factory owners, who strove for more efficiency during a period of increased industrialization.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; For this reason, industrial leaders such as [[Henry Ford]] and [[S.S. Kresge]] supported Prohibition.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt; The cause of the sober factory worker was related to the cause of women temperance leaders: concerned mothers protested against the enslavement of factory workers, as well as the temptation saloons offered to these workers.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}} Efficiency was also an important argument for the government, because they wanted their soldiers to be sober.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

At the end of the nineteenth century, temperance movement opponents started to criticize the slave trade in Africa. This came during the last period of rapid colonial expansion. Slavery and alcohol trade in colonies were seen as two closely related problems, described as "the twin oppressors of the people". Again, this subject tied in with the ideas of civilization and effectiveness: temperance advocates raised the issue that the "natives" could not be properly "civilized" and put to work, if they were provided with the vice of alcohol.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35–36}}

'''''The Lexicon of Comicana''''' is a 1980 book by the American [[cartoonist]] [[Mort Walker]]. It was intended as a [[tongue-in-cheek]] look at the devices used by cartoonists. In it, Walker invented an international set of [[symbol]]s called ''symbolia'' after researching cartoons around the world. In 1964, Walker had written an article called "Let's Get Down to Grawlixes", a satirical piece for the [[National Cartoonists Society]]. He used terms such as ''grawlixes'' for his own amusement, but they soon began to catch on and acquired an unexpected validity. The ''Lexicon'' was written in response to this.

The names he invented for them sometimes appear in [[dictionary|dictionaries]], and serve as convenient terminology occasionally used by cartoonists and critics. A 2001 gallery showing of comic- and street-influenced art in [[San Francisco]], for example, was called "Plewds! Squeans! and Spurls!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stretcher.org/posts/plewds_squeams_and_spurls/ “Plewds! Squeams! and Spurls!”]; published November 29, 2001; retrieved June 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pawnee capture of the Cheyenne Sacred Arrows''''' occurred around 1830 in central [[Nebraska]], when the [[Cheyenne]] attacked a group from the [[Skidi|Skidi Pawnee]] tribe, who were hunting [[bison]]. The Cheyenne had with them their [[sacred bundle]] of four [[arrow]]s, called the Mahuts. During the battle, this sacred, ceremonial object was taken by the Pawnee. The Cheyenne initially made replica arrows but also tried to get the originals back. They recovered one from the Pawnee directly, either given to them or taken by them, and a second was captured by the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and returned to the Cheyenne in exchange for horses. The two corresponding replicas were ceremonially returned to the [[Black Hills]], where the arrows were traditionally believed to have originated. Eventually the bundles were re-established and the societies and their ceremonies continue into the present day. 

==Background==
Likely, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] lived in villages of earth lodges in the present-day state of [[Nebraska]]&lt;ref name=Blaine1990&gt;Blaine, Martha R. (1990): ''Pawnee Passage, 1870-1875''.

Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}} At the time of the battle with the [[Cheyenne]], the [[Skidi]] Pawnee populated the banks of [[Loup River]] in the central part of Nebraska. The Chawi, the Kitkahahki and the Pitahawirata made up the South Bands&lt;ref name=Murie1981/&gt;{{rp|183, 195 and 199}} as they lived south of the [[Platte River]].&lt;ref name=Murie1981/&gt;{{rp|4}} &lt;ref name=Blaine1990/&gt;{{rp|72}} Just some years later, they would move north and gather in the same area as the Skidi Pawnee.&lt;ref name=Jensen1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=Richard E |title=The Pawnee Mission, 1834-1846 |journal=[[Nebraska History]] |date=1994 |volume=75 |pages=301-310 |url=https://history.nebraska.gov/sites/history.nebraska.gov/files/doc/publications/NH1994PawneeMission.pdf |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}} The Pawnee raised corn and other crops near their villages. However, they went on long communal [[bison]] hunts in both summer and winter. While out on the [[Great Plains|plains]], they lived in skin tents and [[tipi]]s.&lt;ref name=Blaine1990/&gt;{{rp|71-84}}

The final groups of Cheyenne Indians seem to have crossed the [[Missouri River]] from eastern [[North Dakota]] in the last quarter of the 18th century.

The renewal of the arrows form one of the most [[sacred]] of the Cheyenne ceremonies, and traditionally take place during the same time every summer, as well as in response to unfortunate events, such as a homicide or other tragedy.&lt;ref name="Schaefer2008"/&gt;{{rp|268}}

==Prelude==
A year before this historic battle, a party of Cheyenne warriors intended to raid the Pawnee near the lower Platte. The party was discovered and all killed, just as the Cheyenne had done ten years before after the killing of thirty Cheyenne [[Cheyenne military societies#Bowstring|Bowstring]] warriors by the Crow. The tribe vowed to avenge the war group by moving the against those to blame for the killings.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}}

In the summer of 1830, the entire Cheyenne tribe started down the Platte.{{efn|The year 1830 was agreed upon by a Cheyenne and a Pawnee, both participating in the battle.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|556}} Although some give the year as 1833.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|48}}}} A number of allied [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Arapaho]] joined. The special custodian or keeper of the Sacred Arrows, White Thunder, and his wife led them.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} The scouts sent out to locate the enemy found no traces of the Pawnee. By chance, the group came across four messengers from a party of scouts, who had been killed by the Pawnee.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|557}} The scouts finally located a large camp of Pawnees at the head of the [[Loup River|South Loup]].&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} (According to the Pawnee, they had camp somewhere on Platte River).&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorsey |first1=George A. |authorlink1=George Amos Dorsey |title=How the Pawnee Captured the Cheyenne Medicine Arrows |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=1903 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=644-658 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/658944 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |oclc=254963378}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|644}}

After marching for another day and night march, the body of people reached a place near the Pawnee camp in the early morning. The warriors prepared for battle. The women and children grouped in a circle where they had a view of the flat area soon to become a battlefield.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|49}} &lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The Pawnee camp seems to have been hidden on the other side of a ridge.

The Cheyenne warriors and their allies placed themselves in two separate wings. The Sacred Arrows were in front of one wing, and the other wing would follow a man wearing the sacred Buffalo Hat. "These two great medicines protected all who were behind them ... and rendered the enemy in front helpless".&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Meanwhile, the first bison hunters left the Pawnee camp and almost stumbled on the lined of the army. The battle was on, and White Thunder was unable to restrain the Cheyenne. Without having performed the required ceremony, he handed over the arrow bundle to a selected medicine man named Bull. Bull in turn hastily tied the whole bundle to the middle of his lance.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|646}} Then he mounted his horse and tried to catch up with the rest of the warriors.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|57}}

==Battle==
[[File:The area where the Pawnee captured the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne.jpg|thumb|upright 2.7|The area where the Pawnee captured the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne]]
"The battle was hard fought".&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|647}} An old Pawnee, apparently a Pitahawirata&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|552}} from the South Bands, was sick and tired of living. He had told his relatives to carry him to the very [[front line]] of the battle.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|645}} He was sitting on the ground with a bow and some arrows. Bull wanted to [[Counting coup|count coup]] on this enemy, although the rest of the Cheyenne tried to talk him from it.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The old Pawnee avoided the thrust with the lance and seized it. He dragged it from Bull, who slowly rode back to his own line. "This spear must be a wonderful spear ...", shouted the Pawnee, when he saw the medicine bundle in a wrapping of hide tied to it. The Pawnee rushed forward. Chief Big Eagle came first and secured the lance before the Cheyenne could recapture it.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|649}}&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

During the fight, Chief Big Eagle wore the Wonderful Leggings of Pahukatawa. The leggings were a part of a tribal war bundle, and they seemed to make Big Eagle fearless. "Through the power of these leggings the Skiri [Skidi] captured the wonderful Cheyenne arrows".&lt;ref name=MuriepartI&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murie |first1=James R. |last2=Parks |first2=Douglas R. |title=Ceremonies of the Pawnee, Part I: The Skiri |journal=[[Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology]] |date=1981 |volume=27 |url=https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/1337 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |oclc=756235349}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} Further, Big Eagle was dressed in a red shirt and wore a government medal on his breast. Throughout the battle, he rode on a small spotted horse. Therefore, the Cheyenne remembered him as Spotted Horse or Big Spotted Horse.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|648}} &lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|552}}

According to the Cheyenne, they killed the old Pawnee on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} The Pawnee say, he first died the next summer during a Cheyenne attack on an almost empty Pawnee village.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|651}}

With the Sacred Arrows gone and [[morale]] low, the Cheyenne failed to withstand a renewed charge by the Pawnee and retreated.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|37-8}} "How many were killed on either side was not known".&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558}} Later, the Cheyenne retreated up the Platte, mourning the loss of the arrows, which [[George Bent]] described as "... the greatest disaster the Cheyennes ever suffered."&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|152}}

==Aftermath==
Pawnee Chief Big Eagle concluded they had captured something of extraordinary importance when he examined the arrows. He was keeper of the [[Pawnee mythology|Morning Star]] bundle of the Skidi Pawnee and placed three of the arrows in that bundle.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|650}} &lt;ref name=MuriepartI/&gt;{{rp|66}} 

Some time after the battle, the best Cheyenne arrow makers made four surrogate Sacred Arrows.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|53}}&lt;ref name=Grinnell1910/&gt;{{rp|558-560}} However, they also tried in various ways to retrieve the originals. Once, they invited Big Eagle and the Pawnees to their camp. In return for the four arrows they promised the guests many horses. Big Eagle expected treachery and brought just one arrow wrapped in a bundle. As feared, a Cheyenne rode away with the arrow in an unguarded moment.&lt;ref name=Dorsey1903/&gt;{{rp|657}} Another source recounts that three Cheyenne, White Thunder, Old Bark, and Doll Man traveled to a Skidi village in 1835 where they were received in Big Eagle's lodge and given one Buffalo Arrow. Despite gifts of more than a hundred horses, no more arrows were returned.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|39}}

They recognized the Man Arrow and returned it to the Cheyenne in exchange for one hundred horses.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name=Mallory1886/&gt;{{rp|141}} 

Two of the remade Sacred Arrows were now in excess. A ceremony was held, and the Cheyenne left two of the new arrows in a bundle in a crevice of the Black Hills, near the place where Sweet Medicine had received the original arrows. There they remained for a long while, and were occasional visited by Cheyenne travelers, before eventually disappearing.&lt;ref name=Hyde1987/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref name="Grinnell2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinnell|first=George Bird|title=The Cheyenne Indians: Their History and Lifeways : Edited and Illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzxHTeOe8FcC|year=2008|publisher=[[World Wisdom]]|isbn=978-1-933316-60-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}

Efforts to restore the additional two original arrows were again made in the 1890s and 1930s to no avail.&lt;ref name="Powell1998"/&gt;{{rp|40-1}} The return of the remaining arrows remained a source of bitterness for generations.&lt;ref name="Lookingbill2015"/&gt;

'''VinylPlus''' was founded by the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM), the European Stabiliser Producers Association (ESPA), European Plasticisers and the European Plastics Converters (EuPC) in 2011 when the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] industry renewed a previous initiative called Vinyl 2010. VinylPlus is a ten-year, industry-wide voluntary commitment to develop more ecologically responsible ways to produce, use and recycle PVC. The programme aligns with the principles and targets of the [[United Nations|UN]]’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and the [[circular economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=91|title=VinylPlus - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VinylPlus includes all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters and recyclers. It covers the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland.

VinylPlus is included in the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] Registry of Commitments, and is a member of the Green Industry Platform, the global partnership led by the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)]] and the United Nations Environment Platform Programme (UNEP). VinylPlus is also registered as a partner on the UN Partnerships for SDGs platform where it is recognised as fulfilling the SMART criteria. 

== History ==
VinylPlus succeeded Vinyl 2010, which was the European PVC industry’s first voluntary commitment. Vinyl 2010 was set up in 2000 around the principles of [[Responsible Care]] adopted by the European chemicals industry in the 1980s . Its programme aimed to shift the PVC industry to a more sustainable model by improving recycling and substituting hazardous additives.

At the same time, the [[European Union]] also started addressing environmental concerns about plastics, notably developing the [[Waste framework directive|Waste Framework Directive]] (EU Directive 2008/98/EC), which laid down key EU recycling rules.

Vinyl 2010 also set up a monitoring committee, which was kept upon the creation of VinylPlus. The committee was designed as an independent verification of the programme’s activities, and includes representatives from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], trade unions, consumer associations, academia and members of the European 

== Progress Report ==
VinylPlus publishes an annual Progress Report summarising progress and data. Progress is measured against each of the five sustainability challenges identified for PVC. All information included in the report is presented to the Monitoring Committee and independently audited by third parties.

== Product Label ==
The VinylPlus Product Label was launched in 2018 as an identification tool.

== Recycling ==
One aspect of the programme is to Improve recycling figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vinylplus.eu/recycling/circular-economy|title=VinylPlus - The Circular Economy|website=vinylplus.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum ==
VinylPlus organises an annual forum: The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum. The first one took place in Istanbul in 2013. The event aims to encourage dialogue on sustainability by assembling representatives from the PVC industry, policy makers, consumer groups, retailers, architects, designers, recyclers and NGOs.  The themes from past forums have been:

* 2013: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth for Europe and Beyond
* 2014: Enhancing the Value of Partnerships
* 2015: More Vinyl, Less Carbon
* 2016: Smart Vinyl For Our Cities
* 2017: Towards Circular Economy
* 2018: Meeting Societal Needs

== Governance ==
VinylPlus’s management Board represents all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters. The Monitoring Committee offers guidance and advice, while ensuring an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the Voluntary Commitment. The Monitoring Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry. The Monitoring Committee’s stated goal is to ensure VinylPlus’s transparency, participation and accountability. 

== Affiliates ==
==== Recovinyl ====
The Recovinyl  programme was set up in 2003 as part of Vinyl 2010’s commitment. Its original mission was to advance waste collection and recycling schemes. When the Vinyl 2010 programme ended, it was given a dual role under the new VinylPlus initiative. While Recovinyl still encourages PVC recycling, it also aims to optimise resource efficiency by acting as an intermediary between recyclers and converters.

==== Vinyl Foundation ==== 
The Vinyl Foundation is the non-profit organisation that manages the funds from the European PVC product manufacturers, compounders and raw material traders that support VinylPlus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14412">[[Oliver E. Williamson]] hypothesised (1964) that [[profit maximization]] would not be the objective of the managers of a joint stock organisation.&lt;ref name="International Management Journal"&gt;[http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/ig/vol1/21-1-1-2.pdf International Management Journal], Kenny Crossan, The Theory of the Firm and Alternative Theories of Firm Behaviour:  A Critique.  International Journal of Applied Institutional Governance Volume 1 Issue 1; {{ISSN|1747-6259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory, like other managerial theories of the firm, assumes that utility maximisation is a manager’s sole objective.&lt;ref name="Principles of Microeconomics"&gt;D. D. Tewari, Katar Singh (2003). Principles of Microeconomics. New Age International Publishers. pp. 92.  {{ISBN|81-224-1017-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However it is only in a corporate form of business organisation that a self-interest seeking manager maximise his/her own utility, since there exists a separation of ownership and control.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory"&gt;H.L. Ahuja (2009). Advanced Economic Theory. S.Chand&amp;Co. pp. 932. {{ISBN|81-219-0260-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The managers can use their ‘discretion’ to frame and execute policies which would maximise their own utilities rather than maximising the shareholders’ utilities. This is essentially the [[principal–agent problem]].&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Piyali"&gt;Geetika, Piyali Ghosh, Purba Roy Choudhury (2009). Managerial Economics. The McGraw-Hill Companies. pp. 50. {{ISBN|978-0-07-026365-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This could however threaten their job security, if a minimum level of profit is not attained by the firm to distribute among the shareholders.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics M.M."&gt;Mukund Mahajan (2008). Managerial Economics, third edition. Nirali Prakashan. pp. 10.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic assumptions of the model are:
# Imperfect competition in the markets.
# Divorce of ownership and management.
# A minimum profit constraint exists for the firms to be able to pay dividends to their share holders.&lt;ref name="srv.manipalu"&gt;[http://train-srv.manipalu.com/wpress/?p=95249 Objectives of Firms], SMU WordPress. MB0042-Unit-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial utility function==
The managerial [[utility function]] includes variables such as [[salary]], [[job security]], power, status, dominance, prestige and professional excellence of managers. Of these, salary is the only quantitative variable and thus [[measurable]]. The other variables are non-pecuniary, which are non-quantifiable.
The variables expenditure on staff salary, management slack, discretionary investments can be assigned nominal values. Thus these will be used as proxy variables to measure the real or unquantifiable concepts like job security, power, status, dominance, prestige and professional excellence of managers, appearing in the managerial [[utility function]].&lt;ref name="Managerial Eco by Nadar"&gt;E. Narayanan Nadar, S. Vijayan (2009). Managerial Economics, eastern economy edition. PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. pp. 42. {{ISBN|978-81-203-3720-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utility function''' or '''"expense preference"'''&lt;ref name="
Managerial Economics by Trivedi"&gt;M. L. Trivedi (2009). Managerial Economics: Theory and Applications. Tata McGraw–Hill. pp. 100. {{ISBN|978-0-07-043578-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of a manager can be given by:

::&lt;math&gt;U=U(S,M,I_D) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U'' denotes the Utility function, ''S'' denotes the “monetary expenditure on the staff”, ''M'' stands for "Management Slack" and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for amount of "Discretionary Investment".

"'''Monetary expenditure on staff'''" include not only the manager's salary and other forms of monetary compensation received by him from the business firm but also the number of staff under the control of the manager as there is a close [[positive relationship]] between the number of staff and the manager's salary.

"'''Management slack'''" consists of those non-essential management perquisites such as entertainment expenses, lavishly furnished offices, luxurious cars, large expense accounts, etc. which are above minimum to retain the managers in the firm. These perks, even if not provided would not make the manager quit his job, but these are incentives which enhance their prestige and status in the organisation in turn contributing to efficiency of the firm's operations.
The Management Slack is also a part of the cost of production of the [[firm]].

"'''Discretionary investment'''" refers to the amount of resources left at a manager's disposal, to be able to spend at his own discretion. For example, spending on latest equipment, furniture, decoration material, etc. It satisfies their ego and gives them a sense of pride. These give a boost to the manager's esteem and status in the organisation. Such investments are over and above the amount required for the survival of the firm (such as periodic replacement of the [[capital equipment]]).&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Managerial Eco by Nadar" /&gt;

==Concepts of profit in the model==
The various concepts of profit used in the model needs to be understood clearly before moving to the main model. Williamson has put forth four main concepts of profits in his model:

===Actual profit (Π)===
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi=R-C-S \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the total revenue, ''C'' is the cost of production and ''S'' is the staff expenditure.

===Reported profit (Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;)===
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_r=\Pi - M \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π is the actual profit and ''M'' is the management slack.

===Minimum profit (Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)===
It is the amount of profit after tax which should be paid to the [[shareholders]] of the firm, in the form of [[dividends]], to keep them satisfied. If the minimum level of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] cannot be given out to the shareholders, they might resort of bulk sale of their shares which will transfer the ownership to other hands leaving the [[company]] in the risk of a complete take over.  Since the shareholders have the [[voting rights]], they might also vote for the change of the top level of management. Thus the [[job security]] of the manager is also threatened.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Trivedi" /&gt;
Ideally the reported profits must be either equal to or greater than the minimum profits plus the [[taxes]], as it is only after paying out the minimum profit that the additional profit can be used to increase the managerial [[utility]] further.

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_r \ge \Pi_0 +T \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the reported profit, Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the minimum profit and ''T'' is the tax.

===Discretionary profit (Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;)===
It is basically the entire amount of profit left after minimum profits and tax which is used to increase the manager’s utility, that is, to pay out managerial emoluments as well as allow them to make discretionary investments.

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_D=\Pi - \Pi_0 - T \,&lt;/math&gt;
                          
where Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the discretionary profit, Π is the actual profit, Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the minimum profit and ''T'' is the tax amount.

However, what appears in the managerial utility function is discretionary investments (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;) and not discretionary profits. Thus it is very important to distinguish between the two as further in the model we would have to maximize the managerial utility function given the profit constraint.

::&lt;math&gt;I_D=\Pi_r - \Pi_0 - T \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the reported profit, '''Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the minimum profit and ''T'' is the tax amount.

Thus it can be seen that the difference in the Discretionary Profit and the Discretionary investment arises because of the amount of managerial slack. This can be represented by the given equation

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_D=I_D +M \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the discretionary profit, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Discretionary investment and ''M'' is the management slack.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Economics by Maria"&gt;Maria Moschandreas (2005). Business Economics, second edition. Thomson. p. 204. {{ISBN|1-86152-399-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model framework==
For simple representation of the model the managerial slack is considered to be zero. Thus there is no difference between the actual profit and reported profit, which implies that the discretionary profit is equal to the discretionary investment.  I.e.

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi_r=\Pi \text{ or }\Pi_D=I_D \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the reported profit, Π is the actual profit, Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;  is the discretionary profit and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the discretionary investment.

Such that the utility function of the manager becomes

::&lt;math&gt;U=U(S,I_D) \,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''S''' is the staff expenditure and '''I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the discretionary investment.

There is a trade off between these two variables. Increase in either will give the manager a higher level of satisfaction. At any point of time the amount of both these variables combined is the same, therefore an increase in one would automatically require a decrease in the other. The manager therefore has to make a choice of the correct combination of these two variables to attain a certain level of desired utility.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Piyali" /&gt;

Substituting

::&lt;math&gt;I_D=\Pi - \Pi_0 - T \,&lt;/math&gt;  in the new managerial utility function, it can be rewritten as

::&lt;math&gt;U=U(S, \Pi - \Pi_0 - T) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between the two variables in the manager’s utility function is determined by the profit function. Profit of a firm is dependent on the demand and cost conditions. Given the cost conditions the demand is dependent of the price, staff expenditures and the market condition.

::&lt;math&gt;X=f(S,\bar{P},\bar{E}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Price and market condition is assumed to be given exogenously at equilibrium. Thus the profit of the firm becomes dependent on the staff expenditure which can be written as

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi=f(X)=f(S,\bar{P},\bar{E}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Discretionary profit can be rewritten as
 
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_D=f(S,\bar{P},\bar{E}) - \Pi_0 - T) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the model, the managers would try to maximise their utility given the profit constraint

:: &lt;math&gt;\max U=U(S, \Pi - \Pi_0 - T) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
:: &lt;math&gt;\text{subject to} \Pi \ge \Pi_0 +T \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Trivedi" /&gt;

==Graphical representation of the model==
[[File:Utility indifference curves of managers.jpg|thumb|'''Fig 1. Utility indifference curves of managers''']]

Fig 1. shows the various levels of utility (''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) derived by the manager by combining different amounts of discretionary profits and staff expenditure. Higher the indifference curve, higher is the level of utility derived by the manager. Hence the manager would try to be on the highest level of indifference curve possible given the constraints. Staff expenditure is plotted on the ''x''-axis and discretionary profits on the ''y''-axis.

The discretionary profit in this simplified model is equal to the discretionary investment. The indifference curves are downward sloping and convex to the origin. This shows diminishing marginal rate of substitution of staff expenditure for discretionary profits. The curves are [[asymptotic]] in nature which implies that at any point of time and under any given circumstance the manager will choose positive amounts of both discretionary profits and staff expenditure.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Trivedi" /&gt;

[[File:Discretionary profit curve.jpg|left|thumb|'''Fig 2. Discretionary profit curve''']]

Assuming that the firm is producing an optimum level of output and the market environment is given, the discretionary profits curve is generated, shown in Fig 2. It gives the relationship between staff expenditure and discretionary profits.

It can be seen from the figure that profit will be positive in the region between the points B and C. Initially with increase in profits, the staff expenditure the discretionary profits also increase, but this is only till the point Π&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, till S level of staff expenditure. Beyond this if staff expenditure is increased due to increase in output, then a fall in the discretionary profits is noticed. Staff expenditure of less than B and more than C is not feasible as it wouldn't satisfy the minimum profit constraint and would in turn threaten the [[job security]] of managers.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics M.M." /&gt;

[[File:Equilibrium of firm in Williamson's Model.jpg|thumb|'''Fig 3. Equilibrium of a firm in Williamson's Model''']]

To find the equilibrium in the model, Fig 1. is superimposed on Fig 2. The equilibrium point is the point where the discretionary profit curve is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve of the manager, which is point E in Fig 3. Staying at the highest profit point would require the manager to be at a lower indifference curve ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In this case the highest attainable level of utility is ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. At equilibrium, the level of profits would be lower but staff expenditure S* is higher than the staff expenditure made at the maximum profit point. As indifference curve is downward sloping, the equilibrium point would always be on the right of the maximum profit point. Thus the model shows the higher preference of managers for staff expenditure as compared to the discretionary investments.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;

==Criticism==
# The model fails to describe how businesses take their price and output decisions in a highly competitive set up.&lt;ref name="International Management Journal" /&gt;
# The relationship between better performance of managers and the increasing amounts spent on manager’s utility by the firm is not always true.&lt;ref name="srv.manipalu" /&gt;
# The model does not apply in a dynamic set up like changing demand and cost conditions during booms and recessions.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;
