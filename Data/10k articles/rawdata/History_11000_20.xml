The '''6th millennium BC''' spanned the years 6000 through 5001 BC. 
It falls into the [[Holocene climatic optimum]], with [[Meltwater pulse 1C|rising sea levels]].
Culturally, [[Mesopotamia]] is in the [[Pottery Neolithic]] ([[Halaf culture]]), and  [[Neolithic Revolution|agriculture]] spreads to [[Neolithic Europe|Europe]] and to  [[Prehistoric Egypt|Egypt]]. 

[[World population estimates|World population]] grows dramatically as a result of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], perhaps quadrupling, from about 10 to 40 million, over the course of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Noël Biraben, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", ''Population'' 34-1 (1979), 13-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Yahya ibn al-Sakkak al-Miknasi''', full name '''Abu Yahya or Abu Abd Allah Mohammed ibn Abu Galib ibn Ahmad ibn Mohammed ibn Abu-l-Hasan Ali ibn Mohammed ibn as-Sakkak al-Miknasi.''' (died 818 AH-1415/6 AD), was a Moroccan [[Sufi]] mystic, Maliki scholar, historian and genealogist of great repute, from [[Tadla]], friend of [[Ibn Khaldun]] and especially well known as author of an advice to Muslim kings, ''Nush muluk al-islam bi-al-tarif bi-ma yajibu alay-him min huquq ila bayt al-kiram''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ben Chekroun, ''La Vie intellectuelle marocaine sous les Mérinides et les Wattasides'', 1974, pp. 368-72&lt;/ref&gt; In his advice Ibn Sakkak expressed skepticism about the divine right claimed by some rulers in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Saida, Sqalli Houssini, Thesis, ''Contribution à l'Étude du discours politico-réligieux sous les derniers Mérinides: les Lettres d'Ibn Abbad de Ronda au Sultan Abu Faris et le Nush Muluk al-Islam d'Ibn As-Sakkak.'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Sakkak is also the author of ''Kitab al-Uslub min-al-kalam ‘ala la hawla wa-la quwwata illa billah'' (known as ''Kitab al-Asalib''), the first book about the [[Shadhili|Tariqa Shadhiliyya]] in Morocco, in which he used the name "Shadhili" for [[Ibn Abbad al-Rundi]] (d. 792/1377).&lt;ref&gt;Éric Geoffroy, ''Une voie soufie dans le monde:la Shâdhiliyya'', p.75''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alas Poor Yagan.jpg|thumbnail|right|350px|''Alas Poor Yagan'', from ''[[The West Australian]]'', Saturday 6 September 1997]]
'''''Alas Poor Yagan''''' is an [[editorial cartoon]], drawn by [[Dean Alston]] and published in ''[[The West Australian]]'' [[newspaper]] on 6 September 1997.  It consists of a panel of eight drawings of [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] [[activist]] [[Ken Colbung]] speaking to a group of three Indigenous Australian children.&lt;ref name="Alston 1997"&gt;[[Dean Alston|Alston, Dean]] (1997). "Alas, Poor Yagan".  ''[[The West Australian]]'', 6 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon's content offended many Indigenous Australians, and resulted in a complaint of racism to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].  The commission eventually ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to [[Nyungar]] beliefs but did not breach the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]].  This ruling was subsequently upheld on appeal to the [[Federal Court of Australia]].

==Background==
{{main|Yagan}}
''Alas Poor Yagan'' was published shortly after the return of [[Yagan]]'s head from the [[United Kingdom]]. Yagan was a Nyungar warrior who resisted the [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement of [[Western Australia]]. He was shot dead by a settler in 1833, and his head was removed and sent to the United Kingdom for display in a [[museum]]. In 1964, it was buried in an unmarked grave in a local [[cemetery]]. The Nyungar community began efforts to locate and repatriate the head in 1990.  Yagan's head was finally [[Exhumation of Yagan's head|exhumed]] in September 1997, but organisation of the handover "was accompanied by a degree of sometimes undignified acrimony over who had the appropriate cultural claims, by descent, to bring the remains back".&lt;ref name="FCA 2004"&gt;Federal Court of Australia (2004). [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2004/16.html ''Bropho v Human Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission &lt;nowiki&gt;[2004]&lt;/nowiki&gt; FCAFC 16'']. 6 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These conflicts within the Nyungar community were publicly aired, and at one point even involved litigation in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"&gt;Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (2001). ''Corunna v West Australian Newspapers  (2001) EOC 93-146. 12 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''[[The West Australian]]'' provided coverage of the repatriation of Yagan's head, including the conflict within the Nyungar community. ''Alas Poor Yagan'' was published on 6 September 1997.  It was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Nyungars instead of fostering unity, and it lampooned the conduct of those involved in the conflict. It could also be interpreted as insulting aspects of Indigenous Australian culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage.&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"/&gt;

==Complaint==
On 24 September 1997, a complaint about the cartoon was lodged with the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].  The complaint was made by human rights lawyer [[Hannah McGlade]] on behalf of a group of people calling themselves "The Nyungar Circle of Elders", and comprising Albert Corunna, Richard Wilkes, Violet Newman, Mingli Wanjurri, Leisha Eatts, [[Robert Bropho]] and [[Ken Colbung]].  The complainants alleged that Alston and ''The West Australian'' had breached "s18c of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975".&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"/&gt;

On 4 March 1998, the Race Discrimination Commissioner discontinued her inquiry into the case on the grounds that the cartoon was "an artistic work" that was published "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt from the s18c conditions under s18d of the Act.  The Nyungar Circle of Elders rejected that finding, and asked for the case to be referred to the Commission for public inquiry.  A public hearing was held on 29 April 1999, and the findings released on 12 April 2001.  The Commission found that the cartoon was in breach of s18c of the Act; specifically, it found that the cartoon:
* contained a demeaning portrayal of Yagan;
* reinforced a negative [[stereotype]] regarding alcohol and Indigenous Australians;
* contained derogatory references to the [[Wagyl]], a [[religion|religious]] figure;
* treated [[death]] in a manner offensive to Indigenous Australians;
* provided intimate details of the ancestry of individuals, in some cases "where the intercourse was not a matter of choice for the Aboriginal women concerned";
* implied a diminishing of the race by the resultant racial mix; and
* reinforced a negative stereotype of Indigenous people taking advantage of government grants.
The Commission also found, however, that the cartoon was exempt under s18d of the Act, because it was done reasonably and in good faith.  The reasoning was based partly on the overall coverage of the issue by ''The West Australian'', which "provided a balance report... and an opinion which... encouraged unity in, and support of, the Aboriginal community".  In such a context, the decision by then [[editing|editor]] [[Paul Murray (journalist)|Paul Murray]] to publish the cartoon was found to be reasonable.&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"/&gt;

[[Robert Bropho]] then sought a judicial review of the Commission's finding, but his application was dismissed on 4 December 2002.  Bropho then appealed against that decision in the [[Federal Court of Australia]].  On 6 February 2004, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal and ordered Bropho to pay all costs.&lt;ref name="FCA 2004"/&gt;

==Analysis==
According to McGlade, a number of academic commentators have expressed concern about the ruling, in particular that the protections offered under s18c were being undermined by a broad interpretation of the s18d exemption. McGlade has argued that "It is extremely difficult to reconcile the serious finding of breach under section18C with the subsequent finding of reasonableness under section 18D."&lt;ref name="McGlade 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Hannah | last = McGlade | year = 2001 | title = Race Vilification Before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission | journal = [[Indigenous Law Bulletin]] | volume = 5 | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "obviously the adverse findings made of the Commission could have been relied upon to defeat the respondent's claim to have acted reasonably and in good faith. It appears that the complainants were placed under an impossible burden of proving explicit motive and intent.... [P]roper remedies are being denied by the responsible bodies."&lt;ref name="McGlade 2004"&gt;{{cite book | first = Hannah | last = McGlade | year = 2004 | title = Honour Among Nations?: Treaties and Agreements with Indigenous People | chapter = Race Discrimination in Australia: A Challenge for Treaty Settlement | pages = 273–287 | publisher = Melbourne University Publishing | isbn = 0-522-85106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point is made by Anna Chapman, who argues that "the result of the case was a reification of dominant racial values... in prioritising non-indigenous racial narratives over Indigenous perspectives."&lt;ref name="Chapman 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Anna | last = Chapman | title = Australian Racial Hatred Law: Some Comments on Reasonableness and Adjudicative Method in Complaints Brought by Indigenous People | year = 2004 | journal = Monash University Law Review | volume = 30 | pages = 27–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Equestriantunic.jpg|thumb|Picture of an [[Equestrian order|equestrian]] dressed in his rank toga and tunic, the angusticlavia.]]
In [[ancient Rome]], an '''angusticlavia''', '''angusticlavus''', or '''angustus clavus''' was a narrow-strip [[tunic]] (''tunica'') with two narrow vertical [[Tyrian purple]] stripes (''clavi''). The tunic was typically worn under the [[toga]] with the right side stripe visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/121060 | title=The Senate and Senatorial and Equestrian Posts. In Cambridge Ancient History, Vol X 2nd Edition. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Talbert, Richard | year=1996 | location=Cambridge | pages=326 | isbn=0521264308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and significance==
The ''angusticlavia'' was the tunic associated with the rank and office of the [[Equestrian order|''eques'']], or equestrians, one of the two highest legal orders in [[aristocratic]] Rome. Order members were military men, often [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (''patrici''), who served as the [[cavalry]] units in war. During times of peace they frequently served as personal assistants to [[Roman Senate|Roman senators]]. Equestrians wore the angusticlavia under the [[trabea]], a short toga of distinctive form and color. They also wore equestrian shoes (''[[calcei]]''), and a gold ring ([[anulus aureus]]). The tunic's stripes were about an inch wide, which contrasted with the senator's [[laticlavus]], which bore three-inch wide stripes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27810161 |contribution=Reconstructing Roman Clothing|title=The World of Roman Costume| publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press | author= Goldman, Norma | year=2001 | location=Cambridge | pages=221 | isbn=0299138542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818659594 | title=Crisis Management During the Roman Republic: The Role of Political Institutions in Emergencies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Golden, Gregory K | year=2013 | location=Cambridge | pages=49 |isbn=9781107032859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angusticlavia's purple-hued bands distinguished members of the equestrian order from other Roman dignitaries and from regular [[Roman citizenship|citizens]]. In ancient Rome, the color purple became increasingly linked to the higher classes, and eventually to the [[Roman emperors|emperor]] and the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|empire's magistrates]]. Thus, the angusticlavia served to indicate [[Roman social class|social status]] above regular citizenry but below senators and magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7310712 | title=Selected Orations and Letters of Cicero; To Which Is Added the Catiline of Sallust | publisher=Scott, Foresman and Co., | author=Johnston, Harold Whetsone | year=2010 | location=Chicago | pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/659246766 | title=Arms and Armour of the Warrior Saints: Tradition and Innovation in Byzantine Iconography (843–1261) | publisher=BRILL | author=Grotowsk, Piotr | year=2010 | pages=301 (note 658) | isbn=9004185488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794672969 | title=History: From the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Day | publisher=Penguin | author=Hart-Davis, Adam | year=2012 | pages=107 | isbn=9780756698584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/228041839 | title=Tratado de declamación o arte dramático | publisher=Editorial Fundamentos |author1=Bastús y Carrera |author2=Vicente Joaquín | year=2008 | location=Madrid | pages=253 | isbn=9788424511326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On certain occasions, particularly during times of political or social upheaval, senators in Rome chose to wear the equestrian tunic as a public display of distress. This practice was part of the semi-[[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] legacy of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]. In 58&amp;nbsp;BCE, when the [[tribune of the plebs]] [[Clodius]] was pushing [[Cicero]] into exile, the senators took on the ''angusticlavia'' in public protest. In 53&amp;nbsp;BCE, during a period of civic violence, the [[Roman Consul|consuls]] put aside their senatorial dress (the laticlavus) and summoned the [[Roman Senate|senate]] in equestrian attire (the ''angusticlavia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61342089 | title=The Augustan succession : an historical commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman history, Books 55-56 (9 B.C.-A.D. 14) | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Swan, Peter Michael | year=2004 | location=Oxford | pages=307 | isbn=1423720849}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of ancient Roman history, the angusticlavia lost its symbolic meaning and class association. Wall paintings and other representations of the Roman past "show all types of men and boys wearing stripes of similar width -- but there were later attempts to enforce or reintroduce the senatorial and equestrian classes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/122309175 | title=Greek and Roman Dress from A to Z | publisher=Routledge |author1=Cleland, Liza |author2=Glenys Davies |author3=Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones | year=2007 | location=New York | pages=35 | isbn=9780415226615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Latin word ''angusticlavia'' is compounded of ''[[wikt:angustus#Latin|angustus]]'' ("narrow; small") and ''[[wikt:clavus#Latin|clavus]]'' ("nail; stud").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dangusticlavius | title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, angustĭclāvĭus | accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''clavus,'' or "nail", refers to the stripes, for being as long as nails. The term ''angustus'', or "narrow", refers to these stripes or ornaments as being slimmer than on the senatorial laticlavus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01| title=Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences : containing the definitions of the terms, and accounts of the things signify'd thereby, in the several arts, both liberal and mechanical, and the several sciences, human and divine : the figures, kinds, properties, productions, preparations, and uses, of things natural and artificial : the rise, progress, and state of things ecclesiastical, civil, military, and commercial : with the several systems, sects, opinions, &amp;c : among philosophers, divines, mathematicians, physicians, antiquaries, criticks, &amp;c : the whole intended as a course of antient and modern learning | publisher=J. and J.

}}
In [[Korean mythology]] and history, '''Asadal''' ([[Hangul]]/ [[Hanja]]:아사달/阿斯達) was the mythical capital city of kingdom of [[Gojoseon]] ([[Hangul]]/ [[Hanja]]: 고조선/ 古朝鮮 - meaning "Older Joseon"), the first ever [[Korea|Korean]] kingdom and notably founded by the legendary god-king [[Dangun|Dan'gun]]. It is thought that Asadal was located in [[Manchuria]], northeastern [[Hwanghae]] Province ([[Hangul]]/ [[Hanja]]: 황해/黃海) in North Korea, or [[Pyongyang]] Province ([[Hangul]]/ [[Hanja]]: 평양/平壤) - that is, either the legendary kingdom in situ within the province of Pyongyang, not referring to the modern-day capital of North Korea - Pyongyang. 

The first Korean historical work to mention it is the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' ([[Hangul]]/ [[Hanja]]: 삼국유사/三國遺事 - ''"Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms"''), which cites the Chinese ''[[Book of Wei]]'' (Korean [[Hangul]]/ [[Hanja]]: 위서/魏書 - ''wi-seo''). The ''Samguk Yusa'' also cites the lost historical records of ''Go-gi'' (고기/古記 - ''"Old Analects/ Records"'') to the effect that Dan'gun's capital was located in Pyongyang. But recent studies show that there were more than one city named Pyongyang (which literally means "flat soil" in Chinese), situated in the north deep in Manchuria - possibly bordering in between China and Russia. The Pyongyang that is North Korea's capital today is actually the Southern counterpart, as it was common at the time for an emperor to manage two capitals and rule in two palaces. Therefore, it could be that the "true" Asadal is located in Manchuria.

It is often hypothesized that Asadal may be a compound noun composed of two elements, ''asa'' and ''dal''. This hypothesis appears to be motivated by an assumption of equivalence between the Chinese phonetic transcription 阿斯達, which is read in Modern Korean as ''Asadal'' (but in Mandarin Chinese as ''Asīdá'' and in Modern Japanese as ''Ashitatsu'' or ''Ashidachi''), and the word 朝鮮 (Mandarin ''Cháoxiǎn'' or ''Cháoxiān'', Korean ''Joseon'', Japanese ''Chōsen'') "Joseon, another [[names of Korea|name for Korea]]." However, the etymology of Joseon is unknown; it is not even clear whether it has been created as a phonetic transcription of a foreign name or rather as a semantic calque of a foreign name, and the ''Cháo'' reading of the first syllable of the Mandarin Chinese form is identical with the reading of this character when used to mean "dynasty," not with the reading of this character when used to mean "morning" (which would be *''Zhāo'' instead). Despite the weakness of this hypothesis, ''Asa-'' in ''Asadal'' is sometimes claimed to be cognate with a common [[Korean language|Korean]] word for "morning" (Middle Korean ''achɔm'', Modern Korean ''achim''), probably because of obvious phonetic similarity with [[Japanese language|Japanese]] 朝 ''asa'' "morning." However, the Chinese character 斯, which is used in the modern Chinese language mainly to represent the phoneme /s/ or /θ/ in word-final and preconsonantal positions when transcribing foreign words, has always had a sibilant (/s/) rather than an affricate like Korean ''ch'', and the Chinese language has plenty of characters that would be better suited to transcribing Korean ''ch''. ''Dal'' may be the result of reading [[Hanja|Chinese characters]] in the Korean way, and the original Chinese pronunciation at the time Asadal was recorded in ancient historical texts could have been "Da," a transcription of the Korean word ''sdah'' or ''ddang'' meaning "land." If such is the case, "Asadal" would mean "Morning Land." However, if "dal" has been used much like the [[Goguryeo]] city name suffix "-dal" used for mountains and cities founded on plateaus/mountains, then "Asadal" would mean "Morning Mountain."

==Career==
In 1949, Morris was employed by the city of [[Clearwater, Florida]] to work at its main library,&lt;ref name="questia.com"/&gt; making her the first [[African American]] to work as a librarian in that municipality. Before being hired, she had never set foot inside a library due to the segregation laws of that time.&lt;ref name="questia.com"/&gt; Soon afterwards, she became the director of the "Negro Library", which opened in 1950. A local resident, Horace Carson, had convinced the City Commission to fund the new library, after which he asked Morris to work there. 

As director of the newly founded library, Morris undertook all tasks, including storytelling and even sweeping.&lt;ref name="questia.com"/&gt; She often had to lobby for additional books, encourageing the children to read and learn as much as they could.&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt; She also helped upgrade the library's location from a tiny rented space to a larger official one in 1962. The architect who designed the new building was Eugene Beach.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.myclearwaterlibrary.com/learn/historical-information/clearwater-library-history&lt;/ref&gt; Morris asked him to construct a structure with a circular shape so she could "supervise library activities by herself if necessary." &lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt; The building was renamed the [[North Greenwood Library]] in 1983 after she retired.

In addition do her library duties, Morris helped increase voter registration and prepare students for high school equivalency tests.&lt;ref name="tumblr.com"/&gt; Even after her retirement in 1983,&lt;ref name="tumblr.com"/&gt; she remained involved in local committees. She asked that the city rethink its decision about reducing library hours, so children would not be denied access.&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt;

In 2010, she co-wrote the volume "Christine Wigfall Morris: Stories of Family, Community, and History" to document her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jC9qkQEACAAJ&amp;dq=Christine+Wigfall+Morri&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv9ZSsqa7bAhUT-J8KHeL7A1YQ6AEIKTAA|title=Christine Wigfall Morris: Stories of Family, Community, and History|first1=Christine Neomi|last1=Morris|first2=Barbara J.|last2=Sorey|date=1 September 2010|publisher=America Star Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="questia.com"/&gt; She also has a book collection named after her at the [[North Greenwood Library]].&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt;
==Background==
Morris was born on March 24, 1922 in [[Register, Georgia|Register]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to parents Eddie and Hattie Wigfall. She also had a sister named Louise.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/christine-wigfallmorris-obituary?pid=173435195|title=Christine WIGFALL MORRIS Obituary - Clearwater, Florida|first=|last=admin|date=10 December 2014|website=Legacy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the family moved to [[Clearwater, Florida]] where her parents opened a dry cleaning business.&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt; She attended a segregated high school, graduating in 1941.  She then studied home economics and English at [[Bethune-Cookman University]].&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt;  She was married to Willie J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''David Ian Berguer''' (born October 1939) is a British [[local historian]] and author, and the chairman of the Friern Barnet and District Local History Society. His books include ''The Friern Hospital Story'' (2012), the story of the former Colney Hatch Asylum.

==Early life==
David Berguer was born in October 1939.

==Writing==
[[File:Friern Hospital 05.jpg|thumb|Friern Hospital, the subject of Berguer's major work.]]
His career was in media management in the advertising industry. He retired in 2000 and at that time was one of the founders of the Friern Barnet and District Local History Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chavillepress.co.uk/berguer.html Biography.] Chaville Press. Retrieved 8 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; His first book was ''Under the Wires at Tally Ho'', an examination of the trams and trolleybuses that once served the area of Finchley in north London.

This was followed by ''The Friern Hospital Story'', which examined the complete history of the former Colney Hatch Asylum, later known as [[Friern Hospital]], from its design and opening in 1851 to its closure in 1993, and subsequent conversion to flats known as Princess Park Manor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-series.co.uk/leisure/books/10049434._Not_treated__but_not_ill_treated_/ David Berguer talks to Rosy Moorhead about his book that looks at the history of Friern Hospital.] Rosy Moorhead, Times Series, 15 November 2012. Retrieved 8 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the book was named by the [[London &amp; Middlesex Archaeological Society]] the best single topic publication written by a member of their 55 affiliated local history societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friern-barnethistory.org.uk/friern-hospital-story ''The Friern Hospital Story''.] Friern Barnet &amp; District Local History Society. Retrieved 8 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Berguer produced ''All over by Christmas'', an examination of conditions on the home front in Barnet during the First World War&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friern-barnethistory.org.uk/all-over-by-christmas ''All Over by Christmas''.] Friern Barnet &amp; District Local History Society. Retrieved 8 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he and a team trawled local newspapers from the wartime period to extract the source material. He originally thought the book would be short but there was so much information available that the final work was nearly 300 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-series.co.uk/leisure/books/11107188.Barnet_in_the_Great_War/?

Retrieved 9 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he produced ''Whetstone Revealed'' with [[John Heathfield]].

He is credited with having made heritage studies a discipline in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Clout, [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/27/david-lowenthal-obituary "David Lowenthal obituary"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Lowenthal graduated from the [[New Lincoln School| Lincoln School]] in New York, which encouraged interdisciplinary investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/246465145 A long interview] with Lowenthal recorded in 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Harvard University]] during WWII, studying across several disciplines but graduating with a B.S. in history in 1944. He returned to study for an M.A. in [[geography]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1950.&lt;ref name="Lecture"&gt;[https://www.iiconservation.org/congress/2010istanbul/forbes "Forbes Prize Lecture 2010"], International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; At Berkeley his research was on [[the Guianas]], working with [[Carl Sauer]]. He earned his PhD in [[history]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], for a study of the life of [[George Perkins Marsh]], an early geographer and conservationist.  

Lowenthal was inducted into the U.S. Army Infantry in May 1943 and deployed in September 1944, three months after D-Day. He left active service with trench foot, and it was while recuperating in Somerset that his long association with England, later to become his adopted country, began. In December 1944, he was reassigned to Army Intelligence and embarked on a mission to count toilets in German castles to ascertain how well each might support the occupation forces. While taking part in the Intelligence Photographic Documentation Project – a never-completed mission was to survey and catalogue the whole of western Europe’s terrain and built environment – Lowenthal fell from his truck and fractured his wrist, which resulted in his being recalled to Washington in September 1945.

==Career==
Lowenthal served as a research analyst in the U.S. Department of State from 1945 to 1946. From 1952 to 1956, he was an assistant professor of History at [[Vassar College]]He then undertook several postings, between the USA, Caribbean and the UK.  From 1956 to 1970 at the [[University of the West Indies]] in Jamaica, he was a history lecturer, research associate, and a consultant to the Vice Chancellor. From 1958 to 1972, he was also a research associate at the American Geographical Society. Between 1961 and 1972 he worked at the [[Institute of Race Relations]] in London. He was a professor of geography at [[University College London]] (UCL) 1972 to 1985 and remained an Emeritus professor there until his death. In October 2017 he gave the inaugural lecture in an annual series for UCL's new Centre for Critical Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/critical-heritage-studies/news/2017/oct/david-lowenthal-delivers-first-cchs-annual-lecture "David Lowenthal delivers first CCHS annual lecture"], Centre for Critical Heritage Studies, UCL, 30 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowenthal died in [[London]] on 15 September 2018, having celebrated his 95th birthday with friends earlier in the year, in both London and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=ucl&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/critical-heritage-studies/news-and-events/chs-news-publication/David-Lowenthal-has-passed-away|title=David Lowenthal has passed away |publisher=[[University College London]] |date=17 September 2018|website=|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He and his family lived in [[Harrow on the Hill]] in north-west London for many years, and after retirement, in California.

==Contributions==
Lowenthal's doctoral work was on the 19th-century North American philologist, geographer and environmentalist [[George Perkins Marsh]], whose work laid the foundations of the environmental conservation movement in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landscaperesearch.org/about-us/lrg-directors/david-lowentha/ Landscape Research Group, About Us, Directors, David Lowenthal]&lt;/ref&gt; and led to his book ''George Perkins Marsh: Versatile Vermonter'' (1958, revised 2003).  

Other key texts of his in the field of historical geography include ''The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History'' (1996),  and ''Passage du Temps sur le Paysage'' (2008).&lt;ref name="British Academy" /&gt; Landscape photographs taken by Lowenthal in the 1950s were included in a French exhibition at ''Le Pavillon Populaire'' in Montpellier, France, from 8 February to 16 April 2017 and accompanying book ''Notes sur l'asphalte, une Amérique mobile et précaire, 1950-1990.'' His last book, ''Quest for the Unity of Knowledge'', will be published posthumously.&lt;ref name=ucl /&gt;

He was well known for his work on landscapes, and advised international [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] agencies and institutions, including [[UNESCO]], the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], the [[International Council of Museums]], [[ICCROM]], the [[Getty Conservation Institute]], the [[World Monuments Fund]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[Europa Nostra]], [[English Heritage]], the U.S. National Trust for Historic Preservation, the [[National Trust of Australia]], and the [[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref name="Lecture" /&gt;

His historical analysis of the ever-changing role of the past in shaping our lives, ''The Past is a Foreign Country'' (1985), is his best-known work, widely considered to be a classic text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/event/sylvester-baxter-lecture-david-lowenthal-conservation-past-and-present/ "Sylvester Baxter Lecture: David Lowenthal, 'Conservation Past and Present'"], Events, Harvard University Graduate School of Design, November 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University College London, Department of Geography, David Lowenthal at 90 [http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/news/news-archive-2013/april-2013/david-lowenthal-at-90]&lt;/ref&gt; A new book, ''The Past Is a Foreign Country – Revisited'', came out in 2015, for which he was honoured with a [[British Academy Medal]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;UCL [http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/news-events/news/news-archive/september-2015/new-book-from-david-lowenthal Retrieved 3 November 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialectical materialism''' is a [[philosophy]] of [[science]] and [[nature]] developed in Europe and based on the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. A. Jordan, ''The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism'' (London: Macmillan, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thomas, ''Marxism and Scientific Socialism: From Engels to Althusser'' (London: Routledge, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialectical materialism adapts the [[Hegelian dialectic]] for traditional [[materialism]], which examines the subjects of the world in relation to each other within a dynamic, evolutionary environment, in contrast to metaphysical materialism, which examines parts of the world within a static, isolated environment.

Dialectical materialism accepts the evolution of the natural world and the emergence of new qualities of being at new stages of evolution. As Z. A. Jordan notes, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."&lt;ref name="Jordan, p. 167"&gt;Jordan, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formulation of the Soviet version of dialectical and [[historical materialism]] (such as in Stalin's book ''[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]]'') in the 1930s by [[Joseph Stalin]] and his associates, became the "official" Soviet interpretation of [[Marxism]]. It was codified and popularized in textbooks which were{{when|date=January 2017}} required reading in the Soviet Union as well as in some Eastern European countries. It was exported to China as the "official" interpretation of Marxism.

== The term ==
Marx and Engels never used the words "dialectical materialism" in their own writings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch02.htm|title=Marx's Conception of Man |author= [[Erich Fromm]] |publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1887 by [[Joseph Dietzgen]], a socialist who corresponded with Marx, during and after the failed [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 German Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Charbonnat, ''Histoire des philosophies matérialistes'', Syllepse, 2007, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; Casual mention of the term "dialectical materialism" is also found in the biography ''Frederick Engels'', by philosopher [[Karl Kautsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1887/xx/engels.htm |title=Karl Kautsky: Frederick Engels (1887) |publisher=Marxists.org |date=2003-11-23 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in the same year. Marx himself had talked about the "materialist conception of history", which was later referred to as "[[historical materialism]]" by Engels. Engels further explained the "materialist dialectic" in his ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'' in 1883. [[Georgi Plekhanov]], the father of Russian Marxism, later introduced the term "dialectical materialism" to Marxist literature.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Plekhanov, ''The development of the monist view of history'' (1895)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] further delineated and defined dialectical and historical materialism as the world outlook of [[Marxism-Leninism]], and as a method to study society and its history.&lt;ref&gt;as discussed in his 1938 article, Dialectical and Historical Materialism [http://marx2mao.net/Stalin/DHM38.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
Marx and Engels each began their adulthood as [[Young Hegelians]], one of several groups of intellectuals inspired by the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sperber |first=Jonathan |year=2013 |title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hunt |first=Tristram |year=2009 |title=Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/marxs-general-the-revolutionary-life-of-friedrich-engels/oclc/263983621 |publisher=Metropolitan/Henry Holt &amp; Co |postscript=.|isbn=9780805080254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's doctoral thesis, ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'',  was concerned with the [[atomism]] of [[Epicurus]] and [[Democritus]], which is considered the foundation of materialist philosophy. Marx was also familiar with [[Lucretius]]'s theory of ''[[clinamen]]''. Marx and Engels both concluded that Hegelian philosophy, at least as interpreted by their former colleagues, was too abstract and was being misapplied in attempts to explain the [[social injustice]] in [[industrialisation|recently industrializing]] countries such as [[Germany]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]], which was a growing concern in the early 1840s.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt;

In contrast to the conventional [[dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]] of the day, which emphasized the [[idealism|idealist]] observation that human experience is dependent on the mind's perceptions, Marx developed [[dialectic#Marxist dialectics|Marxist dialectics]], which emphasized the [[materialism|materialist]] view that the world of the concrete shapes [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] interactions and that those in turn determine [[political sociology|sociopolitical]] reality.&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"/&gt; Whereas some Hegelians blamed religious alienation (estrangement from the traditional comforts of religion) for societal ills, Marx and Engels concluded that alienation from economic and political [[autonomy]], coupled with [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[poverty]], was the real culprit.&lt;ref name="Hunt_2009"/&gt; In keeping with dialectical ideas, Marx and Engels thus created an alternative theory, not only of why the world is the way it is but also of which actions people should take to make it the way it ought to be. In ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), Marx wrote, "The philosophers have only ''interpreted'' the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to ''change'' it."&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"/&gt; Dialectical materialism is thus closely related to Marx's and Engels's [[historical materialism]] (and has sometimes been viewed as [[synonym]]ous with it). Marx rejected the language of "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]".&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

Dialectical materialism is an aspect of the broader subject of [[materialism]], which asserts the primacy of the material world: in short, matter precedes thought. Materialism is a [[Scientific realism|realist philosophy of science]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar 1979&lt;/ref&gt; which holds that the world is material; that all phenomena in the universe consist of "matter in motion," wherein all things are interdependent and interconnected and develop according to [[natural law]]; that the world exists outside us and independently of our perception of it; that thought is a reflection of the material world in the brain, and that the world is ''in principle'' knowable. Marx criticized classical materialism as another idealist philosophy—idealist because of its transhistorical understanding of material contexts. The Young Hegelian [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] had rejected Hegel's idealistic philosophy and advocated materialism.&lt;ref name="Marxists"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/e.htm "Feuerbach, Ludwig"] at marxists.org. Accessed 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being strongly influenced by Feuerbach,&lt;ref name="Marxists"/&gt; Marx rejected Feuerbach's version of materialism as inconsistent.&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of Engels, especially ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1878) and ''Dialectics of Nature'' (1875–82), were the source of the main doctrines of dialectical materialism.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

== Marx's dialectics&lt;!--'Dialectical idealism' redirects here--&gt; ==
The concept of dialectical materialism emerges from statements by Marx in the second edition postface to his magnum opus, [[Das Kapital|''Capital'']]. There Marx says he intends to use Hegelian dialectics but in revised form. He defends Hegel against those who view him as a "dead dog" and then says, "I openly avowed myself as the pupil of that mighty thinker [[Hegel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy'', ed. Frederick Engels (New York: Modern Library, no date, first published 1906), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx credits Hegel with "being the first to present [dialectic's] form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner". But he then criticizes Hegel for turning dialectics upside down: "With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell."&lt;ref name="Marx, p. 25"&gt;Marx, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's criticism of Hegel asserts that Hegel's dialectics go astray by dealing with ideas, with the human mind. Hegel's dialectic, Marx says, inappropriately concerns "the process of the human brain"; it focuses on ideas.  Hegel's thought is in fact sometimes called '''dialectical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, and Hegel himself is counted among a number of other philosophers known as the [[German idealists]].  Marx, on the contrary, believed that dialectics should deal not with the mental world of ideas but with "the material world", the world of production and other economic activity.&lt;ref name="Marx, p. 25"/&gt;

For Marx, human history cannot be fitted into any neat ''a priori'' schema. He explicitly rejects the idea of Hegel's followers that history can be understood as "a person apart, a metaphysical subject of which real human individuals are but the bearers".&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx and F. Engels, ''The Holy Family'' (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1956), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; To interpret history as though previous social formations have somehow been aiming themselves toward the present state of affairs is "to misunderstand the historical movement by which the successive generations transformed the results acquired by the generations that preceded them".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' (London: Martin Lawrence, [1936]), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's rejection of this sort of [[teleology]] was one reason for his enthusiastic (though not entirely uncritical) reception of Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Taylor, "The Significance of Darwinian Theory for Marx and Engels", ''Philosophy of the Social Sciences'' 19 (1989), 409–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marx, dialectics is not a formula for generating predetermined outcomes but is a method for the empirical study of social processes in terms of interrelations, development, and transformation. In his introduction to the Penguin edition of Marx's ''Capital'', [[Ernest Mandel]] writes, "When the dialectical method is applied to the study of economic problems, economic phenomena are not viewed separately from each other, by bits and pieces, but in their inner connection as an integrated totality, structured around, and by, a basic predominant mode of production."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, Introduction to Karl Marx, ''Capital'', Vol. 1 (Harmondsworth, U.K.: Penguin, 1976), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's own writings are almost exclusively concerned with understanding human history in terms of systemic processes, based on [[modes of production]] (broadly speaking, the ways in which societies are organized to employ their technological powers to interact with their material surroundings). This is called ''[[historical materialism]]''. More narrowly, within the framework of this general theory of history, most of Marx's writing is devoted to an analysis of the specific structure and development of the capitalist economy.

For his part, Engels applies a "dialectical" approach to the natural world in general, arguing that contemporary science is increasingly recognizing the necessity of viewing natural processes in terms of interconnectedness, development, and transformation. Some scholars have doubted that Engels's "dialectics of nature" is a legitimate extension of Marx's approach to social processes.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schmidt, ''The Concept of Nature in Marx'' (London: NLB, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thomas, "Marx and Science", ''Political Studies'' 24 (1976), 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Carver, ''Engels: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued that despite Marx's insistence that humans are natural beings in an evolving, mutual relationship with the rest of nature, Marx's own writings pay inadequate attention to the ways in which human agency is constrained by such factors as biology, geography, and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastiano Timpanaro, ''On Materialism'' (London: NLB, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ted Benton, ed., ''The Greening of Marxism'' (New York: Guilford Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engels's dialectics&lt;!--'Materialist dialectic' redirects here--&gt; ==
Engels postulated three laws of dialectics from his reading of Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, F. (7th ed., 1973). ''Dialectics of nature'' (Translator, Clements Dutt). New York: International Publishers. (Original work published 1940). See also ''[http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/index.htm Dialectics of Nature]''&lt;/ref&gt; Engels elucidated these laws as the '''materialist dialectic'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in his work ''Dialectics of Nature'':

# The law of the unity and conflict of opposites
# The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes
# The law of the negation of the negation

The first law, which originates with the ancient [[Ionians|Ionian]] philosopher [[Heraclitus]],&lt;ref&gt;cf. for instance. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/heraclit.htm#H3 'The Doctrine of Flux and the Unity of Opposites' in the 'Heraclitus' entry in the ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt; was seen by both Hegel and [[Vladimir Lenin]] as the central feature of a dialectical understanding of things:
{{quote|It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of oppositions in their unity, or of the positive in the negative, that speculative thought consists. It is the most important aspect of dialectic.|Hegel, ''Science of Logic'', § 69, (p 56 in the Miller edition)}}
{{quote|The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence (one of the "essentials", one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of dialectics. That is precisely how Hegel, too, puts the matter.|Lenin's Collected Works VOLUME 38, p359: On the question of dialectics.}}

The second law Hegel took from Ancient Greek philosophers, notably the [[paradox of the heap]], and explanation by Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;"The sudden conversion into a change of quality of a change which was apparently merely quantitative had already attracted the attention of the ancients who illustrated in popular examples the contradiction arising from ignorance of this fact; they are familiar under the names of 'the bald' and 'the heap'. These elenchi are, according to Aristotle's explanation, the ways in which one is compelled to say the opposite of what one had previously asserted..." https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hl333.htm#0719. Hegel, ''Science of Logic'', § 718ff, (p 335 in the Miller edition. See also pp. 368–70.)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is equated with what scientists call [[phase transitions]]. It may be traced to the ancient Ionian philosophers, particularly [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]&lt;ref&gt;c.f. a fascination with transitions between [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]]. Guthrie, W.K.C. "The Milesians: Anaximenes". ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; from whom Aristotle, Hegel, and Engels inherited the concept. For all these authors, one of the main illustrations is the [[phase transitions]] of water. There has also been an effort to apply this mechanism to social phenomena, whereby population increases result in changes in social structure. The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes can also be applied to the process of social change and class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro, R.L. (2000). The transition from quantity to quality: A neglected causal mechanism in accounting for social evolution. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences''. Vol. 97, No. 23, pp. 12926–12931. [http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12926.full]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third law, "negation of the negation", originated with Hegel. Although Hegel coined the term "negation of the negation", it gained its fame from Marx's using it in ''Capital''.  There Marx wrote this: "The [death] knell of capitalist private property sounds.  The expropriators [capitalists] are expropriated.  The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property.  This is the first negation [antithesis] of individual private property.  [The "first negation", or antithesis, negates the thesis, which in this instance is feudalism, the economic system that preceded capitalism.] ... But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It [final communism, the synthesis] is the negation of [the] negation."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Capital'', ch. 32,  837.&lt;/ref&gt;

Z. A. Jordan notes, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."&lt;ref name="Jordan, p. 167"/&gt;

== Lenin's contributions ==
{{Marxism-Leninism|concepts}}
After reading Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' in 1914, [[Lenin]] made some brief notes outlining three "elements" of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm |title=Lenin's Summary of Hegel's Dialectics (Lenin's Collected Works Vol. 38, pp. 221–222) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

# The determination of the concept out of itself [the thing itself must be considered in its relations and in its development];
# The contradictory nature of the thing itself (the other of itself), the contradictory forces and tendencies in each phenomenon;
# The union of analysis and synthesis.

Lenin develops these in a further series of notes, and appears to argue that "the transition of quantity into quality and vice versa" is an example of the unity and opposition of opposites expressed tentatively as "not only the unity of opposites but the transitions of every determination, quality, feature, side, property into every other [into its opposite?]."

Also, in his essay "On the Question of Dialectics", Lenin stated that "Development is the 'struggle' of opposites."
He stated that "The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/misc/x02.htm|title=On the Question of Dialectics|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Materialism and Empiriocriticism]]'' (1908), Lenin explained ''dialectical materialism'' as three axes: (i) the materialist inversion of Hegelian dialectics, (ii) the [[historicity (philosophy)|historicity]] of ethical principles ordered to [[class struggle]], and (iii) the convergence of "[[evolution|laws of evolution]]" in physics ([[Helmholtz]]), biology ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]), and in [[political economy]] (Marx). Hence, Lenin was philosophically positioned between historicist Marxism ([[Antonio Labriola|Labriola]]) and [[determinism|determinist]] Marxism—a political position close to "[[social Darwinism]]" (Kautsky). Moreover, late-century discoveries in physics ([[x-rays]], [[electrons]]), and the beginning of [[quantum mechanics]], philosophically challenged previous conceptions of [[matter]] and [[materialism]], thus matter seemed to be disappearing. Lenin disagreed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Matter disappears' means that the limit within which we have hitherto known matter disappears, and that our knowledge is penetrating deeper; properties of matter are disappearing that formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and primary, and which are now revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain states of matter. For the ''sole'' 'property' of matter, with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up, is the property of ''being an objective reality'', of existing outside of the mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lenin was developing the work of Engels, who said that "with each epoch-making discovery, even in the sphere of [[natural science]], [[materialism]] has to change its form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frederick Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch02.htm |title=Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Lenin's challenges was distancing materialism, as a viable philosophical outlook, from the "vulgar materialism" expressed in the statement "the brain secretes thought in the same way as the liver secretes bile" (attributed to 18th-century physician [[Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis]]); "metaphysical materialism" (matter composed of immutable particles); and 19th-century "mechanical materialism" (matter as random molecules interacting per the laws of mechanics). The philosophic solution that Lenin (and Engels) proposed was "dialectical materialism", wherein matter is defined as ''objective reality'', theoretically consistent with (new) developments occurring in the sciences.

Lenin reassessed [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s philosophy and concluded that it was in line with dialectical materialism.&lt;ref name="NC57" /&gt;

== Lukács's contributions ==
[[György Lukács]], Minister of Culture in the brief [[Béla Kun]] government of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (1919), published ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923), in which he defined ''dialectical materialism'' as the knowledge of society as a whole, knowledge which, in itself, was the [[class consciousness]] of the proletariat. In the first chapter "What is Orthodox Marxism?", Lukács defined ''orthodoxy'' as fidelity to the "Marxist method", not fidelity to "dogmas":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the "belief" in this or that thesis, nor the [[exegesis]] of a "sacred" book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded, and deepened, only along the lines laid down by its founders. (§1)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his later works and actions, Lukács became a leader of [[Democratic Marxism]]. He modified many of his formulations of his 1923 works and went on to develop a Marxist ontology and played an active role in democratic movements in Hungary in 1956 and the 1960s. He and his associates became sharply critical of the formulation of dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union that was exported to those countries under its control. In the 1960s, his associates became known as the [[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]].

Lukács philosophical criticism of [[Marxist revisionism]] proposed an intellectual return to the Marxist method. As did [[Louis Althusser]], who later defined Marxism and [[psychoanalysis]] as "conflictual sciences";&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Althusser]], "Marx and Freud", in ''Writings on Psychoanalysis'', Stock/IMEC, 1993 (French edition)&lt;/ref&gt; that political factions and revisionism are inherent to [[Marxist theory]] and political praxis, because dialectical materialism is the philosophic product of [[class struggle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For this reason, the task of orthodox Marxism, its victory over Revisionism and [[utopian socialism|utopianism]] can never mean the defeat, once and for all, of false tendencies. It is an ever-renewed struggle against the insidious effects of bourgeois ideology on the thought of the proletariat. Marxist orthodoxy is no guardian of traditions, it is the eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming the relation between the tasks of the immediate present and the totality of the historical process. (§5)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...the premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness'.... Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity. (§5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosophically aligned with Marx is the criticism of the [[individualist]], [[bourgeois]] philosophy of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], which is founded upon the voluntary and [[consciousness|conscious subject]]. Against said [[ideology]] is the primacy of social relations. Existence—and thus the world—is the product of human activity, but this can be seen only by accepting the primacy of social process on individual consciousness. This type of consciousness is an effect of ideological mystification.

At the 5th Congress of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] (July 1924), [[Grigory Zinoviev]] formally denounced Lukács's heterodox definition of ''orthodox Marxism'' as exclusively derived from fidelity to the "Marxist method", and not to Communist party dogmas; and denounced the Marxism developments of the German theorist [[Karl Korsch]].

==Stalin's contributions==
In the 1930s, [[Joseph Stalin]] and his associates formulated a version of dialectical and [[historical materialism]] that became the "official" Soviet interpretation of Marxism. It was codified in Stalin's work, ''[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]]'' (1938), and popularized in textbooks used for [[compulsory education]] within the Soviet Union and throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]]. It was exported to [[China]] as the "official" interpretation of Marxism but, in its Soviet formulation, has since then been widely rejected there.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Mao's contributions ==
In ''[[On Contradiction]]'' (1937), Mao outlined a version of dialectical materialism that subsumed two of Engels's three principal laws of dialectics, "the transformation of quantity into quality" and "the negation of the negation" as sub-laws (and not principal laws of their own) of the first law, "the unity and interpenetration of opposites".

== As a heuristic in biology and elsewhere ==
Historian of science [[Loren Graham]] has detailed at length the role played by dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union in disciplines as diverse as biology, psychology, chemistry, cybernetics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. He has concluded that, despite the [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]] period in genetics and constraints on free inquiry imposed by political authorities, dialectical materialism had a positive influence on the work of many Soviet scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Loren R. Graham, ''Science, Philosophy, and Human Behavior in the Soviet Union'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evolutionary biologists, such as [[Richard Lewontin]] and the late [[Stephen Jay Gould]], have tried to employ dialectical materialism in their approach. They view dialectics as playing a precautionary heuristic role in their work. From Lewontin's perspective, we get this idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dialectical materialism is not, and never has been, a programmatic method for solving particular physical problems. Rather, a dialectical analysis provides an overview and a set of warning signs against particular forms of dogmatism and narrowness of thought. It tells us, "Remember that history may leave an important trace. Remember that being and becoming are dual aspects of nature. Remember that conditions change and that the conditions necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself. Remember to pay attention to real objects in time and space and not lose them in utterly idealized abstractions. Remember that the qualitative effects of context and interaction may be lost when phenomena are isolated". And above all else, "Remember that all the other caveats are only reminders and warning signs whose application to different circumstances of the real world is contingent."&lt;ref name="evolutionthe1st4billionyears"&gt;{{cite book |title= Evolution: The First Four Billion Years| author=Beatty, J. | chapter=Lewontin, Richard | editors=Michael Ruse &amp; Joseph Travis | year=2009 | publisher= The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03175-3 | page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gould shared similar views regarding a heuristic role for dialectical materialism. He wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by Western scholars, not discarded because some nations of the second world have constructed a cardboard version as an official political doctrine.&lt;ref name="Urchininthestorm153"&gt;{{cite book | title=An Urchin in the Storm: Essays About Books and Ideas |author=Gould, Stephen Jay | chapter=Nurturing Nature | editor=… | year=1990 | publisher=Penguin| location = London | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;...when presented as guidelines for a philosophy of change, not as dogmatic precepts true by fiat, the three classical laws of dialectics embody a holistic vision that views change as interaction among components of complete systems and sees the components themselves not as a priori entities, but as both products and inputs to the system. Thus, the law of "interpenetrating opposites" records the inextricable interdependence of components: the "transformation of quantity to quality" defends a systems-based view of change that translates incremental inputs into alterations of state, and the "negation of negation" describes the direction given to history because complex systems cannot revert exactly to previous states.&lt;ref name="Urchininthestorm154"&gt;Gould, S. J. (1990), p.154&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This heuristic was also applied to the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] proposed by Gould and [[Niles Eldredge]]. They wrote that "history, as Hegel said, moves upward in a spiral of negations", and that "punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time."&lt;ref name="Gould&amp;Eldredge"&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, &amp; Eldredge, Niles (1977). [http://www.nileseldredge.com/pdf_files/Punctuated_Equilibria_Gould_Eldredge_1977.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered."] ''Paleobiology'' '''3''' (2): 115–151. (p.145)&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that "the law of transformation of quantity into quality", "holds that a new quality emerges in a leap as the slow accumulation of quantitative changes, long resisted by a stable system, finally forces it rapidly from one state into another", a phenomenon described in some disciplines as a [[paradigm shift]]. Apart from the commonly cited example of water turning to steam with increased temperature, Gould and Eldredge noted another analogy in [[information theory]], "with its jargon of equilibrium, steady state, and homeostasis maintained by [[negative feedback]]", and "extremely rapid transitions that occur with [[positive feedback]]".&lt;ref name="Gould&amp;Eldredge146"&gt;Gould, S. J., &amp; Eldredge, N. (1977) p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewontin, Gould, and Eldredge were thus more interested in dialectical materialism as a heuristic than a dogmatic form of 'truth' or a statement of their politics. Nevertheless, they found a readiness for critics to "seize upon" key statements&lt;ref name="Brockman"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Third Culture | author=Gould, S. J. | chapter=Stephen Jay Gould: "The Pattern of Life's History" | editor=Brockman, J. | year=1995 | publisher= Simon and Schuster | location = New York|isbn=978-0-684-80359-3 | page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portray punctuated equilibrium, and exercises associated with it, such as public exhibitions, as a "Marxist plot".&lt;ref name="Gould2002"&gt;{{cite book | last= Gould| first= Stephen Jay| title= The Structure of Evolutionary Theory | year = 2002 | publisher = The Belknap Press of Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn =978-0-674-00613-3 }} In his account of one ad hominem absurdity, Gould states on p. 984 "I swear that I do not exaggerate" regarding the accusations of a Marxist plot.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical evaluations==
Some critics argue against dialectical materialism on account of its adherence to a purely [[Materialism#Criticism and alternatives|materialist]] worldview, while others have objections to the [[Dialectic#Criticisms|dialectic]] method it employs. There are critics, such as the Marxist [[Alain Badiou]], who dispute the way the concept is interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing|last = Zizek|first = Slavoj|publisher = Verso|year = 2013|isbn = 9781844678976|location = New York}}p.44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Needham]], an influential historian of science and a Christian who nonetheless was an adherent of dialectical materialism, suggested that a more appropriate term might be "dialectical organicism".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, ''Moulds of Understanding'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1976), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leszek Kołakowski]], writing in ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' (1976), argued that dialectical materialism consists partly of "truisms with no specific Marxist content", partly of "philosophical dogmas", partly of nonsense, and partly of statements that—depending on how they are interpreted—could be any of these things.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Main Currents of Marxism|last = Kołakowski|first = Leszek|publisher = W. W. Norton and Company|year = 2005|isbn = 9780393329438|location = New York|pages = 909}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Eastman]] argued that dialectical materialism lacks a [[psychological]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dialectical Materialism|last = Oehler|first = Hugo|publisher = Demos Press|year = 1941|location = Chicago}}p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Allen W. Wood|Allen Wood]] argued that, in its form as an official Soviet philosophy, dialectical materialism was doomed to be superficial because "creativity or critical thinking" was impossible in an authoritarian environment. Nevertheless, he considered the basic aims and principles of dialectical materialism to be in harmony with rational scientific thought.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wood, Allen |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=212–3 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Mt Zion School cropped.jpg|thumb|Pupils and teacher at the Mt. Zion School in the Dominicker settlement of Holmes County, circa 1910 {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
The '''Dominickers''' are a small biracial or [[triracial]] ethnic group that was once centered in the [[Florida Panhandle]] county of [[Holmes County, Florida|Holmes]], in a corner of the southern part of the county west of the [[Choctawhatchee River]], near the town of [[Ponce de Leon, Florida|Ponce de Leon]]. The group was classified in 1950 as one of the "reputed Indian-White-Negro racial isolates of the Eastern United States" by the [[United States Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melungeon.org/index.cgi?&amp;CONTEXT=cat&amp;cat=10056 |title=Table of 1950 Federal Census findings on triracial groups, including Dominickers in Holmes County |accessdate=2006-09-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518143749/http://www.melungeon.org/index.cgi?&amp;CONTEXT=cat&amp;cat=10056 |archivedate=2006-05-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few facts are known about their origins, and little has been published about this group.

==First mention and origins==
The first known mention in print of the Dominickers' existence is an article in ''Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State'', published by the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in 1939. The article "Ponce de Leon" identifies the Dominickers as being descendants of the widow of a pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] plantation owner and one of her black slaves, by whom she had five children. (A separate oral tradition has it that the slave was the [[mulatto]] half-brother of the woman's deceased husband, but this has not been verified.)&lt;ref name="pineywoods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pineywoodshistory.com/documents.html|title=Documents page, ''Piney Woods History''|accessdate=2006-09-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022049/http://www.pineywoodshistory.com/documents.html|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unsigned article said that numerous descendants still lived in the area at the time of writing, and their children attended a [[racial segregation|segregated]] school (as required by Florida's [[Jim Crow laws]]). Dominickers were not accepted as social equals by the white community, but they did not associate with the black community, either. The Dominickers formed a small middle layer of Holmes County society separate from both whites and blacks (somewhat analogous to the status of [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creoles]] before the United States purchase of the Louisiana Territory).&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

According to the article, their appearance varied from very fair (white) to "Negroid" (black), even among the siblings of a single family. It also says the [[pejorative]] nickname "Dominickers" originated when a local man in a divorce case described his estranged wife as "black and white, like an old [[Dominiques|Dominicker chicken]]."  Another account says the description applied to the man with whom she was living.&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

==Further sources==
Two unpublished typescripts&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt; prepared for the [[Federal Writers' Project|FWP]] Florida guidebook, but not included in it, are now archived at the [[University of Florida]] library in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]]. They were likely sources or drafts of the published article.

These typescripts go into further detail than the published article on the appearance and behavior of the Dominickers, calling them as "sensitive, treacherous, and vindictive" and "pathetically ignorant." The men are described as "big and burly looking," known for their skill at breaking horses and making [[moonshine]] whiskey.  The women, however, are much less kindly described as "low in stature, fat, and shapeless," wearing loose clothing and going [[barefoot]] all the time.&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

One article notes that Dominickers were "treated with the same courtesy that a Negro receives—never served at a public fountain nor introduced to a white person."  A few Dominicker children were allowed to attend the white high school in [[Westville, Florida|Westville]], but they were "never allowed to actually graduate."&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

In contrast to these descriptions, photographs of known Dominickers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show that their appearance ranged from fair-complected to swarthy, but not "Negroid," as claimed; the women, especially, seem to have had an olive-skinned, wavy-haired "Mediterranean" look. One scholarly writer, a native of the area, states, "Most of these people are Spanish or Cuban in appearance."&lt;ref name="howell"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3087971|title=Ralph D. Howell, "Dominicker:  A Regional Racial Term" (1972)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native American ancestry==
The typescripts give five different accounts of the Dominickers' origins, which are said to include [[Yuchi|Euchee Indian]] ancestors, suggesting there were originally several distinct mixed-race families in the area in various combinations of white, black, and Indian blood, descendants of whom intermarried, all of them eventually being considered Dominickers.  One typescript says, "they are about three-fourths [[White (people)|white]] and one-eighth [[Negro]] and one-eighth [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]."&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

For example, one story that can be pieced together from the typescripts as well as from some more reliable published sources,&lt;ref name="mckinnon"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?a=51;sid=461e88087b9afbfb79102356ee744f1d;idno=WF00000103;c=fhp;cc=fhp;view=jpg;seq=76;size=s |title=John Love McKinnon (son of Col. Neill McKinnon), ''History of Walton County,'' pp. 62–66, 94–97 (1911)|accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  says that Jim Crow (no connection with the segregation laws called by that name), an "Indian prince," son of Chief [[Sam Story]] of the local [[Yuchi|Euchee Indians]], married Harriet, a beautiful, "more than two-thirds white" house servant belonging to a local white family; they produced a daughter, Eliza.  When the Euchees migrated to southern Florida in 1832, shortly after Sam Story's death, Harriet (who may have been her owner's daughter) and the baby stayed behind with the white family.  When Eliza grew up, she married a "[[high yellow|yellow boy]]" (mulatto) named Jim Harris, son of a slave belonging to another white family.  Their daughter, Lovey, eventually married another "yellow boy" and had a large family of good-looking children, who "married into another half-breed family."  It is also said that other Euchees besides Jim Crow left many  descendants (presumably mixed-race) in the area.&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

==Census records==
Federal censuses of [[Holmes County, Florida|Holmes]] and the adjacent counties of [[Walton County, Florida|Walton]] and [[Washington County, Florida|Washington]] dating back to 1850 list many Dominicker families and individuals, variously identified as [[White (people)|white]], [[mulatto]], and [[black (people)|black]] (even among members of the same family). Classifications for a given individual often changed from one census to the next, as they were dependent on the opinion of the census enumerator. The census records show that in the decades following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] many Dominickers married white spouses, and their children had even more white ancestry.

The 1950 federal census instructed enumerators to make note of local populations of mixed white, black, and Indian ancestry in the eastern United States. In [[Holmes County, Florida|Holmes County]], [[Florida]], and nowhere else, 60 Dominickers were so counted although they were designated as white on the census.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1956, a [[United States Public Health Service]] worker, who had tabulated the 1950 census findings, made a brief visit to the area and interviewed some white residents. He was unable to make contact with any Dominickers, said to number about 40 at that time.  His field notes indicate that at least one Dominicker claimed to be of Spanish and Indian descent. He also noted that "the term Dominicker is not acceptable to the group and is not used in their presence."&lt;ref name="pineywoods"/&gt;

==Dispersal and assimilation==
At some point in the 1960s, following the US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'', the black school in Ponce de Leon was closed, and students of color were integrated into the other local public schools. Some descendants of the Dominicker group still live in the area, but since World War II, many have scattered to other parts of the country. Those remaining in [[Holmes County, Florida|Holmes County]] and nearby localities have quietly assimilated into the white community, and there is no organized affiliation of Dominicker descendants.

'''Farida Jafar gizi Mammadova''' ({{lang-az| Fəridə Cəfər qızı Məmmədova}}) (born 8 August 1936, [[Shirvan (city)|Shirvan]]) is an [[Azerbaijan]]i historian who specialises in the history of ancient [[Caucasian Albania]].

She is the author of numerous research papers, articles and books on Azerbaijani ancient and medieval history. She lectures at the [[Baku State University]], Azerbaijan Pedagogical University, and is the head of the Department of Humanities in the [[Western University (Azerbaijan)|Western University]] in [[Baku]]. Farida Mammadova works at the Institute of History of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan]]. In her research, she is known to be a disciple of the late Azerbaijani historian and the former vice-president of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]] [[Ziya Bunyadov]].

Mammadova's area of focus has been the study of the development of [[Caucasian Albania]], its ethnic composition, political and social life, the development of [[Christianity]] in [[Caucasian Albania]], [[Church of Caucasian Albania]], arts and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.az/az/comembers/mamedovafrjr.htm Farida Mammadova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402142131/http://science.az/az/comembers/mamedovafrjr.htm |date=2012-04-02 }}. Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
Mammadova's theories have been criticized by foreign authors for the misinterpretation of historical sources and [[Historical revisionism|revisionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/albanskymif.html "Albanian Myth" (in Russian) / V.A. Shnirelman, "Voyni pamyati. Mifi, identichnost i politika v Zakavkazye", Moscow, Academkniga, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/in_depth/newsid_4670000/4670649.stm [[Thomas de Waal]], Black Garden, chapter "Urekavank", in Russian, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the critics of Mammadova's works is Russian historian V.A. Shnirelman, who dedicated a whole chapter in his book ''Wars of Memory'' to Mammadova's mistakes, misinterpretations and traced the influence of the [[anti-Armenian]] authors [[V.L. Velichko]] and [[Ziya Bunyadov]] to her theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/albanskymif.html "Albanian Myth" (in Russian) / V.A. Shnirelman, "Voyni pamyati. Mifi, identichnost i politika v Zakavkazye", Moscow, Academkniga, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas de Waal]], Mammadova's theories on the Albanians were formulated in such a way as "to separate the Armenians completely from the Caucasus." "She has placed Caucasian Albania on the territory of modern [[Republic of Armenia]]: all the territories, churches and monasteries in Republic of Armenia have been designated as Albanian." He describes Mammadova's theories as "an improved version of what became a very rough tool in Azerbaijan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/in_depth/newsid_4670000/4670649.stm [[Thomas de Waal]], Black Garden, chapter "Urekavank", in Russian, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her interviews Mammadova has made anti-Armenian statements, including:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And it is known that on whole planet exactly the Armenian people are distinguished by their absence of spiritual and other human values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.az/print/news/armenia/38422.html Фарида Мамедова: «Разрушив захоронение «Агадеде», армяне в очередной раз пытаются посягнуть на историю Азербайджана», Day.Az daily, January 06,  2006 (in Russian)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117040201/http://www.day.az/print/news/armenia/38422.html |date=November 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are only two nations with an identity but no state....The Jews and the Armenians. The difference is that the Jews created a state in their historical homeland; the Armenians created one not in their historical homeland.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, Thomas.

'''François Catrou''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa katʁu}}) (December 28, 1659 – October 12, 1737) was a [[France|French]] historian, translator, and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest.

==Life==
Catrou was born in Paris, the son of Mathurin Catrou, secretary to [[Louis XIV]]. During his college days a marked facility and grace in composition gave promise of his future literary success. At eighteen he entered the [[Society of Jesus]]. During his regular period of Jesuit probation and study his talents for preaching were discovered, and at the completion of his studies in 1690 he began his active career as a preacher, in which office he continued for ten years with remarkable success. In 1701 he founded the "[[Journal de Trévoux]]", and was an active member of its staff for twelve years. He died in Paris.

==Works==
While engaged in journalistic duties Catrou found time for historical research, and to his productions in this line his fame is chiefly due.

===''History of the Mogul Dynasty''===
The ''Histoire generale de l'empire du Mogul'' was published in five duodecimo volumes in 1715. The matter was drawn, in the main, from the memoirs of the Venetian traveller [[Niccolao Manucci]]. It was translated into Italian as "Istoria generale del Imperio del Mogul" by Domenico Occhi and published in Venice in 1751. An English translation, the "History of the Mogul Dynasty" was published in London in 1826 and again, in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;''Storia do Mogor or Mogul India 1653-1708 by Niccolao Manucci, Venetian''. Translated and with Introduction and Notes by [[William Irvine (historian)|William Irvine]]. In four vols. London: Murray 1907 (several Indian reprints). - The foreword contains a detailed description of Catrou's method of dealing with Manucci's text (pp.xvii-xxvi).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''History of Fanaticism in the Protestant Religion''===
Catrou's "Histoire du fanatisme dans la religion protestante" was a controversial work dealing principally with the [[Anabaptist]]s and the [[Quaker]]s. The best edition is that published in two duodecimo volumes in Paris in 1740.

===''Roman History''===
The "Histoire romaine", with geographical and critical notes, was published in twenty-one quarto volumes between the years of 1725 and 1737. It was edited a second time in 1737. The notes are from the pen of P. Rouillé, S.J. This gigantic work was translated into Italian by Fra Zannino Marsecco in Venice in 1730-37, and into English by R. Bundy, as ''The Roman History with Notes, done into English from the Original French of the Rev. Fathers Catrou and Rouillé'' in London in 1728-37, in six folio volumes. The French work was highly praised at the time for its deep research and solid reasoning, but its somewhat pompous style soon brought severe censure from the critics. Its appearance in an English dress gave occasion to some very bitter attacks; but, though censured, this work provided inspiration to British historian [[Nathaniel Hooke]], who in his ''Roman History'' drew freely from the text of Catrou and more freely from the critical notes of Rouillé.

===Translation of Virgil===
Catrou's translation of [[Virgil]] contained critical and historical notes. The translation is at all times free and not infrequently inaccurate. The notes and the accompanying life of Virgil manifest a thorough acquaintance with both poem and poet. Catrou's ''Virgil'' was a constant companion of the historian [[Edward Gibbon]] during his early studies. "I always consulted the most learned and ingenious commentators" he writes in [[Memoirs of My Life and Writings|his autobiography]]; "[[Torrentius]] and [[Dacier]] on Horace, and Catrou and [[Servius]] on Virgil".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">'''Gilla na Naemh Ua Duinn''' (1102 – 17 December 1160) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], [[historian]], and [[cleric]].

The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] describe him as:

"''lector of Inis-Clothrann, a [[wikt:paragon|paragon]] in history and poetry, and a good speaker, sent his spirit to his heavenly patrimony, amid a choir of angels, on the 17th of December, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.''"

Inis Clothran is an [[island]] located in the northern part of [[Lough Ree]], on the [[River Shannon]]. It contains the remains of a [[monastery]] of which Ua Duinn was [[lector]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71275">'''Homosexuality in ancient Rome''' often [[Societal attitudes toward homosexuality|differs markedly]] from the contemporary [[Western civilization|West]]. [[Latin]] lacks words that would precisely translate "[[homosexual]]" and "[[heterosexual]]".&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary dichotomy of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|ancient Roman sexuality]] was active/[[Dominance and submission|dominant]]/masculine and passive/submissive/feminine. Roman society was [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and the [[ingenui|freeborn]] male [[Roman citizenship|citizen]] possessed political liberty (''libertas'') and the right to rule both himself and his household (''[[paterfamilias|familia]]''). "Virtue" (''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'') was seen as an active quality through which a man (''vir'') defined himself. The conquest mentality and "cult of virility" shaped same-sex relations. Roman men were free to enjoy sex with other males without a perceived loss of masculinity or social status, as long as they took the dominant or penetrative role. Acceptable male partners were [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] and former slaves, [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and entertainers, whose lifestyle placed them in the nebulous social realm of ''[[infamia]]'', excluded from the normal protections accorded a citizen even if they were technically free. Although Roman men in general seem to have preferred youths between the ages of 12 and 20 as sexual partners, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minors]] were off limits at certain periods of Rome, though professional prostitutes and entertainers might remain sexually available well into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', passim; Elizabeth Manwell, "Gender and Masculinity," in ''A Companion to Catullus'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex relations among women are far less documented. Although [[Women in ancient Rome|Roman women]] of the upper classes were educated and are known to have both written poetry and corresponded with male relatives, very few fragments of anything that might have been written by women survived. Male writers took little interest in how women experienced sexuality in general.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} During the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and early [[Principate]], little is recorded of sexual relations among women, but better and more varied evidence, though scattered, exists for the later [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

During the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], a Roman citizen's political liberty (''libertas'') was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion, including both corporal punishment and sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326. See the statement preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12. 1 that " it was an injustice to bring force to bear against the body of those who are free" (''vim in corpus liberum non aecum ... adferri'').&lt;/ref&gt; Roman society was [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] (see ''[[paterfamilias]]''), and [[masculinity]] was premised on a capacity for governing oneself and others of lower status.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]]'', "valor" as that which made a man most fully a man, was among the active virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], "The Ambiguity of ''Virtus'' in Lucan's ''Civil War'' and Statius' ''Thebiad''," ''Arachnion'' 3; Andrew J.E. Bell, "Cicero and the Spectacle of Power," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 87 (1997), p. 9; Edwin S.

Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman ideals of masculinity were thus premised on taking an active role that was also, as Craig A. Williams has noted, "the prime directive of masculine sexual behavior for Romans".&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, scholars have tended to view expressions of Roman [[male sexuality]] in terms of a "penetrator-penetrated" [[Binary opposition|binary model]]; that is, the proper way for a Roman male to seek sexual gratification was to insert his penis into his partner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Langlands]], ''Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing himself to be penetrated threatened his liberty as a free citizen as well as his sexual integrity.&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion of how sexual activity defines the free, respectable citizen from the slave or "un-free" person, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|Master-slave relations in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was expected and socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender ''per se''. Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires with only slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]''. Gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another man's integrity. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's [[sex life]], indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in "low sensual pleasure" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homoerotic themes are introduced to [[Latin literature]] during a period of increasing [[Hellenization|Greek influence]] on [[Roman culture]] in the 2nd century BC.
[[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Greek cultural attitudes]] differed from those of the Romans primarily in idealizing ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' between freeborn male citizens of equal status, though usually with a difference of age (see "[[Pederasty in ancient Greece]]"). An attachment to a male outside the family, seen as a positive influence among the Greeks, within Roman society threatened the authority of the ''paterfamilias''.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. xi; Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Roman women were active in educating their sons and mingled with men socially, and women of the governing classes often continued to advise and influence their sons and husbands in political life, [[homosociality]] was not as pervasive in Rome as it had been in [[Classical Greece|Classical Athens]], where it is thought to have contributed to the particulars of pederastic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', pp. xi–xii; Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Imperial era, a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free males was associated with anxieties about the subordination of political liberty to the emperor, and led to an increase in executions and corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2006), p. 329. The lower classes (''humiliores'') were subject to harsher penalties than the elite (''honestiores'').&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual license and decadence under the empire was seen as a contributing factor and symptom of the loss of the ideals of physical integrity (''libertas'') under the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;This is a theme throughout Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homoerotic literature and art==
The [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] was among a circle of poets who made short, light [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic poems]] fashionable. One of his few surviving fragments is a poem of desire addressed to a male with a Greek name.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 120; Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevation of [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] and [[Ancient Greek art|art]] as models of expression promoted the celebration of homoeroticism as the mark of an urbane and sophisticated person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay MacMullen]], "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love," ''Historia'' 31.4 (1982), pp. 484–502.&lt;/ref&gt; No assumptions or generalizations should be made about any effect on [[sexual orientation]] or real-life behavior among the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Halperin, "The First Homosexuality?" in ''The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece '' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 242 and 263, with criticism of MacMullen.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nisos Euryalos Louvre LL450 n2.jpg|thumb|upright|Heroic portrayal of [[Nisus and Euryalus]] (1827) by [[Jean-Baptiste Roman]]: Vergil described their love as ''pius'' in keeping with Roman morality]]
"[[neoteric|New poetry]]" introduced at the end of the 2nd century included that of [[Gaius Valerius Catullus]], whose work include expressing desire for a freeborn youth explicitly named "Youth" (''Iuventius'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmina'' 24, 48, 81, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin name and freeborn status of the beloved subvert Roman tradition.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Catullus's contemporary [[Lucretius]] also recognizes the attraction of "boys"&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'' 4.1052–1056). See also [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[#Puer|pueri]]'', which can designate an acceptable submissive partner and not specifically age&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt;). Homoerotic themes occur throughout the works of [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|poets writing during the reign of Augustus]], including elegies by [[Tibullus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tibullus]], Book One, elegies 4, 8, and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propertius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]] 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; the second ''[[Eclogues|Eclogue]]'' of [[Vergil]], and several poems by [[Horace]]. In the ''[[Aeneid]],'' Vergil draws on the [[Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece|Greek tradition of pederasty in a military setting]] by portraying the love between [[Nisus and Euryalus]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 116–119.&lt;/ref&gt; whose military valor marks them as solidly Roman men (''viri'').&lt;ref&gt;Mark Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero: Coming of Age in Catullus and Vergil'' (University of Michigan Press, 1997), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Vergil describes their love as ''pius'', linking it to the supreme virtue of ''[[pietas]]'' as possessed by the hero [[Aeneas]] himself, and endorsing it as "honorable, dignified and connected to central Roman values".&lt;ref&gt;James Anderson Winn, ''The Poetry of War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Augustan period [[Ovid]], Rome's leading literary figure, was alone among Roman figures in proposing a radically new agenda focused on love between men and women: making love with a woman is more enjoyable, he says, because unlike the forms of same-sex behavior permissible within Roman culture, the pleasure is mutual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' 2.683–684; Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Ovid himself, however, did not claim exclusive heterosexuality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Judith P. Hallett|editor2= Marilyn Skinner|year=1997|title=Roman Sexualities|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he does include mythological treatments of homoeroticism in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;As at ''Metamorphoses'' 10.155ff.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Thomas Habinek]] has pointed out that the significance of Ovid's rupture of human erotics into categorical preferences has been obscured in the [[history of sexuality]] by a later heterosexual bias in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Habinek|Habinek]], "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," p. 31 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other Roman writers, however, expressed a bias in favor of males when sexual activity with males and females were compared, including [[Juvenal]], [[Plutarch]], [[Straton of Sardis|Strato]],&lt;ref&gt;{{title=In Bed with the Romans|author=Paul Chrystal|year=2017|publisher=Amberley Publishing|isbn=978-1445666730}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the poet [[Martial]], who often derided women as sexual partners and celebrated the charms of ''pueri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Potter2009|editor=Potter, David S. |title=A Companion to the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4ZmqsyC5kEC|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9918-6|page=335|chapter=Sexuality in the Roman Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; In literature of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], the ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Petronius]] is so permeated with the culture of male–male sex that in 18th-century European literary circles, his name became "a byword for homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Byron and Greek Love'' (London, 1998), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex, art, and everyday objects===
{{See also|Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum}}
Representations of male–male and female–female sex are less common in art of ancient Rome than are male–female sex acts. A [[frieze]] at the [[Suburban Baths (Pompeii)|Suburban Baths]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a series of sixteen sex scenes, including same-sex couples, and same-sex pairings as a part [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Group sex|group sex acts]].

[[File:Sexual scene on pompeian mural 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Threesome from the Suburban Baths in Pompeii, depicting a sexual scenario as described also by Catullus, ''Carmen'' 56]]
[[Threesome]]s in Roman art typically show two men penetrating a woman, but one of the Suburban scenes has one man entering a woman from the rear while he in turn receives anal sex from a man standing behind him. This scenario is described also by Catullus, ''Carmen'' 56, who considers it humorous.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.–A.D. 250'' (University of California Press, 1998, 2001),  p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The man in the center may be a ''[[#Cinaedus|cinaedus]]'', a male who liked to receive anal sex but who was also considered seductive to women.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', pp. 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foursome (group sex)|Foursomes]] also appear in Roman art, typically with two women and two men, sometimes in same-sex pairings.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male nudity|Roman attitudes toward male nudity]] differ from those of the ancient Greeks, who regarded idealized portrayals of the nude male as an expression of masculine excellence. The wearing of the [[toga]] marked a Roman man as a free citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative connotations of nudity include defeat in war, since captives were stripped, and slavery, since slaves for sale were often displayed naked.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amulettes phalliques gallo-romaines Musée Saint-Remi 120208.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|[[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] bronze examples of the ''[[fascinum]]'', a phallic [[amulet]] or charm]]
At the same time, the [[phallus]] was displayed ubiquitously in the form of the ''[[fascinum]]'', a magic charm thought to ward off malevolent forces; it became a customary decoration, found widely in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], especially in the form of [[wind chime]]s (''[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Pliny's Brassiere," in ''Roman Sexualities'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The outsized phallus of the god [[Priapus]] may originally have served an [[apotropaic]] purpose, but in art it is frequently laughter-provoking or grotesque.&lt;ref&gt;David Fredrick, ''The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenization, however, influenced the depiction of male nudity in Roman art, leading  to more complex signification of the male body shown nude, partially nude, or costumed in a [[muscle cuirass]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus'' (University of Michigan Press, 1988), pp. 239–240, 249–250 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warren Cup====
{{Main|Warren Cup}}
The Warren Cup is a piece of [[Symposium|convivial]] silver, usually dated to the time of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] (1st century AD), that depicts two scenes of male–male sex.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999) 21–52. John R. Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.–A.D. 250'' (University of California Press, 1998, 2001), p. 61, asserts that the Warren cup is valuable for art history and as a document of Roman sexuality precisely because of its "relatively secure date."&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Pollini, "The Warren Cup," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; that the two sides of this cup represent the duality of pederastic tradition at Rome, the Greek in contrast to the Roman. On the "Greek" side, a bearded, mature man is penetrating a young but muscularly developed male in a rear-entry position. The young man, probably meant to be 17 or 18, holds on to a sexual apparatus for maintaining an otherwise awkward or uncomfortable sexual position. A child-slave watches the scene furtively through a door ajar. The "Roman" side of the cup shows a ''[[#Puer delicatus|puer delicatus]]'', age 12 to 13, held for intercourse in the arms of an older male, clean-shaven and fit. The bearded pederast may be Greek, with a partner who participates more freely and with a look of pleasure. His counterpart, who has a more severe haircut, appears to be Roman, and thus uses a slave boy; the myrtle wreath he wears symbolizes his role as an "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexual conquest and imperialism|erotic conqueror]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pollini, "Warren Cup," pp. 35–37, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The cup may have been designed as a [[conversation piece]] to provoke the kind of dialogue on ideals of love and sex that took place at a Greek [[symposium]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollini, "Warren Cup," p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquity of the Warren Cup has been challenged, and it may instead represent perceptions of Greco-Roman homosexuality at the time of its manufacture, possibly the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Marabini Moevs, “Per una storia del gusto: riconsiderazioni sul Calice Warren,” Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali ''Bollettino d’Arte'' 146 (Oct.–Dec. 2008) 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male–male sex==

===Roles===
[[Image:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|The [[Warren Cup]], portraying a mature bearded man and a youth on its "Greek" side]]
A man or boy who took the "receptive" role in sex was variously called ''cinaedus'', ''pathicus'', ''[[exoletus]]'', ''concubinus'' (male concubine), ''spintria'' ("analist"), ''puer'' ("boy"), ''pullus'' ("chick"), ''pusio'', ''delicatus'' (especially in the phrase ''puer delicatus'', "exquisite" or "dainty boy"), ''mollis'' ("soft", used more generally as an aesthetic quality counter to aggressive masculinity), ''tener'' ("delicate"), ''debilis'' ("weak" or "disabled"), ''effeminatus'', ''discinctus'' ("loose-belted"), ''pisciculi,'' ''spinthriae,'' and ''morbosus'' ("sick"). As Amy Richlin has noted, "'[[gay]]' is not exact, 'penetrated' is not self-defined, '[[Top, bottom and versatile|passive]]' misleadingly connotes inaction" in translating this group of words into English.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some terms, such as ''exoletus'', specifically refer to an adult; Romans who were socially marked as "masculine" did not confine their same-sex penetration of male prostitutes or slaves to those who were "boys" under the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 85 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some older men may have at times preferred the passive role. Martial describes, for example, the case of an older man who played the passive role and let a younger slave occupy the active role.&lt;ref&gt;Martial, [[s:la:Epigrammaton liber III#LXXI|3.71]].&lt;/ref&gt; An adult male's desire to be penetrated was considered a sickness (''morbus''); the desire to penetrate a handsome youth was thought normal.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--the following list is alphabetical--&gt;

====''Cinaedus''====
''Cinaedus'' is a derogatory word denoting a male who was gender-deviant; his choice of sex acts, or preference in sexual partner, was secondary to his perceived deficiencies as a "man" (''vir'').&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Catullus directs the slur ''cinaedus'' at his friend Furius in his notoriously obscene [[Catullus 16|''Carmen'' 16]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 181ff. and 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in some contexts ''cinaedus'' may denote an anally passive man&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most frequent word for a male who allowed himself to be penetrated anally,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; a man called ''cinaedus'' might also have sex with and be considered highly attractive to women.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cinaedus'' is not equivalent to the English vulgarism "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]",&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; except that both words can be used to deride a male considered deficient in manhood or with androgynous characteristics whom women may find sexually alluring.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', p. 223, compares ''cinaedus'' to "faggot" in the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", in which a singer referred to as "that little faggot with the earring and the make-up" also "gets his money for nothing and his chicks for free."&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing, use of cosmetics, and mannerisms of a ''cinaedus'' [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|marked him as effeminate]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; but the same effeminacy that Roman men might find alluring in a ''puer'' became unattractive in the physically mature male.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cinaedus'' thus represented the absence of what Romans considered true manhood, and the word is virtually untranslatable into English.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 55, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, a ''cinaedus'' (Greek ''kinaidos'') was a professional dancer, characterized as non-Roman or "Eastern"; the word itself may come from a language of [[Asia Minor]]. His performance featured [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tambourine]]-playing and movements of the buttocks that suggested anal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Concubinus''====
Some Roman men kept a male concubine (''concubinus'', "one who lies with; a bed-mate") before they married a woman. [[Eva Cantarella]] has described this form of concubinage as "a stable sexual relationship, not exclusive but privileged".&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the hierarchy of household slaves, the ''concubinus'' seems to have been regarded as holding a special or elevated status that was threatened by the introduction of a wife. In a [[epithalamium|wedding hymn]], Catullus&lt;ref&gt;Catullus, ''Carmen'' 61, lines 119–143.&lt;/ref&gt; portrays the groom's ''concubinus'' as anxious about his future and fearful of abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," pp. 218, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; His long hair will be cut, and he will have to resort to the female slaves for sexual gratification—indicating that he is expected to transition from being a receptive sex object to one who performs penetrative sex.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 534; Ronnie Ancona, "(Un)Constrained Male Desire: An Intertextual Reading of Horace ''Odes'' 2.8 and Catullus Poem 61," in ''Gendered Dynamics in Latin Love Poetry'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 47; Mark Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero: Coming of Age in Catullus and Vergil'' (University of Michigan Press, 1997), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''concubinus'' might father children with women of the household, not excluding the wife (at least in [[invective]]).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 229. note 260: Martial 6.39.12-4: "''quartus cinaeda fronte, candido voltu / ex concubino natus est tibi Lygdo: / percide, si vis, filium: nefas non est.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The feelings and situation of the ''concubinus'' are treated as significant enough to occupy five stanzas of Catullus's wedding poem. He plays an active role in the ceremonies, distributing the traditional nuts that boys threw (rather like [[Ask Ann Landers#Wedding rice and birds|rice or birdseed]] in the modern Western tradition).&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', pp. 125–126; Robinson Ellis, ''A Commentary on Catullus'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 181; Petrini, ''The Child and the Hero'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship with a ''concubinus'' might be discreet or more open: male concubines sometimes attended [[Symposium|dinner parties]] with the man whose companion they were.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' 1.2.8, who disapproves of consorting with either ''concubini'' or "girlfriends" (''amicae'') in front of one's children. [[Ramsey MacMullen]], "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love," ''Historia'' 31 (1982), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martial]] even suggests that a prized ''concubinus'' might pass from father to son as an especially coveted inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 24, citing Martial 8.44.16-7: ''tuoque tristis filius, velis nolis, cum concubino nocte dormiet prima.'' ("''and your mourning son, whether you wish it or not, will lie first night sleep with your favourite''")&lt;/ref&gt; A military officer on campaign might be accompanied by a ''concubinus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caesarian Corpus]], ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi|The Spanish War]]'' 33; MacMullen, "Roman Attitudes to Greek Love," p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[catamite]] or ''[[#Puer delicatus|puer delicatus]]'', the role of the concubine was regularly compared to that of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince abducted by [[Jove]] (Greek [[Zeus]]) to serve as his [[cupbearer]].&lt;ref&gt;"They use the word ''Catamitus'' for Ganymede, who was the ''concubinus'' of Jove," according to the [[lexicographer]] [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] (38.22, as cited by Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 332, note 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''concubina'', a female concubine who might be free, held a protected legal status under [[Roman law]], but the ''concubinus'' did not, since he was typically a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pathicus''====
''Pathicus'' was a "blunt" word for a male who was penetrated sexually. It derived from the unattested Greek adjective ''pathikos'', from the verb ''paskhein'', equivalent to the Latin [[deponent verb|deponent]] ''patior, pati, passus'', "undergo, submit to, endure, suffer".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "passive" derives from the Latin ''passus''.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pathicus'' and ''cinaedus'' are often not distinguished in usage by Latin writers, but ''cinaedus'' may be a more general term for a male not in conformity with the role of ''vir'', a "real man", while ''pathicus'' specifically denotes an adult male who takes the sexually receptive role.&lt;ref&gt;Holt N. Parker, "The Teratogenic Grid," in ''Roman Sexualities'', p. 56; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''pathicus'' was not a "homosexual" as such. His sexuality was not defined by the gender of the person using him as a receptacle for sex, but rather his desire to be so used. Because in Roman culture a man who penetrates another adult male almost always expresses contempt or revenge, the ''pathicus'' might be seen as more akin to the sexual [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] in his experience of pleasure. He might be penetrated orally or anally by a man or by a woman with a [[dildo]], but showed no desire for penetrating nor having his own penis stimulated. He might also be dominated by a woman who compels him to perform [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Cunnilingus and fellatio|cunnilingus]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, "The Teratogenic Grid," p. 57, citing Martial 5.61 and 4.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Puer''====
[[File:Roman_coin_celebrating_pederasty.jpg|right|300px|Coin depicting oral sex between a man and a youth]]
In the discourse of sexuality, ''puer'' ("boy") was a role as well as an age group.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''puer'' and the feminine equivalent ''puella'', "girl", could refer to a man's sexual partner, regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; As an age designation, the freeborn ''puer'' made the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|transition from childhood]] at around age 14, when he assumed the [[toga virilis|"toga of manhood"]], but he was 17 or 18 before he began to take part in public life.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; A slave would never be considered a ''vir'', a "real man"; he would be called ''puer'', "boy", throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 536; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pueri'' might be "functionally interchangeable" with women as receptacles for sex,&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt; but freeborn male minors were strictly off-limits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], "''Stuprum'': Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome," in ''Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; To accuse a Roman man of being someone's "boy" was an insult that impugned his manhood, particularly in the political arena.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt; The aging ''cinaedus'' or an anally passive man might wish to present himself as a ''puer''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Puer delicatus''====
[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n2.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|"Roman" side of the Warren Cup, with the wreathed "erotic conqueror" and his ''puer delicatus'' ("dainty boy")&lt;ref&gt;As analyzed by John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999) 21–52.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''puer delicatus'' was an "exquisite" or "dainty" child-slave chosen by his master for his beauty as a "[[Age disparity in sexual relationships|boy toy]]",&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Manwell, "Gender and Masculinity," in ''A Companion to Catullus'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as ''deliciae'' ("sweets" or "delights").&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Galán Vioque, ''Martial, Book VII: A Commentary'' (Brill, 2002), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the freeborn Greek ''[[eromenos]]'' ("beloved"), who was protected by social custom, the Roman ''delicatus'' was in a physically and morally vulnerable position.&lt;ref&gt;Manwell, "Gender and Masculinity," p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The "coercive and exploitative" relationship between the Roman master and the ''delicatus'', who might be prepubescent, can be characterized as [[pedophilia|pedophilic]], in contrast to Greek ''[[Pederasty in ancient Greece|paiderasteia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beert C. Verstraete and Vernon Provencal, introduction to ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The boy was sometimes [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Castration and circumcision|castrated]] in an effort to preserve his youthful qualities; the emperor [[Nero]] had a ''puer delicatus'' named [[Sporus]], whom he castrated and married.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Vout]], ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 136 (for Sporus in [[Alexander Pope]]'s poem "[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]", see [[Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pueri delicati'' might be idealized in poetry. In the erotic elegies of [[Tibullus]], the ''delicatus'' Marathus wears lavish and expensive clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Keith, "Sartorial Elegance and Poetic Finesse in the Sulpician Corpus," in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty of the ''delicatus'' was measured by [[Apollo]]nian standards, especially in regard to his long hair, which was supposed to be wavy, fair, and scented with perfume.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Navarro Antolín, ''Lygdamus. Corpus Tibullianum III.1–6: Lygdami Elegiarum Liber'' (Brill, 1996), pp. 304–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological type of the ''delicatus'' was represented by [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], the [[Troy|Trojan]] youth abducted by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] (Greek [[Zeus]]) to be his divine companion and cupbearer.&lt;ref&gt;Vioque, ''Martial, Book VII'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Satyricon]]'', the tastelessly wealthy freedman [[Trimalchio]] says that as a child-slave he had been a ''puer delicatus'' servicing both the master and the mistress of the household.&lt;ref&gt;William Fitzgerald, ''Slavery and the Roman Literary Imagination'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pullus''====
''Pullus'' was a term for a young animal, and particularly a [[chicken|chick]]. It was an affectionate word&lt;ref&gt;As at [[Horace]], ''Satire'' 1.3.45 and [[Suetonius]], ''Life of Caligula'' 13, as noted by Dorota M. Dutsch, ''Feminine Discourse in Roman Comedy: On Echoes and Voices'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 55. See also [[Plautus]], ''Poenulus'' 1292, as noted by Richard P. Saller, "The Social Dynamics of Consent to Marriage and Sexual Relations: The Evidence of Roman Comedy," in ''Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies'' (Dumbarton Oaks, 1993), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally used for a boy (''puer'')&lt;ref&gt;The words ''pullus'' and ''puer'' may derive from the same Indo-European root; see Martin Huld, entry on "child," ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; who was loved by someone "in an obscene sense".

The [[lexicographer]] [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] provides a definition and illustrates with a comic anecdote. [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus]], a [[Roman consul|consul]] in 116 BC and later a [[Roman censor|censor]] known for his moral severity, earned his ''[[cognomen]]'' meaning "[[Ivory]]" (the modern equivalent might be "[[Porcelain]]") because of his fair good looks (''candor''). Eburnus was said to have been struck by lightning on his buttocks, perhaps a reference to a [[birthmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Richlin]],  ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; It was joked that he was marked as "[[Jove]]'s chick" (''pullus Iovis''), since the characteristic instrument of the king of the gods was the lightning bolt&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] p. 285 in the 1997 [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana|Teubner]] edition of Lindsay; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 17; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquité'' (Jérôme Millon, 2003 reprint, originally published 1883), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also the relation of Jove's cupbearer Ganymede to "[[catamite]]"). Although the sexual inviolability of underage male citizens is usually emphasized, this anecdote is among the evidence that even the most well-born youths might go through a phase in which they could be viewed as "sex objects".&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps tellingly,&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 289, finds Eburnus's reputation as "Jove's chick" and his later excessive severity against the ''impudicitia'' of his son to be "thought-provoking".&lt;/ref&gt; this same member of the illustrious [[Fabia (gens)|Fabius family]] ended his life in exile, as punishment for killing his own son for ''[[#Impudicitia|impudicitia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Pro Balbo'' 28; [[Valerius Maximus]] 6.1.5–6; Pseudo-Quintilian, ''Decl.'' 3.17; [[Orosius]] 5.16.8; [[T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, p. 549;  Gordon P. Kelly, ''A History of Exile in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 172–173; Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th-century [[Gallo-Roman]] poet [[Ausonius]] records the word ''pullipremo'', "chick-squeezer", which he says was used by the early satirist [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Sexuality'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pusio''====
''Pusio'' is etymologically related to ''puer,'' and means "boy, lad". It often had a distinctly sexual or sexually demeaning connotation.&lt;ref&gt;As at [[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' 9.7; [[Cicero]], ''Pro Caelio'' 36 (in reference to his personal enemy [[Clodius Pulcher]]); Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982), pp. 191–192; Katherine A. Geffcken, ''Comedy in the Pro Caelio'' (Bolchazy-Carducci, 1995), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juvenal]] indicates the ''pusio'' was more desirable than women because he was less quarrelsome and would not demand gifts from his lover.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 6.36–37; Erik Gunderson, "The Libidinal Rhetoric of Satire," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Roman Satire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pusio'' was also used as a [[personal name]] (''[[cognomen]]'').

====''Scultimidonus''====
''Scultimidonus'' ("asshole-bestower")&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; was rare and "florid" slang&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; that appears in a fragment from the early Roman satirist [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]].&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[gloss (annotation)|glossed]]&lt;ref&gt;Glossarium codicis Vatinici, ''[[Corpus Glossarum Latinarum]]'' IV p. xviii; see Georg Götz, ''Rheinisches Museum'' 40 (1885), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; as "Those who bestow for free their ''scultima'', that is, their anal orifice, which is called the ''scultima'' as if from the inner parts of whores" (''scortorum intima'').&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Impudicitia''===
The abstract noun ''impudicitia'' (adjective ''impudicus'') was the negation of ''[[pudicitia]]'', "sexual morality, chastity". As a characteristic of males, it often implies the willingness to be penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;RIchlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing was an expression of male ''impudicitia''.&lt;ref&gt;RIchlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', pp. 92, 98, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impudicitia'' might be associated with behaviors in young men who retained a degree of boyish attractiveness but were old enough to be expected to behave according to masculine norms. [[Julius Caesar]] was accused of bringing the notoriety of ''infamia'' upon himself, both when he was about 19, for taking the passive role in an affair with [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|King Nicomedes of Bithynia]], and later for many adulterous affairs with women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of the Divine Julius'' 52.3; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Elder]] noted that "''impudicita'' is a crime for the freeborn, a necessity in a slave, a duty for the freedman":&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; male–male sex in Rome asserted the power of the citizen over slaves, confirming his masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subculture===
Latin had such a wealth of words for men outside the masculine norm that some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Primarily Amy Richlin, as in "Not before Homosexuality."&lt;/ref&gt; argue for the existence of a homosexual [[subculture]] at Rome; that is, although the noun "homosexual" has no straightforward equivalent in Latin, literary sources reveal a pattern of behaviors among a minority of free men that indicate same-sex preference or orientation. [[Plautus]] mentions a street known for male prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Curculio'' 482-84&lt;/ref&gt; Public baths are also referred to as a place to find sexual partners. [[Juvenal]] states that such men scratched their heads with a finger to identify themselves.

[[Apuleius]] indicates that ''cinaedi'' might form social alliances for mutual enjoyment, such as hosting dinner parties. In his novel ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', he describes one group who jointly purchased and shared a ''[[#Concubinus|concubinus]]''. On one occasion, they invited a "well-endowed" young [[wikt:hick|hick]] (''rusticanus iuvenis'') to their party, and took turns performing oral sex on him.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, primarily those who argue from the perspective of "[[Social constructionism|cultural constructionism]]", maintain that there is not an identifiable social group of males who would have self-identified as "homosexual" as a community.&lt;ref&gt;As summarized by John R. Clarke, "Representation of the ''Cinaedus'' in Roman Art: Evidence of 'Gay' Subculture," in ''Same-sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage between males===
Although in general the Romans regarded [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Marital sex|marriage as a male–female union]] for the purpose of producing children, a few scholars believe that in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating [[Marriage in ancient Rome|traditional marriage rites]] in the presence of friends. male–male weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the feelings of the participants are not recorded. Both Martial and Juvenal refer to marriage between males as something that occurs not infrequently, although they disapprove of it.&lt;ref&gt;Martial 1.24 and 12.42; Juvenal 2.117–42. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 28, 280; Karen K. Hersh, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 36; Caroline Vout, ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 151ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman law]] did not recognize marriage between males, but one of the grounds for disapproval expressed in Juvenal's satire is that celebrating the rites would lead to expectations for such marriages to be registered officially.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; As the empire was becoming Christianized in the 4th century, legal prohibitions against marriage between males began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various ancient sources state that the emperor [[Nero]] celebrated two public weddings with men, once taking the role of the bride (with a [[freedman]] [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]]), and once the groom (with [[Sporus]]); there may have been a third in which he was the bride.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], [[Tacitus]], [[Dio Cassius]], and [[Aurelius Victor]] are the sources cited by Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonies included traditional elements such as a [[dowry]] and the wearing of the Roman bridal veil.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 3rd century AD, the emperor [[Elagabalus]] is reported to have been the bride in a wedding to his male partner. Other mature men at his court had husbands, or said they had husbands in imitation of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 278–279, citing Dio Cassius and [[Aelius Lampridius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sources are in general hostile, [[Dio Cassius]] implies that Nero's stage performances were regarded as more scandalous than his marriages to men.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 63.22.4; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference in Latin literature to a marriage between males occurs in the ''[[Philippicae|Philippics]]'' of [[Cicero]], who insulted [[Mark Antony]] for being a slut in his youth until [[Gaius Scribonius Curio|Curio]] "established you in a fixed and stable marriage (''matrimonium''), as if he had given you a ''[[stola]]''", the traditional garment of a married woman.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phillippics'' 2.44, as quoted by Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cicero's sexual implications are clear, the point of the passage is to cast Antony in the submissive role in the relationship and to impugn his manhood in various ways; there is no reason to think that actual marriage rites were performed.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male–male rape===
[[Roman law]] addressed the rape of a male citizen as early as the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" (''famosus,'' related to ''infamis'', and ''suspiciosus)'' had the same right as other free men not to have his body subjected to forced sex.&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in a fragment of the speech ''De Re Floria'' by [[Cato the Elder]] (frg. 57 Jordan = [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12.7), as noted and discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lex Julia de vi publica'',&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 48.6.3.4 and 48.6.5.2.&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in the early 3rd century AD but probably dating from the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of Julius Caesar, defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 562–563. See also ''Digest'' 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who had been raped were exempt from the loss of legal or social standing suffered by those who submitted their bodies to use for the pleasure of others; a male prostitute or entertainer was ''infamis'' and excluded from the legal protections extended to citizens in good standing.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 558–561.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of law, a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slave]] could not be raped; he was considered property and not [[person (law)|legally a person]]. The slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', pp. 99, 103; McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fears of mass rape following a military defeat extended equally to male and female potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the jurist [[Sextus Pomponius|Pomponius]], "whatever man has been raped by the force of robbers or the enemy in wartime" ought to bear no stigma.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 3.1.1.6, as noted by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of one man to subject another to anal or oral rape (''[[irrumatio]]'') is a theme of invective poetry, most notably in Catullus's notorious [[Catullus 16|''Carmen'' 16]],&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus'', pp. 27–28, 43 (on Martial), 58, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a form of masculine braggadocio.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 20; Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'', p. 12; Amy Richlin, "The Meaning of ''irrumare'' in Catullus and Martial," ''Classical Philology'' 76.1 (1981) 40–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Rape was one of the traditional punishments inflicted on a male adulterer by the wronged husband,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 27, 76 (with an example from [[Martial]] 2.60.2.&lt;/ref&gt; though perhaps more in revenge fantasy than in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a collection of twelve anecdotes dealing with assaults on chastity, the historian [[Valerius Maximus]] features male victims in equal number to female.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] 6.1; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; In a "[[mock trial]]" case described by [[Seneca the Elder|the elder Seneca]], an ''adulescens'' (a man young enough not to have begun his formal career) was gang-raped by ten of his peers; although the case is hypothetical, Seneca assumes that the law permitted the successful prosecution of the rapists.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothetical case imagines the extremity to which a rape victim might be driven: the freeborn male (''[[ingenui|ingenuus]]'') who was raped commits suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''Institutio oratoria'' 4.2.69–71; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans considered the rape of an ''ingenuus'' to be among the worst crimes that could be committed, along with [[parricide]], the rape of a female virgin, and robbing a [[Roman temple|temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 565, citing the same passage by Quintilian.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex relations in the military===
The Roman soldier, like any free and respectable Roman male of status, was expected to show self-discipline in matters of sex. [[Augustus]] (reigned 27 BC – 14&amp;nbsp;AD) even prohibited soldiers from marrying, a ban that remained in force for the Imperial army for nearly two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Men of the governing classes, who would have been officers above the rank of [[centurion]], were exempt. Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 144; Sara Elise Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers (13 B.C.–A.D. 235): Law and Family in the Imperial Army'' (Brill, 2001), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of sexual gratification available to soldiers were prostitutes of any gender, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|male slaves]], [[war rape]], and same-sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi|Bellum Hispaniense]]'', about [[Caesar's civil war]] on the front in [[Roman Spain]], mentions an officer who has a male concubine (''concubinus'') on [[military campaign|campaign]]. Sex among fellow soldiers, however, violated the Roman decorum against intercourse with another freeborn male. A soldier maintained his masculinity by not allowing his body to be used for sexual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare, rape symbolized defeat, a motive for the soldier not to make his body sexually vulnerable in general.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 94. See section above on [[#male–male rape|male rape]]: Roman law recognized that a soldier might be raped by the enemy, and specified that a man raped in war should not suffer the loss of social standing that an ''infamis'' did when willingly undergoing penetration; ''Digest'' 3.1.1.6, as discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Republic, homosexual behavior among fellow soldiers was subject to harsh penalties, including death,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; as a violation of [[military discipline]]. [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) reports that the punishment for a soldier who willingly submitted to penetration was the ''[[fustuarium]]'', clubbing to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html#37 6.37.9] (translated as [[bastinado]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman historians record cautionary tales of officers who abuse their authority to coerce sex from their soldiers, and then suffer dire consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', pp. 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest officers, who still might retain some of the adolescent attraction that Romans favored in male–male relations, were advised to beef up their masculine qualities by not wearing perfume, nor trimming nostril and underarm hair.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', p. 97, citing among other examples Juvenal, ''Satire'' 14.194–195.&lt;/ref&gt; An incident related by [[Plutarch]] in his biography of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] illustrates the soldier's right to maintain his sexual integrity despite pressure from his superiors. A good-looking young recruit named [[Trial of Trebonius|Trebonius]]&lt;ref&gt;The name is given elsewhere as Plotius.&lt;/ref&gt; had been [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] over a period of time by his superior officer, who happened to be Marius's nephew, Gaius Luscius. One night, after having fended off unwanted advances on numerous occasions, Trebonius was summoned to Luscius's tent. Unable to disobey the command of his superior, he found himself the object of a sexual assault and drew his sword, killing Luscius. A conviction for killing an officer typically resulted in execution. When brought to trial, he was able to produce witnesses to show that he had repeatedly had to fend off Luscius, and "had never prostituted his body to anyone, despite offers of expensive gifts". Marius not only acquitted Trebonius in the killing of his kinsman, but gave him a [[Roman military decorations and punishments#Crowns|crown for bravery]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Marius'' 14.4–8; see also Valerius Maximus 6.1.12; Cicero, ''Pro Milone'' 9, in Dillon and Garland, ''Ancient Rome'', p. 380; and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 16.4. Discussion by Phang, ''Roman Military Service'', pp. 93–94, and ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 281; Cantarella, ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'', pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex acts===
In addition to repeatedly described anal intercourse, oral sex was common. A graffito from [[Pompeii]] is unambiguous: "Secundus is a fellator of rare ability" (''Secundus felator rarus'').&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 4, 9027; translation from Hubbard, ''Homosexuality'', 423&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to ancient Greece, a large penis was a major element in attractiveness. [[Petronius]] describes a man with a large penis in a public bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Petronius: ''Satyricon''&lt;/ref&gt;  Several emperors are reported in a negative light for surrounding themselves with men with large sexual organs.&lt;ref&gt;Aelius Lampridius: [[Historia Augusta|Scripta Historia Augusta]], Commodus, 10.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] poet [[Ausonius]] (4th century AD) makes a joke about a male threesome that depends on imagining the configurations of group sex:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Three men in bed together: two are sinning,&lt;ref&gt;The Latin joke is hard to translate: Ausonius says that two men are committing  ''[[stuprum]]'', a sex crime; "sin" is generally a Christian concept, but since Ausonius was at least nominally a Christian, "sin" may capture the intention of the wordplay.&lt;/ref&gt; two are sinned against."&lt;br /&gt;"Doesn't that make four men?"&lt;br /&gt;"You're mistaken: the man on either end is implicated once, but the one in the middle does double duty."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ausonius]], ''Epigram'' 43 Green (39); Matthew Kuefler, ''The Manly Eunuch: Masculinity, Gender Ambiguity, and Christian Ideology in Late Antiquity'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, a 'train' is being alluded to: the first man penetrates the second, who in turn penetrates the third. The first two are "sinning", while the last two are being "sinned against".

==Female–female sex==
{{See also|History of lesbianism|Tribadism}}
[[File:Pompeii - Terme Suburbane - Apodyterium - Scene V.jpg|thumb|Female couple from a series of erotic paintings at the Suburban Baths, Pompeii]]
References to sex between women are infrequent in the Roman literature of the Republic and early [[Principate]]. Ovid finds it "a desire known to no one, freakish, novel ... among all animals no female is seized by desire for female".&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 9.727, 733–4, as cited by Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Roman Imperial era, sources for same-sex relations among women are more abundant, in the form of love spells, medical writing, texts on astrology and the interpretation of dreams, and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernadette Brooten|Bernadette J. Brooten]], ''Love between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism'' (University of Chicago Press, 1996), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A graffito from Pompeii expresses the desire of one woman for another:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I wish I could hold to my neck and embrace the little arms, and bear kisses on the tender lips. Go on, doll, and trust your joys to the winds; believe me, light is the nature of men.&lt;ref&gt;The Latin indicates that the ''I'' is of [[grammatical gender|feminine gender]]; ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 4.5296, as cited by Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Greek words for a woman who prefers sex with another woman include ''hetairistria'' (compare ''[[hetaira]]'', "courtesan" or "companion"), ''tribas'' (plural ''tribades''), and ''Lesbia''; Latin words include the [[loanword]] ''tribas'', ''fricatrix'' ("she who rubs"), and ''[[virago]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brooten, ''Love between Women,'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; An early reference to same-sex relations among women is found in the Roman-era Greek writer [[Lucian]] (2nd century CE): "They say there are women like that in Lesbos, masculine-looking, but they don't want to give it up for men. Instead, they consort with women, just like men."&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Dialogues of the Courtesans'' 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Romans thought a sex act required an active or dominant partner who was "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallic]]", male writers imagined that in female–female sex one of the women would use a [[dildo]] or have an exceptionally large [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female genitals|clitoris]] for penetration, and that she would be the one experiencing pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Walters,  "Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought," pp. 30–31, and Pamela Gordon, "The Lover's Voice in ''Heroides'' 15: Or, Why Is Sappho a Man?," p. 283, both in ''Roman Sexualities''; John R. Clarke, "Look Who's Laughing at Sex: Men and Women Viewers in the ''Apodyterium'' of the Suburban Baths at Pompeii," both in ''The Roman Gaze'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Dildos are rarely mentioned in Roman sources, but were a popular comic item in Classical Greek literature and art.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one known depiction of a woman penetrating another woman in Roman art, whereas women using dildos is common in [[Greek vase painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana M. Swancutt, "''Still'' before Sexuality: 'Greek' Androgyny, the Roman Imperial Politics of Masculinity and the Roman Invention of the ''tribas''," in ''Mapping Gender in Ancient Religious Discourses'' (Brill, 2007), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial describes women acting sexually actively with other women as having outsized sexual appetites and performing penetrative sex on both women and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Martial 1.90 and 7.67, 50; Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," p. 347; John R. Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art 100 B.C.–A.D. 250'' (University of California Press, 1998, 2001), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial portrayals of women who sodomize boys, drink and eat like men, and engage in vigorous physical regimens may reflect cultural anxieties about the growing independence of Roman women.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may also simply describe a common behavior that is experienced even in Western culture today.

==Gender presentation==

[[File:Mosaico Trabajos Hércules (M.A.N. Madrid) 13.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Omphale cross-dressed (mosaic from [[Roman Spain]], 3rd century AD)]]

Cross-dressing appears in Roman literature and art in various ways to mark the uncertainties and ambiguities of gender:
* as political invective, when a politician is accused of dressing seductively or effeminately;
* as a mythological [[trope (literature)|trope]], as in the story of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] exchanging roles and attire;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid adduces the story of Hercules and Omphale as an explanation for the ritual nudity of the [[Lupercalia]]; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male nudity|"Male nudity in ancient Rome"]] and Richard J. King, ''Desiring Rome: Male Subjectivity and Reading Ovid's Fasti'' (Ohio State University Press, 2006), pp. 185,  195, 200, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
* as a form of religious [[investiture]], as for the priesthood of the [[Galli]];
* and rarely or ambiguously as [[transvestic fetishism]].

A section of the ''Digest'' by [[Ulpian]] categorizes [[Clothing in ancient Rome|Roman clothing]] on the basis of who may appropriately wear it: ''vestimenta virilia'', "men's clothing", is defined as the attire of the ''paterfamilias'', "head of household"; ''puerilia'' is clothing that serves no purpose other than to mark its wearer as a "child" or minor; ''muliebria'' are the garments that characterize a ''materfamilias''; ''communia'', those that are "common", that is, worn by either sex; and ''familiarica'', clothing for the ''familia'', the subordinates in a household, including the staff and slaves. A man who wore women's clothes, Ulpian notes, would risk making himself the object of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 34.2.23.2, as cited by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Female prostitutes were the only women in ancient Rome who wore the distinctively masculine toga. The wearing of the toga may signal that prostitutes were outside the normal social and legal category of "woman".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions," p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment from the playwright [[Lucius Accius|Accius]] (170–86&amp;nbsp;BC) seems to refer to a father who secretly wore "virgin's finery".&lt;ref&gt;''Cum virginali mundo clam pater'': Kelly Olson, "The Appearance of the Young Roman Girl," in ''Roman Dress and the Fabrics of Roman Culture'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; An instance of [[transvestism]] is noted in a legal case, in which "a certain senator accustomed to wear women's evening clothes" was disposing of the garments in his will.&lt;ref&gt;''Digest'' 34.2.33, as cited by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; In the "[[mock trial]]" exercise presented by [[Seneca the Elder|the elder Seneca]],&lt;ref&gt;See above under "male–male rape."&lt;/ref&gt; the young man (''adulescens'') was gang-raped while wearing women's clothes in public, but his attire is explained as his acting on a dare by his friends, not as a choice based on gender identity or the pursuit of erotic pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Elder]], ''Controversia'' 5.6; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender ambiguity was a characteristic of the priests of the goddess [[Cybele]] known as Galli, whose ritual attire included items of women’s clothing. They are sometimes considered a [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]] priesthood, since they were required to be castrated in imitation of [[Attis]]. The complexities of gender identity in the religion of Cybele and the Attis myth are explored by Catullus in one of his longest poems, ''Carmen'' 63.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen O. Murray, ''Homosexualities'' (University of Chicago Press, 2000), pp. 298–303; Mary R. Bachvarova, "Sumerian ''Gala'' Priests and Eastern Mediterranean Returning Gods: Tragic Lamentation in Cross-Cultural Perspective," in ''Lament: Studies in the Ancient Mediterranean and Beyond'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 19, 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] describes a masculine form of "Venus" (Aphrodite) who received cult on [[Cyprus]]; she had a beard and male genitals, but wore women's clothing. The deity's worshippers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothes, and women men's.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 3.8.2. Macrobius says that Aristophanes called this figure ''Aphroditos''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin poet [[Laevius]] wrote of worshipping "nurturing Venus" whether female or male (''[[Si deus si dea|sive femina sive mas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''Venerem igitur almum adorans, sive femina sive mas est,'' as quoted by Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 3.8.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was sometimes called ''[[Aphroditos]]''. In several surviving examples of Greek and Roman sculpture, the love goddess pulls up her garments to reveal her male genitalia, a gesture that traditionally held [[apotropaic]] or magical power.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Montserrat, "Reading Gender in the Roman World," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity, and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersex==
{{main|Intersex in history}}
Pliny notes that "there are even those who are born of both sexes, whom we call hermaphrodites, at one time ''[[androgyn]]i''" (''andr-'', "man", and ''gyn-'', "woman", from the Greek).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 7.34: ''gignuntur et utriusque sexus quos hermaphroditos vocamus, olim androgynos vocatos''; Veronique Dasen, "Multiple Births in Graeco-Roman Antiquity," ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' 16.1 (1997), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators see hermaphroditism as a "violation of social boundaries, especially those as fundamental to daily life as male and female".&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, "Priests of the Goddess," p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The era also saw an historical account of a congenital eunuch.&lt;ref name = "Philostratus"&gt;Philostratus, VS 489&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Christian rule==
Attitudes toward same-sex behavior changed as Christianity became more prominent in the Empire. The modern perception of Roman sexual decadence can be traced to early [[Christian polemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J.L. Blanshard, "Roman Vice," in ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. 1–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from measures to protect the liberty of citizens, the prosecution of male–male sex as a general crime began in the 3rd century when [[male prostitution]] was banned by [[Philip the Arab]]. A series of laws regulating male–male sex were promulgated during the [[Crisis of the Third Century|social crisis of the 3rd century]], from the [[statutory rape]] of minors to marriage between males.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 4th century, anally passive men under the [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian Empire]] were [[Death by burning|punished by burning]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the [[Theodosian Code]].&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'' 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the 6th century, under [[Justinian]], that legal and moral discourse on male–male sex becomes distinctly Christian:&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Records, "When Sex Has Lost its Significance": Homosexuality, Society, and Roman Law in the 4th Century", in UCR Undergraduate Research Journal, Volume IV (June 2010)[http://ugrj.ucr.edu/journal/volume4/christopher_records.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; all male–male sex, passive or active, no matter who the partners, was declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia," p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Male–male sex was pointed to as cause for [[Divine retribution|God's wrath]] following a series of disasters around 542 and 559.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brinkschröde, "Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses," in ''Combatting Homophobia'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Commelin''' (19 October 1598, [[Amsterdam]] - 13 January 1676, Amsterdam) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] historian.

==Life==
He wrote ''Lives of the Stadtholders [[William the Silent|William I]] and [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice]]'' and ''Origin and Progress of the [[Dutch East India Company]]'',  as well as other basic works in the fields of [[geography]], [[cosmography]] and [[astronomy]], discovery and travel. He was the father of [[Jan Commelin]] and the grandfather of [[Caspar Commelin]].
He served as Regent of the Huiszitten House in Amsterdam, together with [[Ferdinand Bol]], where their portraits were painted in a ''[[regentenstuk]]'' in 1675 by [[Pieter van Anraedt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/14668 The painting of the regents by Anraedt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anraedt painted his portrait again separately in 1675, and this second portrait looks very similar to an earlier regentenstuk painted by Bol himself in 1657 of the Huiszitten House regents (Commelin has whiskers in both paintings).&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/1906 The painting of the same regents by Bol] in the RKD&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Joaquín Justo Camacho Lago''' (July 17, 1766 &amp;ndash; August 31, 1816) was a [[Viceroyalty of the New Granada|Neogranadine]] statesman, lawyer, journalist and professor, who worked for the Independence of the [[Colombia|New Granada]], what is now [[Colombia]], and participated in the Open Cabildo which declared the Act of Independence, of which he was also a signer. He was executed during the Reign of Terror of [[Pablo Morillo]] after the [[Spanish invasion of New Granada]].

==Early life==

Camacho was born on July 17, 1766, in [[Tunja]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gobernantes de Colombia'' By Jorge de Mendoza Velez&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the [[Viceroyalty of the New Granada]], now [[Colombia]]. His parents were Francisco Camacho y Solórzano and Rosa Rodríguez de Lago y Castillo. He attended [[Our Lady of the Rosary University]] where he studied [[Jurisprudence]]. He was admitted as a [[lawyer]] by the [[Royal Audiency of Santafé de Bogotá]] in the year 1792. He became one of the most important lawyers of the viceroyalty and winning the admiration of his colleagues.

On June 13, 1793, Camacho married Marcelina Rodríguez de Lago y Castillo, a member of the prominent Sanz de Santamaría family on her mother’s side.&lt;ref&gt;''Gendering Latin American Independence: Women's Political Culture and the Textual Construction of Gender 1790-1850'' By the [[University of Nottingham]], and the [[University of Manchester]][http://www.genderlatam.org.uk/PersonDetails.php?PeopleID=632]&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had three children.

==Writing and journalism==

Responding to a prize competition in 1808 by philanthropist Nicolás Manuel Tanco,&lt;ref&gt;''Ciencia, filosofía y educación en Colombia (siglo XVIII)'' By Juan Manuel Pacheco&lt;/ref&gt; Camacho wrote ''Memoria sobre la causa y curación de los cotos'', an account on the cause and treatment for [[goitre]]; this remarkable work won the competition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YZQCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA507&amp;dq=Memoria+sobre+la+causa+y+curaci%C3%B3n+de+los+cotos&amp;as_brr=1#PPA507,M1 ''Estudios criticos'' By Rafael Maria Merchan]&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was a response to the situation of Bogotá, which at the time was having a small epidemic of goiter.&lt;ref&gt;''Memorias para la Historia de la Medicina en Santafé de Bogotá'' By Doctor Pedro M. Ibáñez&lt;/ref&gt;

Camacho wrote for the ''Seminario del Nuevo Reino de Granada'', a newsletter edited by [[Francisco José de Caldas]], its most important contribution was in 1809, ''Relación territorial de la provincia de Pamplona en el Nuevo Reino de Granada'', an extensive account of the Province of [[Pamplona]] at the end of the Colonial Period. In it is described its main cities, the fauna and flora of the region, the provincial limits and borders, and other geographical and botanical information about Pamplona.&lt;ref&gt;''Seminario del Nuevo Reino de Granada'' (Volume II, 1809, Page 97)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La botánica y los botánicos de la peninsula hispanolusitana'' (Page 57) By Miguel Colmeiro y Penido [https://books.google.com/books?id=G04bAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Relaci%C3%B3n+territorial+de+la+Provincia+de+Pamplona#PPA57,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Camacho started venturing more into [[journalism]] in 1810, when he co-edited the newspaper ''Diario Político'', with [[Francisco José de Caldas]]. The Diario Politico first came out on August 27, 1810, and contained political articles related with the events of July 20 then on. It ran three editions per week till February 1811.&lt;ref&gt;''La producción intelectual de los rosaristas, 1700-1799: Catálogo bibliográfico'' (Page 53) By Pilar Jaramillo de Zuleta [https://books.google.com/books?id=zoHZm67BspMC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22Joaqu%C3%ADn+Camacho%22&amp;sig=jsn2mZDHQv7qDkttYKCGkJQy-Xw]&lt;/ref&gt;

==July 20, 1810==

On July 19, 1810, the precursors of the independence - [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]], José Acevedo Gómez, [[José Miguel Pey]] and [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano]], among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of [[Francisco José de Caldas]]. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; the precursors were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/cseiii/cseiii05a.htm Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Génesis de la revolución del 20 de julio de 1810''  (Page 140) By Sergio Elías Ortiz&lt;/ref&gt; They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, [[Antonio Villavicencio]] and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in [[Cartagena de Indias]]. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had to come from the Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing something about it.&lt;ref&gt;''Grandes fechas'' (Page 59) By Abelardo Forero Benavides&lt;/ref&gt; Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy and ask him to allow a Junta to take place: they knew that he was going to oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.

The next day, Friday July 20, 1810, everything went according to their plan, and by night they had assembled an Open Cabildo. Don Camacho was part of this Cabildo, which wrote the first Declaration of Independence of Colombia, the ''Acta del Cabildo Extraordinario de Santa Fe'', which declared the Viceroyalty of New Granada independent. Camacho was one its signers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcudiavirtual.ua.es/servlet/SirveObras/public/08147397511360395432268/p0000001.htm ''Acta del Cabildo Extaordinario de Santa Fe'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deputy of Congress==

Camacho also participated in the Congress of the United Provinces of the New Granada, which was convened in [[Villa de Leiva]], as a Deputy Representative for the Province of Tunja.&lt;ref&gt;''El libro de la patria; historia del 20 de julio, complementada con pensamientos de esclarecidos colombianos sobre esta fecha memorable ilustrad con rasgos biográficos de los treinta y siete vocales que constituyeron el gobierno del nuevo reino... preparada en conmemoracion del aniversario del 20 de julio de 1894.''

==Triumvirate==

On October 5, 1814, the Congress of the United Provinces changed the Presidency of the United Provinces and replaced it with a [[Triumvirate]], a three-member executive body. Congress nominated [[Custodio García Rovira]], [[Manuel Rodríguez Torices]] and [[José Manuel Restrepo]] for the triumvirate, but they were all unable to assume the presidency, so Congress replaced them with [[José María del Castillo y Rada]], [[José Fernández Madrid]], and Camacho.&lt;ref&gt;''Colombia: Elections and Events 1810-1849'' By Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Library {{cite web |url=http://sshl.ucsd.edu/collections/las/colombia/1810.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513225215/http://sshl.ucsd.edu/collections/las/colombia/1810.html |archivedate=2007-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camacho exercised the executive power till January 2, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/camajose.htm Joaquín Camacho  By Javier López Ocampo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==

Camacho was sentenced to death by [[Pablo Morillo]] and the War Council on  August 31, 1816 and was executed by a [[firing squad]] on the same day, at the age of fifty. He was sick, [[Blindness|blind]] and [[paralyzed]]&lt;ref&gt;''Hombres y ciudades: Antología del paisaje, de las letras y de los hombres de Colombia'' By Gustavo Otero Muñoz&lt;/ref&gt; and had to be carried in his [[wheelchair]] up the platform designated for his execution.&lt;ref&gt;''Presidentes de Colombia'' By Constantino Martinez Villamizar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survivors==

When Camacho died, his family was oppressed by the Terror Regime until the liberation by [[Simón Bolívar]] in 1819. His wife asked the Libertador to grant her a [[pension]] for her husband's sacrifice to the Nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderlatam.org.uk/RefDetails.php?RefID=183 Gendering Latin American Independence Project at The University of Nottingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bolívar personally asked congress for this and in 1820 a pension was given to her in his name.&lt;ref&gt;;;Bolívar'' By Colombia Ministerio de Educación Nacional&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Indalecia Camacho, who was also blind, received a pension from Congress on May 26, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;''Leyes'' By Colombia, Colombia Consejo de Estado, Colombia Congreso.

==Biography==
Bopp studied at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]] under [[Moritz Cantor]]. In 1906 he [[Habilitation|habilitated]] with a work about the [[conic section]]s of [[Gregorius a Sancto Vincenti]], and in 1915 he became [[Professor#Germany|professor extraordinarius]] in Heidelberg. As successor of Moritz Cantor he taught [[history of mathematics]], political arithmetic, and [[Insurance]]. In 1933 he became ill and died in 1934.
 
Bopp's special field of interest were researches about [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]]. He edited Lambert's ''Monatsbuch'', his letter exchanges with [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Abraham Gotthelf Kästner]], and his [[Philosophy|philosophical]] writings. Bopp wrote many historical papers, including two studies on the history of [[elliptic function]]s, and the re-publication of a paper by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] on the cause of [[gravitation]].

:''This article includes biographical information relating to the Anglican nun known as '''Sister Kate''', as well as the institution that she established which was known as '''Sister Kate's'''''.

[[Image:Katherine Clutterbuck.jpg|thumb|right|Sister Kate]]
'''Katherine Mary Clutterbuck''' CSC [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (1860 in [[Wiltshire]], England – 1946 in [[Nedlands, Western Australia]]), usually known as '''Sister Kate''', was an [[Anglican]] [[nun]] who pioneered a cottage home system for looking after [[orphan]] babies and children in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080036b.htm Biographical Entry – The Australian Dictionary of Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; She later became well known for her work with [[Indigenous Australian]] children who were selected according to a criterion of skin colour and sent to her homes to groom the young "nearly white" children for absorption into the white community.  These children would later be described as part of the "[[Stolen Generation]]".

Clutterbuck was the daughter of well-off parents, Captain Clutterbuck and his wife.

Clutterbuck was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]] (Member of the Civil Division), on 1 January 1934, for her services to disadvantaged children.

In December 2006, the ''[[The West Australian|West Australian]]'' newspaper published a list entitled the "100 Most Influential Western Australians" which included Clutterbuck. The list was developed by a committee including several eminent Western Australian historians.

==Orphanage career==
In 1881 Clutterbuck joined the [[Community of the Sisters of the Church]], a [[Church of England]] order founded in London in 1870 by [[Emily Ayckbowm|Mother Emily Ayckbowm]]. Now referred to as "Sister Kate", Clutterbuck worked with orphans in the London slums for 17 years until 1901 when she and several other sisters were sent to [[Western Australia]] to establish a girls' school and orphanage.  She arrived in Western Australia in December 1901 with Sister Sarah and 22 [[orphaned]] English children aged between 6 and 10 in her care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facp.iinet.net.au/teachingnotes/myplaceback.html Fremantle Arts Centre Press – My Place by Sally Morgan]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other sisters of her order set about the establishment of founding a church school (now [[Perth College, Western Australia|Perth College]]), Clutterbuck and Sister Sarah set out to establish a home for orphaned babies. Temporary premises in William Street, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] were used while a permanent children's home in the country was located.  The nuns purchased a {{convert|20|acre|ha|adj=on}} block at [[Parkerville, Western Australia|Parkerville]] in the [[Darling Range]].  Clutterbuck took up residence in 1903 with eight children in an old hut and bark roofed barn which she named The League of Charity Homes for Waifs and Stray Babies and which was later expanded to become Parkerville Children's Home.   Forty-five children were being fostered by 1905 and, thanks to a benefactor, [[Walter Padbury]], a large stone nursery was built.  Other improvements included a 6000-gallon (27,000-litre) water tank and 120 acres (50 ha) of land partially planted with fruit trees as well as a carriage and horse.  The state government provided some funding and by 1911, 100 children were living there.  Another two sisters were recruited from England and the building were extended to include a dining-room, schoolhouse and kitchen.

For nearly 30 years Clutterbuck ran the home where over 800 disadvantaged children passed through her care.  In 1927 the home was taken over by the Diocese of Perth and in 1930 she retired at the age of 70.  She was awarded an MBE the following year.

Parkerville continues to be operated today as accommodation for disadvantaged children.  A small river in the vicinity of the home is named Clutterbuck Creek.{{coord|31|52|20|S|116|8|10|E|type:landmark|name=Parkerville Children's Home}}

==Return from retirement and the Stolen Generations==
Friend and associate Ruth Lefroy shared an interest in the welfare of Aboriginal children.  In 1932, Lefroy purchased a property in Neville Street, [[Bayswater, Western Australia|Bayswater]] called the Children's Cottage Home which was run by Clutterbuck.  Another house used as a holiday home was acquired in Beach Street, [[Mosman Park, Western Australia|Mosman Park]].  The home was funded by government subsidies from the Native Welfare and Child Welfare Departments, as well as fêtes, jumble sales, donations and street collections.

At this time [[A. O. Neville]], the government [[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aboriginals]], was the architect of an official scheme which oversaw the care, custody and education of Aboriginal and half-caste children under 16 years in the state.  The scheme's purpose was to integrate young and part Aboriginal children into white society by separating them from their families.  The process by which the separation was done has been widely condemned since a report entitled ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' was published in 1997 following a federal government inquiry.  These people are now known as the [[Stolen Generations]].

As part of the scheme, Neville directed young Aboriginal children and babies into the Children's Cottage Home run by Clutterbuck.

In June 1934, Clutterbuck and Ruth Lefroy relocated the home with ten school-aged children to a new site on Railway Street (now Treasure Road), [[Queens Park, Western Australia|Queens Park]].  The new six-roomed home was named "Myola" and had been purpose built with the help of private sponsorship.  Due to a [[measles]] epidemic, the cottage was soon extended to create a ward where sick children could be isolated and nursed.  In 1935 a kitchen and a second cottage, "Friendly Cottage", were built on the site to accommodate younger children.  At this time Queens Park was a relatively undeveloped suburb although the cottage was well located with a school and [[Queens Park railway station, Perth|train station]] nearby.  Towards the end of 1936, Neville began negotiations on behalf of Clutterbuck for the purchase of land immediately adjacent to the home.  An adjoining 5.25 acres (2 hectares) was acquired at a cost of £85 in January 1937 using funds donated by a benefactor.  The same person also donated funds to extend the second cottage and to build a third cottage and a chapel. This third cottage was known as "Nursery Cottage" and the chapel was named the "Chapel of the Guardian Angel".

Neville supposedly reproached Sister Kate for building the chapel, suggesting that the funds should have been spent on the children.

Church services, Sunday School and daily prayers were conducted in the new chapel on a regular basis. A morning service conducted by Sister Kate was conducted each morning. The chapel was very important to Sister Kate: according to Vera Whittington
{{cquote|''Even in her last years, when she no longer took the services, it was her delight to walk to the chapel for private devotions. The chapel stood as a symbol for the centre of Sister Kate's life and that of the Home.:&lt;ref&gt;Whittington, Vera, ''Sister Kate: a life dedicated to children in need of care'', Nedlands, University of WA Press, 1999, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;
''}}

She refused to have the building dedicated, believing that its non-denominational status would encourage patronage by the children, and it was not until after her death in February 1948 that Anglican Archbishop Moline dedicated the chapel. In 1937, fund-raising by a group known as the  'Virgillians', led by [[Mary Durack]], enabled further development of the site and in 1938–41 a [[kindergarten]] and another cottage were constructed.

With the onset of World War 2 most of the children were evacuated to the Duke of York Hotel at [[Greenbushes, Western Australia|Greenbushes]]. Some children required specialised medical attention and attendance at Perth hospitals however, and so Ruth Lefroy purchased a cottage at [[Roleystone, Western Australia|Roleystone]].  After the war, the Roleystone property was sold and the proceeds used to pay for the construction of 'Memorial cottage'.

In 1946, funds from the [[Lotteries Commission of Western Australia|Lotteries Commission]] helped build 'Gran's Cottage' (as she was then known) as a private residence for Sister Kate.  Soon after however, she died suddenly at [[Tresillian Hospital]] in Nedlands at the age of 86.

Most of her foster-children were with her from babyhood to maturity: they called her 'Mum', and in later years 'Gran'.  She was not a big woman and was said to have an English complexion, and radiated kindliness with a quiet strength that won respect and confidence from young and old.  Always full of sympathy, she had a kindly understanding nature and was always able to offer advice for the children which she treated as her own.

==Posthumous events==
A committee then administered the home, with the position of Superintendent Matron taken over by Ruth Lefroy.  The Queens Park complex, which by this time comprised seven cottages as well as the chapel and kindergarten, became known as "Sister Kate's Children's Cottages" in recognition of her work.  Ruth Lefroy died in 1953 and her will made provision for the ownership of the property to be donated to the [[Presbyterian Church]], now part of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]].

[[Dean Collard]] was appointed Director of the Cottages in August 1987.

In 1988, the cottages were renamed as "Manguri".  The organisation continues today to provide Aboriginal child-care services.

==Change of era==
* '''1648''' {{nihongo|''Keian gannen''|慶安元年}}: The new era name was created in response to criticism that ''Shōhō'' was too closely related to ''Shōbō'' (焼亡, meaning "death by burning"). The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Shōhō'' 5, on the 5th day of the 2nd month.

The new era name was drawn from the Chinese classic, The [[I Ching]]: "At the end happiness, joy of quiet righteousness, answer the world unlimited" (乃終有'''慶、安'''貞之吉、応地無疆):

==Events of the ''Keian'' era==
* '''April 1, 1649''' (''Keian 2, 20th day of the 2nd month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc  慶安二年二月二十日 --&gt;: There was a major earthquake in Edo.&lt;ref name="t412"/&gt;
* '''1651''' (''Keian 4''):  [[Keian Uprising]]. Plans by well-organized ''[[rōnin]]'' to attack several Tokugawa strongholds simultaneously were timely discovered. The attempt plan to overthrow the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Edo Bakufu]] by [[Marubashi Chūya]] and [[Yui Shōsetsu]] was thwarted.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shogans: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822'', pp. 85–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titsingh translated the text from Japanese and Chinese; and his work was then supplemented for posthumous publication by Julius Klaproth.

The '''Lap Engine''' is a [[beam engine]] designed by [[James Watt]], built by [[Boulton and Watt]] in 1788. It is now preserved at the [[Science Museum, London]].

It is important as both an early example of a beam engine by Boulton and Watt, and also mainly as illustrating an important innovative step in their development for its ability to produce rotary motion.&lt;ref name="Dickinson &amp; Jenkins, 1927" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowley, Lap Engine" /&gt;

The engines name comes from its use in  [[Matthew Boulton]]'s [[Soho Manufactory]], where it was used to drive a line of 43 polishing or [[lapping]] machines, used for the [[Birmingham toy industry|production of buttons and buckles]].&lt;ref name="SM, Lap Engine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hulse, web, Lap Engine" /&gt;

== Innovations ==

[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1950S00022(1).jpg|thumb|A 1950 model of the engine, now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]] ]]

Watt did not invent the [[steam engine]] and there is no single '[[Watt steam engine]]' as such. He developed a number of separate innovations, each of which improved the existing engines of the day, beginning with [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen's]].  The Lap Engine of 1788, also the [[Whitbread Engine]] (1785), represent survivors of the first engines to show all of Watt's major improvements in one.&lt;ref name="Crowley, Lap Engine" /&gt;

The [[rotative beam engine]] needs a means to convert [[reciprocating motion]] of the piston and beam to [[rotary motion]]. The [[crankshaft]] was well known for centuries before Watt, mostly from its use in mining machinery powered by [[water wheel]]s. However its use for a steam engine was covered by [[James Pickard]]'s patent at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watt was unwilling to pay a license fee to use the [[crank (mechanism)|crank]] and so sought an alternative. The sun and planet gear was invented by another [[Scottish people|Scottish]] engineer, [[William Murdoch]], an employee of [[Boulton and Watt]]. Watt patented it in October 1781.

The sun and planet gear is a simple [[epicyclic gear]]. The planet is attached rigidly to the end of the [[connecting rod]], hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional gearwheels, this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.

The '''Late Middle Ages''' or '''Late Medieval Period''' was the [[Periodization|period]] of [[European history|European]] history lasting from 1250 to 1500 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. The Late Middle Ages followed the [[High Middle Ages]] and preceded the onset of the [[early modern era]] (and, in much of Europe, the [[Renaissance]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wallace K. Ferguson, ''Europe in transition, 1300-1520'' (1962) [https://archive.org/details/europeintransiti00ferg online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1300, centuries of prosperity and growth in Europe came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] and the [[Black Death]], reduced the population to around half of what it was before the calamities.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Alchon, Suzanne (2003). A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective. University of New Mexico Press. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-8263-2871-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with depopulation came social unrest and [[endemic warfare]]. [[France]] and [[England]] experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the [[Jacquerie]] and the [[Peasants' Revolt]], as well as over a century of intermittent conflict, the [[Hundred Years' War]]. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the [[Catholic Church]] was temporarily shattered by the [[Western Schism]]. Collectively, those events are sometimes called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Cantor, ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'' (1994) p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the [[Italian Renaissance]] began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]] through contact with Arabs during the [[Crusades]], but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the [[Capture of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], when many [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with this influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing, which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. Those two things would later lead to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Toward the end of the period, the [[Age of Discovery]] began. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire cut off trading possibilities with the East. Europeans were forced to seek new trading routes, leading to the Spanish expedition under [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[Americas]] in 1492 and [[Vasco da Gama]]’s voyage to Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.

The changes brought about by these developments have led many scholars to view this period as the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of [[modern history]] and of [[early modern Europe]]. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result, there was [[continuity thesis|developmental continuity]] between the [[ancient history|ancient age]] (via [[classical antiquity]]) and the [[modern age]]. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not to speak of the Late Middle Ages at all but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.

==Historiography and periodization==
{{Human history}}
The term "Late Middle Ages" refers to one of the three periods of the Middle Ages, along with the Early Middle Ages and the High Middle Ages. [[Leonardo Bruni]] was the first historian to use tripartite periodization in his ''History of the Florentine People'' (1442).&lt;ref name="Hankins"&gt;Leonardo Bruni, James Hankins, ''History of the Florentine people'', Volume 1, Books 1–4, (2001), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flavio Biondo]] used a similar framework in ''Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire'' (1439–1453). Tripartite periodization became standard after the German historian [[Christoph Cellarius]] published ''Universal History Divided into an Ancient, Medieval, and New Period'' (1683).

For 18th-century historians studying the 14th and 15th centuries, the central theme was the [[Renaissance]], with its rediscovery of ancient learning and the emergence of an individual spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Brady ''et al.'', p. xiv; Cantor, p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of this rediscovery lies in Italy, where, in the words of [[Jacob Burckhardt]]: "Man became a spiritual individual and recognized himself as such".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacob|last=Burckhardt|authorlink=Jacob Burckhardt|title=The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy|edition=|publisher=|location=|year=1860|page=121|id=|url=|isbn=0-06-090460-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition was later challenged, and it was argued that the 12th century was a period of greater cultural achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Charles Homer|last=Haskins|authorlink=Charles Homer Haskins|title= The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century|edition=|publisher= Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1927|id=|url=|isbn= 0-19-821934-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As economic and demographic methods were applied to the study of history, the trend was increasingly to see the late Middle Ages as a period of recession and crisis. [[Belgium|Belgian]] historian [[Henri Pirenne]] continued the subdivision of [[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]], and Late Middle Ages in the years around [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;"Les périodes de l'histoire du capitalisme", ''Académie Royale de Belgique. Bulletin de la Classe des Lettres'', 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was his [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colleague, [[Johan Huizinga]], who was primarily responsible for popularising the pessimistic view of the Late Middle Ages, with his book ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Johan|last=Huizinga|authorlink=Johan Huizinga|title=The Waning of the Middle Ages: A Study of the Forms of Life, Thought and Art in France and the Netherlands in the XIVth and XVth Centuries|edition=|publisher=E. Arnold|location=London|year=1924|page=|id=|url=|isbn=0-312-85540-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Huizinga, whose research focused on France and the [[Low Countries]] rather than Italy, despair and decline were the main themes, not rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand, ed. ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 7: c. 1415 – c. 1500'', (1998) p 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Cantor, ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'' (1994) p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historiography on the period has reached a consensus between the two extremes of innovation and crisis. It is now generally acknowledged that conditions were vastly different north and south of the Alps, and the term "Late Middle Ages" is often avoided entirely within Italian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goff, p. 154. See e.g. {{cite book|first=John M.|last=Najemy|authorlink=|title=Italy in the Age of the Renaissance: 1300–1550|edition=|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2004|page=|isbn=0-19-870040-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Renaissance" is still considered useful for describing certain intellectual, cultural, or artistic developments, but not as the defining feature of an entire European historical epoch.&lt;ref name="Bradyxvii"&gt;Brady ''et al.'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The period from the early 14th century up until&amp;nbsp;– and sometimes including&amp;nbsp;– the 16th century, is rather seen as characterized by other trends: demographic and economic decline followed by recovery, the end of western religious unity and the subsequent emergence of the [[nation state]], and the expansion of European influence onto the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="Bradyxvii"/&gt;

== History ==

The limits of [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] were still being defined in the 14th and 15th centuries. While the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] was beginning to repel the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] kingdoms completed the [[Reconquista]] of the peninsula and turned their attention outwards, the [[Balkans]] fell under the dominance of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="For references, see below"&gt;For references, see below.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the remaining nations of the continent were locked in almost constant international or internal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 3; Holmes, p. 294; Koenigsberger, pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation gradually led to the consolidation of central authority and the emergence of the [[nation state]].&lt;ref name="BradyJones"&gt;Brady et al., p. xvii; Jones, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial demands of war necessitated higher levels of taxation, resulting in the emergence of representative bodies&amp;nbsp;– most notably the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 29; Cantor, p. 514; Koenigsberger, pp. 300–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of secular authority was further aided by the decline of the papacy with the [[Western Schism]] and the coming of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Brady et al., p. xvii; Holmes, p. 276; Ozment, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failed union of [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] of 1319–1365, the pan-Scandinavian [[Kalmar Union]] was instituted in 1397.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 366; Jones, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedes were reluctant members of the [[Denmark|Danish]]-dominated union from the start. In an attempt to subdue the Swedes, King [[Christian II of Denmark]] had large numbers of the Swedish aristocracy killed in the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] of 1520. Yet this measure only led to further hostilities, and Sweden broke away for good in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 703&lt;/ref&gt; Norway, on the other hand, became an inferior party of the union and remained united with Denmark until 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sverre|authorlink2=Knut Mykland|last2=Mykland|first2=Knut|last=Bagge|authorlink=Sverre Bagge|title=Norge i dansketiden: 1380–1814|edition=2nd|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|year=1989|isbn=978-82-02-12369-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] of [[Scotland]] in 1286 threw the country into a succession crisis, and the English king, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], was brought in to arbitrate. Edward claimed overlordship over Scotland, leading to the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 348–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The English were eventually defeated, and the Scots were able to develop a stronger state under the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 350–1; Koenigsberger, p. 232; McKisack, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1337, England's attention was largely directed towards France in the [[Hundred Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry V of England|Henry V’s]] victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415 briefly paved the way for a unification of the two kingdoms, but his son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] soon squandered all previous gains.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 458; Koenigsberger, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of France led to discontent at home. Soon after the end of the war in 1453, the dynastic struggles of the [[Wars of the Roses]] (c. 1455–1485) began, involving the rival dynasties of the [[House of Lancaster]] and [[House of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 458; Nicholas, pp. 32–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war ended in the accession of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] family, who continued the work started by the Yorkist kings of building a strong, centralized monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 353; Jones, pp. 488–92.&lt;/ref&gt; While England's attention was thus directed elsewhere, the [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords in [[Ireland]] were becoming gradually more assimilated into Irish society, and the island was allowed to develop virtual independence under English overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack, pp. 228–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[France|French]] [[House of Valois]], which followed the [[House of Capet]] in 1328, was at its outset marginalized in its own country, first by the English invading forces of the [[Hundred Years' War]], and later by the powerful [[Duchy of Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 355; Holmes, pp. 288-9; Koenigsberger, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] as a military leader changed the course of war in favour of the French, and the initiative was carried further by King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]].&lt;ref&gt;Duby, p. 288-93; Holmes, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], met resistance in his attempts to consolidate his possessions, particularly from the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] formed in 1291.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 450-5; Jones, pp. 528-9.&lt;/ref&gt; When Charles was killed in the [[Burgundian Wars]] at the [[Battle of Nancy]] in 1477, the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was reclaimed by France.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 455; Hollister, p. 355; Koenigsberger, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[County of Burgundy]] and the wealthy [[Burgundian Netherlands]] came into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under [[Habsburg]] control, setting up conflict for centuries to come.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 455; Hollister, p. 363; Koenigsberger, pp. 306-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bohemia]] prospered in the 14th century, and the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] made the king of Bohemia first among the imperial [[Prince-elector|electors]], but the [[Hussite Wars|Hussite revolution]] threw the country into crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 311–2; Wandycz, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy Roman Empire]] passed to the [[Habsburg]]s in 1438, where it remained until its dissolution in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 362; Holmes, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in spite of the extensive territories held by the Habsburgs, the Empire itself remained fragmented, and much real power and influence lay with the individual principalities.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 507; Hollister, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, financial institutions, such as the [[Hanseatic League]] and the [[Fugger]] family, held great power, on both economic and political levels.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 152–153; Cantor, p. 508; Koenigsberger, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom of [[Hungary]] experienced a golden age during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wandycz, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the reigns of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] (1308–42) and his son [[Louis the Great]] (1342–82) were marked by success.&lt;ref&gt;Wandycz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The country grew wealthy as the main European supplier of gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 737.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis the Great led successful campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy, and from Poland to Northern Greece.

He had the greatest military potential of the 14th century with his enormous armies (often over 100,000 men). Meanwhile, [[Poland]]'s attention was turned eastwards, as the [[Polish-Lithuanian union|union]] with [[Lithuania]] created an enormous entity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 318; Wandycz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The union, and the conversion of Lithuania, also marked the end of [[paganism]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beckov Horne nadvorie 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ruins]] of [[Beckov Castle]] in [[Slovakia]]]]

Louis did not leave a son as heir after his death in 1382. Instead, he named as his heir the young prince [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]]. The Hungarian nobility did not accept his claim, and the result was an internal war. Sigismund eventually achieved total control of Hungary and established his court in Buda and Visegrád. Both palaces were rebuilt and improved, and were considered the richest of the time in Europe. Inheriting the throne of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire, Sigismund continued conducting his politics from Hungary, but he was kept busy fighting the [[Hussites]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was becoming a menace to Europe in the beginning of the 15th century.

The King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary led the largest army of mercenaries of the time, The [[Black Army of Hungary]], which he used to conquer [[Bohemia]] and [[Austria]] and to fight the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However, the glory of the Kingdom ended in the early 16th century, when the King [[Louis II of Hungary]] was killed in the [[battle of Mohács]] in 1526 against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Hungary then fell into a serious crisis and was invaded, ending its significance in central Europe during the medieval era.

The Byzantine Empire had for a long time dominated the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 14th century, however, it had almost entirely collapsed into a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, centered on the city of Constantinople and a few enclaves in [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 771–4; Mango, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was permanently extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 99; Koenigsberger, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] was in decline by the 14th century, and the ascendancy of [[Serbia]] was marked by the Serbian victory over the Bulgarians in the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] in 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 796–7.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1346, the Serbian king [[Stefan Dušan]] had been proclaimed emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 875.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Serbian dominance was short-lived; the Serbian army led by the Lazar Hrebljevanovic was defeated by the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, where most of the [[Serbian nobility]] was killed and the south of the country came under Ottoman occupation, as much of southern Bulgaria had become Ottoman territory [[Battle of Maritsa|in 1371]].&lt;ref name="Hollister, p p. 339"&gt;Hollister, p. 360; Koenigsberger, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern remnants of Bulgaria were finally conquered by 1396, Serbia fell in 1459, Bosnia in 1463, and Albania was finally subordinated in 1479 only a few years after the death of [[Skanderbeg]].

As the European population was severely reduced, land became more plentiful for the survivors, and labour consequently more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Duby, p. 270; Koenigsberger, p. 284; McKisack, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts by landowners to forcibly reduce wages, such as the English 1351 [[Statute of Laborers]], were doomed to fail.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts resulted in nothing more than fostering resentment among the peasantry, leading to rebellions such as the French [[Jacquerie]] in 1358 and the English [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 484; Hollister, p. 332; Holmes, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effect was the virtual end of [[serfdom]] in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 564; Hollister, pp. 332–3; Koenigsberger, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, landowners were able to exploit the situation to force the peasantry into even more repressive bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, pp. 332–3; Jones, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The upheavals caused by the Black Death left certain minority groups particularly vulnerable, especially the [[Jew]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Chazan, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; who were often blamed for the calamities. Anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s were carried out all over Europe; in February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 330; Holmes, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; States were also guilty of discrimination against the Jews. Monarchs gave in to the demands of the people, and the Jews were expelled from England in 1290, from France in 1306, from Spain in 1492, and from Portugal in 1497.&lt;ref&gt;Brady et al., pp. 266–7; Chazan, pp. 166, 232; Koenigsberger, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Jews were suffering persecution, one group that probably experienced increased empowerment in the Late Middle Ages was women. The great social changes of the period opened up new possibilities for women in the fields of commerce, learning and religion.&lt;ref name="Klapisch-Zuber268"&gt;Klapisch-Zuber, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the same time, women were also vulnerable to incrimination and persecution, as belief in [[witchcraft]] increased.&lt;ref name="Klapisch-Zuber268"/&gt;

Up until the mid-14th century, Europe had experienced steadily increasing [[urbanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 323; Holmes, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities were also decimated by the Black Death, but the role of urban areas as centres of learning, commerce and government ensured continued growth.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 164; Koenigsberger, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1500, [[Venice]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Paris]] and [[Constantinople]] each probably had more than 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Allmand125"&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two other cities were larger than 40,000; most of these were in Italy and the Iberian peninsula, but there were also some in France, the Empire, the Low Countries, plus [[London]] in England.&lt;ref name="Allmand125"/&gt;

The [[Hundred Years' War]] was the scene of many military innovations.
]]
|}
Through battles such as [[Battle of the Golden Spurs|Courtrai]] (1302), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] (1315), it became clear to the great territorial princes of Europe that the military advantage of the feudal [[cavalry]] was lost, and that a well equipped [[Infantry in the Middle Ages|infantry]] was preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 350; McKisack, p. 39; Verbruggen, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|Welsh Wars]] the English became acquainted with, and adopted, the highly efficient [[English longbow|longbow]].&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1988), p. 59; Cantor, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Once properly managed, this weapon gave them a great advantage over the French in the Hundred Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack, p. 240, Verbruggen, pp. 171–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[Black powder|gunpowder]] affected the conduct of war significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Contamine, pp. 139–40; Jones, pp. 11–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Though employed by the English as early as the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346, [[firearms]] initially had little effect in the field of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Contamine, pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; It was through the use of [[cannon]]s as [[Siege engine|siege weapons]] that major change was brought about; the new methods would eventually change the architectural structure of [[fortification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 169; Contamine, pp. 200–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes also took place within the recruitment and composition of armies. The use of the [[Conscription|national]] or [[feudal levy]] was gradually replaced by paid troops of domestic [[retinue]]s or foreign [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was associated with [[Edward III of England]] and the [[condottieri]] of the Italian city-states.&lt;ref&gt;Contamine, pp. 150–65; Holmes, p. 261; McKisack, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; All over Europe, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Swiss Mercenaries|soldiers]] were in particularly high demand.&lt;ref&gt;Contamine, pp. 124, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the period also saw the emergence of the first permanent armies. It was in [[House of Valois|Valois]] France, under the heavy demands of the Hundred Years' War, that the armed forces gradually assumed a permanent nature.&lt;ref&gt;Contamine, pp. 165–72; Holmes, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the military developments emerged also a constantly more elaborate [[Chivalry|chivalric]] code of conduct for the warrior class.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 349; Holmes, pp. 319–20.&lt;/ref&gt; This new-found ethos can be seen as a response to the diminishing military role of the aristocracy, and gradually it became almost entirely detached from its military origin.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of chivalry was given expression through the new ([[secular]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03691a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; type of [[chivalric order]]s; the first of these was the [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Order of St. George]], founded by [[Charles I of Hungary]] in 1325, while the best known was probably the English [[Order of the Garter]], founded by Edward III in 1348.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 537; Jones, p. 209; McKisack, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian conflict and reform==

===The Papal Schism===
{{Main|Western Schism}}
The French crown's increasing dominance over the [[Papacy]] culminated in the transference of the [[Holy See]] to [[Avignon]] in 1309.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Pope returned to [[Rome]] in 1377, this led to the election of different popes in Avignon and Rome, resulting in the [[Western Schism|Papal Schism]] (1378–1417).&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 497; Hollister, p. 338; Holmes, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The Schism divided Europe along political lines; while France, her ally Scotland and the Spanish kingdoms supported the Avignon Papacy, France's enemy England stood behind the Pope in Rome, together with Portugal, Scandinavia and most of the German princes.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 338; Koenigsberger, p. 326; Ozment, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418), the Papacy was once more united in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 498; Ozment, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the unity of the Western Church was to last for another hundred years, and though the Papacy was to experience greater material prosperity than ever before, the Great Schism had done irreparable damage.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, pp. 327–8; MacCulloch, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal struggles within the Church had impaired her claim to universal rule, and promoted [[anti-clericalism]] among the people and their rulers, paving the way for reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 339; Holmes, p. 260; Koenigsberger, pp. 327–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant Reformation===
{{Main|Bohemian Reformation|Protestant Reformation}}
[[File:Jan Hus at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Jan Hus]] burnt at the stake]]
Though many of the events were outside the traditional time period of the Middle Ages, the end of the unity of the Western Church (the [[Protestant Reformation]]), was one of the distinguishing characteristics of the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Bradyxvii"/&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] had long fought against heretic movements, but during the Late Middle Ages, it started to experience demands for reform from within.&lt;ref&gt;A famous account of the nature and suppression of a heretic movement is [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s {{cite book|first=|last=|authorlink=|title=Montaillou: Cathars and Catholics in a French Village, 1294–1324|edition=|publisher=Scolar Press|location=London|year=1978|isbn=0-85967-403-7|author=Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these came from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professor [[John Wycliffe]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Wycliffe held that the [[Bible]] should be the only authority in religious questions, and he spoke out against [[transubstantiation]], [[celibacy]] and [[indulgence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 15; Cantor, pp. 499–500; Koenigsberger, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of influential supporters among the [[English language|English]] aristocracy, such as [[John of Gaunt]], the movement was not allowed to survive. Though Wycliffe himself was left unmolested, his supporters, the [[Lollards]], were eventually suppressed in England.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 15–6; MacCulloch, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage of [[Richard II of England]] to [[Anne of Bohemia]] established contacts between the two nations and brought Lollard ideas to her homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 312; MacCulloch, pp. 35–6; Ozment, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings of the [[Czech lands|Czech]] priest [[Jan Hus]] were based on those of John Wycliffe, yet his followers, the [[Hussites]], were to have a much greater political impact than the Lollards.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 16; Cantor, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Hus gained a great following in [[Bohemia]], and in 1414, he was requested to appear at the Council of Constance to defend his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 377; Koenigsberger, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was burned as a heretic in 1415, it caused a popular uprising in the Czech lands.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 332; MacCulloch, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Hussite Wars]] fell apart due to internal quarrels and did not result in religious or national independence for the [[Czechs]], but both the Catholic Church and the German element within the country were weakened.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 353; Hollister, p. 344; Koenigsberger, p. 332–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]], a German monk, started the [[German Reformation]] by posting [[95 theses]] on the castle church of [[Wittenberg]] on October 31, 1517.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate provocation spurring this act was [[Pope Leo X]]’s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in 1514.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, pp. 70, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 127; Ozment, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; When he refused, he was placed under the ban of the Empire by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving the protection of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]], he was then able to translate the Bible into [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;Ozment, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

To many secular rulers the Protestant reformation was a welcome opportunity to expand their wealth and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 16–7; Cantor, pp. 500–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church met the challenges of the reforming movements with what has been called the Catholic Reformation, or [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 107; Ozment, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe became split into northern [[Protestant]] and southern Catholic parts, resulting in the Religious Wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 266; Ozment, pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly dominant position of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] presented an impediment to trade for the Christian nations of the west, who in turn started looking for alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 159–60; Pounds, pp. 467–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese and Spanish explorers found new trade routes&amp;nbsp;– south of [[Africa]] to [[India]], and across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Americas|America]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, pp. 334–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants opened up direct sea routes with [[Flanders]], the [[Champagne fairs]] lost much of their importance.&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla (1976), p. 275; Koenigsberger, p. 295; Pounds, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, English wool export shifted from raw wool to processed cloth, resulting in losses for the cloth manufacturers of the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla (1976), p. 283; Koenigsberger, p. 297; Pounds, pp. 378–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]], the [[Hanseatic League]] reached the peak of their power in the 14th century, but started going into decline in the fifteenth.&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla (1976), p. 275; Cipolla (1994), p. 203, 234; Pounds, pp. 387–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, a process took place&amp;nbsp;– primarily in Italy but partly also in the Empire&amp;nbsp;– that historians have termed a 'commercial revolution'.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 226; Pounds, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the innovations of the period were new forms of [[Corporation|partnership]] and the issuing of [[insurance]], both of which contributed to reducing the risk of commercial ventures; the [[Negotiable instrument#Bill of exchange|bill of exchange]] and other forms of credit that circumvented the [[Canon law|canonical laws]] for [[gentile]]s against [[usury]], and eliminated the dangers of carrying [[Precious metal|bullion]]; and new forms of [[accounting]], in particular [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]], which allowed for better oversight and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla (1976), pp. 318–29; Cipolla (1994), pp. 160–4; Holmes, p. 235; Jones, pp. 176–81; Koenigsberger, p. 226; Pounds, pp. 407–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the financial expansion, trading rights became more jealously guarded by the commercial elite. Towns saw the growing power of [[guild]]s, while on a national level special companies would be granted monopolies on particular trades, like the English wool [[The staple|Staple]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 121; Pearl, pp. 299–300; Koenigsberger, pp. 286, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; The beneficiaries of these developments would accumulate immense wealth. Families like the [[Fugger]]s in Germany, the [[Medici]]s in Italy, the [[Duke of Suffolk|de la Poles]] in England, and individuals like [[Jacques Coeur]] in France would help finance the wars of kings, and achieve great political influence in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 150–3; Holmes, p. 304; Koenigsberger, p. 299; McKisack, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is no doubt that the demographic crisis of the 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in ''absolute'' terms, there has been a vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; While the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the Renaissance was a result of greater opulence, more recent studies have suggested that there might have been a so-called 'depression of the Renaissance'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=C.M.|last=Cipolla|authorlink=Carlo Maria Cipolla|year=1964|title=Economic depression of the Renaissance?|journal=[[The Economic History Society|Economic History Review]]|volume=xvi|issue=|pages=519–24|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/2592852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of convincing arguments for the case, the statistical evidence is simply too incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, pp. 484–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, the predominant academic trend of [[scholasticism]] was challenged by the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] movement. Though primarily an attempt to revitalise the [[classical language]]s, the movement also led to innovations within the fields of science, art and literature, helped on by impulses from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars who had to seek refuge in the west after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 243–54; Cantor, p. 594; Nicholas, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

In science, classical authorities like [[Aristotle]] were challenged for the first time since antiquity. Within the arts, humanism took the form of the [[Renaissance]]. Though the 15th-century Renaissance was a highly localised phenomenon&amp;nbsp;– limited mostly to the city states of northern Italy&amp;nbsp;– artistic developments were taking place also further north, particularly in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="For references, see below"/&gt;

===Philosophy, science and technology===
{{Main|Medieval philosophy|History of science in the Middle Ages|Medieval technology}}
[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500.png|thumb|European output of manuscripts 500–1500. The rising trend in medieval book production saw its continuation in the period.&lt;ref&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the “Rise of the West”: Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (416, table 1)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The predominant school of thought in the 13th century was the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] reconciliation of the teachings of [[Aristotle]] with [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 42; Koenigsberger, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Condemnations (University of Paris)#Condemnation of 1277|Condemnation of 1277]], enacted at the [[University of Paris]], placed restrictions on ideas that could be interpreted as heretical; restrictions that had implication for [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] thought.&lt;ref name="SEP 1277"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condemnation/|title=Condemnation of 1277|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|author=Hans Thijssen|year=2003|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative was presented by [[William of Ockham]], following the manner of the earlier Franciscan [[John Duns Scotus]], who insisted that the world of reason and the world of faith had to be kept apart. Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony&amp;nbsp;– or [[Occam's razor]]&amp;nbsp;– whereby a simple theory is preferred to a more complex one, and speculation on unobservable phenomena is avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 142; Nicholas, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; This maxim is, however, often misquoted. Occam was referring to his nominalism in this quotation. Essentially saying the theory of absolutes, or metaphysical realism, was unnecessary to make sense of the world.

This new approach liberated scientific speculation from the dogmatic restraints of Aristotelian science, and paved the way for new approaches. Particularly within the field of theories of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] great advances were made, when such scholars as [[Jean Buridan]], [[Nicole Oresme]] and the [[Oxford Calculators]] challenged the work of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, pp. 100–3, 149, 164–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Buridan developed the theory of ''impetus'' as the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was an important step towards the modern concept of [[inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, pp. 95–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The works of these scholars anticipated the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] worldview of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, pp. 112–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain technological inventions of the period&amp;nbsp;– whether of [[Arab]] or [[China|Chinese]] origin, or unique European innovations&amp;nbsp;– were to have great influence on political and social developments, in particular [[gunpowder]], the [[printing press]] and the [[compass]]. The introduction of gunpowder to the field of battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s [[movable type]] [[printing press]] made possible not only the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The [[compass]], along with other innovations such as the [[cross-staff]], the [[mariner's astrolabe]], and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the [[World Ocean]]s, and the early phases of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 11–2; Koenigsberger, pp. 297–8; Nicholas, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Other inventions had a greater impact on everyday life, such as [[Glasses|eyeglasses]] and the weight-driven [[clock]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 160; Koenigsberger, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual arts and architecture===

[[File:MZK 003 Nr 01 Fig 27 - Holzwohnhaus Halberstadt Aufbau.jpg|thumb|upright|Urban dwelling house, late 15th century, Halberstadt, Germany.]]

A precursor to [[Renaissance]] art can be seen already in the early 14th-century works of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]. Giotto was the first painter since antiquity to attempt the representation of a three-dimensional reality, and to endow his characters with true human emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 433; Koenigsberger, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important developments, however, came in 15th-century Florence. The affluence of the merchant class allowed extensive patronage of the arts, and foremost among the patrons were the Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 155; Brotton, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period saw several important technical innovations, like the principle of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]] found in the work of [[Masaccio]], and later described by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p. 24; Koenigsberger, p. 363; Nicholas, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater realism was also achieved through the scientific study of anatomy, championed by artists like [[Donatello]].&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 253; Cantor, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen particularly well in his sculptures, inspired by the study of classical models.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 554; Nichols, pp. 159–60.&lt;/ref&gt; As the centre of the movement shifted to Rome, the period culminated in the [[High Renaissance]] masters [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, p. 67; Burke, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Italian Renaissance were slow to cross the Alps into northern Europe, but important artistic innovations were made also in the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 269; Koenigsberger, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not&amp;nbsp;– as previously believed&amp;nbsp;– the inventor of oil painting, [[Jan van Eyck]] was a champion of the new medium, and used it to create works of great realism and minute detail.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 302; Cantor, p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; The two cultures influenced each other and learned from each other, but painting in the Netherlands remained more focused on textures and surfaces than the idealized compositions of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p. 250; Nicholas, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern European countries [[Gothic architecture]] remained the norm, and the gothic cathedral was further elaborated.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), pp. 300–1, Hollister, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, on the other hand, architecture took a different direction, also here inspired by classical ideals. The crowning work of the period was the [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] in [[Florence]], with Giotto's clock tower, [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]]'s baptistery gates, and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s cathedral [[dome]] of unprecedented proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand (1998), p. 305; Cantor, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Medieval literature}}
[[File:Michelino DanteAndHisPoem.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] by [[Domenico di Michelino]], from a fresco painted in 1465]]

The most important development of late medieval literature was the ascendancy of the [[vernacular]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The vernacular had been in use in England since the 8th century and France since the 11th century, where the most popular genres had been the [[chanson de geste]], troubadour lyrics and romantic epics, or the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Italy was later in evolving a native literature in the vernacular language, it was here that the most important developments of the period were to come.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, p. 387; Koenigsberger, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]'', written in the early 14th century, merged a medieval world view with classical ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 546; Curtius, pp. 351, 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Another promoter of the Italian language was [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] with his ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, p. 396; Koenigsberger, p. 368; Jones, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of [[Latin]], and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin as well as Italian, as would [[Petrarch]] later (whose ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern [[lyric poem]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, p. 26; Jones, p. 258; Koenigsberger, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Together the three poets established the [[Tuscan dialect]] as the norm for the modern [[Italian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new literary style spread rapidly, and in France influenced such writers as [[Eustache Deschamps]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In England [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] helped establish [[Middle English]] as a literary language with his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', which contained a wide variety of narrators and stories (including some translated from Boccaccio).&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, p. 35; Jones. p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of vernacular literature eventually reached as far as Bohemia, and the Baltic, Slavic and Byzantine worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Medieval music}}
[[File:Vielle.jpg|right|thumb|A musician plays the [[vielle]] in a fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]].]]

Music was an important part of both secular and spiritual culture, and in the universities it made up part of the ''[[quadrivium]]'' of the liberal arts.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand, p. 319; Grant, p. 14; Koenigsberger, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the [[motet]]; a composition with text in several parts.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand, p. 322; Wilson, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1330s and onwards, emerged the [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] style, which was a more complex fusion of independent voices.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 229, 289–90, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Polyphony had been common in the secular music of the [[Provence|Provençal]] [[troubadour]]s. Many of these had fallen victim to the 13th-century [[Albigensian Crusade]], but their influence reached the papal court at Avignon.&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 381; Wilson, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main representatives of the new style, often referred to as ''[[ars nova]]'' as opposed to the ''[[ars antiqua]]'', were the composers [[Philippe de Vitry]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 383; Wilson, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, where the Provençal troubadours had also found refuge, the corresponding period goes under the name of [[Music of the Trecento|trecento]], and the leading composers were [[Giovanni da Cascia]], [[Jacopo da Bologna]] and [[Francesco Landini]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 357–8, 361–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent reformer of Orthodox Church music from the first half of 14th century was [[John Kukuzelis]]; he also introduced a system of notation widely used in the [[Balkans]] in the following centuries.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Medieval theatre}}
In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages. Many of these plays contained [[comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality plays]] emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. The most interesting morality play is ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' which depicts [[Human|mankind]]'s progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is ''[[Everyman]]''. Everyman receives [[Death]]'s summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by [[Kinship|Kindred]], [[Good (economics)|Goods]], and Fellowship – only [[Good works|Good Deeds]] goes with him to the grave.

At the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the [[Great Hall]] of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a "screen" at the other for the actors. Also important were [[Mummers Play|Mummers' plays]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season, and court [[masque]]s. These masques were especially popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] who had a House of Revels built and an [[Master of the Revels|Office of Revels]] established in 1545.&lt;ref name="BH101"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103)&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the banning of religious plays in many countries. [[Elizabeth I]] forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the [[Netherlands]] in 1539, the [[Papal States]] in 1547 and in [[Paris]] in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.&lt;ref name="BH101"/&gt;

===After the Middle Ages===
{{Main|Early modern period}}

After the end of the late Middle Ages period, the [[Renaissance]] spread unevenly over continental Europe from the southern European region. The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era. Europeans would later begin an [[Age of Discovery|era of world discovery]]. Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of [[printing]] which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Europeans also discovered new trading routes, as was the case with [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]’ travel to the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]]’s circumnavigation of [[Africa]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]] in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.

By the end of the 15th century the [[Ottoman Empire]] had advanced all over [[Southeastern Europe]], eventually conquering the [[Byzantine Empire]] and extending control over the Balkan states. Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East, and fought to keep its rule over a period of two centuries. After the tragic death of the young king [[Vladislaus I of Hungary]] during the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444 against the Ottomans, the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count [[John Hunyadi]], who became Hungary's regent-governor (1446–1453). Hunyadi was considered one of the most relevant military figures of the 15th century: Pope [[Pius II]] awarded him the title of ''Athleta Christi'' or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe.

Hunyadi succeeded during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] in 1456 against the Ottomans, the biggest victory against that empire in decades. This battle became a real Crusade against the Muslims, as the peasants were motivated by the Franciscan monk Saint [[John of Capistrano]], who came from Italy predicating Holy War. The effect that it created in that time was one of the main factors that helped in achieving the victory. However the premature death of the Hungarian Lord left [[Pannonia]] defenseless and in chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Draskóczy, István (2000). '''A tizenötödik század története'''. Pannonica Kiadó. Budapest: Hungary.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extremely unusual event for the Middle Ages, Hunyadi's son, Matthias, was elected as King of Hungary by the nobility. For the first time, a member of an aristocratic family (and not from a royal family) was crowned.&lt;ref&gt;Engel Pál, Kristó Gyula, Kubinyi András. (2005) Magyarország Története 1301- 1526. Budapest, Hungary: Osiris Kiadó.&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]] (1458–1490) was one of the most prominent figures of the period, directing campaigns to the West, conquering Bohemia in answer to the Pope's call for help against the Hussite Protestants. Also, in resolving political hostilities with the German emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]], he invaded his western domains. Matthew organized the [[Black Army of Hungary|Black Army]] of mercenary soldiers; it was considered as the biggest army of its time. Using this powerful tool, the Hungarian king led wars against the Turkish armies and stopped the Ottomans during his reign. After the death of Matthew, and with end of the Black Army, the Ottoman Empire grew in strength and Central Europe was defenseless. At the [[Battle of Mohács]], the forces of the Ottoman Empire annihilated the Hungarian army and [[Louis II of Hungary]] drowned in the Csele Creek while trying to escape. The leader of the Hungarian army, Pál Tomori, also died in the battle. This is considered to be one of the final battles of Medieval times.&lt;ref&gt;Fügedi, Erik. (2004). '''Uram Királyom'''. Fekete Sas Kiadó Budapest:Hungary.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Mangrove''' was a [[Caribbean]] restaurant located at 8 All Saints Road, [[Notting Hill]], west London. It was opened in 1968 by [[Trinidad]]ian community [[activist]] and [[civil rights]] campaigner [[Frank Crichlow]].&lt;ref name=Jasper&gt;[[Lee Jasper|Jasper, Lee]], [http://operationblackvote.wordpress.com/2010/09/17/obituary-a-tribute-to-frank-crichlow-founder-of-mangrove-community-association/ "Obituary: Frank Crichlow, founder of Mangrove Community Association"], OBV, 17 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the El Rio before it — a coffee bar run by Crichlow at 127 Westbourne Park Road in the early 1960s that attracted attention in the [[Profumo affair]], as one of the places frequented by [[Christine Keeler]]&lt;ref name=Busby /&gt; and [[Stephen Ward]] — the Mangrove was a meeting place for the black community in the area, as well as for white radicals, artists, authors, and musicians.&lt;ref name=BunceIndy /&gt; Famous customers included [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Bob Marley]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Lionel Morrison]], [[Norman Beaton]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Colin MacInnes]], [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]] and [[Anthony Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Tony Gifford]].&lt;ref name=BunceIndy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Busby&gt;[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/26/frank-crichlow-obituary-civil-rights-activist "Frank Crichlow obituary"], ''The Guardian'', 26 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A small newspaper, ''The Hustler'', was published on the premises, underlining the community aspect of the restaurant,&lt;ref name=BunceIndy&gt;Bunce, Robin, and Paul Field,[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/frank-critchlow-community-leader-who-made-the-mangrove-restaurant-the-beating-heart-of-notting-hill-2086839.html "Frank Critchlow: Community leader who made the Mangrove Restaurant the beating heart of Notting Hill"], ''The Independent'', 23 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which also served as an informal head office for the [[Notting Hill Carnival]].&lt;ref name="Cohen1993" /&gt;

==The Mangrove Nine==
{{Main|Mangrove nine}}
In 1969 the Mangrove restaurant became the target of police attention that seemed designed to close it down. Robin Bunce and Paul Field write in ''[[The Independent]]'' that it was raided 12 times between January 1969 and July 1970,&lt;ref name=BunceIndy /&gt; and in August that year a protest march was organized demanding "hands off the Mangrove". The protest ended in violence and the arrests of nine protesters (the "Mangrove Nine"), including Crichlow, [[Althea Jones LeCointe|Althea Jones Lecointe]] and [[Darcus Howe]], on charges that included conspiracy to incite a riot. Their celebrated trial  in 1971 — which featured an unsuccessful demand by Howe for an all-black jury — ended with the acquittal of all nine on the incitement charges, and five of the nine, including Crichlow and Howe, on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/7days/9/issue9-home_special.pdf "The Mangrove Trial is over with Five acquitted and Four on suspended sentences"], ''7 Days'', 22 December 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Bunce and Field write that the Mangrove Nine "turned the fight against police racism into a cause célèbre."&lt;ref name=Bunce&gt;Bunce, Robert, and Paul Field, [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary "Mangrove Nine: the court challenge against police racism in Notting Hill"], ''The Guardian'', 29 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A documentary film, ''The Mangrove Nine'' (directed by [[Franco Rosso]], produced by Rosso and [[John La Rose]], with [[Horace Ové]] as associate producer, and scripted by La Rose),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402359/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm "The Mangrove Nine (1973): Full Cast &amp; Crew"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; was made in 1973, and includes interviews with the defendants recorded before the final verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://black-history-month.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=501:mangrove-nine&amp;catid=69:uk-events&amp;Itemid=101 "Mangrove Nine"], Black History Month.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Anne Everett Green''', ''née'' Wood (19 July 1818 – 1 November 1895) was an English historian. After establishing a reputation for scholarship with two multi-volume books on royal ladies and noblewomen, she was invited to assist in preparing [[Calendar (archives)|calendars]] (abstracts) of hitherto disorganised historical [[state papers]]. In this role of "calendars editor", she participated in the mid-19th-century initiative to establish a centralised national archive. She was one of the most respected female historians in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain.

==Family and early career==
Mary Anne Everett Wood was born in [[Sheffield]] to a [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Methodist]] minister, Robert Wood, and his wife Sarah. Her father was responsible for her education, offering an extensive knowledge of history and languages, and she benefited from mixing with her parents' intellectual friends including [[James Everett (Methodist)|James Everett]], the minister and writer, after whom she was named.

When the family moved to London in 1841 she began researching in the [[British Museum]] and elsewhere, and during the 1840s she worked on ''Letters of Royal and Illustrious Ladies'' (1846) and ''Lives of the Princesses of England: from the Norman Conquest '' (1849–1855). She had started work on this book in 1843, using private libraries like that of the rich collector Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]], as well as archives like those at [[Lambeth Palace]]. After her marriage to the painter George Pycock Green in 1845, they travelled for the sake of his artistic career, and she was able to research her subject further in [[Paris]] and [[Antwerp]]. ''Lives of the Princesses'' was praised by the antiquary [[Dawson Turner]] and by the historian Sir [[Francis Palgrave]] among others.

Palgrave, the first Deputy Keeper of the [[Public Record Office]] (PRO), had met Green, was impressed with her scholarship, especially her knowledge of languages, and recommended her to his superior [[John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly|John Romilly]], the [[Master of the Rolls]]. Romilly was continuing [[Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale|Lord Langdale]]'s work of overseeing the establishment of a national archive (the PRO), and publishing some of the documents it held. Numerous [[state papers]] which had been assembled from different locations were studied and summarised, and then the abstracts were arranged in chronological order in the form of "[[Calendar (archives)|calendars]]".

In 1854 Romilly invited Green to become an external calendars editor. In her first few years doing this work she gave birth to two of her three daughters, one of whom, [[Evelyn Everett-Green]], became a novelist. Mary Anne Everett Green's son had been born in 1847 but died in 1876. Her husband became disabled and it was important for her to earn an income. While supplementing her work at the PRO with journalism, she pursued some private research but had no time to complete a planned book on the [[House of Hanover|Hanover]]ian queens.

==Public records==
Unlike the full-time employees doing similar work, such as Sir [[Thomas Duffus Hardy]], and the three male free-lancers working on the calendars, who all had paid assistance, Green's only helper was her sister [[Esther Wood|Esther]], but she became the "most highly respected" and "most efficient compiler of calendars".&lt;ref&gt;Christine L. Krueger, ODNB&lt;/ref&gt; She sometimes complained about being paid less than the men, and also disputed editorial questions with her superiors. Romilly did eventually agree to her suggestion of historical prefaces written by herself and the other editors, and these came to be seen as an essential part of the calendars. Green herself wrote 700 pages of prefaces which amount to a history of seventeenth-century England.&lt;ref&gt;Christine L. Krueger, ''Why she lived at the PRO''&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four decades Green edited 41 volumes starting with ''Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of [[James I of England|James I]]'' (4 volumes, 1857–9). By the time she completed ''Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'' in 1872, reviewers considered she had established a model for such work; with more detailed abstracts than many other calendars, as well as the highest standards of scholarship, her work "came to be recognized as the standard to be followed by all editors".&lt;ref&gt;Christine L. Krueger, ''Why she lived at the PRO''&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other 19th-century women historians, Green tended to concentrate her work in fields seen as suited to "feminine" talents: research into queens and ladies, private lives, and the deciphering, translation and compilation of historical documents, for instance. One of her earliest books was prefaced by her asking the reader not to criticise her for having "ventured upon a field usually occupied only by the learned of the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;''Illustrious Ladies'' quoted by Anne Laurence&lt;/ref&gt; Her calendar prefaces, though, were an opportunity to write on broader, more "masculine" themes, like the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], earning respect for the overall quality and "strict historical accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Masson]], quoted by Christine L. Krueger in ''Why she lived at the PRO''&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of only three women to sign a public petition in 1851 asking the PRO to offer free access to its records for serious scholars, a request which was granted in 1852. Alongside 80 men's signatures, including those of [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]], and [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], were the women historians who depended on detailed study of freshly discovered original sources to claim authority for their work:&lt;ref&gt;Anne Laurence&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agnes Strickland]] and [[Lucy Aikin]] were the other two.

Green went on working at the PRO until shortly before she died, aged 77, at home in London on 1 November 1895, having passed her research on the [[House of Hanover|Hanover]]ian queens to her friend [[A. W. Ward]]. Her work at the PRO was continued by the niece she had trained: Sophia Crawford Lomas. Both Ward and Lomas helped ensure that her ''Elizabeth, Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia'' (1909) appeared posthumously. Other books of hers include ''Diary of John Rous'' (1856) and ''Letters of Queen Henrietta Maria'' (1857). She was also known for her philanthropy.

==Strategy==
For the first time, the Pakistani military implemented a military strategy called "Seek, Destroy, Clear, Hold." The Pakistani military will seek the target. Once found, it will be destroyed. When destroyed, the infrastructure, bodies and weapons will be cleared and the area will be held both during this time and after its completion to ensure post-operation security and infrastructure rebuilding and/or area rehabilitation. The [[Seek and Destroy]] component is from the [[Vietnam War]] whereas the [[Clear and hold]] component is from the [[Iraq War]]. The Pakistani military combined the two doctrines as a single doctrine for the operation to be successful.

==Background==

==={{anchor|Peace-negotiations}}Peace negotiations===
Peace negotiations with the [[Taliban]] were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] after his election,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|author=Shahzeb Jillani |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26065385 |title=Pakistan enters peace talks with Taliban |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qhy9iNEJ | archivedate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani Government]] and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26731838 |title=First day of Pakistan Taliban peace talks concluded |publisher=BBC |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhyCYa5e | archivedate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The terrorists called for the implementation of [[Sharia]] in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held within the framework of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Pakistani constitution]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1090330/pakistani-taliban-announce-month-long-ceasefire |title=Pakistani Taliban announce month-long ceasefire&amp;nbsp;– Pakistan |work=Dawn|location=Pakistan |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhyFIeIf | archivedate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the meetings at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, negotiations also involved helicopter travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The government had indicated that stronger military action would be implemented if the talks failed.&lt;ref name="bbc2" /&gt;

==State's Counter-retaliation==
{{Main|2014 Peshawar school massacre|l1=Targeted killings of TTP terrorists by Pakistan Armed Forces and police encounters in Pakistan}}
Responding to TTP's retaliatory attacks, [[State of Pakistan|Pakistan]] has mounted deadliest counter-retaliation on [[Pakistani Taliban|TTP]]; first removing the moratorium on executions of terrorists by the Presidential Order, and secondly establishing military courts commissions (roughly based on [[Guantanamo military commission|Gitmo]]). Pakistani authorities have issued [[Hanging|"hang till death"]] orders to [[jail superintendent]]s at the nationwide [[National Academy for Prisons Administration|prisons]]. In weeks, a number of [[high-value detainees]] convicted on a terrorism charges were hanged.

Since December 2014, Pakistan's [[Pakistani intelligence community|intelligence community]], [[Law enforcement in Pakistan|law enforcement agencies]], antiterrorism forces, and [[Administrative units of Pakistan|inter-provincial]] [[Police Service of Pakistan|police]] have been engaged in deadly [[police encounter]]s in all over the country. [[News channels in Pakistan|News media]] have been televising the live actions on tracking down the militants and targeting the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] operatives in series of [[police encounter]]s. In the afternoon of 20 December, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police|KP Police]] and the [[special agent]]s of the [[Federal Investigation Agency|FIA]] raided a safe house in Shabqadar, a town located in {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Peshawar. In an exchange of fire at the safe house, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police|KPK police]] and the other law enforcement agencies gunned down the six TTP fighters, including their commander and two other high-value targets who assisted in the attack.&lt;ref name="Dunya News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Six militants killed in Peshawar operation|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/250949-Six-militants-killed-in-Peshawar-operation|accessdate=20 December 2014|publisher=Dunya News|date=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the night of 20 December, the team of [[Pakistan Rangers]] personnel raided a [[Safe house, Pakistan|safe house]] in [[Manghopir]] area of Karachi and killed five members of the TTP in a  deadly shoot out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rangers kill three 'terrorists' in Karachi shootout|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-169225-Rangers-kill-three-terrorists-in-Karachi-shootout--|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2014, [[Sindh Police|Karachi Police]] and the [[Crime Investigation Department (Pakistan)|CID teams]] chased down and killed the TTP leader, Abid Muchar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TTP commander Abid Muchar, three militants killed in Karachi|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/809291/ttp-commander-abid-muchar-three-militants-killed-in-karachi/|accessdate=22 December 2014|publisher=Express Tribunes|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his three associates in a [[police encounter]]. The same night, another action in took place in [[Karachi]] when the [[CID (Pakistan)|CID teams]], in a [[High speed chase|high-speed chase]] in [[Hawke's Bay Beach]], chased and apprehended five members of [[Al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda's]] [[Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent|South Asian chapter]] who are suspected of planning an attack on a [[Karachi Naval Dockyard|naval dockyard in Karachi]] in September.

Acting on a [[Military Intelligence (Pakistan)|MI]] information, the navy's [[Special Services Group Navy|SSGN]] teams were inserted in secret hideout in [[Khyber Agency]] and stalked the six terrorists led by Saddam Jan— the mastermind of the Army Public School attack— at the midnight of 26 December 2014.&lt;ref name="Telegraph, Pakistan Bureau, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yusufzai|first1=Ashfaq|title=Mastermind of Peshawar school attack killed|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/11313678/Mastermind-of-Peshawar-school-attack-killed.html|agency=Telegraph, Pakistan Bureau|publisher=Telegraph, Pakistan Bureau, 2014|date=26 December 2014|quote=Pakistan says it has killed the alleged mastermind of a school attack in Peshawar that claimed the lives of 132 children |accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a late night operations, the [[Special Services Group Navy|SSGN]] combat teams reportedly hunted and killed Jan along with his six militants, while trying to seek sanctuary. An unnamed senior [[Pakistan Government|Pakistan government]] official confirmed the report.&lt;ref name="Telegraph, Pakistan Bureau, 2014"/&gt;

The '''origin of water on Earth''', or the reason that there is clearly more liquid [[water]] on [[Earth]] than on the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the [[Solar System]], is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over [[history of Earth|the past 4.5 billion years]] in sufficient quantity to form [[ocean]]s.

==Possible sources==

===Extraplanetary sources===
[[Comet]]s, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, or water-rich [[meteoroid]]s ([[protoplanet]]s) from the outer reaches of the [[asteroid belt]] colliding with Earth may have brought water to the world's oceans.

Large-enough [[planetesimal]]s were heated by the decay of [[aluminium-26]]. This could cause water to rise to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-earth.html|title=How Earth was watered|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient [[eucrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Adam R.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Sune G.|last3=Marschall|first3=Horst R.|last4=McCubbin|first4=Francis M.|last5=Monteleone|first5=Brian D.|date=2014-10-31|title=Early accretion of water in the inner solar system from a carbonaceous chondrite–like source|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623|journal=Science|language=en|volume=346|issue=6209|pages=623–626|doi=10.1126/science.1256717|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25359971|bibcode=2014Sci...346..623S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of [[deuterium]] to [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (D/H ratio) in the four comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]], [[Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake]], [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], and [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], by researchers such as [[David Jewitt]], is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the [[Kuiper belt]]. According to Alessandro Morbidelli,&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Morbidelli et al. [[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]] 35, 2000, S. 1309–1329&lt;/ref&gt; the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;H. Genda, M. Ikoma, Origin of the Ocean on the Earth: Early Evolution of Water D/H in a Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere. Accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2025&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.

Recent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=Common source for Earth and Moon water|journal=Nature|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2013.12963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel discovers water vapour around dwarf planet Ceres|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Herschel_discovers_water_vapour_around_dwarf_planet_Ceres|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.&lt;ref name="source_mrk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="source_mrk2"/&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less [[mass]]ive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser [[noble gas]]es in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.

Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact which created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |title=Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kxiqRQz?url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with hydrogen and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{Convert|230|C|}} because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. As cooling continued, [[subduction]] and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] cycles appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=N.

The [[Cool early Earth]] theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.

In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of [[plate tectonics]] as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the [[Hadean|Hadean period]] are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing [[greenhouse effect]]s, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/science/02eart.html?8dpc |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A New Picture of the Early Earth |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of organisms==
Some terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], via [[redox|redox reactions]] and [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans"&gt;{{citation|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria ([[purple sulfur bacteria]]) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Niel|first=C.B.|title=Photosynthesis of bacteria|journal=Arch. Mikrobiol.|date=1931|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S

Few modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">The '''patriarchal age''' is the era of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], according to the narratives of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12–50. (These chapters also contain the history of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], although Joseph is not one of the patriarchs.) It is preceded in the Bible by the [[primeval history]] and followed by [[The Exodus]].

==Jewish tradition==
The Bible contains an intricate pattern of chronologies from the creation of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first man, to the reigns of the later kings of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Based on this chronology and the Rabbinic tradition, ancient Jewish sources such as [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] date the birth of [[Abraham]] to 1948 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] (c. 1813 BCE)&lt;ref name="abraham_jvl"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/abraham.html Jewish Virtual Library: Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; and place the death of [[Jacob]] in 2255 AM (c. 1506 BCE).

==Biblical criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
History known and dateable independently from the Bible first makes contact with the Scriptures during the era of the first Jewish kings. As such, the events before this period came to be disputed with the advent of [[biblical criticism]] in the 19th century. Little interest in questioning the [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]] existed before then, but with the development of the [[documentary hypothesis]] – the theory that the [[Pentateuch]], including the [[Book of Genesis]], was composed not by [[Moses]] but by unknown authors living at various times between 950 and 450 BC.

==Early biblical archaeology==
Out of this heated debate between the various theories of [[biblical criticism]] and traditional, religious interpretations was born [[biblical archaeology]], a form of archaeology different from others in that it sought not to discover and interpret mute evidence, but to validate or invalidate the historicity of the patriarchs and the events surrounding their lives, as described within the Bible.

The most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was [[William F. Albright]], who believed that he had identified the patriarchal age in the period 2100–1800 BC, the Intermediate [[Bronze Age]], the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient [[Canaan]]. Albright argued that he had found evidence of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|sudden collapse]] of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] from the northeast whom he identified with the [[Amorites]] mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright, [[E. A. Speiser]] and [[Cyrus Gordon]] argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: "We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals."&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, "History of Israel", 1972, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblical archaeology==
Albright's interpretation came under fierce criticism as archaeology unearthed apparent [[anachronism]]s in the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age, in some cases suggesting that some of the texts were written later than the traditional dates. For example, in Genesis 21:32, Abraham apparently encounters [[Philistines]], who (according to archaeology{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}) actually did not settle in the Middle East until the 12th century BCE. However, usage of future place names had been a known Scriptural phenomenon to Jewish scholars for centuries prior to the biblical criticism movement.&lt;ref name="rashi_ber2"&gt;For instance, the classic tenth-century commentator [[Rashi]] notes that the Bible sometimes refers to places according to the names that later peoples created for them, as in his comment on Gen. 2:14: "Cush and Assyria: As yet they did not exist and Scripture wrote [using] their future names." Similarly in chapter 21, the Bible never actually calls Abimelech and his subjects "Philistines," but only says that they returned to "the land [that would become that] of the Philistines."&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] from 2014 discovered what may be the earliest domesticated [[camel]] bones found in Israel or even anywhere outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This has been described as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news| last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091 |accessdate=30 January 2014 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sapir-Hen |first=Lidar |author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley |journal=Tel Aviv |year=2013 |volume=40 |pages=277–285 |url= http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2014 |doi= 10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albright himself saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;Heide, Martin. 2011 "The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible."

[[File:Puffy Shirt 2006.jpg|thumb|The famous ''[[Seinfeld]]'' [[The Puffy Shirt|"puffy shirt"]], an example of a poet shirt blouse.]]
A '''poet shirt''' (also known as a '''poet blouse''' or '''pirate shirt''') is a type of [[shirt]] made as a loose-fitting [[blouse]] with [[Sleeve#Types of sleeves|full bishop sleeves]], usually decorated with large [[Ruffle|frills]] on the front and on the cuffs.&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Givhan, "Renewed white shirt fashion's new palette", ''Herald-Journal'', September 30, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it has a laced-up V-neck opening, designed to pull over the head, but can have a full-length opening fastened by buttons. The [[Collar (clothing)|collar]] may be standing or folded over with points. Fabrics commonly used in its manufacture include [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[velvet]] and [[satin]], while frills may be of the same fabric or of [[lace]]. Originally intended as a male garment, it is also worn by women today (though still interchangeably referred to as both a "shirt" and a "blouse" regardless of which gender is wearing it).&lt;ref&gt;Gavenas, Mary Lisa. ''The Fairchild Encyclopedia of Menswear'' (2008), p.47. {{ISBN|978-1-56367-465-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although descended from the shirts worn by men in the 17th and 18th centuries, the modern poet blouse combines two aspects: the fineness of ruffled shirts worn as an undergarment by aristocrats and the informality of plain shirts worn (normally open-necked) as a standalone garment by workmen. Inspired by [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Richard. ''The Romantic Poets and their Circle'' (2005), p.7. {{ISBN|978-1-85514-355-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon-Jones, Christine. ''Byron: The Image of the Poet'' (2008), p.85. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-997-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a popular style for boys during the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Historical Boys' Clothing - Blouses: http://histclo.com/style/shirt/Blouse/blouse.html&lt;/ref&gt; and for the pseudo-historical costumes worn by Hollywood actors portraying characters such as swordsmen or pirates during the 20th century. 

One example of this is professional musician/actor [[Meat Loaf]], who has been known for his eccentric on-stage attire since the late 1970s, which typically consists of either sequined black vests, or a tuxedo consisting of a black blazer, matching pants &amp; shoes, and a white poet blouse with a red handkerchief, which he holds in his hand or ties to the microphone stand. Many fans &amp; music reviewers such as inthestudio.net would come to refer to this look as his "prom tux" in popular culture, as this type of suit is most commonly associated with high school proms.

A tailored version of the poet shirt became highly fashionable for young men during the 1960s, particularly in London. Jane Ormsby Gore described her discussions at that time with her then husband, [[Michael Rainey]], who owned a men's clothing shop in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]: "We were very influenced by [[Byron]] … those Byron shirts with frilly fronts and big sleeves".&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of interview with Jane Ormsby Gore in March 2006. ''V&amp;A Museum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Epitomised by bands such as [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]], the vogue for [[Androgyny|androgynous]] frilly blouses played a significant part in the [[New Romanticism|New Romantic]] male fashion of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs, Peter &amp; Storry, Mike. ''Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture'' (1999), p.23. {{ISBN|978-0-415-14726-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the style remains popular in some modern movements such as the [[Gothic fashion|Goth subculture]], where it may be valued simply for its romantic or swashbuckling image, intended as part of a themed costume (e.g. [[vampire]]) or worn in defiance of mainstream conventions as a deliberate expression of gender ambiguity (in the same tradition as [[glam rock]]&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d388|pure_url=yes}} "Glam rock"], ''Allmusic''.&lt;/ref&gt;).

A ruffled poet shirt, often worn with a wide belt or other item of clothing traditionally associated with [[Pirates in popular culture|pirates]], has been the central theme of a spate of fashion trends stimulated by the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' series of adventure films, the first of which was released in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"Yo-ho-ho and a barrel of fun", ''Orlando Sentinel'', October 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raven Penny is a coin of the Viking [[Olaf Guthfrithson]] who was the king of [[Dublin]] between 934-941.

==History==

Anlaf Guthfrithson was a member of the [[Norse-Gael]] [[Uí Ímair]] dynasty and King of Dublin from 934 to 941. He succeeded his father, [[Gofraid ua Ímair]], who was also briefly king of [[Jorvik|York]] in 927 following the death of his kinsman [[Sitric Cáech]], but was expelled in the same year by king Æthelstan of England.

During the short reign of Anlaf Guthfrithsson the Raven Penny was minted by [[Aethelferd]] between 939-941. The inscription on the Raven Penny mentions among other things “King Anlaf”.

==Legend and Images==

'''Obverse'''

A [[raven]] with wings displayed and the encircled legend: +ANLAF CVNVNC. The legend means “King Anlaf”.

'''Reverse'''

A small [[cross pattée]] and the encircled legend: +EDELFERD MINETRE. The legend means “Moneyer Aethelferd”. 

'''Interpretation'''

The legend CVNVNC on the obverse is the word [[Konungr]] in [[Old Norse]] written in the [[Latin alphabet]] minus the letter r. CVNVNC is most likely a [[transliteration]] from [[Younger Futhark]] into 10th century Latin:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecurmsundisc.com/rune-script/transliteration/ The Curmsun Disc - Transliteration]&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[inscription]] is the earliest known surviving texts in Old Norse in the Latin alphabet. 
The use of Old Norse language instead of Latin coupled with the raven image, associated with the [[List of Germanic deities|Norse god]] [[Odin]], is a strong indication that the Vikings were declaring their independence in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/10827208/%C3%93l%C3%A1fr_s_Raven_Coin_Old_Norse_myth_in_circulation Leon Wild, ''Óláfr’s raven coin: Old Norse myth in circulation?

Alexander's death launched a sequence of events that culminated in the [[Decembrist revolt]] and the accession of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].|alt=White plaster death mask of Alexander I on display in the Historical Museum in Moscow.]]

The '''Russian interregnum of 1825''' began {{OldStyleDateNY|December 1|November 19}} with the death of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] in [[Taganrog]] and lasted until the accession of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and the suppression of the [[Decembrist revolt]] on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 26|December 14}}. In 1823 Alexander secretly removed his brother [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Constantine]] from the [[order of succession]], after Constantine informed Alexander he had no intention of ruling the Empire, and appointed Nicholas [[heir presumptive]]. Unprecedented secrecy backfired with a dynastic crisis that placed the whole [[House of Romanov]] at peril. Only three men, apart from Alexander himself, were fully aware of his decision,&lt;ref name=S388/&gt; and none of them was present in the [[Winter Palace]] when the news of Alexander's death reached [[Saint Petersburg]] on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 9|November 27}} 1825.

Military governor [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich|Mikhail Miloradovich]] persuaded hesitant Nicholas to pledge allegiance to Constantine, who then lived in [[Warsaw]] as the [[viceroy of Poland]]. The [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], faced with a legal [[Gordian Knot]], concurred with Miloradovich; the civil government and the troops stationed in Saint Petersburg recognized Constantine as their sovereign – a sovereign who did not intend to reign. As ''[[The Times|The Times of London]]'' observed, the Russian Empire had "two self-denying Emperors and no active ruler".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw, carried by mounted messengers, took two weeks. Constantine repeated his renunciation of the crown and blessed Nicholas as his sovereign but refused to come to Saint Petersburg, leaving the dangerous task of resolving the crisis to Nicholas alone.

Evidence of the brewing [[Decembrist revolt]] compelled Nicholas to act. In the first hour of {{OldStyleDateNY|December 26|December 14}} he proclaimed himself [[Tsar#Full style of Russian Sovereigns|Emperor of All the Russias]]. By noon the civil government and most of the troops of Saint Petersburg pledged allegiance to Nicholas but the Decembrists incited three thousand soldiers in support of Constantine and took a stand on [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]]. Nicholas crushed the revolt at a cost of 1,271 lives&lt;ref name=N117&gt;Nechkina, p. 117, analyzed different numbers from different sources. Nicholas released an estimate of 80 dead. The most credible report, according to Nechkina, was authored by S. N. Korsakov of Saint Petersburg police and counted 1,271 dead of whom 903 were civilians of low classes ({{lang-ru|чернь}}, "the mob").&lt;/ref&gt; and became an undisputed sovereign. He ruled the empire in an authoritative reactionary manner for 29 years.

The first historic study of the interregnum, [[Modest von Korff]]'s ''Accession of Nicholas I'', was commissioned by Nicholas himself. Memoirists, historians and fiction authors sought alternative explanations of the apparently irrational behaviour of the Romanovs. [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorists]] named Alexander, Nicholas, Miloradovich and [[Dowager Empress]] [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria]], alone or in various alliances, as the driving forces behind the events of November–December 1825.

|}

[[Alexander I of Russia]], the elder of four sons of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], had no male issue; his legitimate daughters died in infancy. According to the 1797 [[Pauline Laws]] his childless brother Constantine had been [[heir presumptive]] since Alexander's accession. The third brother, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas]], followed him in the [[order of succession]]. Constantine and his legitimate wife [[Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] separated in 1799. Juliane returned to Germany and resisted any proposals to restore the family. Constantine, engaged in the action of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], did not attempt a formal divorce until meeting [[Joanna Grudzińska]]. Their love affair that began in 1815 compelled Constantine to divorce Juliane and marry Joanna.&lt;ref&gt;Schilder 1901, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine divorced Juliane ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' on {{OldStyleDateNY|April 2|March 20}}, 1820. On the same day Alexander appended the Pauline Laws with a principle that a marriage between a member of the House of Romanov and a person of lesser standing could not confer on the latter the rights of the House, and that their offspring were barred from the order of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp.31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; On {{OldStyleDateNY|May 24|May 12}} of the same year, Constantine married Joanna, who was created Duchess of [[Łowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 32; Seton-Watson, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine had no intention of ruling the Empire and retired to Warsaw as the viceroy of [[Congress Poland]]. According to Nicholas, Alexander told him of Constantine's decision to abdicate in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 24-26 and Schilder 1901, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia|Michael]], the youngest of four brothers, he learned about it from Constantine in the summer of 1821.&lt;ref name=K33&gt;Korff, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases the speakers emphasized extreme secrecy of the matter.

Korff wrote that Constantine's [[wikt:renunciation|renunciation]] "was completed or, at all events, received its final arrangement" in the very end of 1821 when all four brothers reunited in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=K36&gt;Korff, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; On  {{OldStyleDateNY|January 26|January 14}}, 1822 Constantine sent "a humble petition" to Alexander, expressing his ''wish'' to pass the rights to the throne to the next in line, Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 38-39, provides English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later Alexander wrote to Constantine that the matter was still not resolved. The closing paragraph was especially ambiguous and could have been interpreted as leaving the final outcome in Constantine's hands: "It therefore remains to herself [Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria]]] as well as to me ... to leave you ''fully at liberty'' to execute your ''irrevocable'' determination...".&lt;ref name=K40&gt;Korff, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secret manifest ===

[[File:Filaret (Drozdov) by Gau.jpg|thumb|right|Metropolitan (in 1823–1825 Archbishop) [[Filaret, Metropolitan of Moscow|Filaret]], author and keeper of the secret Manifest.|alt=]]

In the summer of 1823 minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs [[Alexander Nikolayevich Golitsyn|Alexander Golitsyn]], acting on behalf of Alexander, asked Archbishop of Moscow [[Filaret, Metropolitan of Moscow|Filaret]] to draft a formal manifest that would seal the "final arrangement" made a year and a half earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 42-43. The full text, in English, is provided in Korff, pp. 45-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's usual speechwriter [[Mikhail Speransky]] was cut out the loop.&lt;ref name=K43&gt;Korff, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Golitsyn instructed Filaret to lock the signed manifest, in utmost secrecy, in the [[sanctuary]] of the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Assumption Cathedral]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=K43/&gt; Filaret feared that a document locked in Moscow could not influence the transfer of power to the successor, which would normally take place in Saint Petersburg, and objected to Alexander. The tsar reluctantly agreed and ordered Golitsyn to make three copies and deposit them in sealed envelopes in the [[Most Holy Synod|Synod]], the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] and the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]] in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=K44&gt;Korff, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Filaret insisted that at least the existence of these envelopes must be made known to reliable witnesses, the whole affair "has been preserved as in a tomb, the Imperial secret involving the existence of the empire".&lt;ref name=K53/&gt;

Alexander signed the manifest in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] on {{OldStyleDateNY|August 28|August 16}}, 1823 and brought it to Moscow himself on {{OldStyleDateNY|September 6|August 25}}.&lt;ref name=K49/&gt; According to Alexander's handwriting on the envelope it was "to be opened by the Diocesan of the See of Moscow and the General-Governor of Moscow in the cathedral of Assumption, ''before taking any other steps''."&lt;ref name=K49&gt;Korff, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later Filaret took the envelope inside the cathedral, showed Alexander's seal to three priests and locked the Manifest in the [[altar]].&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor of Moscow [[Dmitry Golitsyn]] remained unaware of the affair altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Saint Petersburg copies", handwritten by Alexander Golitsyn and bearing Alexander's own handwriting on the envelopes, were filed three months later, raising short-lived speculations among the "completely ignorant dignitaries".&lt;ref name=K53&gt;Korff, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Alexander, only [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]], Alexander Golitsyn and Filaret were certainly aware of the existence, contents and location of the manifest and its copies.&lt;ref name=S388&gt;Schilder 1898, vol. 4 p. 388: "No one new about the existence of the Act proclaiming Nicholas the Heir, apart from three statesmen: count Arakcheyev, prince A. I. Golitsyn and archbishop of Moscow Filaret." ({{lang-ru|О существовании акта, назначавшего великого князя Николая Павловича наследником престола, при жизни Александра никто не знал, за исключением трех государственных сановников: графа Аракчеева, князя А. И. Голицына и архиепископа Московского Филарета.}}). Modern historians contest this opinion, arguing that either Empress Maria or Miloradovich or both of them were fully aware of the Manifest.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Korff, Empress Maria was actively engaged in the events of 1821–1822 and knew of the "final arrangement"&lt;ref&gt;Alexander wrote of her as his principal advisor, if not the deciding voice, on succession problem - Korff, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; but not its implementation. Constantine, Nicholas, Michael and Alexander's wife [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elisabeth]] knew even less.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 41, 63, 65-66; Riasanovsky, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for unprecedented secrecy are unknown. Nicholas's bad reputation among the troops is a common explanation. Anatole Mazour wrote that Nicholas was "unacceptable to political circles and most unpleasant to military men"; as the inspector of the Guards he "aroused both the displeasures of higher officers and the hatred of the privates"; but Mazour also admitted that Constantine was "scarcely more agreeable to the military men".&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; Riasanovsky suggested that Alexander wanted to retain freedom to change the 1823 manifest at will.&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conspiracy ===

After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the Russian economy, ravaged by the [[Continental System]]&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 12-15, analyzed the effects of the Continental System on agriculture and industry.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Napoleon's invasion]], slid into a continuous economic crisis. Grain exports were high in 1816–1817, but in 1818–1819 Western European crops recovered and Russian exports plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Landed gentry tried to restore lost income through [[enclosure]]s and driving away redundant [[Russian serfdom|serf peasants]], but Alexander outlawed "emancipation" of serfs without land.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 3-6, analyzed Alexander's motives for the 1808 ban.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic downfall fuelled radical opposition inside [[Russian nobility]]: "it was Alexander's failures to live up to their hopes that led them to take on the task to themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperial treasury was bankrupted by rising state debt and falling revenues. Alexander was aware of the crisis but never tackled its root cause, the oversized peacetime army of 800,000 men.&lt;ref name=KA34&gt;Kagan, pp. 11, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander expected future wars in Southern Europe and the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and feared that mass dismissal of veteran soldiers would cause insurrection. He could not let them go: they were not needed in their native villages, and there were no jobs in the cities. Instead of reducing the army to an affordable peacetime size, Alexander tried to cut spending through the establishment of self-sustaining [[military settlement]]s, which failed "from start to finish".&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, pp. 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced expensive [[Military exercise|field maneuvers]] with drill exercise and parades, alienating experienced commanders and contributing to dissatisfaction of the nobility.&lt;ref name=KA33&gt;Kagan, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union of Salvation|first secret organization]] aspiring to change the system was formed by the veterans of Napoleonic Wars in February 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Their aims varied from establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]] to "getting rid of foreigners and alien influence".&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even considered murdering Alexander I after [[Sergei Petrovich Troubetzkoy|Sergey Trubetskoy]] reported a rumour that Alexander was planning to incorporate [[Kresy|western provinces]] into [[Congress Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818 the organization was reformed into the [[Union of Prosperity]]. In the same year [[Pavel Pestel]], the most radical conspirator, relocated to [[Ukraine]] and began actively recruiting Army officers, the core of the future Southern Society.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 74-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1821 internal conflicts between the radical South and the aristocratic North led to the dissolution of the Union of Prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Northern Society indulged in writing elaborate [[Aristocracy|aristocratic constitutions]] while Pestel and his ring settled on changing the regime by military force.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Pestel's own political program, influenced by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; envisioned "one nation, one government, one language" for the whole country, a uniform Russian-speaking entity with no concessions to ethnic or religious minorities, even the [[Finns]] or the [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the aspirations of the Northern Society, Pestel planned to reduce the influence of landed and financial aristocracy, "the main obstacle to national welfare that could be eliminated only under a republican form of government."&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pestel's influence gradually radicalized the Northern Society and helped in bringing the two groups together. Twice, in 1823 and 1824, the North and the South planned joint strikes against Alexander. The Southern terrorists subscribed to kidnap or kill Alexander during military maneuvers, the North was tasked with inciting revolt in Saint Petersburg. In both cases Alexander changed his itinerary and evaded the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 154-155; Seton-Watson, pp. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; His informers reported a fragmented picture of the conspiracy; Alexander had no [[secret police]] and managed the investigation personally on ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Pestel's third plan shifted the center of insurgence to Saint Petersburg but the death of Alexander caught the conspirators unprepared.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of Alexander ==

[[File:La mort alexandre taganrog.jpg|thumb|right|Death of Alexander. [[Alexander I Palace]] in [[Taganrog]], {{OldStyleDateNY|December 1|November 19}} 1825.|alt=Contemporary drawing of dead Alexander in his bedroom in Taganrog, attended by twelve mourning men.]]

On {{OldStyleDateNY|September 13|September 1}}, 1825&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 60. Troyat, p. 285, dates departure "on the night of September 1" (old style).&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander left Saint Petersburg to accompany the ailing Empress Elizabeth to [[spa]] treatment in [[Taganrog]], then a "rather agreeable town"&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 50. On pp. 50-51 Lee explains how Taganrog transformed from "a town as dirty and neglected as any town in Russia" to a town worthy of hosting the Tsar's residence.&lt;/ref&gt; on the coast of [[Sea of Azov]]. Golitsyn pleaded with Alexander to publish the secret manifest of 1823 but the emperor refused: "Let us rely on God. He will know how to order things better than us mortals."&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The statesmen who accompanied Alexander – [[Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky|Pyotr Volkonsky]], [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] and [[Alexander Chernyshyov]] – were not aware of the manifest.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 62-63; Schilder 1898, vol. 4 p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander and Elizabeth traveled to the south separately; he reached Taganrog {{OldStyleDateNY|September 25|September 13}}, she ten days later.&lt;ref name=T286&gt;Troyat, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Their relations had considerably improved since the death of Alexander's illegitimate daughter Sophie Naryshkina in June 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The reunion in Taganrog, according to Volkonsky, became the couple's second honeymoon&lt;ref name=T286/&gt; (Wortman noted that this and similar sentimental opinions, influenced by Nicholas's propaganda, should not be taken literally&lt;ref name=W130&gt;Wortman, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;).

After a stay with Elizabeth, Alexander left Taganrog on a tour of [[Crimea]] that was cut short by a bout of "bilious remittent fever"&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 45, retells the report by Alexander's physician James Wylie.&lt;/ref&gt; that struck Alexander on {{OldStyleDateNY|November 9|October 27}} in [[Alupka]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 42-43. Schilder 1898, vol. 4 p. 370, also dated the onset of Alexander's terminal illness {{OldStyleDateNY|November 9|October 27}} and noted that at this date it was a mere cold. Troyat, p. 289, dated the onset {{OldStyleDateNY|November 16|November 4}} (when Alexander stayed in Mariupol) but, according to Lee, this was not the ''first'' bout but, rather, the gravest one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan de Witt]] and Alexander Boshnyak, the informers who kept Alexander updated on the unfolding Decembrist conspiracy in the South, were also incapacitated by a similar disease. Conspiracy theorist Vladimir Bryukhanov suggested that all three men were slowly poisoned, contrary to the fact that such fevers were quite common in the marshlands around the [[Sea of Azov]] (Lee, pp. 42-43).&lt;/ref&gt; Return to Taganrog brought no improvement; on November 10 Alexander lost consciousness for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, p. 290. Schilder 1898, vol. 4 pp. 563-567, provides full text of Pyotr Volkonsky's daily records of Alexander's illness starting from his return to Taganrog.&lt;/ref&gt; He "strenuously refused all medical assistance" of his [[Scottish people|Scottish]] physician [[James Wylie]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 41, 46-47. Some English sources render Wylie's name in reverse transliteration from Russian as '' Yakov Vassilievich Villiye'', viz. ''[http://www.scottish-memories.co.uk/magazine-issues/viewissue.asp?issueID=77&amp;page=2 Doctor To The Tsars]'' by Ian Gray.&lt;/ref&gt; Diebitsch reported the state of Alexander's health to Constantine in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Schilder 1898, vol. 4 p. 397. Vasilich, p. 23, noted that Constantine maintained absolute secrecy regarding Alexander's illness. Even their brother Michael was kept out of the loop until the news of Alexander's death reached Warsaw on November 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The disease consumed Alexander and on {{OldStyleDateNY|November 29|November 17}} it seemed that he was in terminal agony. Only then did Diebitsch and Volkonsky notify the court in Saint Petersburg of the inevitable.

Diebitsch promptly dispatched a courier to ''His Majesty Emperor Constantine'' in Warsaw; a second courier left for Saint Petersburg with a letter for Empress Maria.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The courier to Warsaw, owing to shorter distance and better roads, arrived at Constantine's palace two days ahead of the courier sent to Saint Petersburg. Constantine and Michael received the news in the evening&lt;ref name=K64&gt;Korff, p. 64 and Schilder 1898, vol. 4 p. 398: 7 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt; of {{OldStyleDateNY|December 7|November 25}}.&lt;ref name=K61&gt;Korff, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine immediately assembled his court and publicly renounced any claims to the throne. He spent all night drafting the responses to Diebitsch and to ''His Majesty Emperor Nicholas'' and Empress Maria in Saint Petersburg. The messenger, Grand Duke Michael, left Warsaw after dinner on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 8|November 26}}.&lt;ref name=K66&gt;Korff, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interregnum in Saint Petersburg ==

=== Miloradovich ===

Portrait by [[George Dawe]] from the [[Military Gallery of the Winter Palace]]|alt=General Miloradovich in full dress uniform wearing the riband of the Order of Saint Andrew. The portrait was painted by George Dawe in the end of Alexander's reign.]]

In the evening of {{OldStyleDateNY|December 7|November 25}} Governor-General of Saint Petersburg [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich|Mikhail Miloradovich]] brought the news of Alexander's terminal illness to Nicholas. News of Alexander's death arrived in Saint Petersburg on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 9|November 27}}. After a brief meeting with his mother Nicholas publicly pledged his oath to ''Emperor Constantine''. While the public took the decision for granted, Maria was startled: "Nicholas, what have you done? Didn't you know that ''you'' are [[heir presumptive]]?"&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The oath sparked an unprecedented dynastic crisis: two principal contenders forfeited their rights in favor of each other in "a hitherto unheard-of struggle — a struggle not for the acquisition of power, but for its renunciation!".&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The throne remained vacant.

Nicholas took the secret of his decision to his grave. According to Korff, Nicholas did not know the provisions of the 1823 manifest and merely executed his legal and moral obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sergei Petrovich Troubetzkoy|Sergey Trubetskoy]], Nicholas was well aware of his rights but Miloradovich and general [[Alexander Voinov]] compelled him to step back. They met with Nicholas late in the evening of December 7. Miloradovich argued that Nicholas can not reign unless Constantine abdicates in public ''as a reigning Emperor''. Independent action by Nicholas, said Miloradovich, will provoke a civil war because the troops will stand for Constantine. Nicholas reluctantly submitted to the military opposition. Schilder,&lt;ref name=G26&gt;Gordin, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Seton-Watson]],&lt;ref name=W194&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordin,&lt;ref name=G26/&gt; Andreeva&lt;ref&gt;Andreeva, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;  accepted Trubetskoy's account as genuine. Safonov dismissed it as disinformation planted by Nicholas to justify his moment of weakness.&lt;ref name="S01"/&gt;

Miloradovich temporarily assumed [[dictator]]ial power. From this moment and until the outbreak of the Decembrist revolt Miloradovich maintained a confident demeanor and persuaded Nicholas that "the city is quiet and tranquil" despite mounting evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Nicholas's oath to Constantine Miloradovich instructed military commanders to administer the oath in their units.&lt;ref&gt;Trubetskoy, p. 28, wrote that he was startled ({{lang-ru|я был крайне удивлён}}) to see Miloradovich issuing orders and dispatching messengers ''before'' the State Council meeting.&lt;/ref&gt; Miloradovich broke the law twice: by initiating the oath without Constantine's own accession manifest,&lt;ref&gt;Schilder 1901, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and by initiating the oath in the troops before the civil government was sworn in.&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, p. 129; Andreeva, pp. 236-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miloradovich also took care of the original Manifest. His messenger arrived in Moscow on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 11|November 29}}, and informed governor [[Dmitry Golitsyn]] that Constantine was now Emperor, that the city administration must be sworn immediately and that "a certain packet which has been deposited in 1823 in the Cathedral" must remain sealed.&lt;ref name=K102&gt;Korff, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Filaret objected but was compelled to accept the facts. Moscow was sworn to Constantine {{OldStyleDateNY|December 12|November 30}},&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 103-108.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1st Army in [[Mogilev]] on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 13|December 1}}.&lt;ref name=K130/&gt;

=== State council ===

Alexander Golitsyn rushed to Nicholas as soon as learned of the ''[[wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''. Their {{OldStyleDateNY|December 9|November 27}} meeting revealed the depth of the legal crisis that Nicholas had just made worse. Nicholas refused to act contrary to his oath to Constantine; both parties "separated with evident coolness".&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; At 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. Golitsyn opened the extraordinary session of the State Council.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that a copy of Alexander's manifest, written by his own hand, was waiting for the occasion right there, in State Council files, and "bitterly deprecated the unnecessary precipitation in taking the oath". Minister of Justice Lobanov-Rostovsky and admiral [[Alexander Shishkov|Shishkov]] opposed, insisting on the legality of oath to Constantine, but the majority temporarily leaned towards Golitsyn's stance.&lt;ref name=K89/&gt;

Miloradovich, again, interfered in favor of Constantine. According to Trubetskoy, who attended at the Council meeting, the Manifest was presented as Alexander's [[Will (law)|will]], rather than a [[law]]. Miloradovich argued that the Emperor may not appoint a successor through a ''will'' that contradicts pre-existing ''laws'' of succession; the Council can examine the will but may not ''act'' upon it.&lt;ref name=T30&gt;Trubetskoy, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 32, noted that "Alexander's manifesto had precisely the form of a sovereign's personal will and testament in dynastic matters which Paul's law of succession had tried to abolish."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Korff, the Council opened the secret envelope and read the manifest, but Miloradovich barred further talks with an argument that the manifest was already void: "Nicholas has solemnly renounced the right conferred upon him by the said Manifest."&lt;ref name=K89&gt;Korff, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Council members suddenly found themselves in an inconvenient position of "a state authority rather than His Majesty's [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]]".&lt;ref name="Korff, p. 90"&gt;Korff, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of acting on their own they herded into Nicholas' waiting room. Nicholas once again repeated his refusal of the throne and personally administered the council members' oath to Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the day the case appeared to be closed and couriers rushed the news of Constantine's accession to all corners of the empire.&lt;ref name="Korff, p. 90"/&gt;

=== Indecision ===

[[File:Const.jpg|thumb|The [[Constantine ruble]] bearing the profile of ''By God's Grace Constantine, Emperor and Autocrat of All Russias''.|alt=Obverse of a rare coin, the Constantine ruble, featuring the profile of Grand Duke Constantine as a middle-aged man, with an inscription: By God's Grace Emperor and Autocrat of All Russia.]]

On {{OldStyleDateNY|December 15|December 3}} Grand Duke Michael brought Constantine's letters to Saint Petersburg.&lt;!--  He learned of the oath to Constantine in [[Jelgava|Mittau]] from [[Ivan Paskevich]].&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Michael and Empress Maria persuaded Nicholas in the grave error he had made. Nicholas, now confident in his right to take the throne, realised that simply declaring himself emperor would, most likely, cause an insurrection. The only choice left, it seemed, was to invite Constantine to Saint Petersburg and have him formally abdicate in public.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day a courier rushed the invitation to Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; On {{OldStyleDateNY|December 18|December 6}}, Nicholas received a brief letter from Constantine, who firmly refused to travel to the capital, thus denying Nicholas any help in the succession crisis. "If everything is not arranged in accordance with our late Emperor's will", warned Constantine, "I shall remove into a still more distant retirement."&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials of all ranks expected the new tsar just as eagerly. On {{OldStyleDateNY|December 18|December 6}}, Minister of Finance [[Georg von Cancrin]] ordered [[Mint (coin)|minting]] of [[Constantine ruble|a new coin]] bearing the profile of ''Emperor and Autocrat Constantine''. Cancrin attended the {{OldStyleDateNY|December 9|November 27}} meeting of the State Council and was fully aware of the unfolding controversy, yet acted in confidence that Constantine was ''the'' emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoshevich, [http://www.arcamax.ru/books/const/bart1-02.htm p. 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; This confidence persisted despite the suspicious silence of Grand Duke Michael and his retinue. Michael did not pledge allegiance to Constantine and evaded all inquiries about ''His Majesty''. Rumours and speculations made Michael's presence in the palace intolerable and the family council dominated by Empress Maria decided that he must return to Warsaw and personally persuade Constantine to come to Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 121-122, Bartoshevich, [http://www.arcamax.ru/books/const/bart1-01.htm p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria gave Michael a [[wikt:mandate|mandate]] to intercept and read all letters that Constantine could send to her.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael met with Constantine's courier at [[Ninasi|Nennal]]&lt;ref&gt;Present-day [[Ninasi]], [[Lohusuu Parish]], [[Estonia]]&lt;/ref&gt; on {{OldStyleDateNY|December 20|December 8}}. He understood that his mission could not change Constantine's will and decided that he might be more useful to the House in Saint Petersburg rather than Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not mistaken; his arrival in Saint Petersburg on the day of Decembrist revolt became a vital factor in persuading the troops in favor of Nicholas.&lt;ref name=K130&gt;Korff, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last warnings ===

At 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. Saturday, {{OldStyleDateNY|December 24|December 12}}, Colonel Frederics brought Nicholas the "most urgent" report of the mounting conspiracy. The report, authored by [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch|Diebitsch]] and handwritten by [[Alexander Chernyshyov|Chernyshyov]], was addressed to ''His Majesty Emperor Constantine'' – one copy to Saint Petersburg, another one to Warsaw. Hesitating, Nicholas opened the package and "was overwhelmed with unspeakable horror" of the conspiracy among his own Guards.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Diebitsch was confident in containing mutiny in his troops but, as for the rebels in Saint Peterburg and Moscow, he could only provide names.

Nicholas, still hoping to "conceal the whole affair in the closest secrecy" particularly from his mother, summoned Miloradovich and Alexander Golitsyn – the men who already earned his displeasure but whose offices were vital in maintaining order.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 136. Golitsyn, as Minister of Communications, controlled the postal system and the [[black room]] that intercepted suspicious letters.&lt;/ref&gt; A quick search for the people named by Diebitsch brought no result: all were away on [[furlough]],&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; said Miloradovich, and again assured Nicholas that "the city is tranquil". In fact, one person named in the report, [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]] Svistunov, was present in Saint Peterburg and actively coordinated the rebels.

At 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. of the same day Nicholas received a cryptic and threatening message from [[Yakov Rostovtsev]].&lt;ref name=RO&gt;Rostovtsev, a Guards lieutenant recently inducted into the Northern Society, suffered from extreme [[stuttering]] and presented his report in writing. Rostovtsev stuttered for his whole life, yet reached a full general's rank. In 1849 Nicholas appointed Rostovtsev to investigate the case of the [[Petrashevsky Circle]]. Rostovtsev personally interrogated young [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and supervised his [[mock execution]]. - Payne, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Rostovtsev's report did not specify any names but threatened Nicholas with a multitude of disasters. Surprisingly well informed about the correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw, Rostovtsev advised Nicholas to go to Warsaw himself rather than wait for Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; His report, "a candle to the Lord and to Satan",&lt;ref name=M163&gt;Mazour, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; sounded like an [[ultimatum]]: "You have seriously irritated a great number against you. In the name of your own glory I entreat you not to hasten to reign."&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas did not heed Rostovtsev's proposals which ran completely contrary to his plans. In another irrational twist, he treated Rostovtsev with respect and affection, and shielded him from prosecution.&lt;ref name=RO/&gt;

== Accession of Nicholas ==

=== Decision ===

In the afternoon of {{OldStyleDateNY|December 24|December 12}} Nicholas received a letter from Constantine. Once again, Constantine refused to come to Saint Peterburg and blessed Nicholas onto the throne. The letter "terminated all indecision"&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; and started the countdown of "a virtual [[coup d'etat]]".&lt;ref name=W129&gt;Wortman, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas sent a courier for Michael and summoned [[Nikolay Karamzin]] to prepare the draft of his accession manifest.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 142, 155. Karamzin declined the honour and the manifest was authored by [[Mikhail Speransky]].&lt;/ref&gt; He then summoned three key officials representing the Church, the Guards and the civil government, and ordered them to convene a State Council meeting at 8&amp;nbsp;p.m. of the next day. The timing, thought Nicholas, allowed just enough time to bring in Michael, the living proof of his good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Michael was at [[Ninasi|Nennal]], 26&amp;nbsp;versts or 280&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Saint Petersburg. The round trip to [[Ninasi|Nennal]] and back, with all resources of the Empire, could not be made in 24 hours.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the government, and most importantly the troops, were to be sworn on the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas wrote: "On the 14th I will be Emperor or dead."&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-three members of the State Council arrived in due time but Nicholas delayed the announcement for hours, waiting for Michael. Soon after midnight, in the very beginning of {{OldStyleDateNY|December 26|December 14}}, Nicholas realized that no more delays were possible, and walked into the Council hall alone. He "seated himself in the place of the President" and read his accession manifest. This, according to Korff, was the first ever precedent when the State Council convened at night.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas went at lengths in explaining how the legal uncertainty set by Alexander lured him into pledging allegiance to Constantine. He specifically required "that the time of Our accession to the Throne be counted from the 19th day of November 1825", the day of Alexander's death, sealing the fact that Constantine had never reigned and that the oath to Constantine was merely a misunderstanding rectified by Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, p. 4: "This period of time was obliterated by a manifesto of the Emperor Nicholas accession to be kept on 19 November 1825..."&lt;/ref&gt; The State Council accepted the fact without further discussion and was dismissed at about 1 a.m.&lt;ref name=K168&gt;Korff, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt===

[[File:Peterburg, Senate Square, 1825, dec. 14.jpg|thumb|right|Standoff on Senate Square. The wooden fence on the left marked the construction site of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]].|alt=Rebel soldiers, government troops and civilians in folk clothing stand around the stature of Peter I in three concentric circles.]]

{{OldStyleDateNY|December 26|December 14}}, "the longest day" of Nicholas I, coincided with the [[winter solstice]]: the sun rose at 9:04 and set at 2:58.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas assembled military commanders before sunrise. He again explained the background and motives for his decision. There were no objections, and the officers left to administer the oath to Nicholas in their units.&lt;ref&gt;Korf, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miloradovich did not attend this meeting. He arrived at the palace later and again assured Nicholas of "calm and tranquility", dismissing available intelligence. His police spectacularly failed in "a concurrence of other strange blunders, which it is difficult to explain at present".&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas made a blunder of his own, by not printing and distributing copies of the Manifest and thus contributing to the rising agitation among civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, pp. 175-176, 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Decembrists were disorganized: their "dictator" Sergey Trubetskoy did not show up at all,&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 171-175, analyzed Trubetskoy's motives. Trubetskoy's own memoirs omit the revolt altogether.&lt;/ref&gt; "the bravest men among the leaders developed an apathy and unwonted lack of nerve."&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the tsar, they did not attempt to recruit civilian masses.&lt;ref name=M176&gt;Mazour, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oath in the troops proceeded smoothly until the men of Horse Artillery Regiment demanded personal assurance from Grand Duke Michael. Michael had just arrived in Saint Petersburg and Nicholas immediately sent him to speak to the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; At about noon Nicholas learned of the greater threat, the insurrection of the Moscow Regiment. Shouting "Hurrah for Constantine", the rebels took a stand in formation on the Senate Square, encouraged by the masses of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, p. 181, noted that the mob was openly supporting Constantine: he remained their legitimate tsar, and Nicholas did nothing to present his case to the masses.&lt;/ref&gt; By noon the rebel forces on the square counted three thousand men, against already present nine thousand loyalists. Nicholas was there, "pale, weary, and eager to settle the whole affair as soon as possible."&lt;ref name="M176"/&gt;

At around 12:30 Miloradovich tried to speak to the rebel troops and was fatally shot by [[Pyotr Kakhovsky]] and stabbed by [[Yevgeny Obolensky]]. [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]] attempted shooting Grand Duke Michael. Another negotiator, Metropolitan Serafim, was forced away from the square.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas, still hoping to avoid bloodshed,&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 178; Seton-Watson, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; ordered an intimidating [[Charge (warfare)|cavalry charge]] against the rebels. It miserably failed as horses lost balance and fell on icy pavement.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed by, civilians flooded the square, forming a dense circle around the loyalists troops. Nicholas feared that the mob may overwhelm his troops after sunset. Worse, he saw his own soldiers defecting to the rebels.&lt;ref name=N115&gt;Mazour, p. 178; Nechkina, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generals pressed Nicholas for action, [[Karl Wilhelm von Toll]] reproached him: "Let me clear the square with gunfire or abdicate!".&lt;ref name=M178&gt;Mazour, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; At around 4 p.m. Nicholas ordered artillery fire against the rebels who did not dare to attack the batteries or otherwise change the outcome in their favour.&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canister shot]]s killed more civilians than rebel soldiers.&lt;ref name=N116&gt;Nechkina, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Their flight from the square was checked by loyalist battalions blocking escape routes. Tsarist propaganda reported 80 dead,&lt;ref&gt;This was the official body count declared by Nicholas. According to memoirs of baron Kaulbars, reproduced in Vasilich, vol. 2 p. 93, rumour of the day set the number of dead at "70-80". Kaulbars wrote that he had counted 56 dead rebels and five civilians - these bodies were collected from Senate Square and piled near St. Isaac's fence. Apart from these dead, Kaulbars mentioned one killed loyalist of his regiment and "a few" killed in other areas of the city. He did not mention the bodies dumped in the [[Neva River]].&lt;/ref&gt; later studies counted at least 1,271 dead, 903 of them civilians of low birth.&lt;ref name=N117/&gt;

==Aftermath==

{{further|Chernigov Regiment revolt}}

The Southern Society attempted their own revolt: one thousand men of the Chernigov Regiment led by [[Sergey Muravyov-Apostol]] and [[Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin]] ravaged [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] towns and evaded government troops until a defeat at Kovalivka on {{OldStyleDateNY|January 15|January 3}}, 1826. [[Hugh Seton-Watson]] wrote that it was "the first and the last political revolt by army officers"; Nicholas and his successors eradicated liberalism in the troops and secured their unconditional loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after suppressing the revolt in Saint Petersburg Nicholas took control of the investigation. Of six hundred suspects&lt;ref&gt;The total of six hundreds contains the Decembrists along with innocent people, uninvolved family members and fictitious names invented by the suspects. It does not include enlisted men of the mutinous regiments.&lt;/ref&gt; 121 were put on trial. Five leaders were hanged, others exiled to [[Siberia]];&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] most sentences in a demonstration of good will, sending the least offenders to fight as soldiers in the [[Caucasian War]]. Soldiers of the mutinous regiments were [[Running the gauntlet|run through the gauntlet]]. Some died, others ended up fighting in the Caucasus or exiled in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;Nechkina, pp. 134-135; Mazour, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anatole Mazour, the sentence was unusually harsh and revengeful;&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, pp. 214, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Seton-Watson, it was in line with European practice of the time, but nevertheless contributed to public perception of Nicholas as "a dark and sinister figure" and of the Decembrists as selfless martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Challenge to Nicholas rule created an atmosphere of hostility, bitterness and fear ... it remained imprinted in Nicholas's mind as a traumatic moment that justified intensified surveillance and police persecution."&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, p. 128. See also Mazour, pp. 265-266: "he always considered developments from a viewpoint determined by his sad memories of December 14."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Alexander's public image of a liberal conqueror, Nicholas chose to present himself as the defender of order, a distinctively [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalist]] leader protecting the nation from foreign evils.&lt;ref name=W129/&gt; Lack of public support encouraged Nicholas to stage grand ceremonial events; the whole reign was marked by sentimental "demonstrations of attachments and love" to the tsar "who had evoked only antipathy".&lt;ref name=W130&gt;Wortman, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrated the day of his victory over the revolt with for the rest of his life, but the facts and analysis of 1825 events remained censored, contributing to the "Decembrist myth".&lt;ref&gt;Mazour, p. 271; Wortman, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas studied the grievances exposed in the 1826 investigation and incorporated them in his own reform program.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 202. Mazour, pp. 267-268, wrote that Nicholas referred to the report on Decembrist ideas for all his life. Alexander Borovkov, secretary of the 1826 investigation, deliberately biased the report in favor of the Decembrists' most constructive proposals, effectively plagiarizing the Decembrist program.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his good intentions, his administration evolved into an overcentralized, oversized and incompetent system. Instead of managing the country for Nicholas, the system "loaded him with an innumerable magnitude of trivial affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 210, cites memoirs of Modest von Korff.&lt;/ref&gt; It was infested with laziness, indifference and corruption on all levels, although Seton-Watson wrote that the degree of bureaucratic vice has been exaggerated by contemporary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine remained Viceroy of Poland until the [[November uprising]] and died [[Cholera epidemic of 1831|in 1831 of cholera]]. He was "the only person treated by Nicholas as his equal and associate rather than a servant."&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas and Michael remained close until Michael's death of a [[stroke]] in 1849, although Michael's militarism and tyranny over subordinates regularly annoyed Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==

[[File:Maria Fedorovna in mourning by G.Dawe (c.1825, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|right|Empress dowager Maria, mother of Alexander, Constantine and Nicholas, has been the chief suspect of conspiracy theories.|alt=Portrait of a dark-haired ageing woman dressed in black, wearing a black veil, a blue riband and a star of the Order of Saint Andrew, and a medallion with the profile of tsar Paul. It was painted in the year of the interregnum.]]

In 1847 Nicholas commissioned historian [[Modest von Korff]] to write the first history of the interregnum and the Decembrist revolt. Korff received limited but then unprecedented access to private records of the Romanovs and personally interviewed surviving high-ranking witnesses. The first edition, approved by Nicholas, was published in 1848 in mere twenty-five copies. The third, and the first ''public'' edition, was published in 1857 simultaneously in Russian, English, French and German languages. Korff's account, despite constraints of [[censorship]], remains ''the'' mainstream version of the interregnum, but not the revolt. It was accepted in Imperial Russian (Schilder) and [[Soviet historiography]] ([[Militsa Nechkina]]) and in Western academia (Anatole Mazour, [[Vladimir Nabokov]], Hugh Seton-Watson).

Memoirs of the Decembrists contradicted official history and each other. [[Sergei Petrovich Troubetzkoy|Sergey Trubetskoy]], referring to the first report of Alexander's terminal illness received in Saint Petersburg {{OldStyleDateNY|December 7|November 25}}, wrote that "the thought of the successor frightened everybody because the successor ''was unknown''."&lt;ref name=T26&gt;Trubetskoy, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrey Rosen (1799–1884) wrote on the subject of Nicholas's oath to Constantine that "Count Miloradowitsch &lt;small&gt;(sic)&lt;/small&gt; and Prince A. N. Galitzine, who knew the tenor of Alexander's will, exerted themselves in vain to prevent so doing, but Nicholas would not hear of any objection ... it was nevertheless ''everywhere known'' that Constantine has abdicated and that a will of Alexander's was in existence transferring the government to Nicholas... The members of the Senate knew that, since 1823, a will of Alexander's lay among their archives."&lt;ref name=R2&gt;Rosen, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen also speculated that because Nicholas "knew all along of the existence of secret societies" he voluntarily stepped aside "to avoid in this way any occasion of disturbance and discontent."&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet historians concentrated on studies of the Decembrist movement and treated the interregnum as an insignificant episode in the grand picture of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name=S01/&gt; Interregnum resurfaced as an independent research topic in the 1970s. Historians, biographers and fiction authors sought alternative explanations of irrational events and named Alexander, Nicholas, Miloradovich and Empress Maria, alone or in various combinations, as the secret driving forces of the interregnum. None of these alternatives received wide support in academia.

* According to historian Mikhail Safonov, the interregnum was orchestrated by Empress Maria in alliance with Miloradovich. Maria allegedly sought power for herself and used Miloradovich to extract oath to Constantine from Nicholas. As soon as abdication of both Constantine and Nicholas became attested in public, the Crown of Russia would have passed to seven-year-old [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander]]. Maria thus received a solid opportunity to rule the Empire as the [[regent]] for a whole decade. Nicholas realized the threat and launched his own [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref name=S01&gt;Safonov 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Kalinin's 1988 study of the [[Constantine ruble]], Maria and Nicholas acted in accord. They feared that accession of Nicholas in accordance with Alexander's manifest will be opposed as a breach of Pauline laws and needed Constantine's formal abdication as a ''reigning monarch''. Nicholas (not Miloradovich) initiated oath to Constantine with a simple goal of adding more weight to Constantine's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Melnikova, [http://www.arcamax.ru/books/const/meln11.htm p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[Yakov Gordin]] (a poet born in 1935 who switched into history writing in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Polukhina, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;) the interregnum was orchestrated by Miloradovich who acted as an independent dictator. He knew that Constantine, his wartime friend since the [[The Italian and Swiss expedition (1799-1800)|Swiss campaign of 1800]], has no intention to rule. According to Gordin, Miloradovich hoped that the accession of Constantine would elevate him to the top of imperial hierarchy. With this in mind, he mobilized the generals' opposition against Nicholas and tolerated the Decembrist conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordin, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* German writer Vladimir Bryukhanov, in a radical development of Gordin's theory, wrote that Miloradovich was ''the'' puppetmaster of the Decembrists and led an influential military party including Arakcheev, Diebitsch, [[Pavel Kiselyov]] and even doctor Wylie. According to Bryukhanov's [[conspiracy theory]], Miloradovich planned to take over absolute power from the House of Romanov.
* Tatyana Andreeva supported a toned-down version of Gordin's theory. According to Andreeva, Miloradovich assumed dictatorial authority but had no intention to become the "maker of the kings". Rather, he merely attempted to maintain the lawful [[order of succession]] and prevent social unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Andreeva, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space Shuttle ''Discovery''''' ([[Orbiter Vehicle Designation]]: '''OV-103''') is one of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiters]] from [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program]] and the third of five fully operational orbiters to be built.&lt;ref name="ov103"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/discovery-info.html|title=Space Shuttle Overview: Discovery (OV-103)|accessdate=November 6, 2007|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2007|author=NASA|authorlink=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first mission, [[STS-41-D]], flew from August 30 to September 5, 1984. Over 27 years of service it launched and landed 39 times, gathering more spaceflights than any other spacecraft to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/15327-space-shuttle-discovery-10-cool-facts.html |title=10 Cool Facts About NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery &amp;#124; Space Shuttle Retirement |publisher=Space.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discovery'' became the third operational orbiter to enter service, preceded by ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scibuff.com/2011/02/24/discoverys-last-trip-to-space-begins/ |title=Discovery's last mission flight to space begun |date=February 24, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014726/http://www.scibuff.com/2011/02/24/discoverys-last-trip-to-space-begins/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It embarked on its last mission, [[STS-133]], on February 24, 2011 and touched down for the final time at [[Kennedy Space Center]] on March 9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery's Final Touchdown A Success|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/2009363/discoverys_final_touchdown_a_success/|publisher=redOrbit.com|accessdate=March 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617NPuwvi?url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/2009363/discoverys_final_touchdown_a_success|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; having spent a cumulative total of almost a full year in space. ''Discovery'' performed both research and [[International Space Station]] (ISS) assembly missions. It also carried the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] into orbit. ''Discovery'' was the first operational shuttle to be retired, followed by ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' and then ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''.

==History==
The name ''Discovery'' was chosen to carry on a tradition based on ships of exploration,&lt;ref name="ov103"/&gt; primarily {{HMS|Discovery|1774|6}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery (OV-103)|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/discovery.html|website=science.ksc.nasa.gov|accessdate=February 28, 2015|ref=Discovery, the third orbiter to become operational at Kennedy Space Center, was named after one of two ships that were used by the British explorer James Cook in the 1770s during voyages in the South Pacific that led to the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. Another of his ships was the Endeavour, the namesake of NASA's newest orbiter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the ships commanded by Captain [[James Cook]] during his third and final major voyage from 1776 to 1779, and [[Henry Hudson]]'s {{ship||Discovery|1602 ship|2}},&lt;ref name="ov103"/&gt; which was used in 1610–1611 to explore [[Hudson Bay]] and search for a [[Northwest Passage]]. Other ships bearing the name have included {{HMS|Discovery|1874|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Did the Space Shuttle Discovery Get Its Name?|url=http://www.space.com/10908-space-shuttle-discovery-names-origin.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1875–1876 [[British Arctic Expedition]] to the North Pole and {{ship|RRS|Discovery}}, which led the 1901–1904 "[[Discovery Expedition]]" to [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=pao/&gt;

''Discovery'' launched the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and conducted the [[STS-82|second]] and [[STS-103|third]] Hubble service missions. It also launched the [[Ulysses probe|''Ulysses'' probe]] and three [[TDRS]] satellites. Twice ''Discovery'' was chosen as the "Return To Flight" Orbiter, first in 1988 after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']] in 1986, and then again for the twin "Return To Flight" missions in July 2005 and July 2006 after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003. [[Project Mercury]] astronaut [[John Glenn]], who was 77 at the time, flew with ''Discovery'' on [[STS-95]] in 1998, making him the oldest person to go into space.&lt;ref name=over/&gt;

Had plans to launch [[United States Department of Defense]] payloads from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] gone ahead, ''Discovery'' would have become the dedicated [[US Air Force]] shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Transportation System Haer No. TX-116|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2.pdf|website=NASA.gov|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first West Coast mission, [[STS-62-A]], was scheduled for 1986, but [[Canceled Space Shuttle missions|canceled]] in the aftermath of ''Challenger''.

''Discovery'' was retired after completing its final mission, [[STS 133]] on March 9, 2011. The spacecraft is now on display in Virginia at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], an annex of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref name=nasm&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=256|title=Space Shuttle Discovery Joins the National Collection|date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=July 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121120846/http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=256|archivedate=January 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SRBsepfromDiscovery07042006.png|thumb|''Discovery'' rocketing into space, just after booster separation.]]

''Discovery'' weighed roughly 3600&amp;nbsp;kg (3.6t) less than ''Columbia'' when it was brought into service due to optimizations determined during the construction and testing of ''Enterprise'', ''Columbia'' and ''Challenger''.&lt;ref name=over&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Shuttle Overview: Discovery (OV-103)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/discovery-info.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Discovery'' weighs {{convert|6|lb}} heavier than ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' and {{convert|363|lb}} heavier than ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.&lt;ref name="FT facts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Space Shuttle Discovery Facts|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110408/NEWS0208/110408015/Space-Shuttle-Discovery-facts|newspaper=Florida Today|date=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the ''Discovery'' weight optimizations included the greater use of quilted [[AFRSI]] blankets rather than the white [[LRSI]] tiles on the fuselage, and the use of [[graphite epoxy]] instead of aluminum for the payload bay doors and some of the wing spars and beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STS-41D Press Kit|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_012_STS-41D_Press_Kit.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=12 July 2013|page=13| date=August 1984 |quote="Graphite epoxy has replaced some internal aluminum spars and beams in the wings and in the payload bay doors."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its delivery to the Kennedy Space Center in 1983, ''Discovery'' was modified alongside ''Challenger'' to accommodate the liquid-fueled [[Centaur-G]] booster, which had been planned for use beginning in 1986 but was cancelled in the wake of the ''Challenger'' disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lardas|first=Mark|title=Space Shuttle Launch System: 1972–2004|year=2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late 1995, the orbiter underwent a nine-month [[Orbiter Maintenance Down Period]] (OMDP) in [[Palmdale, California]]. This included outfitting the vehicle with a 5th set of cryogenic tanks and an external airlock to support missions to the [[International Space Station]].

==Flow directors==
The Flow Director was responsible for the overall preparation of the shuttle for launch and processing it after landing, and remained permanently assigned to head the spacecraft's ground crew while the astronaut flight crews changed for every mission. Each shuttle's Flow Director was supported by a Vehicle Manager for the same spacecraft. Space Shuttle ''Discovery'''s Flow Directors were:

'''Spiridon Trikoupis'''  ({{lang-el|Σπυρίδων Τρικούπης}}; April 20, 1788 – February 24, 1873) was a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Politician|statesman]], [[diplomat]], [[author]] and [[orator]]. He was the first Prime Minister of Greece (1833) and member of provisional governments of Greece since 1826.

He was born in [[Missolonghi]] and was son of the primate of [[Missolonghi]], [[Ioannis Trikoupis]]. After studying in [[Paris]] and [[London]], he became private secretary to [[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford]], [[Governor]] of the [[Ionian Islands]].

During the [[Greek War of Independence]], he occupied several important administrative and diplomatic posts. He was a member of the provisional government in 1826, a member of the national convention at [[Troezen]] in 1827, and president of the council and minister of foreign affairs in 1832. He was appointed the first [[Prime Minister]] of [[Greece]] in 1833. He was thrice Greek minister (ambassador) to London (1835–1838, 1841–1843 and 1850–1861), and in 1850 envoy-extraordinary to [[Paris]].

His funeral oration for his friend [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], delivered in the [[cathedral]] of Missolonghi in 1824&lt;ref&gt;Richard Edgcumbe, ''Byron: the Last Phase'',  Haskell House Publishers (New York, 1972) p. 185-190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietro Gamba, ''A Narrative of Lord Byron's Last Journey to Greece: Extracted from the journal of Count Peter Gamba, who attended his lordship on that expedition'', Folcroft Library Editions (1975) p.339&lt;/ref&gt; was translated into many languages. A collection of his earlier religious and political orations was published in Paris in 1836. He was the author of ''Istoria tis Ellinikis Epanastaseos'' (London, 1853–1857), his work on the history of the Greek revolution. He was the father of [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], also a Prime Minister of Greece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">'''Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten zur Erinnerung an die Opfer politischer Gewaltherrschaft''' is a public foundation founded by the [[Free State of Saxony]], which owns and supports memorials to the victims of [[Communism]] and [[National Socialism]]. The foundation is a founding member institution of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].

In the totalitarian communist regime of [[East Germany]], only communist victims of national socialism were commemorated. Hence, after 1989, the need for institutions and memorials to other victims of national socialism and to victims of communism arose. The foundation was founded by the state government of Saxony on 15 February 1994. On 28 February 2003, the [[Landtag of Saxony]] adopted a law regulating the activities of the foundation (''Sächsische Gedenkstättenstiftungsgesetz'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stsg.de/cms/sites/default/files/u9/errichtungsgesetz.pdf Sächsische Gedenkstättenstiftungsgesetz], 28 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is headed by [[Siegfried Reiprich]], who is also a member of the Executive Board of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience.

According to the [[Global Terrorism Database]] maintained by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, have been recorded from 2000 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Terrorism Index 2015 |url=http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf |publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etmologically, the word terror is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''Tersere'', which later becomes ''Terrere''. The latter form appears in European languages as early as the 12th century; its first known use in French is the word ''terrible'' in 1160. By 1356 the word ''terreur'' is in use. ''Terreur'' is the origin of the [[Middle English]] term ''terrour'', which later becomes the modern word "terror".&lt;ref name=jf /&gt;

== Historical background ==
{{Main|Reign of Terror}}

[[File:JacobinVignette03.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Seal of the [[Jacobin]] Club: 'Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality'.]]
The term ''terroriste'', meaning "terrorist", is first used in 1794 by the French philosopher [[François-Noël Babeuf]], who denounces [[Maximilien Robespierre]]{{'}}s [[Jacobin]] regime as a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Princeton University Press |last=Palmer |first=R.R. |title=The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800 |chapter=The French Directory Between Extremes |date=2014 |jstor=j.ctt5hhrg5.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kellner&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/17405900410001674515 |issn=1740-5904 |eissn=1740-5912 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=41–64 |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=9/11, spectacles of terror, and media manipulation: A critique of Jihadist and Bush media politics |journal=Critical Discourse Studies |date=April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to the Reign of Terror, the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] threatened Paris with an "exemplary, never to be forgotten vengeance: the city would be subjected to military punishment and total destruction" if the royal family was harmed, but this only increased the Revolution's will to abolish the monarchy.&lt;ref name=duncan /&gt; Some writers attitudes about [[French Revolution]] grew less favorable after the French monarchy was abolished in 1792. During the [[Reign of Terror]], which began in July 1793 and lasted thirteen months, Paris was governed by the Committee of Public safety who oversaw a regime of mass executions and public purges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4725-0912-3 |last=Crawford |first=Joseph |title=Gothic Fiction and the Invention of Terrorism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Fear in the Age of the Reign of Terror |date=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the French Revolution, ancient philosophers wrote about [[tyrannicide]], as tyranny was seen as the greatest political threat to Greco-Roman civilization. [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] were similarly occupied with the concept of tyranny, though the analysis of some theologians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] drew a distinction between usurpers, who could be killed by anyone, and legitimate rulers who abused their power — the latter, in Aquinas' view, could only be punished by a public authority. [[John of Salisbury]] was the first medieval Christian scholar to defend tyrannicide.&lt;ref name=jf&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=271–288 |last=Fine |first=Jonathan |title=Political and Philological Origins of the Term 'Terrorism' from the Ancient Near East to Our Times |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |date=2010 |jstor=20720662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars today trace the origins of the modern tactic of terrorism to the Jewish [[Sicarii Zealots]] who attacked Romans and Jews in 1st century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. They follow its development from the Persian [[Order of Assassins]] through to 19th-century anarchists. The "Reign of Terror" is usually regarded as an issue of etymology. The term terrorism has generally been used to describe violence by non-state actors rather than government violence since the 19th-century [[Anarchism in France|Anarchist Movement]].&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |last=Ken Duncan |title=A Blast from the Past Lessons from a Largely Forgotten Incident of State-Sponsored Terrorism |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |date=2011 |jstor=26298499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP Oxford| isbn = 978-0-19-154198-8| last = Houen| first = Alex| title = Terrorism and Modern Literature: From Joseph Conrad to Ciaran Carson| date = 2002-09-12 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-135-16595-6| last = Thackrah| first = John Richard| title = Dictionary of Terrorism| date = 2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] used the word "Terrorists" in a description of the new [[French Directory|French government called 'Directory']]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Burke]] – To The Earl Fitzwilliam (Christmas, 1795.) In: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/burke-select-works-of-edmund-burke-vol-3 Edmund Burke, ''Select Works of Edmund Burke, vol. 3 (Letters on a Regicide Peace)'' (1795)]. Retrieved 10 July 2017. &lt;br /&gt;This Internet version contains two, mingled, indications of page numbers: one with single brackets like [260], one with double brackets like [ [309] ]. Burke lengthily introduces his view on 'this present [[French Directory|Directory government]]', and then writes on page [ [359] ]: "Those who arbitrarily erected the new building out of the old materials of their own [[National Convention|Convention]], were obliged to send for an Army to support their work. (…) At length, after a terrible struggle, the Troops prevailed over the Citizens. (…) This power is to last as long as the Parisians think proper. (…) [315] To secure them further, they have a strong corps of [[irregular military|irregulars]], ready armed. Thousands of those Hell-hounds called Terrorists, whom they had shut up in Prison on their last Revolution, as the Satellites of Tyranny, are let loose on the people. (…)"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At length, after a terrible struggle, the [Directory] Troops prevailed over the Citizens (…) To secure them further, they have a strong corps of [[irregular military|irregulars]], ready armed.

There are over 109 different definitions of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"&gt;Arie W. Kruglanski and Shira Fishman Current Directions in Psychological Science Vol. 15, No. 1 (Feb., 2006), pp. 45–48&lt;/ref&gt; American political philosopher [[Michael Walzer]] in 2002 wrote: "Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders".&lt;ref name=Walzer /&gt; [[Bruce Hoffman]], an American scholar, has noted that

It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[C.A.J. Coady]] has written that the question of how to define terrorism is "irresolvable" because "its natural home is in polemical, ideological and propagandist contexts".&lt;ref name=teichman&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 64| issue = 250| pages = 505–517| last = Jenny Teichman| title = How to Define Terrorism| journal = Philosophy|date = 1989| jstor = 3751606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French historian {{ill|Sophie Wahnich|fr|Sophie Wahnich|vertical-align=sup}} distinguishes between the [[revolutionary terror]] of the French Revolution and the terrorists of the September 11 attacks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wahnich |first=Sophie |date=2016 |title=In Defence of the Terror: Liberty or Death in the French Revolution |page=108 |publisher=Verso |edition=Reprint |isbn=978-1-78478-202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scurr |first=Ruth |date=17 August 2012 |title=In Defence of the Terror: Liberty or Death in the French Revolution by Sophie Wahnich – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/defence-terror-french-wahnich-review |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts disagree about "whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether or not states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of ''terror'' for a definition of ''terrorism''."&lt;ref name=teichman /&gt;

===State terrorism===
Alternatively, responding to developments in modern warfare, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Jonathan Friedman]] distinguish between state terrorism against [[non-combatant]]s and state terrorism against [[combatant]]s, including '[[Shock and Awe]]' tactics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shock and Awe" as a subcategory of "rapid dominance" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2006 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Friedman |first2=Jonathan |title=Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention |url=https://www.academia.edu/3587732 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London |page=xxx}}; and {{Cite book |last1=Nairn |first1=Tom |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |title=Global Matrix: Nationalism, Globalism and State-Terrorism |url=https://www.academia.edu/1642325 |year=2005 |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Nations===
In November 2004, a [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] report described terrorism as any act "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act".&lt;!-- ''(Note that this report does not constitute [[international law]])'' --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Reform |publisher=United Nations |date=21 March 2005 |url=https://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427012107/http://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archivedate=27 April 2007 |access-date=2008-07-11 |quote=The second part of the report, entitled "Freedom from Fear backs the definition of terrorism–an issue so divisive agreement on it has long eluded the world community–as any action "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[international community]] has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged.&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1998-p32"&gt;Hoffman (1998), p. 32, See review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html Inside Terrorism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ |title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.&lt;ref name=Martyn&gt;Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September], Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216134913/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a [[Definition of terrorism#Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism|Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Paniagua (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4 ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997–2005''], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The international community has adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.

Since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.&lt;ref&gt;1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60, "Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm UN Doc. A/Res/60/49].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===U.S. law===
Various legal systems and government agencies use different [[Anti-terrorism legislation|definitions of terrorism in their national legislation]].

U.S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:
"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f |title=22 U.S. Code §&amp;nbsp;2656f – Annual country reports on terrorism |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;2331 defines "international terrorism" and "domestic terrorism" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled "Terrorism":

"International terrorism" means activities with the following three characteristics:

Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.

===Media spectacle===
A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bockstette, Carsten |year=2008 |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques |issue=20 |url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-01 |journal=George C. Marshall Center Occasional Paper Series |issn=1863-6039 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Terrorists also attack national symbols, which may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] or its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Juergensmeyer |first=Mark |title=Terror in the Mind of God |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2000 |pages=125–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Controversies about labeling terrorism}}
Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state-groups.&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt;&lt;ref name=JR.White /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heryant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruthven /&gt;&lt;ref name=Walzer /&gt;

Those labeled "terrorists" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as [[separatist]], [[freedom fighter]], liberator, [[revolutionary]], [[vigilante]], [[Insurgent|militant]], paramilitary, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]], [[rebellion|rebel]], patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. [[Jihad]]i, [[mujaheddin]], and [[fedayeen]] are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc&gt;{{cite news |author1=Paul Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title=UN staggers on road to reform |quote=This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=BBC News |date=14 September 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, [[utilitarian]] philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the "harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;Rodin, David (2006). "Terrorism". In E. Craig (Ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, [[Michael Walzer]] argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when "a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so".&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jannmllk&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Steinfels |title=Beliefs; The just-war tradition, its last-resort criterion and the debate on an invasion of Iraq |quote=For those like Professor Walzer who value the just-war tradition as a disciplined way to think about the morality of war&amp;nbsp;... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 March 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/us/beliefs-just-war-tradition-its-last-resort-criterion-debate-invasion-iraq.html?pagewanted=1|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Inside Terrorism'' [[Bruce Hoffman]] offered an explanation of why the term ''terrorism'' becomes distorted:
{{quote|On one point, at least, everyone agrees: ''terrorism'' is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label ''terrorist'' to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization ''terrorist'' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.&lt;ref name=tws11jant5r4&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |quote=Google cached copy |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-11468-0 |page=32 |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html |access-date=2010-01-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416230530/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html |archivedate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jant5r555&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |newspaper=The New York Times |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jangbbjj&gt;{{cite news |author=Raymond Bonner |title=Getting Attention: A scholar's historical and political survey of terrorism finds that it works |quote=''Inside Terrorism'' falls into the category of 'must read,' at least for anyone who wants to understand how we can respond to international acts of terror. |newspaper=The New York Times: Books |date=1 November 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01bonnert.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the [[aphorism]], "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter".&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc /&gt; This is exemplified when a group using [[irregular military]] methods is an ally of a [[Sovereign state|state]] against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally.

Some groups, when involved in a "liberation" struggle, have been called "terrorists" by the Western governments or media.

Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists.

Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/PM-Modis-vow-to-avenge-Uri-wont-remain-just-words-Manohar-Parrikar/articleshow/54456254.cms |title=PM Modi's vow to avenge Uri won't remain just words: Manohar Parrikar – Times of India |website=indiatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sicarii Zealots]], though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the [[Zealots]] which was active in [[Judaea Province]] at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist. According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian [[Josephus]], after the [[Zealotry]] rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''.

''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Their terror was also directed against Jewish "collaborators", including temple priests, [[Sadducees]], [[Herodian dynasty|Herodians]], and other wealthy elites.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "terrorism" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the [[Jacobin Club]] during the "[[Reign of Terror]]" in the [[French Revolution]]. "Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible", said Jacobin leader [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. In 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] denounced the Jacobins for letting "thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists&amp;nbsp;... loose on the people" of France.

In January 1858, Italian patriot [[Felice Orsini]] threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38"&gt;Crenshaw, Martha, ''Terrorism in Context'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight bystanders were killed and 142 injured.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38" /&gt; The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38" /&gt;

In early 1975, the [[National Institute of Justice|Law Enforcement Assistant Administration]] in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled ''Disorders and Terrorism'', produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff.

The Task Force defines terrorism as "a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes".  It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/39469NCJRS.pdf |title=Disorders and Terrorism |website=National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals |date=1976 |pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[File:US Army Humvee attacked.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Humvee destroyed by a [[car bomb]], Baghdad, [[Iraq]] in 2006.]]--&gt;
* '''Civil disorder''' – A form of collective violence interfering with the [[peace]], security, and normal functioning of the community.
* '''Political terrorism''' – [[Violence|Violent]] criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate [[fear]] in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes.
* '''Non-Political terrorism''' – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits "conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for [[coercion|coercive]] purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective".
* '''Quasi-terrorism''' – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quasi-terrorism |url=https://mukkulreddy.wordpress.com/types-of-terrorism/quasi-terrorism/ |website=Mukkulreddy.wordpress.com|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Terrorism |url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/types-of-terrorism/ |publisher=Crime Museum|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TERRORISM |url=http://www.earthdash.org/more_info/terrorism.html |publisher=Earth Dashboard|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fleeing [[felony|felon]] who takes [[hostage]]s is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different.
* '''Limited political terrorism''' – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a [[revolutionary]] approach; limited political terrorism refers to "acts of terrorism which are committed for [[ideology|ideological]] or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the [[Sovereign state|state]]".
* '''Official or state terrorism''' – "referring to nations whose rule is based upon [[fear]] and [[oppression]] that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions". It may also be referred to as '''Structural Terrorism''' defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy.

Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into '''domestic terrorism''' and '''international terrorism''', or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terrorism and homeland security: an introduction with applications |author=Philip P.

== Motivations of terrorists ==
As well as there being no one agreed definition of terrorism, there is a similar lack of consensus regarding the causes - or motivations behind - terrorism. Numerous studies have identified certain behavioural and situational characteristics that are common, and perhaps causal, to the consequence of terrorism, specific analysis of case studies have lead to suggested motivations to individual historical acts.

A report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK highlights the vast discrepencies between individual cases of terrorism recorded. To begin with, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault.

==== Intimidation ====
Attacks on 'collaborators' are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in [[Kenya]], in [[Algeria]] and in [[Cyprus]] during their independence struggles. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==== International Attention ====
This strategy was used by [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[September 11 attacks|its attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]] in the United States on September 11, 2001. These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported, such as the [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970]] and the [[1975 Dutch train hostage crisis]].

==== Local/internal social standing ====
Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Abrahm"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abrahms |first=Max |title=What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy |journal=[[International Security]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=86–89 |date=March 2008 |url=http://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/what_terrorists_really_want_terrorist_motives_and_counterterrorism_strategy |format=PDF 1933 [[Kilobyte|KB]] |issn=0162-2889 |accessdate=2008-11-04 |doi=10.1162/isec.2008.32.4.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.&lt;ref name="Abrahm" /&gt;

==== Cultural tolerance of violence ====
Additionally, Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mousseau |first1=Michael |title=Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror |journal=International Security |date=2002 |volume=27 |issue=3 |doi=10.1162/01622880260553615 |pages=5–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/many-terrorists-first-victims-are-their-wives-were-not-allowed-talk-about Many terrorists' first victims are their wives – but we're not allowed to talk about that] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Perceived illegitimacy of the State ====
Some terrorists like [[Timothy McVeigh]] were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==== Religious beliefs/zealotry ====
According to Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that Just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. 
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Mental Health ====
Ariel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides’ families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Merari |first1=Ariel |title="Psychological Aspects of Suicide Terrorism," in Bruce Bongar et al., Psychology of Terrorism. |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes - such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations - or suicidal symptoms. By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |title=Mishandling Suicide Terrorism |journal=The Washington Quarterly |date=2004 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=67–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nationalism ====
Although a common factor in terrorism is a strong religious belief there are other factors such as cultural, social and 
political that wholly preclude religion. For example, the drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others. Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters, nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya. Although a distinction should be made between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad. Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads whereas most of the non-Chechen fighters did (Janeczko, 2014)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janeczko |first1=Matthew |title='Faced with death, even a mouse bites': Social and religious motivations behind terrorism in Chechnya |date=19 Jun 2014 |pages=428–456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial support for family ====
Another factor are perceived assurances of financial stability for the actor's families, that they are given when they join a terrorist organization or complete an attempt of terror. An extra grant is provided for the families of suicide bombers.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"/&gt;

== Democracy and domestic terrorism ==

While a democratic nation espousing [[civil liberties]] may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties.&lt;ref name=tws11janetrr&gt;{{cite news |author=Rick Young |title=PBS Frontline: 'Spying on the Home Front' |quote=...&amp;nbsp;we and Frontline felt that it was important to look more comprehensively at the post-9/11 shift to prevention and the dilemma we all now face in balancing security and privacy. |publisher=''PBS: Frontline'' |date=16 May 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/05/03/DI2007050301142.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, [[homegrown terrorism]] has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordy |last=Yager |title=Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a devil of a problem |publisher=thehill.com |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.&lt;ref&gt;shabad, goldie and francisco jose llera ramo.

According to the [[Global Terrorism Index]] by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[religious extremism]] has overtaken [[Separatism|national separatism]] and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Syria]] is the main driver behind these trends.&lt;ref name=arnett&gt;{{cite news |author=George Arnett |title=Religious extremism main cause of terrorism, according to report |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 November 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/nov/18/religious-extremism-main-cause-of-terrorism-according-to-report|access-date= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are [[Boko Haram]], [[Al Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt;

By the 1930s, the movement had been infected with [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], and eventually [[Christian Identity]] theology diverged from traditional [[British Israelism|Anglo-Israelism]], and developed what is known as the [[Serpent seed|"two seed"]] theory.&lt;ref name=adlci /&gt; According to the two-seed theory, the Jewish people are descended from [[Cain]] and the serpent (not from [[Shem]]).&lt;ref name=adlci /&gt; The white European seedline is descended from the "lost tribes" of Israel. They hold themselves to "God's laws", not to "man's laws", and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]].&lt;ref name=adlci /&gt;

[[Israel]] has also had problems with [[Jewish religious terrorism]]. [[Yigal Amir]] assassinated Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1995. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. {{sfn|Spaaij|2012|page=68}}

== Perpetrators ==
The [[perpetrator]]s of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. However, the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive [[Covert cell|cells]], highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London underground bombing]], [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] and the [[2002 Bali bombing]] were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient [[telecommunications]] to succeed where others had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sageman |first=Mark |title=Understanding Terror Networks |publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press |year=2004 |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=166–67 |isbn=978-0-8122-3808-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/personal-characteristics-of-lone-actor-terrorists/ |title=Personal Characteristics of Lone-Actor Terrorists |date=29 February 2016 |author1=Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker |author2=Jeanine de Roy van Zuijdewijn |access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as ''violent non-state actors''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A 2007 study by economist [[Alan B. Krueger]] found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace.A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not,terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others. This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated,does not make them a potential terrorist.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Superfreakonomics: global cooling, patriotic prostitutes, and why suicide bombers should buy life insurance |author1=Steven D.

{{Main|List of designated terrorist groups|Lone wolf (terrorism)|Violent non-state actor}}
Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a "terrorist" in the media.

According to the Global Terrorism Database, the most active terrorist group in the period 1970 to 2010 was [[Shining Path]] (with 4,517 attacks), followed by [[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), [[Basque Fatherland and Freedom]] (ETA), [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC), [[Taliban]], [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], [[New People's Army]], [[National Liberation Army of Colombia]] (ELN), and [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/br/ETACeasefires.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State sponsors ===
{{Main|State-sponsored terrorism}}
A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group. Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely. When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trackingterrorism.org/article/state-sponsored-terrorism |title=State Sponsored Terrorism |publisher=trackingterrorism.org|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

As with "terrorism" the concept of "state terrorism" is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00000137/01/Primorat.pdf |title=Pds Sso |publisher=Eprints.unimelb.edu.au |access-date=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512021205/https://eprints.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00000137/01/Primorat.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with [[war crime]]s, [[international human rights law]], and [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/SC7276.doc.htm |title=Addressing Security Council, Secretary-General Calls on Counter-Terrorism Committee To Develop Long-Term  Strategy To Defeat Terror |publisher=Un.org |access-date=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former United Nations [[Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] has said that it is "time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'.

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of [[Political Science]] Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], the British and American [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], and the U.S. [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. He argues that "the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents." He also cites the [[first strike]] option as an example of the "terror of coercive diplomacy" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using [[nuclear weapon]]s in "crisis management" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of [[foreign policy]] was shaped by the presence and use of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state .&lt;ref name="tws11jangbhh"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Stohl |title=The Superpowers and International Terror |publisher=International Studies Association, Atlanta |date=1 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Stohl |title=Terrible beyond Endurance?

== Funding ==
{{Main|Terrorist financing}}
[[State-sponsored terrorism|State sponsors]] have constituted a major form of funding; for example, [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ncua" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tws11jan4r67"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jeremy Lott |title=Tripped Up |quote=and before the Soviet Union fell, terrorist organizations were funding themselves through subsidies from Communist governments |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=6 October 2004 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2004/10/06/tripped-up|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Gang]] received funding from [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] officers in Beirut to undermine the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Aims and activities of the Stern Group in Palestine |journal=Research and Analysis Branch |volume=2717 |issue=R &amp; N |date=1 December 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]] has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours, especially [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/5779916/Pakistani-president-Asif-Zardari-admits-creating-terrorist-groups.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=Pakistani president Asif Zardari admits creating terrorist groups | access-date= |first=Dean |last=Nelson |date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through [[organized crime]]. Communications occur through modern [[telecommunications]], or through old-fashioned methods such as [[courier]]s. There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing [[weapons of mass destruction]].

Terrorism is a form of [[asymmetric warfare]], and is more common when direct [[conventional warfare]] will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power.&lt;ref name=tws11jan1q21q&gt;{{cite news |title=Hackers warn high street chains |quote=That's the beauty of asymmetric warfare. You don't need a lot of money, or an army of people. |publisher=BBC News |date=25 April 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7366995.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:
* [[Secession]] of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state
* Dominance of territory or resources by various [[ethnic groups]]
* Imposition of a particular form of government
* Economic deprivation of a population
* Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army
* Religious fanaticism

== Responses ==
[[File:1080 Poisoning Scare At New World in Wellington.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism]]
Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the [[political spectrum]] and reassessments of [[value system|fundamental values]].

Specific types of responses include:
* [[Anti-terrorism legislation|Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers]]
* [[Target hardening]], such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
* Preemptive or reactive military action
* Increased intelligence and surveillance activities
* Preemptive humanitarian activities
* More permissive interrogation and detention policies

The term "[[counter-terrorism]]" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors.

According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in [[The Washington Post]], "Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/ |title=A hidden world, growing beyond control |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=19 July 2010 |first1=Dana |last1=Priest |first2=William |last2=Arkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "A New Strategy for America's War on Terrorism", ''Patrolling'' magazine, 75th Ranger Regiment Association, Winter 2011, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction of the ''U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Sarah Sewall states the need for "U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants––and erode support of the host nation." Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: "Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction."&lt;ref&gt;Sewall, Sarah, introduction to ''The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy, often termed "courageous restraint", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown.&lt;ref name=ankony1 /&gt;

=== Terrorism research ===
Terrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], the [[Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies]], and the [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tinnes |first1=J |year=2013 |title=100 Core and Periphery Journals for Terrorism Research |url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/258 |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |volume=7 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International agreements ===
One of the agreements that promote the international legal anti-terror framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018. The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counter terrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045. The Code was signed by more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=70 countries sign Counter-Terrorism Code initiated by Kazakhstan |url=https://www.inform.kz/en/70-countries-sign-counter-terrorism-code-initiated-by-kazakhstan-says-president_a3450890 |website=inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass media ==

[[File:Plakat La Terroriste.jpg|thumb|''La Terroriste'', a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]] throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car.|left]]
Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.&lt;ref&gt;The Media and Terrorism: A Reassessment [[Paul Wilkinson (professor)|Paul Wilkinson]]. ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Summer 1997), pp. 51–64 Published by Frank Cass, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/responding-to-cyber-jihad-towards-an-effective-counter-narrative/ |title=Responding to Cyber Jihad: Towards an Effective Counter Narrative |date=31 March 2015 |author=Dr. Bibi van Ginkel |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |access-date=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely [[James F. Pastor]] explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terrorism &amp; Public Safety Policing: Implications of the Obama Presidency |author=Pastor, James F. |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4398-1580-9 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcome of terrorist groups ==

[[File:RANDterroristGpsEnd2006.svg|thumb|upright=2|How terrorist groups end (n = 268): The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations (43 percent), with most of the rest terminated by routine policing (40 percent).  Groups that were ended by military force constituted only 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;The researchers found 648 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006.  Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006 (Jones and Libicki, 2008, p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006.  They found 648.  of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the [[Good Friday Agreement|Irish Republican Army]] in Northern Ireland.  Law enforcement took out 40 percent.  Ten percent won.  Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force.

Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006.  Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors.  Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement.   26 percent won.  21 percent succumbed to military force.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 101, Table 5.4)&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists.  To avoid that, the [[rules of engagement]] must be conscious of [[collateral damage]] and work to minimize it.

Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cronin |first1=Audrey Kurth |title=How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns |date=2009 |publisher=Princeton U. Pr |isbn=978-0-691-13948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Capture or killing of a group's leader. (Decapitation).
# Entry of the group into a legitimate political process. (Negotiation).
# Achievement of group aims. (Success).
# Group implosion or loss of public support. (Failure).
# Defeat and elimination through brute force. (Repression).
# Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence. (Reorientation).

== Databases ==
The following terrorism databases are or were made publicly available for research purposes, and track specific acts of terrorism:
* [[Global Terrorism Database]], an open-source database by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2015 with more than 150,000 cases.
* [[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]
* [[Worldwide Incidents Tracking System]]
* [[Tocsearch]] (dynamic database)
The following public report and index provides a summary of key global trends and patterns in terrorism around the world
* [[Global Terrorism Index]], produced annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]]
The following publicly available resources index electronic and bibliographic resources on the subject of terrorism
* [[Human Security Gateway]]

The following terrorism databases are maintained in secrecy by the United States Government for intelligence and counter-terrorism purposes:
* [[Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment]]
* [[Terrorist Screening Database]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) includes a table of 268 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006 with their status as of 2006:  still active, splintered, converted to nonviolence, removed by law enforcement or military, or won.  (These data are not in a convenient machine-readable format but are available.)

It is still used for seasonal migration of herds. Some historians, such as Wisemann, believe that it follows the same route as the [[Via Traiana|Via Minucia Traiana]], an ancient Roman road.

'''The "War over Water"''', also  the '''Battle over Water''', refers to a series of confrontations between [[Israel]] and its [[Arab League|Arab]] neighbors from November 1964 to May 1967 over [[Water politics in the Jordan River basin|control of  water sources]] in the [[Jordan River]] [[drainage basin]].

The [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] which followed the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], created three [[demilitarized zone]]s on the Israel-Syria border. The southernmost, and also the largest, stretched from the south-eastern part of the [[Sea of Galilee]] eastwards to the [[Yarmuk River]] where the borders of Israel, Jordan and Syria converge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowi|first=Miriam R.|title=Water and power: the politics of a scarce resource in the Jordan River basin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/?id=314KWutTkFkC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn=978-0-521-55836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of water sharing from the Jordan–Yarmuk system turned out to be a major problem between Israel, Syria and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seliktar|first=Ofira|date=June 2005|title=Turning Water into Fire: the Jordan River as the Hidden Factor in The Six Day War|journal=The Middle East Review of International Affairs|volume=9|issue=2|url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue2/jv9no2a4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small scale water-related skirmishes had occurred following the 1949 agreements. In July 1953, Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Jordan Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee. Syrian artillery units opened fire on the construction site.  The [[United Nations]] security council majority (excepting the USSR) voted for the resumption of work by Israel. The Israelis then moved the intake to an economically inferior site at the Sea of Galilee.&lt;ref  name="IwaoH1998p129"/&gt;

In 1955 the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan]] (Johnston Plan) was accepted by the technical committees of both Israel and the Arab League, but the Arab League Council decided not to ratify the plan on 11 October 1955. According to most observers, including Johnston himself, the Arab non-adoption of the plan was not total rejection. While they failed to approve it politically, they nevertheless seemed determined to adhere to the technical details of the agreement. Moreover, it continued to be taken seriously by Arab leaders.&lt;ref  name="Gat2003p101"/&gt; Though the Unified Plan failed to be ratified, both [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]] undertook to operate within their allocation limits.

===Main phase:1964–67===
[[Israel]] completed its [[National Water Carrier]] project, which siphoned water from the [[Sea of Galilee]] in 1964. The initial diversion capacity of the National Water Carrier, without supplementary booster pumps, was 320 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, well within the limits of the Johnston Plan.[[Image:National Water Carrier of Israel-en.svg|thumb|200px]] 
Nevertheless, the Arab states were not prepared to coexist with a project which seemed likely to make a major contribution to [[Israel]]'s economic growth. In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo and decided:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.&lt;ref name="Shlaim2000p229"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Arab states decided to deprive Israel of 35% of the National Water Carrier capacity, by a diversion of the [[Jordan River]] headwaters (both the Hasbani and the Banias) to the [[Yarmouk River]]. The scheme was only marginally feasible, as it was technically difficult and expensive.

A major escalation took place in 1964 when Israel declared it would regard the Diversion Project as an infringement on its sovereign rights.&lt;ref name="Shapland1997p13"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Shapland|title=Rivers of Discord: International Water Disputes in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDKJV-916UoC&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=1997|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-214-4|pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Murakami1995p287"/&gt;

In 1965, there were three notable border clashes, starting with Syrian shootings of Israeli farmers and army patrols, followed by Israeli tanks and artillery destroying the Arab heavy earth moving machines that were used for the diversion plan.&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|accessdate=15 July 2013|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IwaoH.1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kobori, Iwao|author2=Glantz, M.

Control of [[water resources]] and Israeli military attacks against the diversion effort are considered among the factors which led to the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967.

The war is referenced in the famous US antiwar 1965 song "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]" by [[Barry McGuire]] with the line "And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'".{{Citation needed|reason=mistake|date=September 2014}}

'''Willem Bilderdijk''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋɪləm ˈbɪldərˌdɛi̯k}}) ([[Amsterdam]], 7 September 1756 – [[Haarlem]], 18 December 1831) was a Dutch poet.

==Life==
He was the son of an [[Amsterdam]] [[physician]]. When he was six years old an accident to his foot incapacitated him for ten years, and he developed habits of continuous and concentrated study. His parents were ardent partisans of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], and Bilderdijk grew up with strong monarchical and [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] convictions.

After studying at [[Leiden University]], Bilderdijk obtained his doctorate in law in 1782, and began to practise as an advocate at [[The Hague]]. Three years later he contracted an unhappy marriage with Rebecca Woesthoven. He refused in 1795 to take the oath to the administration of the new [[Batavian Republic]], and was consequently obliged to leave the Netherlands. He went to [[Hamburg]], and then to [[London]], where his great learning procured him consideration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

There he had as a pupil {{ill|Katharina Wilhelmina Schweickhardt|de|Katharina Wilhelmina Bilderdijk-Schweickhardt}} (1776-1830), the daughter of the Dutch painter [[Heinrich Wilhelm Schweickhardt]] and herself a poet. When he left London in June 1797 for [[Braunschweig]], this lady followed him, and after he had formally divorced his first wife (1802) they were married.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1806 he was persuaded by his friends to return to the [[Netherlands]], where the Batavian Republic had been replaced by a monarchy, the first king being [[Louis Bonaparte]], a brother of the [[France|French]] emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Louis Napoleon kindly received Bilderdijk and made him his librarian, and a member&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002564 |title=Willem Bilderdijk (1756 - 1831) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually president (1809–1811) of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Bilderdijk also taught the king [[Dutch language|Dutch]], although -on one occasion- he told his people that he was the "Konijn van 'Olland" ("rabbit of 'Olland"), rather than "Koning van Holland" ("King of Holland"), because he had difficulty mastering the pronunciation.

After the abdication of Louis Napoleon Bilderdijk suffered great poverty; on the accession of [[William I of the Netherlands]] in 1813 he hoped to be made a professor, but was disappointed and became a history tutor at Leiden. He continued his vigorous campaign against liberal ideas to his death, which took place at [[Haarlem]] on 18 December 1831.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Bilderdijk was the founder of the spiritual movement that is called "[[Revivalism|Het Réveil]]", which tried to give a [[Christianity|Christian]] answer to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]]. Among his disciples were [[Abraham Capadose]], [[Willem de Clercq]], [[Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer]], and especially [[Isaac da Costa]], who called his teacher "[[Anti-Revolutionary Party|anti-revolutionary]], anti-Barneveldtian, anti-Loevesteinish, anti-[[Liberalism|liberal]]".

==Legacy==
[[File:Bilderdijk 1756-1831 herdacht in 1885 - de Kunstenaarskring.jpg|thumb|right|Gable stone in top of facade to Grote Markt 11, the house Bilderdijk lived in when he died on the [[Grote Markt, Haarlem]]]]
According to [[Godfried Bomans]], who named a club after his pseudonym ''Teisterbant'', the bed Bilderdijk died in was kept until 1950 as a curiosity for people to look at. A commemorative gable stone was placed on the top gable of his old house in 1885, and a commemorative stone is also in the [[St. Bavochurch]].
There is a Bilderdijk Museum in Amsterdam.

'''Zagros Paleolithic Museum''' ({{Lang-fa|موزه پارینه‌سنگی زاگرس}}) is a museum in [[Kermanshah]], [[Iran]], established in 2008. The museum contains a large collection of stone tools and animal fossil bones from various [[Paleolithic]] sites in [[Iran]]. In Iran, it is the only museum of its kind.

==History==
The museum was established by [[Fereidoun Biglari]] and [[A. Moradi Bisetouni]] at Tekieh Biglar Baigi, Kermanshah in 2007. [[Marjan Mashkour]], a [[Zooarchaeology|zooarchaeologist]], was in charge of animal fossil identification for the museum.

==Collections==
Zagros Paleolithic Museum occupies four rooms which include objects from various Paleolithic and [[Neolithic]] sites in Iran, dating from ca. 1,000,000 years to some 8,000 years ago. The first room is an audio room where visitors can watch a documentary about prehistoric stone tools and how Paleolithic artisans made these tools. There is also a full life-size model of a [[Neanderthal]].

The second room is dedicated to human and animal bones from sites on the [[Zagros Mountains]] and some human skull replicas from famous Paleolithic sites in [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]]. Among the faunal remains, the fossil collection from the  [[Wezmeh|Wezmeh cave]] is of prime importance. The third room contains [[Lower Paleolithic]] stone tools from various sites such as [[Kashafrud]], [[Ganj Par]] and Shiwatoo.  The fourth room houses late Paleolithic and Neolithic stone tools, animal bones, shells and other archaeological objects which are also from sites on the [[Zagros mountains]].
