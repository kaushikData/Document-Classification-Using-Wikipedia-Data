'''''A Lost Man''''' ({{lang-fr|Un homme perdu}}, {{lang-ar|رجل ضائع}} {{transl|ar|''rajulun ḍāˀyiˁ''}}, Levantine Arabic ''rajolon ḍāˀyeˁ'') is a 2007 [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] film by the Lebanese director [[Danielle Arbid]].

The film premiered on 18 March during the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]], in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/films/14124/Un-homme-perdu.html Directors' Fortnight | Un homme perdu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210317/http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/films/14124/Un-homme-perdu.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possibly the most sexually graphic film ever made by an Arab director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/graphics/print_pdfs/0521cnd14.pdf  ''Variety'' article]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was inspired by the life of the French photographer [[Antoine D'Agata]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Synopsis==
The story is about a French photographer Thomas Koré ([[Melvil Poupaud]]), who is searching for extraordinary experiences. Koré has become so detached from humanity that the only way he can connect with other people is to have—and photograph—bizarre and demeaning sexual encounters with prostitutes.  When he meets on his path Fouad Saleh ([[Alexander Siddig]]), a man with memory problems, he realized that Fouad is even more lost than he, and befriends him. The French man then tries to discover Fouad's history.

During the 20th century a number of peace walks were organized involving the citizens of the United States and the [[USSR]].  These peace walks, or peace marches, represented [[citizen diplomacy]] initiatives promoting peace and [[Nuclear disarmament]] through direct person-to-person interaction among the citizens of the two [[Cold War]] opponent states.

==1960–1961 San Francisco to Moscow Walk==

A [[peace walk]] from San Francisco, US, to Moscow, USSR, took place from December 1960 to October 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of the European Organiser of the American-European Peace March from San Francisco to Moscow|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/peacemarch.html|publisher=The Archives Hub|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001617/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/peacemarch.html|archive-date=2011-09-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The walk was organized by [[Committee for NonViolent Action|Committee for Nonviolent Action]] and promoted nonviolence and unilateral nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Non-Violent Action|url=http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Committee_for_Non-Violent_Action|publisher=dKosopedia|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206103631/http://dkosopedia.com/wiki/Committee_for_Non-Violent_Action|archive-date=2010-02-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Nonviolent Action Records, 1958–1968 (DG 017)|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG001-025/dg017/dg017cnvamain.htm|work=Swarthmore College Peace Collection|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=2 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110414032457/http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG001-025/dg017/dg017cnvamain.htm| archivedate= 14 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 1988, the American Soviet Peace Walk concert finale event happened at the Band Shell in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park with an estimated public attendance of 25,000 plus. The Producers give many thanks to all participants, the volunteers, and performing friends of the Summer of Love 20th Anniversary 1987 series that benefited the San Francisco Food Bank and ran through to the Concert of July 16, 1988.

'''''Berchtoldstag''''' (also ''Bechtelistag, Bächtelistag, Berchtelistag, Bärzelistag,'' in Liechtenstein ''Bechtelstag, Bechtle'') is an [[Alamanni|Alemannic]] holiday, known in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is near New Year's Day, during the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Rauhnächte]], in Switzerland nearly always on 2 January (in Frauenfeld on the third Monday in January), with the status of a public holiday in a number of [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] (AG, BE, FR, GL, JU, LU, NE, OW, SH, SO, TG, VD, ZG, ZH). Its observation is attested since the 14th century, although celebrations were limited after the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Various theories exist concerning the holiday′s name. [[Blessed Berchtold]] of [[Engelberg abbey]] died circa 2 November 1197, and the abbey could have been important enough to translate his feast out of advent. According to others, it celebrates a hunting trip circa 1191 by Duke [[Berchtold V of Zähringen]], who decided to name his new city after the first animal he killed on that trip, hence [[Bern, Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaysaholiday.org/berchtolds-day-switzerland/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102213301/http://everydaysaholiday.org/berchtolds-day-switzerland/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory associates the name with the verb 'berchten', which means "to walk around, asking for food".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/switzerland/berchtold-day&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also relate to [[Perchta]], [[mythology|mythological]] or [[folklore|folkloric]] female guardian of animals, and sometimes leader of the [[Wild Hunt]], since Twelfth Night traditions even in the Spanish Pyrenees can feature visits from a transformed human/animal. The most likely explanation is offered by the ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]'' that considers it derived from [[Middle High German]] ''berhttac'' or ''berhteltac,'' which translated the Greek ''[[wikt:epiphany|epiphanias]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Schweizerisches Idiotikon'' [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register_alt/faksimile.php?&amp;band=12&amp;spalte=962 ''Berchtelenstag;'' vol. XII 962–968, with note] and [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register_alt/faksimile.php?&amp;band=4&amp;spalte=1538 ''Berchta, berchtelen;'' vol. IV 1538–1539, with notes].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Berchtoldstag especially occurs in Protestant regions where Epiphany has been abolished and replaced by a second day-off after New Year′s day.

In the German-speaking cantons of Zurich, Thurgovia and some parts of Central Switzerland, families celebrate the holiday with meals at pubs or offered by traditional societies. The Argovian village of [[Hallwil]] holds a mask parade with entries symbolizing fertility, age, ugliness, wisdom, vice, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/switzerland/berchtold-day&lt;/ref&gt; In the French-speaking [[Vaud]], children celebrate Berchtoldstag with neighborhood parties which include folk dancing and singing.

Nuts are associated with this holiday. They are both eaten in a "nut feast" and used for games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/switzerland/berchtolds_day.php&lt;/ref&gt; Children build "hocks" of four nuts close together on the ground with a fifth nut balanced on top.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Helene, and Thompson, Sue Ellen, ed.

Located in the [[Eastern Himalaya]]s, it is bordered by [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]] in the north, the [[Sikkim]] state of [[India]] and the [[Chumbi Valley]] of [[Tibet]] in the west, the [[Arunachal Pradesh]] state of India in the east, and the states of [[Assam]] and [[West Bengal]] in the south. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the region's second least populous nation after the [[Maldives]]. [[Thimphu]] is its capital and largest city, while [[Phuntsholing]] is its financial center.

The independence of Bhutan has endured for centuries and it has never been colonized in [[History of Bhutan|its history]]. Situated on the ancient [[Silk Road]] between Tibet, the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]], the Bhutanese state developed a distinct [[Culture of Bhutan|national identity]] based on [[Buddhism]]. Headed by a spiritual leader known as the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], the territory was composed of many [[fief]]doms and governed as a Buddhist theocracy. Following a civil war in the 19th century, the [[House of Wangchuck]] reunited the country and established relations with the [[British Empire]]. Bhutan fostered a strategic partnership with India during the rise of Chinese communism and has a disputed border with China. In 2008, Bhutan transitioned from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]] and held the first election to the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly of Bhutan]]. The National Assembly of Bhutan is part of the bicameral parliament of the [[Bhutanese democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582573/What-use-is-democracy-to-idyllic-Bhutan.html|title=What use is democracy to idyllic Bhutan?|last=Dalrymple|first=William|date=23 March 2008|work=The Telegraph|access-date=24 October 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's landscape ranges from lush subtropical plains in the south to the sub-alpine Himalayan mountains in the north, where there are peaks in excess of {{nowrap|{{convert|7000|m|ft}}}}. [[Gangkhar Puensum]] is the highest peak in Bhutan, and it may also be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world.&lt;ref name=Itami2001&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsuguyasu Itami|title=Gankarpunzum &amp; First Ascent Of Liankang Kangri|journal=Japanese Alpine News|date=October 2001|volume=1|url=http://www.jac.or.jp/english/jan/vol1/GANKARPUNZUM.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wildlife of Bhutan]] is notable for its diversity.

In South Asia, Bhutan ranks first in [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]], [[Ease of doing business index|ease of doing business]], and [[Global Peace Index|peace]]; third in [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|per capita income]]; and is the [[Corruption Perceptions Index|least corrupt country]] {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. However, Bhutan continues to be a [[Least Developed Countries|least developed country]]. Hydroelectricity accounts for the major share of its exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/features/bhutan-s-hydropower-sector-12-things-know |title=Bhutan's Hydropower Sector: 12 Things to Know |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politics of Bhutan|The government]] is a parliamentary democracy; the head of state is the [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck|King of Bhutan]], known as the "[[Druk Gyalpo|Dragon King]]". Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations with 52 countries and the [[European Union]], but does not have formal ties with the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The [[Royal Bhutan Army]] maintains a close relationship with the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

Bhutan is also notable for pioneering the concept of [[Gross National Happiness|gross national happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan's Gross National Happiness Index {{!}} OPHI|website=www.ophi.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The precise etymology of "Bhutan" is unknown, although it is likely to derive from the [[Old Tibetan|Tibetan]] [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] "Bod" used for [[Tibet]]. Traditionally, it is taken to be a transcription of the [[Sanskrit]] ''Bhoṭa-anta'' "end of [[Tibet]]", a reference to Bhutan's position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = A Cultural History of Bhutan |volume = 1 |first = Balaram |last = Chakravarti |publisher = Hilltop |year = 1979 |page = 7 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6VxuAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Names&amp;Histories"&gt;Taylor, Isaac. ''[https://archive.org/details/namesandtheirhi00taylgoog Names and Their Histories; a Handbook of Historical Geography and Topographical Nomenclature]''. Gale Research Co. (Detroit), 1898. Retrieved 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;U.S. Library of Congress, Country Studies, Bhutan, HISTORICAL SETTING, BHUTAN

Since the 17th century the official name of Bhutan has been ''Druk yul'' (country of the [[Drukpa Lineage]], the Dragon People, or the Land of the Thunder Dragon, a reference to the country's dominant Buddhist sect) and Bhutan only appears in English-language official correspondence.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;

Names similar to Bhutan — including Bohtan, Buhtan, Bottanthis, Bottan and Bottanter — began to appear in Europe around the 1580s. [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]]'s 1676 ''Six Voyages'' is the first to record the name ''Boutan''. However, in every case, these seem to have been describing not modern Bhutan but the [[Tibet (1912–51)|Kingdom of Tibet]]. The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into the Scottish explorer [[George Bogle (diplomat)|George Bogle]]'s 1774 expedition — realizing the differences between the two regions, cultures and states, his final report to the [[East India Company]] formally proposed labelling the [[Druk Desi]]'s kingdom as "Boutan" and the [[Panchen Lama]]'s as "Tibet". The EIC's surveyor general [[James Rennell]] first anglicized the French name as Bootan and then popularized the distinction between it and greater Tibet.&lt;ref name="Kuensel"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120216090138/http://www.keystobhutan.com/bhutan/bhutan_history_europe.php "History of Bhutan: How Europe heard about Bhutan"]. ''Kuensel''. 24 August 2003. Retrieved 28 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally, Bhutan has been known by many names. One of the earliest Western records of Bhutan, the 1627 ''Relação'' of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]]s [[Estêvão Cacella]] and [[João Cabral]], records its name variously as ''Cambirasi'' (among the [[Koch Bihar]]is&lt;ref&gt;Cacella, Estêvão.

[http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/jbs/JBS_01_01_01.pdf "Report which Father Estevao Cacella of the Society of Jesus Sent to Father Alberto Laercio, Provincial of the Province of Malabar of East India, about His Journey to Cathay, until He Came to the Kingdom of Bhotanta"] (1627). Retrieved 28 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;), ''Potente'', and ''Mon'' (an endonym for southern Tibet).&lt;ref name="Kuensel"/&gt; The first time a separate Kingdom of Bhutan appeared on a western map, it did so under its local name as "Broukpa".&lt;ref name="Kuensel"/&gt; Others including ''Lho Mon'' ("Dark Southland"), ''Lho Tsendenjong'' ("Southland of the [[Cypress]]"), ''Lhomen Khazhi'' ("Southland of the Four Approaches") and ''Lho Menjong'' ("Southland of the [[medicinal herb|Herbs]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Beneath Blossom Rain: Discovering Bhutan on the Toughest Trek in the World |series = Outdoor Lives |first = Kevin |last = Grange |publisher = University of Nebraska Press |year = 2011 |isbn = 978-0-8032-3433-8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bWco7DY94fsC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvrWAAAAMAAJ |title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife |volume = 2 |series = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife: Southeast Asia and India, Central and East Asia, Middle East |first = William M. |last = Clements |publisher = Greenwood Press |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-313-32849-7 |page = 105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BC, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorized that the state of ''Lhomon'' (literally, "southern darkness"), or ''Monyul'' ("Dark Land", a reference to the [[Monpa people|Monpa]], the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples of Bhutan) may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600. The names ''Lhomon Tsendenjong'' ([[Sandalwood]] Country), and ''Lhomon Khashi'', or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles.&lt;ref name="WIAS"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldinstituteforasianstudies.org/buthan.html |title = Bhutan |publisher = World Institute for Asian Studies |date = 21 August 2006 |accessdate = 23 April 2009 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090801085158/http://www.worldinstituteforasianstudies.org/buthan.html |archivedate = 1 August 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CS0"&gt;{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=Origins and Early Settlement, A.D. 600–1600|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of early Bhutanese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital, [[Punakha]], in 1827. By the 10th century, Bhutan's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history. Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronized by the various [[Mongols|Mongol]] warlords. After the decline of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 14th century, these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] by the 16th century.&lt;ref name=CS1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS4&gt;{{country study |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |year=1991 |section=Rivalry among the Sects |author=Worden, Robert L |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thrikheb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A ''thrikhep'' (throne cover) from the 19th century. Throne covers were placed atop the temple cushions used by high [[lama]]s. The central circular swirling quadrune is the [[gankyil]] in its mode as the "Four Joys".]]
Until the early 17th century, Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring [[fiefdom]]s, when the area was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader Ngawang Namgyal, who had fled religious persecution in Tibet. To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable ''[[dzong architecture|dzongs]]'' or fortresses, and [[promulgation|promulgated]] the [[Tsa Yig]], a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralized control. Many such ''dzong'' still exist and are active centers of religion and district administration. [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] [[Estêvão Cacella]] and [[João Cabral]] were the first recorded Europeans to visit Bhutan in 1627,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Bhutan |author=Karma Phuntsho| year= 2013 | publisher = Random House India   | isbn=9788184003116 | pages=224–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; on their way to Tibet. They met Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, gunpowder and a telescope, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Zhabdrung declined the offer. After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the [[Chagri Monastery]] reporting on his travels. This is a rare extant report of the Zhabdrung.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite book |title = Bhutan |series = Country Guides |first1 = Lindsay |last1 = Brown |first2 = Stan |last2 = Armington |edition = 3 |publisher = [[Lonely Planet]] |year = 2007 |pages = 26, 36 |isbn = 978-1-74059-529-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Jesuit on the Roof of the World: Ippolito Desideri's Mission to Eighteenth-Century Tibet |first = Trent |last = Pomplun |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-19-537786-6 |page = 49 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-3iG4p85PHgC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651, his passing was kept secret for 54 years[1651-1705]. After a period of consolidation, Bhutan lapsed into internal conflict. In the year 1711 Bhutan went to war against the [[Mughal Empire]] and its [[Subedar]]s, who restored the kingdom of [[Koch Bihar]] in the south. During the chaos that followed, the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked Bhutan in 1714.&lt;ref name=CS3&gt;{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=Administrative Integration and Conflict with Tibet, 1651–1728|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of Koch Bihar. In 1772, the [[Maharaja]] of Koch Bihar appealed to the British [[East India Company]] which assisted by ousting the Bhutanese and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the [[British India|British]] were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the [[Duar War]] (1864–65), a confrontation for control of the [[Bengal]] [[Duars]]. After Bhutan lost the war, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] was signed between [[British India]] and Bhutan. As part of the [[war reparations]], the Duars were ceded to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in exchange for a rent of Rs. 50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.

During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and [[Tongsa]] led to civil war in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''poenlop'' (governor) of Tongsa. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882–85.&lt;ref name=CS2&gt;{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=British Intrusion, 1772–1907|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families, with the firm petition made by Gongzim Ugyen Dorji. [[John Claude White]], British Political Agent in Bhutan, took photographs of the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hannavy|title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-87327-1|page=1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government promptly recognized the new monarchy, and in 1910 Bhutan signed the [[Treaty of Punakha]], a [[subsidiary alliance]] which gave the British control of Bhutan's foreign affairs and meant that Bhutan was treated as an Indian [[princely state]]. This had little real effect, given Bhutan's historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect Bhutan's traditional relations with Tibet. After the new [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] gained [[Independence of India|independence]] from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognize India's independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan's foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent India.&lt;ref name=WIAS/&gt;

In 1953, King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] established the country's legislature – a 130-member [[National Assembly]] – to promote a more democratic form of governance. In 1965, he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet. In 1971, Bhutan was admitted to the United Nations, having held observer status for three years. In July 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck.

===Political reform and modernization===
{{further|Law of Bhutan|Constitution of Bhutan}}
Bhutan's political system has recently changed from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]]. King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]]  transferred most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowing for [[impeachment]] of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.democracy-international.org/fileadmin/di/pdf/papers/di-bhutan.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110610012322/http://www.democracy-international.org/fileadmin/di/pdf/papers/di-bhutan.pdf |archivedate = 10 June 2011 |last = Hoffman |first = Klus |title = Democratization from Above: The Case of Bhutan |format = PDF |date = 1 April 2006 |accessdate = 24 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the government lifted a ban on television and the Internet, making Bhutan one of the last countries to introduce television. In his speech, the King said that television was a critical step to the modernisation of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country's [[gross national happiness]],&lt;ref name="GNH"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Larmer |first = Brook |date = March 2008 |title = Bhutan's Enlightened Experiment |journal = National Geographic |issn = 0027-9358 |url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/bhutan/larmer-text/2 |accessdate = 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but warned that the "misuse" of television could erode traditional Bhutanese values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1 = Cathy |last1 = Scott-Clark |first2 = Adrian |last2 = Levy |url = https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,975769,00.html |title = Fast Forward into Trouble |website = The Guardian |date = 14 June 2003 |accessdate = 1 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new constitution was presented in early 2005. In December 2005, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son's favour in 2008. On 14 December 2006, he announced that he would be abdicating immediately. This was followed by the first national [[Elections in Bhutan|parliamentary elections]] in [[Bhutanese National Council election, 2007–2008|December 2007]] and [[Bhutanese general election, 2008|March 2008]].

On 6 November 2008, 28-year-old [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]], eldest son of King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], was crowned King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Nitasha |last = Kaul |title = Bhutan Crowns a Jewel |work = UPI Asia |agency = United Press International |url = http://www.upiasia.com/Politics/2008/11/10/bhutan_crowns_a_jewel/1962 |date = 10 November 2008 |accessdate = 19 June 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615005027/http://www.upiasia.com/Politics/2008/11/10/bhutan_crowns_a_jewel/1962 |archivedate = 15 June 2011 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Geography of Bhutan}}
[[File:Bhutan topo en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A topographic map of Bhutan.]]
Bhutan is located on the southern slopes of the eastern [[Himalayas]], landlocked between the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] to the north and the Indian states of [[Sikkim]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] to the west and south. It lies between latitudes [[26th parallel north|26°N]] and [[29th parallel north|29°N]], and longitudes [[88th meridian east|88°E]] and [[93rd meridian east|93°E]]. The land consists mostly of steep and high [[mountains of Bhutan|mountains]] crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers, which form deep valleys before draining into the Indian plains. Elevation rises from {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the southern foothills to more than {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

The northern region of Bhutan consists of an arc of [[Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level; the highest point in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]] at {{convert|7570|m|ft}}, which has the distinction of being the [[highest unclimbed mountain]] in the world.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html |title = Bhutan – The World Factbook |publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest point, at {{convert|98|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is in the valley of [[Drangme Chhu]], where the river crosses the border with India.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds.

The [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]] in the central region of Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems: the [[Mo Chhu]] and the Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between {{convert|1500|and|4925|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. The forests of the central Bhutan mountains consist of [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] in higher elevations and [[Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests]] in lower elevations. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan's forest production. The [[Torsa River|Torsa]], [[Raidak]], [[Sankosh]], and [[Manas River|Manas]] are the main rivers of Bhutan, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands.

In the south, the [[Shiwalik Hills]] are covered with dense [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]], alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical [[Duars]] Plain. Most of the Duars is located in India, although a {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts: the northern and the southern Duars.

The northern Duars, which abut the Himalayan foothills, have rugged, sloping terrain and dry, porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy [[savanna]]h grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains, empty into the [[Brahmaputra River]] in India. Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005.

The climate in Bhutan varies with elevation, from subtropical in the south to [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the highlands and [[polar climate|polar-type]] climate, with year-round snow in the north. Bhutan experiences five distinct seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, winter and spring. Western Bhutan has the heavier monsoon rains; southern Bhutan has hot humid summers and cool winters; central and eastern Bhutan is temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters.&lt;!--Library of Congress|Geography--&gt;

The [[Bengal tiger]], [[clouded leopard]], [[hispid hare]] and the [[sloth bear]] live in the lush tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, [[grey langur]], tiger, [[goral]] and [[serow]] are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit-bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the [[Himalayan black bear]], [[red panda]], [[squirrel]], [[sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[Sus (genus)|wild pig]] and [[barking deer]]. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the [[snow leopard]], [[blue sheep]], [[marmot]], [[Tibetan wolf]], [[antelope]], [[Himalayan musk deer]] and the [[takin]], Bhutan's [[national animal]]. The endangered wild water buffalo occurs in southern Bhutan, although in small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Choudhury |first = A.U. |year = 2010 |title = The Vanishing Herds: Wild Water Buffalo |publisher = Gibbon Books &amp; The Rhino Foundation for Nature in North East India |location = Guwahati, India |isbn = 978-9380652009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern [[Himalayas]] have been identified as a global [[biodiversity]] hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding [[ecoregion]]s of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] between 1995 and 1997.

According to the Swiss-based [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], Bhutan is viewed as a model for proactive [[Conservation movement|conservation]] initiatives. The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity.&lt;ref name="IUCN-1/2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=New IUCN State Members|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/members/resources/newsletters/jan_2012_en.cfm|publisher=IUCN Newsletter|accessdate=7 July 2014|location=Switzerland|date=Jan 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145336/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/members/resources/newsletters/jan_2012_en.cfm|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty percent of the land area under [[forest]] cover, to designate more than 40%&lt;ref name=BTF1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutantrustfund.bt/parks-of-bhutan |title=Parks of Bhutan |website=Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation online |publisher=Bhutan Trust Fund |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702041330/http://www.bhutantrustfund.bt/parks-of-bhutan |archivedate=2 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BTF2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bhutantrustfund.bt/about-bhutan-trust-fund/the-organisation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100329063448/http://www.bhutantrustfund.bt/about-bhutan-trust-fund/the-organisation |archivedate = 29 March 2010 |title = The Organisation |website = Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation online |publisher = Bhutan Trust Fund |accessdate = 26 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of its territory as national parks, reserves and other protected areas, and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas.

It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan's overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law. The country's constitution mentions environment standards in multiple sections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kingdom of Bhutan. Royal Government of Bhutan. National Environment Commission.

[[File:Asian Black Bear Ursus thibetanus by Dr. Raju Kasambe 04.jpg|thumb|[[Himalayan black bear]]]]
Although Bhutan's natural heritage is still largely intact, the government has said that it cannot be taken for granted and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.undp.org/content/dam/bhutan/docs/Energy_environment/Env-publications/2009-Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan.pdf|title = Bhutan-Biodiversity Action Plan 2009|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 56.3% of all Bhutanese are involved with agriculture, forestry or conservation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The government aims to promote conservation as part of its plan to target Gross National Happiness. It currently has net zero greenhouse gas emissions because the small amount of pollution it creates is absorbed by the forests that cover most of the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bhutan: climate lessons from a Himalayan kingdom|url = http://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/08/05/bhutan-climate-lessons-from-a-himalayan-kingdom/|website = Climate Home – climate change news|accessdate = 17 December 2015|last = Pashley|first = Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the entire country collectively produces 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, the immense forest covering 72% of the country acts as a carbon sink, absorbing more than four million tons of carbon dioxide every year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bhutan has a number of progressive environmental policies that have caused the head of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] to call it an "inspiration and role model for the world on how economies and different countries can address climate change while at the same time improving the life of the citizen." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bhutan must consider long term measure on climate change: UNFCCC's head – BBS|url = http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=39604|website = BBS|accessdate = 17 December 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, electric cars have been pushed in the country and {{As of|2014|lc=y}} make up a tenth of all cars. Because the country gets most of its energy from hydrolelectric power, it does not emit significant greenhouse gases for energy production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pressures on the natural environment are already evident and will be fuelled by a complex array of forces. They include population pressures, agricultural modernisation, poaching, hydro-power development, mineral extraction, industrialisation, urbanisation, sewage and waste disposal, tourism, competition for available land, road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/8743947|title = ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATIONS AND RESPONSE IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES: A STUDY ON THE REPUBLIC OF BHUTAN|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Tims-Lewechi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the overlap of these extensive protected lands with populated areas has led to mutual habitat encroachment. Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas, trampling crops and killing livestock. In response, Bhutan has implemented an insurance scheme, begun constructing solar powered alarm fences, watch towers, and search lights, and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/addressing-human-wildlife-conflict/ |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110901021127/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/addressing-human-wildlife-conflict/ |archivedate = 1 September 2011 |title = Addressing Human-Wildlife Conflict |first = Jigme |last = Wangchuk |publisher = [[Bhutan Observer]] online |date = 8 July 2011 |accessdate = 13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Tashichodzong from the NE.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Tashichho Dzong]] in [[Thimphu]] is the seat of the Bhutanese government since 1952.]]
Bhutan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary]] form of government. The reigning monarch is [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]]. The current [[Prime Minister of Bhutan]] is [[Tshering Tobgay]], leader of the [[People's Democratic Party (Bhutan)|People's Democratic Party]].

The ''[[Druk Gyalpo]]'' (''Dragon King'') is the [[head of state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhutan 2008|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Bhutan_2008?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political system grants [[universal suffrage]]. It consists of the [[National Council (Bhutan)|National Council]], an upper house with 25 elected members; and the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly]] with 47 elected lawmakers from [[List of political parties in Bhutan|political parties]].

Executive power is exercised by the [[Council of Ministers (Bhutan)|Council of Ministers]] led by the [[Prime Minister of Bhutan|prime minister]]. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly]]. Judicial power is vested in the courts of Bhutan. The legal system originates from the semi-theocratic [[Tsa Yig]] code and has been influenced by [[English common law]] during the 20th century. The [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the judiciary.

=== Political culture ===
The first [[Bhutanese general election, 2008|general elections]] for the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly]] were held on 24 March 2008. The chief contestants were the [[Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party]] (DPT) led by [[Jigme Thinley]] and the [[People's Democratic Party (Bhutan)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP) led by [[Sangay Ngedup]]. The DPT won the elections by taking 45 out of 47 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aradhana |last=Sharma |url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080044949&amp;ch=3/25/2008%2012:28:00%20AM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731200031/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080044949&amp;ch=3%2F25%2F2008%2012%3A28%3A00%20AM |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2013 |title=Royalist Party Wins Election in Bhutan |publisher=NDTV.com |date=25 March 2008 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jigme Thinley]] served as Prime Minister from 2008 to 2013.

In the early 20th century, Bhutan's principal foreign relations were with [[British India]] and [[Tibet]]. The government of [[British India]] managed relations with the kingdom from the [[Bhutan House]] in [[Kalimpong]]. Fearful of Chinese communist expansion, Bhutan signed a friendship treaty with the newly independent Republic of India in 1949. Its concerns were exacerbated after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising|Chinese takeover of Tibet]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="bhutanstudies.org.bt"/&gt; Relations with [[Nepal]] remained strained due to [[Bhutanese refugees]]. Bhutan joined the United Nations in 1971. It was the first country to recognize Bangladesh's [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh|independence]] in 1971. It became a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[SAARC]]) in 1985. The country is a member of 150 international organizations,&lt;ref name="bhutanstudies.org.bt"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bhutanstudies.org.bt/publicationFiles/JBS/JBS_Vol10/v10-8.pdf |title=International Politics of Bhutan |author=Galay, Karma |volume=10 |pages=90–107 |journal=Journal of Bhutan Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative]], [[BBIN]], [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Group of 77]].

Bhutan maintains strong economic, strategic, and military relations with neighbouring India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/exclusive/bhutan-pm-india-is-closest-ally/33779 Bhutan PM: India is closest ally], NDTV, 16 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tshewang, Yeshey (12 July 2012) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130423175349/http://www.thebhutanese.bt/pm-stresses-on-importance-of-foreign-relations/ PM stresses on importance of foreign relations], ''The Bhutanese''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bhutan and India revised their friendship treaty which clarified Bhutan's full control of its foreign relations, including its border with Tibet. Bhutan has very warm relations with Japan, which provides significant development assistance. The Bhutanese royals were hosted by the Japanese imperial family during a [[state visit]] in 2011. Japan is also helping Bhutan cope with glacial floods through developing an early warning system.

Bhutan enjoys strong political and diplomatic relations with Bangladesh. The Bhutanese king was the guest of honour during celebrations for Bangladesh's 40th anniversary of independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/14/bhutan-king-arrives-in-dhaka Bhutan king arrives in Dhaka]. bdnews24.com (14 February 2013).

Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 52 countries and the European Union and has missions in India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Kuwait. It has two UN missions, one in New York and one in [[Geneva]]. Only India and Bangladesh have residential embassies in Bhutan, while Thailand has a consulate office in Bhutan. Other countries maintain informal diplomatic contact via their embassies in [[New Delhi]] and [[Dhaka]].

By a long-standing agreement, Indian and Bhutanese citizens may travel to each other's countries without the need for a [[Bhutanese passport|passport]] or visa but only their national identity cards. Bhutanese citizens may also work in India without legal restriction. Bhutan does not have formal diplomatic ties with its northern neighbour, China, although exchanges of visits at various levels between the two have significantly increased in recent times. The first bilateral agreement between China and Bhutan was signed in 1998 and Bhutan has also set up honorary consulates in the [[Special administrative regions of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KQkVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=bhutan+consulate+macau+-ibp#v=onepage&amp;q=bhutan%20consulate%20macau%20-ibp Bhutan: Cautiously Cultivated Positive Perception], Caroline Brassard in ''A Resurgent China: South Asian Perspectives'',  S.

In February 2007 the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised. Whereas the Treaty of 1949, Article 2 stated: "The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan. On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations," the revised treaty now states "In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India, the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other." The revised treaty also includes this preamble: "Reaffirming their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity", an element that was absent in the earlier version. The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 clarifies Bhutan's status as an independent and sovereign nation.

Bhutan maintains formal [[foreign relations of Bhutan|diplomatic relations]] with several Asian and European nations, Canada, and Brazil. Other countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have no formal diplomatic relations with Bhutan, but maintain informal contact through their respective embassies in [[New Delhi]] and Bhutanese honorary consulate in Washington DC. The United Kingdom has an honorary consul resident in Thimphu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=18408 |title = Bhutan establishes ties with Spain |first = Gyalsten K |last = Dorji |website = [[Kuensel]] |date = 15 February 2011 |accessdate = 29 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.embassiesabroad.com/embassies-of/Bhutan#18596 |title = Overseas Embassies and Consulates of Bhutan |website = Go Abroad.com |accessdate = 29 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1068.html |title=Bhutan Country Specific Information |website=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=24 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328065136/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1068.html |archivedate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Bhutan Army]] is Bhutan's military service. It includes the [[Royal Bodyguard of Bhutan|royal bodyguard]] and the [[Royal Bhutan Police]]. Membership is voluntary and the minimum age for recruitment is 18. The standing army numbers about 16,000 and is trained by the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Arun |last = Bhattacharjee |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EL19Df04.html |title = Bhutan Army Sees Action at Last |website = Asia Times |date = 19 December 2003 |accessdate = 23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an annual budget of about US$13.7 million (1.8 percent of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]). Being a [[landlocked country]], Bhutan has no navy. It also has no air force or army aviation corps. The Army relies on the Eastern Air Command of the [[Indian Air Force]] for air assistance.

A harassment campaign escalating in the early 1990s ensued, and afterwards Bhutanese security forces began expelling people.

After many years in refugee camps, many inhabitants are now moving to host nations such as Canada, Norway, the UK, Australia, and the US as refugees. The US has admitted 60,773 refugees from fiscal years 2008 through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/data/refugee_arrival_data.htm Refugee Arrival Data].

===Political divisions===&lt;!--Linked from Template:Bhutan topics--&gt;
{{main|Districts of Bhutan|Gewogs of Bhutan|Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009}}
Bhutan is divided into twenty ''[[Dzongkhag]]'' (districts), administered by a body called the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. In certain ''[[thromde]]s'' (urban municipalities), a further municipal administration is directly subordinate to the Dzongkhag administration. In the vast majority of constituencies, rural ''[[Gewogs of Bhutan|geog]]'' (village blocks) are administered by bodies called the Geog Tshogde.&lt;ref name=LGA09&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo74.pdf |format=PDF |title=Local Government Act of Bhutan 2009 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=11 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162642/http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo74.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thromdes (municipalities) elect Thrompons to lead administration, who in turn represent the Thromde in the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. Likewise, ''geog'' elect headmen called ''gup''s, vice-headmen called ''mangmis'', who also sit on the Dzongkhag Tshogdu, as well as other members of the Geog Tshogde.

==Economy==
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bhutan.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Bhutan's exports.]]
[[File:Bhutan Power Corporation office Thimphu.jpg|thumb|The Bhutan Power Corporation headquarters in [[Thimphu]]. Bhutan's principal export is [[hydroelectricity]].]]
{{Main|Economy of Bhutan}}
Bhutan's currency is the [[ngultrum]], whose value is [[Fixed exchange rate|fixed]] to the [[Indian rupee]]. The rupee is also accepted as [[legal tender]] in the country.
Though Bhutan's economy is one of the world's smallest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World development indicators |url = http://wdi.worldbank.org/tables |publisher = The World Bank Group |accessdate = 28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has grown rapidly in recent years, by eight percent in 2005 and 14 percent in 2006. In 2007, Bhutan had the second-fastest-growing economy in the world, with an annual economic growth rate of 22.4 percent. This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic [[Tala Hydroelectric Power Station]]. {{As of|2012}}, Bhutan's [[per capita income]] was US$2,420.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = World development indicators: size of economy |url = http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/1.1 |publisher = The World Bank Group |accessdate = 28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan's economy is based on agriculture, forestry, tourism and the sale of [[hydroelectric power]] to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for 55.4 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = GNH Survey 2010 |url = http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/docs/2010_Results/PDF/National.pdf |publisher = The Centre for Bhutan Studies |accessdate = 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agrarian practices consist largely of [[subsistence farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars, are a small [[cottage industry]]. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.

This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. Bhutan has no [[rail transport|railways]], though [[Indian Railways]] plans to link southern Bhutan to its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050126/main5.htm |first = Rajeev |last = Sharma |title = MoUs with Bhutan on Rail Links, Power Projects |website = The Tribune |date = 25 January 2011 |accessdate = 23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan and India signed a 'free trade' accord in 2008, which additionally allowed Bhutanese imports and exports from third markets to transit India without tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/india_e.htm |title = MEMBER INFORMATION: India and the WTO |publisher = [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) |accessdate = 23 April 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090422224717/http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/countries_e/india_e.htm |archivedate = 22 April 2009 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan had trade relations with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet region]] until 1960, when it closed its border with China after an influx of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA12Ad02.html |title = In Bhutan, China and India Collide |first = Mohan |last = Balaji |date = 12 January 2008 |accessdate = 3 October 2010 |work = [[Asia Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial sector is in a nascent stage, and though most production comes from cottage industry, larger industries are being encouraged and some industries such as cement, steel, and [[ferroalloy]] have been set up. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian contract labour. Agricultural produce includes rice, chilies, dairy (some yak, mostly cow) products, buckwheat, barley, root crops, apples, and citrus and maize at lower elevations. Industries include cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages and [[calcium carbide]].&lt;!---CIA factbook|CIA-1---&gt;

Bhutan has seen recent growth in the technology sector, in areas such as green tech and consumer Internet/e-commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Chester |first = Ken |title = A Bhutan tech primer: early signs of startups and e-commerce |url = http://www.techinasia.com/bhutan-tech-startups-ecommerce-primer/ |accessdate = 29 September 2013 |newspaper = Tech in Asia |date = 2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Thimphu TechPark launched in the capital and incubates start-ups via the Bhutan Innovation and Technology Centre (BITC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BITC – Business Incubator |url=http://www.thimphutechpark.com/bitc-business-incubator |website=Thimphu TechPark |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321002750/http://www.thimphutechpark.com/bitc-business-incubator |archivedate=21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incomes of over [[Ngultrum|Nu]] 100,000 [[per annum]] are taxed, but very few wage and salary earners qualify. Bhutan's inflation rate was estimated at about three percent in 2003. Bhutan has a [[Gross Domestic Product]] of around US$5.855 billion (adjusted to [[purchasing power parity]]), making it the 158th-largest economy in the world. Per capita income (PPP) is around $7,641,&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; ranked 144th. Government revenues total $407.1 million, though expenditures amount to $614 million. 25 percent&lt;!---CIA factbook|CIA-economy---&gt; of the budget expenditure, however, is financed by India's Ministry of External Affairs.&lt;ref group=note&gt;India's Ministry of External Affairs provides financial aid to neighbouring countries under "technical and economic cooperation with other countries and advances to foreign governments."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020301/budget.htm |title = BUDGET |publisher = The Tribune (India) online |accessdate = 1 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan's exports, principally electricity, [[cardamom]], [[gypsum]], timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit, precious stones and spices, total €128 million (2000 est.). Imports, however, amount to €164 million, leading to a [[trade deficit]]. Main items imported include fuel and lubricants, grain, machinery, vehicles, fabrics and rice. Bhutan's main export partner is India, accounting for 58.6 percent of its export goods. Hong Kong (30.1 percent) and Bangladesh (7.3 percent) are the other two top export partners.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; As its border with Tibet is closed, trade between Bhutan and China is now almost non-existent. Bhutan's import partners include India (74.5 percent), Japan (7.4 percent) and Sweden (3.2 percent).&lt;!---CIA factbook|CIA-2---&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{main|Agriculture in Bhutan}}
[[File:Rice planting in Bhutan 01.jpg|thumb|Rice planting near [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]]]]
The share of the agricultural sector in GDP declined from approximately 55% in 1985 to 33% in 2003. In 2013 the government announced the aspiration that Bhutan will become the first country in the world with 100 percent [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/feb/11/bhutan-first-wholly-organic-country |title = Bhutan set to plough lone furrow as world's first wholly organic country |website = The Guardian |date = 11 February 2013 |accessdate = 25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/35179966/Four_New_Strategies_to_Grow_the_Organic_Agriculture_Sector "Four New Strategies to Grow the Organic Agriculture Sector"], Agrofor International Journal, 2(3):61–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bhutanese red rice]] is the country's most widely known agricultural export, enjoying a market in North America and Europe. Bangladesh is the largest market of Bhutanese [[apple]]s and [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/bangladesh-wants-to-expand-trade-with-bhutan/|title=Bangladesh wants to expand trade with Bhutan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fishing in Bhutan]] is mainly centered on [[trout]] and [[carp]].

===Industry===
The industrial sector accounts of 22% of the economy. The key manufacturing sectors in Bhutan include production of [[ferroalloy]], cement, metal poles, iron and nonalloy steel products, processed [[graphite]], [[copper conductor]]s, alcoholic and carbonated [[beverage]]s, processed fruits, carpets, wood products and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/demonetisation-impacts-indias-border-trade-with-bhutan/articleshow/55717058.cms|title=Demonetisation impacts India’s border trade with Bhutan|first=Dipanjan Roy|last=Chaudhury|date=1 December 2016|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{Main|Mining in Bhutan}}
Bhutan has deposits of numerous minerals. Commercial production includes [[coal]], [[dolomite]], [[gypsum]], and [[limestone]]. The country has proven reserves of [[beryl]], [[copper]], graphite, [[lead]], [[mica]], [[pyrite]], [[tin]], [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. However, the country remains as an environmental frontier as it prefers to conserve the environment, rather than to exploit and destroy it for money.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Energy===
{{main|Energy in Bhutan}}
Bhutan's largest export is hydroelectricity. {{As of|2015}}, it generates 5,000 [[Megawatt|MW]] of hydropower from [[Himalaya]]n river valleys.&lt;ref name="en.prothom-alo.com"&gt;[http://www.en.prothom-alo.com/economy/news/84575/Bhutan-offers-Bangladesh-cheaper-hydel Bhutan offers Bangladesh cheaper hydel]. En.prothom-alo.com (1 November 2015).

Future projects are being planned with Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="en.prothom-alo.com"/&gt; Hydropower has been the primary focus for the country's [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|five-year plans]]. {{As of|2015}}, the [[Tala Hydroelectric Power Station]] is its largest power plant, with an installed capacity of 1,020 MW. It has received assistance from India, Austria and the [[Asian Development Bank]] in developing hydroelectric projects.
Besides Hydropower, it is also endowed with significant renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and bioenergy. Technically viable solar energy generation capacity is around 12000 MW and wind around 760 MW. More than 70% of its land is under forest cover, which is an immense source of bioenergy in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Financial sector===
[[File:Le Meridien Hotel, Thimphu (c).jpg|thumb|The [[Le Méridien]] [[Thimphu]] is part of Bhutan's burgeoning [[Tourism in Bhutan|tourism industry]].]]
{{see also|Banking in Bhutan}}

The two main financial institutions are the [[Bank of Bhutan]], which is based in the southern city of [[Phuntsholing]] and is the retail wing of the [[Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan]], and the Bhutan National Bank, which is based in Thimphu. The [[Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan]] is the main [[stock exchange]].

===Air===
[[Paro Airport]] is the only international airport in Bhutan. [[Yongphulla Airport]] in [[Trashigang]] is a small domestic airport that underwent upgrades through 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13325 |title=Domestic Air Service to Take Wing Soon |first=Tshering |last=Palden |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305053444/http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13325 |archivedate=5 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yongphulla Airport was scheduled for completion in January 2010 but {{as of|2015|January|lc=y}}, the airport remains closed due to ongoing runway repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=16565 |title = DYT Approves Quarry Without Community Clearance |first = Tshering |last = Palden |publisher = [[Kuensel]] online |date = 30 August 2010 |accessdate = 10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; National carrier Druk Air operates flights between Paro Airport and airports in [[Jakar]] (Bumthang Dzongkhag) and [[Gelephu]] (Sarpang Dzongkhag) on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/drukair-to-launch-scheduled-operations-to-gelephu/ |title = Drukair to launch scheduled operations to Gelephu |first = Gyalsten K |last = Dorji |publisher = [[Kuensel]] online |date = 2 December 2015 |accessdate = 11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road===
The [[Lateral Road]] is Bhutan's primary east–west corridor, connecting [[Phuentsholing]] in the southwest to [[Trashigang]] in the east. In between, the Lateral Road runs directly through [[Wangdue Phodrang]], [[Trongsa]] and other population centres. The Lateral Road also has spurs connecting to the capital [[Thimphu]] and other major population centres such as [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and [[Punakha]]. As with other roads in Bhutan, the Lateral Road presents serious safety concerns due to pavement conditions, sheer drops, hairpin turns, weather and landslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey into Bhutan |first = Jamie |last = Zeppa |publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |year = 2000 |isbn = 978-1-57322-815-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=383rWqWgga8C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=4775 |title = Icy Roads Claim Lives |publisher = [[Kuensel]] online |date = 4 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=16502 |title = Landslide at Dzong Viewpoint |first = Samten |last = Yeshi |publisher = [[Kuensel]] online |date = 24 August 2010 |accessdate = 25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, road widening has been a priority across Bhutan, in particular for the North-East-West highway from Trashigang to Dochula. The widening project is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and will make road travel across the country substantially faster and more efficient. In addition, it is projected that the improved road conditions will encourage more tourism in the more inaccessible eastern region of Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North-East-West highway widening progressing under pre-financing|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/north-east-highway-widening-progressing-under-pre-financing/|website=KuenselOnline|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Embassy of India Thimphu, Bhutan|url=https://www.indianembassythimphu.bt/pages.php?id=111|website=www.indianembassythimphu.bt|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East-West highway widening on track|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/east-west-highway-widening-on-track/|website=KuenselOnline|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the road conditions appear to be deterring tourists from visiting Bhutan due to the increased instances of road blocks, landslides and dust disruption caused by the widening project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International tourists bemoan bad road conditions in Bhutan {{!}} Asia News Network|url=http://www.asianews.network/content/international-tourists-bemoan-bad-road-conditions-bhutan-18438|accessdate=30 June 2017|date=31 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708150611/http://www.asianews.network/content/international-tourists-bemoan-bad-road-conditions-bhutan-18438|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
Bhutan has no railways, though it has entered into an agreement with India to link southern Bhutan to India's vast network by constructing an {{convert|18|km|mi}}-long {{RailGauge|1676mm}} [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] rail link between [[Hashimara]] in West Bengal and [[Toribari]] in Bhutan. The construction of the railway via Satali, Bharna Bari and Dalsingpara by [[Indian railways]] will be funded by India.&lt;ref name="times2009"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6970997.ece |work = The Times |date = 30 December 2009 |title = Isolated Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan to get its first railway link |first = Jeremy |last = Page |accessdate = 10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan's nearest railway station is Hasimara.

=== Ethnic groups ===
Bhutanese people primarily consist of the [[Ngalop]]s and [[Sharchop people|Sharchops]], called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese respectively. Although the [[Sharchops]] are slightly larger in demographic size, the [[Ngalop]]s dominate the political sphere, as the King and the political elite belong to this group.&lt;ref name=growup3&gt;{{cite web |author=GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform |title=Ethnicity in Bhutan |url=https://growup.ethz.ch/atlas/Bhutan |publisher=ETH Zurich |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet. Much the same could be said of the [[Sharchops]], the largest group, who traditionally follow the [[Nyingmapa]] rather than the official [[Drukpa Kagyu]] form of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In modern times, with improved transportation infrastructure, there has been much intermarriage between these groups.

The [[Lhotshampa]], meaning "southerner Bhutanese", are a heterogeneous group of mostly [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] ancestry. It was claimed that they constituted 45% of the population in the 1988 census,&lt;ref name="bns"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bhutannewsservice.com/people-population/ |title = People &amp; Population |publisher = Bhutan News Service |accessdate = 10 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and include migrants from as early as the 1890s to as recent as the 1980s, who have fought a bitter war with Bhutan over rights to abode, language, and dress. In the early 1970s, intermarriage between the [[Lhotshampas]] Bhutanese and mainstream Bhutanese society was encouraged by the government, but after the late 1980s, the Bhutanese government forced about 108,000 Lhotshampas from their homes, seized their land, and expelled them to refugee camps.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; Consequently, there has been mass emigration from Bhutan (both forced and voluntary) and [[ethnic cleansing in Bhutan]] resulting in hundreds of thousands of people left [[statelessness|stateless]] in [[refugee camps]] of Nepal.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; Currently, Lhotsampa are estimated to make up approximately 20% of Bhutan's population.&lt;ref name="growup3"/&gt;

It is estimated that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the Bhutanese population follow [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], which is also the [[state religion]].

Buddhism was introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD. Tibetan king [[Songtsän Gampo]] (reigned 627–649), a convert to Buddhism, ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at [[Bumthang (town)|Bumthang]] in central Bhutan and at Kyichu Lhakhang (near [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]]) in the [[Paro Valley]].&lt;ref name="CS1"/&gt;

The national language is Bhutanese ([[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]]), one of 53 languages in the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan language]] family. The script, here called ''Chhokey'' ("Dharma language"), is identical to classical Tibetan. In the schools English is the medium of instruction and Dzongkha is taught as the national language. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan, all of them in the [[Tibeto-Burman]] family, except [[Nepali language|Nepali]], an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]].&lt;ref name=CIDCM/&gt;

Until the 1980s, the government sponsored the teaching of Nepali in schools in southern Bhutan. With the adoption of ''Driglam Namzhag'' and its expansion into the idea of strengthening the role of Dzongkha, Nepali was dropped from the curriculum. The languages of Bhutan are still not well characterized, and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar. Before the 1980s, the [[Lhotshampa]] (Nepali-speaking community), mainly based in southern Bhutan, constituted approximately 30% of the population.&lt;ref name=CIDCM&gt;{{cite web |title = Assessment for Lhotshampas in Bhutan |url = http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=76001 |website = Database |publisher = Center for International Development and Conflict Management, [[University of Maryland]] |accessdate = 9 August 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120622213816/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=76001 |archivedate = 22 June 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a purge of Lhotshaampas from 1990–1992 this number might not accurately reflect the current population.

Dzongkha is partially intelligible with [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]] and spoken natively by 25% of the population. [[Tshangla language|Tshangla]], the language of the Sharchop and the principal pre-Tibetan language of Bhutan, is spoken by a greater number of people. It is not easily classified and may constitute an independent branch of Tibeto-Burman. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers constituted some 40% of the population {{As of|2006|lc=y}}. The larger minority languages are [[Dzala language|Dzala]] (11%), [[Limbu language|Limbu]] (10%), [[Kheng language|Kheng]] (8%), and [[Bantawa language|Rai]] (8%). There are no reliable sources for the ethnic or linguistic composition of Bhutan, so these numbers do not add up to 100%.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Bhutan}}
[[File:ILCS Campus Tagse Bhutan.jpg|thumb|The ILCS Campus Tagse Bhutan.]]
Bhutan has one decentralised university with eleven constituent colleges spread across the kingdom, the [[Royal University of Bhutan]]. The first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|five-year plan]] provided for a central education authority—in the form of a director of education appointed in 1961—and an organised, modern school system with free and universal primary education.

Education programmes were given a boost in 1990 when the [[Asian Development Bank]] (see Glossary) granted a US$7.13 million loan for staff training and development, specialist services, equipment and furniture purchases, salaries and other recurrent costs, and facility rehabilitation and construction at Royal Bhutan Polytechnic.

Bhutan has a rich and unique cultural heritage that has largely remained intact because of its isolation from the rest of the world until the mid-20th century. One of the main attractions for tourists is the country's culture and traditions. Bhutanese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kharat, Rajesh |title = Bhutan's Security Scenario |journal = Contemporary South Asia |volume = 13 |issue = 2 |year = 200 |pages = 171–185 |doi = 10.1080/0958493042000242954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Regg, Cohn.

While Bhutanese citizens are free to travel abroad, Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners. Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost, which is high for tourists on tighter budgets. Entry is free for citizens of India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives, but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US$250 per day that they stay in the country, though this fee covers most travel, lodging and meal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/plan-your-trip/travel-requirements |title=Travel Requirements |publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120162648/http://www.tourism.gov.bt/plan-your-trip/travel-requirements |archivedate=20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutan received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011, of which 25% were for meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New MICE hardware on the cards for Bhutan |url = http://www.ttgmice.com/magazine/?term_id&amp;issues&amp;ID=23596 |publisher = TTGmice |accessdate = 16 March 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605131337/http://www.ttgmice.com/magazine/?term_id&amp;issues&amp;ID=23596 |archivedate = 5 June 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan is the first nation in the world to ban smoking. It has been illegal to smoke in public or sell tobacco, according to [[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010]]. Violators are fined the equivalent of $232—more than two months' salary in Bhutan.

===Dress===
The national dress for Bhutanese men is the ''[[gho]]'', a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the ''kera''. Women wear an ankle-length dress, the ''[[kira (dress)|kira]]'', which is clipped at the shoulders with two identical brooches called the ''koma'' and tied at the waist with kera. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, the ''wonju'' which is worn underneath the kira. A long-sleeved jacket-like garment, the ''toego'' is worn over the kira. The sleeves of the wonju and the tego are folded together at the cuffs, inside out.

Social status and class determine the texture, colours, and decorations that embellish the garments. Differently coloured scarves, known as ''rachu'' for women (red is the most common colour) and ''kabney'' for men, are important indicators of social standing, as Bhutan has traditionally been a [[feudal]] society. Jewellery is mostly worn by women, especially during religious festivals ([[tsechu]]s) and public gatherings. To strengthen Bhutan's identity as an independent country, Bhutanese law requires all Bhutanese government employees to wear the national dress at work and all citizens to wear the national dress while visiting schools and other government offices though many citizens, particularly adults, choose to wear the customary dress as formal attire.

===Architecture===

===Music and dance===
[[File:Bhutan-masked-dance.jpg|thumb|upright|''Chaam'', sacred masked dances, are annually performed during religious festivals.]]
{{Main|Music of Bhutan}}
Masked dances and dance dramas are common traditional features at festivals, usually accompanied by traditional music. Energetic dancers, wearing colorful wooden or composition face masks and stylized costumes, depict heroes, demons, [[Daemon (classical mythology)|dæmons]], death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people. The dancers enjoy royal patronage, and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient lore and art of mask-making.

The [[music of Bhutan]] can generally be divided into traditional and modern varieties; traditional music comprises religious and folk genres, the latter including ''[[zhungdra]]'' and ''[[boedra]]''.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite book |title = The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife: Southeast Asia and India, Central and East Asia, Middle East |volume = 2 |first = William M. |last = Clements |publisher = Greenwood Press |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-313-32849-7 |pages = 106–110 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvrWAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern ''[[rigsar]]'' is played on a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards, and dates back to the early 1990s; it shows the influence of Indian popular music, a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences.&lt;ref name=k1&gt;{{cite web |accessdate = 16 October 2011 |url = http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2420 |first = Ugyen |last = Penjor |title = From Ngesem Ngesem to Khu Khu Khu&amp;nbsp;...

===Family structure===
In Bhutanese families, inheritance generally passes [[Matrilineality|matrilineally]] through the female rather than the male line. Daughters will inherit their parents' house. A man is expected to make his own way in the world and often moves to his wife's home. [[Love marriage]]s are common in urban areas, but the tradition of [[arranged marriage]]s among acquainted families is still prevalent in the rural areas. Although uncommon, [[polygamy]] is accepted, often being a device to keep property in a contained family unit rather than dispersing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Sikkim and Bhutan |publisher = Vikas Publications, Indian Council for Cultural Relations |first = V.H. |last = Coelho |year = 1970 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KD0KAQAAIAAJ |page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous king, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], who abdicated in 2006, had four queens, all of whom are sisters. The current king, [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]], wed [[Jetsun Pema]], 21, a commoner and daughter of a pilot, on 13 October 2011.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bhutanese cuisine}}
[[Rice]] ([[Bhutanese red rice|red rice]]), [[buckwheat]], and increasingly [[maize]], are the staples of [[Bhutanese cuisine]]. The local diet also includes pork, beef, [[yak]] meat, chicken, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chilies and cheese are prepared. ''[[Ema datshi]]'', made very spicy with cheese and chilies, might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it. Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Popular beverages include [[butter tea]], black tea, locally brewed ''[[ara (drink)|ara]]'' ([[rice wine]]), and beer. Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned the sale of [[tobacco]] under its [[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010|Tobacco Act of 2010]].&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;

===Sports===
{{Main|Sports in Bhutan}}
[[File:Bhutan archery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Changlimithang Stadium]] during a parade.]]

Bhutan's national and most popular sport is [[archery]].&lt;ref name="impress BHUTAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impressbhutan.com/sports.html |title=Bhutan at Play |publisher=Impress BHUTAN Travel |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. Two targets are placed over 100 meters apart, and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event, and competitions are organized between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. [[Darts]] (''khuru'') is an equally popular outdoor team sport, in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10&amp;nbsp;cm nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target 10 to 20 meters away.

Another traditional sport is the ''[[Digor (sports)|Digor]]'', which resembles the [[shot put]] and [[Horseshoes|horseshoe throwing]].

Another popular sport is [[basketball]].&lt;ref name="impress BHUTAN"/&gt; In 2002, Bhutan's [[Bhutan national football team|national football team]] played [[Montserrat national football team|Montserrat]], in what was billed as [[The Other Final]]; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup final]], but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world's two lowest ranked teams. The match was held in Thimphu's [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang National Stadium]], and Bhutan won 4–0. A documentary of the match was made by the Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer. Bhutan won its first two FIFA World Cup Qualifying matches, beating Sri Lanka 1–0 in Sri Lanka and 2–1 in Bhutan, taking the aggregate at 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://screamer.deadspin.com/bhutan-wins-again-a-match-report-from-a-deadspin-reade-1692295717 "Bhutan Wins Again! A Match Report from a Deadspin Reader in Bhutan"]. Screamer.deadspin.com. Retrieved on 4 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cricket]] has also gained popularity in Bhutan, particularly since the introduction of television channels from India. The [[Bhutan national cricket team]] is one of the most successful affiliate nations in the region.

'''CKMM-FM''' is a [[contemporary hit radio|CHR/Top 40]]-formatted radio station owned by [[Bell Media]], branded as '''103.1 [[Virgin Radio]]'''. The station broadcasts from 1445 Pembina Highway, [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] with sister stations [[CFWM-FM|99.9 BOB FM]] and [[CFRW|TSN Radio 1290]], while its transmitter is located at [[Duff Roblin Provincial Park]].

CKMM-FM primarily competes with [[CHWE-FM|Energy 106]].

==History==

On March 13, 1979, Armadale Communications was awarded a license for a new FM station in Winnipeg, to broadcast on 103.1&amp;nbsp;MHz. On February 14, 1980, the station signed on air as '''CKWG-FM''', with a near [[freeform (radio format)|freeform]] format. In 1989, the station flipped to [[adult contemporary]]. The following year, the station was sold to Western World Communications. The call signs have changed quite a bit over the years, from '''CHZZ-FM''' ('''Z103''') to '''CKLU-FM''' ('''103 U FM''', then briefly '''Mix 103''') and then finally to '''CKMM-FM'''.  In 1996, the station switched to a [[country music]] format with the on-air name '''Star 103'''.  When Star 103 and [[CFQX-FM|QX 104]] came under the ownership of Craig Broadcasting, the format of Star 103 was changed to avoid redundancy.  CKMM re-launched with a [[contemporary hit radio|CHR/Top 40]] format as '''HOT 103''' on New Year's Eve, 1997. CKMM and CFQX became properties of Standard Radio in 2002.

On October 29, [[2007 in radio|2007]], [[Astral Media]] took over CKMM as a result of a buyout of [[Standard Radio]]. As part of Astral's merger with [[Bell Media]] on June 27, 2013, CKMM is now owned by Bell Media. Sister station CFQX and Bell's [[CHIQ-FM|CHIQ]] were sold to the [[Jim Pattison Group]] in order to meet ownership limits.

On August 31, 2012, CKMM rebranded as '''103-1 Virgin Radio''', like other Astral Media CHR stations, while keeping the same music format and staff.

{{Politics of Cape Verde}}
'''Parliamentary elections''' were held [[Cape Verde]] on 6 February 2011. The result was a victory for the ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV), led by Prime Minister [[Jose Maria Neves]], which won 38 of the 72 seats in the [[National Assembly (Cape Verde)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cv.html Elections in Cape Verde] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Although technical problems prevented a prompt announcement of official results, it quickly became clear that PAICV had won a parliamentary majority, and Veiga conceded defeat on 7 February 2011. The opposition's immediate acceptance of defeat, prior to an official announcement, was viewed as a sign of the strength of democracy in Cape Verde.&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/capeVerdeNews/idAFLDE7160UT20110207 Cape Verde opposition concedes election defeat], Reuters 7 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1910 Chinese expedition to Tibet''' or the '''Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910'''&lt;ref&gt;Sky Train: Tibetan Women on the Edge of History, by Canyon Sam, p258&lt;/ref&gt; was a military campaign of the [[Qing dynasty]] to establish direct rule in [[Tibet]] in early 1910. The expedition occupied [[Lhasa]] on February 12 and officially deposed the [[13th Dalai Lama]] on the 25th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State|author=Melvyn C. Goldstein }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tibet under Qing rule|Qing rule of Tibet]] was established in the early 18th century after the [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)|1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet]], but it was essentially a [[protectorate]] rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. 

After the [[British expedition to Tibet]] in 1904 and the [[Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet|Sino-British treaty in 1906]], the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, "The British military expedition and subsequent [[Treaty of Lhasa|convention]] made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the [[13th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] fled to India."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68481965|title=Tibet : the road ahead|last=1949-|first=Dawa Norbu,|date=1999|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India|isbn=9788172233617|location=New Delhi|oclc=68481965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in [[Khams]] by Qing administrators, and fearing that the [[amban]] in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the [[Qing court]]. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from [[Sichuan]] to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Oidtmann, [https://www.academia.edu/2299057/Playing_the_Lottery_with_Sincere_Thoughts_The_Manchus_and_the_selection_of_incarnate_lamas_during_the_last_days_of_the_Qing Playing the Lottery with Sincere Thoughts: the Manchus and the selection of incarnate lamas during the last days of the Qing], Academia.edu, 40 p., p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the [[Xinhai Lhasa turmoil]] in 1911–1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet. All Qing forces left Tibet by the end of 1912.

'''Eurobandið''' (Euroband) is the name of [[Iceland]]ic technopop and dance duo [[Friðrik Ómar]] and [[Regína Ósk]], who together represented [[Iceland]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. They performed the song "[[This is My Life (Eurobandið song)|This Is My Life]]" in the second semi-final, on 22 May 2008 which won them a place in the final on May 24. They finished 14th out of 25 in the final with 64 points.

They have both, separately, established themselves as popular artists in Iceland and have tried to represent Iceland in [[Eurovision]] before as separate acts, but were unsuccessful. It was not until they joined that Iceland chose them as their representative in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]].

'''FAUR S.A.''' is an industrial engineering and manufacturing company based in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].

==History==
FAUR was founded by [[Nicolae Malaxa]] in 1921 under the name '''MALAXA'''. Main activities were the repairing of rolling stock, manufacturing [[steam locomotives]], [[diesel locomotives]], car-engines and passenger coaches, diesel engines, brake equipment, and special alloy steels. By the end of the 1930s, the Malaxa factories were one of the biggest industrial group in Southeastern Europe, and the main provider of equipment for the [[Romanian Railways]] during the period.

[[Nationalization|Nationalised]] in 1948, part of the company became known as '''23 August Works'''. During [[Communist Romania]] it extended its range of manufacturing by approaching pilot projects to the most Romanian industries but also to other countries in Europe, Asia and Africa.

In 1990, the company was renamed FAUR and privatized.

Since 2004, FAUR is part of [[Bega Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faur.ro/en.html Brief History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steam locomotives==
Since 1920, the design and the construction of different types of [[railway engine]]s began at the Domains Factories (nowadays [[UMC Reșița]]) in [[Reșița]] and Malaxa Factories in Bucharest. Due to the success of the construction of the railway engines in Reșița and Bucharest factories, Romania ceased importing railway locomotives starting with 1930. Between 1926 and 1960, a total number of 1,207 [[steam locomotives]] were built in Romania: 10 models for [[Standard gauge|standard track]]s and 3 models for the [[narrow gauge railway]]s. From these, 797 steam locomotives were made in Reșița Factories and 410 at Malaxa Factories. In 1960 the production of steam locomotives was ceased, the Romanian industry focusing on fabrication of the diesel railway engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.ro/cfr_new/eng/prim_loco.htm The first railway engines in Romania]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''foreign housing exclusion''' goes hand-in-hand with the [[foreign earned income exclusion]]. According to section 911(a) of the federal tax code, a qualified individual under either the [[bona fide resident test|bona fide residence test]] or the [[physical presence test]] will be able to exclude from the gross income the housing amount in a foreign country provided for by the employer.  Note that "provided for by the employer" does not require that the employer actually procure the housing.  If the housing is paid for out of wages paid by the employer, this will meet the test.  However, housing expenses in excess of the wages or earnings from self-employment would not qualify.

The tax code defines the "housing amount" as the total of all qualified housing expenses less the "base housing amount." As a result, it is then important to define what is considered qualified housing expenses as well what the [[IRS]] mean by the base housing amount.

== Qualification ==
In order to qualify, housing expenses must be reasonable expenses incurred by the [[expatriate]] or their spouse and dependents if they live together in a foreign country.  An exception to this rule would be if a second foreign household is maintained for the spouse and dependents due certain adverse and unhealthful conditions such as warfare or civil unrest. As a result, qualified housing expenses for both the first and second foreign home would include the following:

* The fair rental value of housing provided by employer
* Utilities (except for telephone charges)
* Rent
* Repairs
* Real and personal property insurance
* Nonrefundable fees for securing a leasehold
* Nondeductible occupancy taxes
* Residential parking
* Rental of furniture and accessories

Outside of the above list, any other housing expenses are not considered qualified. In addition, the value of meals or lodging that is excluded from gross income will not be excludable for foreign housing exclusion purposes as this would be considered a double benefit. For example, it would not include:

* Buying property
* Labor
* TV or Cable Bills
* Furniture
* Improvements that increase the value of the property

Keep in mind that you cannot include any expenses that you have excluded from gross income, there is no double benefit, in short. There is also a limit on the amount of housing expenses one can incur, usually around 30% of the FEI exclusion times the number of days in the qualifying period, usually about $27,450 a year. You can sometimes get more than this standard limit if you live in a high-cost locality, these limits can be found on Form 2555.

== Second foreign household  ==
If you have 2 foreign households, because your family cannot live near your work because of dangerous or unhealthful conditions, you may qualify for including the expenses of the second household.  This can also include adverse living conditions including war, or if you need to live on a construction site or drilling rig.

== Foreign Housing Deduction  ==
If you are not self-employed, even partially, you cannot take a housing deduction, although you may be eligible for exclusion, as mentioned earlier. If you are considered self-employed, then you can deduct the housing amount on line 36 of [[form 1040]] and [[form 2555]]. If you are both employed and self-employed, you can deduct part of your housing amount and also exclude a portion of it.

== Couples  ==
Determining a couples tax obligations matters if they are living together or separately.

== Limitations ==
Sections 911(c)(2)(A)(i) and 911(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the federal tax code limits the housing expenses eligible for the housing exclusion to 30% of the maximum [[foreign earned income exclusion]].  The result is then multiplied by the number of days in the qualifying period that fall within the tax year.  For 2015, if the maximum foreign earned income exclusion is $100,800, eligible housing expenses for the year would be limited to $30,240 (30% of $100,800). However, qualified individuals living in high-cost neighborhoods are able to deduct more than the standard limit of $30,240 in 2015 but not more than the limits outlined in the Instructions for Form 2555.

In defining the base amount, section 911(c)(1)(B)(iii) of the federal tax code states that the amount is equal to 16% of the maximum [http://www.taxplannercpa.com/foreign-earned-income-exclusion-eligilibility.php foreign earned income exclusion] multiplied by the number of qualifying days within the tax year.  Once again, if the maximum foreign earned income exclusion for the 2015 tax year is $100,800, the base amount would be limited to $16,128 (16% of $100,800) for the year.

To illustrate, let's assume that an architect qualifies for the foreign earned income exclusion under the physical presence test with a qualifying period that includes all of 2015. He makes $69,000 through wages and had $18,000 in housing expenses. In determining the housing amount for the foreign housing exclusion, the housing expenses would meet the $30,240 limit for the year.  However, $16,128 must be reduced from the $18,000 in order to arrive at the housing amount of $1,872 that is eligible for the foreign housing exclusion.

== Conclusion  ==
It is important to reiterate that in order to take advantage of the housing exclusion, the housing amount must be paid for by employer-provided amounts or incurred from maintaining a qualified second foreign household.  Secondly, if housing amounts are to be excluded, this must be calculated first before the foreign earned income exclusion can be determined.  In other words, the housing amount must be deducted from the total foreign earned income to arrive at the excludable amount for foreign earned income exclusion purposes. Lastly, to choose the housing exclusion, Form 2555 is the only form allowed and must be completely filled out.  Form 2555-EZ cannot be used to claim the foreign housing exclusion.

'''Home in Toa Payoh''' is a [[Singapore]] Chinese drama which had its original run telecast in December 2003. The drama is produced by Singapore's [[Mediacorp TV Channel 8]]. It was re-aired in 2007 on every weekday, 5.30pm on Channel 8.

==Synopsis==
The first four minutes of the first episode introduces [[Toa Payoh]], one of Singapore's oldest estates, and chronicles its development from a small "[[kampung]]" along swampy marshland to a modernised thriving neighbourhood. The series depicts life in a typical [[HDB]] estate.

Baomei, Pengkun and Guocheng are childhood friends who grew up together in Toa Payoh. Baomei is an overly thrifty bachelor who is a foreman at a factory. Pengkun is a top technician at Baomei's factory but is always skiving to return home early to be with his wife and children. Guocheng is a highly successful insurance salesman with a loving but constantly nagging wife Huiming. The three of them and their families have to put up with the gossipy and quarrelsome Auntie Fen who often argues with Guocheng's father-in-law.

The '''Independent Senate Group''' ({{lang-nl|Onafhankelijke Senaatsfractie}}, OSF) is a [[parliamentary party]] in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Senate with one senator, representing several provincial parties.

In 1995, several provincial parties and [[The Greens (Netherlands)|The Greens]] proposed their own list. [[Marten Bierman]] nominated by The Greens and second on the list was elected senator by a preference vote. In 1999, Bierman was re-elected. In 2003, [[Henk ten Hoeve]] became senator for the OSF. He had been member of the [[Fryslan|Friesland]] provincial legislature for the [[Frisian National Party]]. He remained senator and leader of the party until 2011, when his role was taken over by [[Kees de Lange]].

In 2015, Henk ten Hoeve became senator of the party for a second time.

The main parties involved are the Frisian National Party, the [[Party for the North]], the [[Party New Limburg]] and the [[Brabant Party]]. The Greens lost their provincial seats in 2003.

The '''Kele''' or '''Sheke''' languages are a clade of [[Bantu language]]s coded Zone B.20 in Guthrie's classification. According to Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), apart possibly from [[Seki language|Seki (Sheke)]] (B.21) itself, the languages form a valid node. They are:
:[[Lengue language|Lengue]], [[Ndasa language|Ndasa]], [[Sigu language|Sigu]] (Sighu), [[Kele language (Gabon)|Kele]] (Dikele), [[Ngom language|Ngom]], [[Mbangwe language|Mbangwe]], [[Wumbvu language|Wumbvu]], [[IKota|Kota]], [[Shake language|Shake]] (Sake), [[Mahongwe language|Mahongwe]], ?[[Seki language|Seki]] (Sheke)

Maho (2009) adds B203 [[Sama language (Gabon)|Sama]], B204 [[Ndambomo language|Ndambomo]], B205 [[Metombola language|Metombola]].

After centuries of [[Swedish Livonia|Swedish]], [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian rule]], a rule mainly executed by the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] [[aristocracy]], the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 when it broke away and declared independence in the aftermath of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Germanis&gt;{{cite book |last=Ģērmanis |first=Uldis |authorlink=Uldis Ģērmanis |editor=Ojārs Kalniņš |title=The Latvian Saga |edition=11th |page=268 |language=English |publisher=Atēna |location=Riga |year=2007 |isbn=9789984342917 |oclc=213385330}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1930s the country became increasingly autocratic after the [[1934 Latvian coup d'état|coup in 1934]] establishing an authoritarian regime under [[Kārlis Ulmanis]]. The country's ''de facto'' independence was interrupted at the outset of [[World War II]], beginning with Latvia's [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|forcible incorporation]] into the [[Soviet Union]], followed by the [[German occupation of Latvia during World War II|invasion and occupation]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1941, and the [[Soviet re-occupation of Latvia in 1944|re-occupation by the Soviets]] in 1944 ([[Courland Pocket]] in 1945) to form the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] for the next 45 years.

The peaceful [[Singing Revolution]], starting in 1987, called for Baltic emancipation from Soviet rule and condemning the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regime's illegal takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/25/world/upheaval-east-soviet-congress-condemns-39-pact-that-led-annexation-baltics.html|title=UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST; Soviet Congress Condemns '39 Pact That Led to Annexation of Baltics|first=Esther B.

==Etymology==
The name ''Latvija'' is derived from the name of the ancient [[Latgalians]], one of four [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Balts|Baltic tribes]] (along with [[Couronians]], [[Selonians]] and [[Semigallians]]), which formed the ethnic core of modern [[Latvian people|Latvians]] together with the [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] [[Livonian people|Livonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latinst.lv/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Latvia_in_brief.pdf |title=Latvia in Brief |year=2012 |publisher=Latvian Institute |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108155832/http://latinst.lv/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Latvia_in_brief.pdf |archivedate=8 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry of Latvia]] coined the [[latinisation of names|latinisations]] of the country's name, "Lettigallia" and "Lethia", both derived from the Latgalians. The terms inspired the variations on the country's name in [[Romance languages]] from "Letonia" and in several [[Germanic languages]] from "Lettland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/litol-0-X.html|title=Baltic Online|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Latvia}}
Around 3000 BC, the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/msr/Ethno/dategen1.html |title=Data: 3000 BC to 1500 BC |work=The European Ethnohistory Database |publisher=The Ethnohistory Project |accessdate=6 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622113922/http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/msr/Ethno/dategen1.html |archivedate=22 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Balts]] established trade routes to Rome and [[Byzantium]], trading local [[amber]] for precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Rome, M Cary and HH Scullard, p455-457, Macmillan Press, {{ISBN|0-333-27830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: [[Curonians]], [[Latgalians]], [[Selonians]], [[Semigallians]] (in Latvian: ''kurši'', ''latgaļi'', ''sēļi'' and ''zemgaļi''), as well as the Finnic tribe of [[Livonian people|Livonians]] (''lībieši'') speaking a Finnic language.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the 12th century in the territory of Latvia, there were 14 lands with their rulers: [[Vanema]], [[Ventava]], [[Bandava]], [[Piemare]], [[Duvzare]], [[Ceklis]], [[Megava]], [[Pilsāts]], [[Upmale]], [[Sēlija]], [[Principality of Koknese|Koknese]], [[Jersika]], [[Tālava]] and [[Adzele]].&lt;ref&gt;Latvijas vēstures atlants, Jānis Turlajs, page 12, Karšu izdevniecība Jāņa sēta, {{ISBN|978-9984-07-614-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/EasternLatvia.htm|title= Data: Latvia|work= Kingdoms of Northern Europe&amp;nbsp;– Latvia|publisher= The History Files}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first missionaries, sent by the Pope, sailed up the [[Daugava River]] in the late 12th century, seeking converts.&lt;ref name="Lonely"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/history |title= Latvian History, Lonely Planet |publisher= Lonelyplanet.com |accessdate= 16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the Church had hoped.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; [[Teutonic Knights|German crusaders]] were sent, or more likely decided to go on their own accord as they were known to do. [[Saint Meinhard|Saint Meinhard of Segeberg]] arrived in Ikšķile, in 1184, traveling with merchants to Livonia, on a Catholic mission to convert the population from their original [[pagan]] beliefs. Pope Celestine III had called for [[Livonian Crusade#Wars against Estonians (1208–27)|a crusade against pagans in Northern Europe]] in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, Meinhard plotted to convert Livonians by force of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.balticsworldwide.com/the-crusaders/|title= The Crusaders|publisher= City Paper|accessdate =28 July 2007|date= 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 13th century, Germans ruled large parts of today's Latvia.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the [[crusader state]] that became known as [[Terra Mariana]] or Livonia. In 1282, Riga, and later the cities of [[Cēsis]], [[Limbaži]], [[Koknese]] and [[Valmiera]], became part of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; Riga became an important point of east-west trading&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; and formed close cultural links with [[Western Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] struggled for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611)|Polish–Swedish War]], northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule.

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted [[Lutheranism]] as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the [[Latvian people]], speaking one [[Latvian language]]. Throughout all the centuries, however, an actual Latvian state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Latvia, southern Latgallians adopted [[Catholicism]] under Polish/[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= V.

=== Latvia in the Russian Empire (1795–1917) ===
The [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710 and the [[Treaty of Nystad]], ending the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the [[Governorate of Livonia|Riga Governorate]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Latgale region remained part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] became an [[autonomous area|autonomous]] Russian province (the [[Courland Governorate]]) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the [[Russian Empire]]. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local [[official language]] and their own parliament, the [[Landtag]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin O'Connor|title=The History of the Baltic States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&amp;pg=PA29|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32355-3|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half the residents of Riga were killed by [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague in 1710–1711]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |title=Collector Coin Dedicated to 18th Century Riga |accessdate=19 July 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719083420/http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |archivedate=19 July 2010 |df=dmy }}. Bank of Latvia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} There also developed a growing urban [[proletariat]] and an increasingly influential Latvian [[bourgeoisie]]. The [[Young Latvians|Young Latvian]] ({{lang-lv|Jaunlatvieši}}) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the [[Slavophile]]s for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the [[Latvian National Awakening|First National Awakening]]. [[Russification]] began in Latgale after the Polish led the [[January Uprising]] in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the [[New Current]], a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. Popular discontent exploded in the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom – ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire), railways built; new factories, banks, and a University were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums), and school buildings were erected; new parks formed; and so on. Riga's boulevards and some streets outside the Old Town date from this period.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Worth mentioning is the fact that [[numeracy]] was also higher in the Estonian and Latvian parts of the Russian Empire, which may have been influenced by the Protestant religion of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

===Declaration of independence===
[[File:Karlis Ulmanis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kārlis Ulmanis]]]]
[[World War I]] devastated the territory of what became the state of Latvia, and other western parts of the Russian Empire. Demands for [[self-determination]] were initially confined to [[autonomy]], until a power vacuum was created by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, followed by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between Russia and Germany in March 1918, then the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. On 18 November 1918, in Riga, the [[Tautas padome|People's Council of Latvia]] proclaimed the independence of the new country, with [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] becoming the head of the [[Latvian Provisional Government|provisional government]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
The General representative of Germany [[August Winnig]] formally handed over political power to the Latvian Provisional Government on 26 November.

The [[Latvian War of Independence|war of independence]] that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments: the Provisional government headed by [[Kārlis Ulmanis]], supported by [[Tautas padome]] and the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]]; the [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvian Soviet government]] led by [[Pēteris Stučka]], supported by the [[Red Army]]; and the Provisional government headed by [[Andrievs Niedra]] and supported by the [[Baltische Landeswehr]] and the German [[Freikorps]] unit ''[[Freikorps in the Baltic|Iron Division]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Estonian and Latvian forces defeated the Germans at the [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|Battle of Wenden]] in June 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/cesis_battle_of|title=Cēsis, Battle of {{!}} International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a massive attack by a predominantly German force—the [[West Russian Volunteer Army]]—under [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]] was repelled in November. Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the [[Battle of Daugavpils]] was a part of the [[Polish–Soviet War]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

A freely elected [[Constituent assembly]] convened on 1 May 1920, and adopted a liberal constitution, the ''[[Constitution of Latvia|Satversme]]'', in February 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiere, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was partly suspended by Kārlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical [[land reform]] was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiere, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level. Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Latvia showed signs of economic recovery, and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} On 15 May 1934, Ulmanis staged a bloodless [[1934 Latvian coup d'état|coup]], establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940.&lt;ref name="Country profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1108059.stm|title=Timeline: Latvia|publisher=BBC News|date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1934, Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of "Latvianising" the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|jstor=2119564|author1=Nicholas Balabkins|author2=Arnolds P.

[[File:Riga 1940 Soviet Army.jpg|thumb|[[Red Army]] troops enter [[Riga]] (1940).]]
Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "[[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]".&lt;ref name="mrtext"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed 23 August 1939&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, Latvia, [[Finland]] and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; A week later, on 1 September 1939, Germany and on 17 September, the Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]].&lt;ref name="PBBG"&gt;{{cite book |first=Prit |last=Buttar |title=Between Giants |ISBN=9781780961637}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, most of the [[Baltic Germans]] left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis' government and Nazi Germany under the [[Heim ins Reich]] programme.&lt;ref name="Latvia in WWII"&gt;Lumans, pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt; In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939, with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Latvia in WWII"/&gt; Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940, when a second resettlement scheme was agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; The racially approved being resettled mainly in Poland, being given land and businesses in exchange for the money they had received from the sale of their previous assets.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|46}}

On 5 October 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres.&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;Wettig, Gerhard, ''Stalin and the Cold War in Europe'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Landham, Md, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7425-5542-9}}, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted.&lt;ref name="wettig20"/&gt; Latvia, then a puppet government, was headed by [[Augusts Kirhenšteins]].&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as The ''[[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]].''

The Soviets dealt harshly with their [[Enemy of the people|opponents]]&amp;nbsp;– prior to [[Operation Barbarossa]], in less than a year, at least 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Sebag Montefiore|authorlink=Simon Sebag Montefiore|title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were deported to Siberia where deaths were estimated at 40 percent, officers of the Latvian army being shot on the spot.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|48}}

On 22 June 1941 German troops attacked Soviet forces in Operation Barbarossa. There were some spontaneous uprisings by Latvians against the Red Army which helped the Germans. By 29 June [[Riga]] was reached and with Soviet troops killed, captured or retreating, Latvia was left under the control of German forces by early July.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|78–96}} The occupation was followed immediately by SS [[Einsatzgruppen]] troops who were to act in accordance with the Nazi [[Generalplan Ost]] which required the population of Latvia to be cut by 50 percent.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|64}}&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Under German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]''. Latvian paramilitary and [[Arajs Kommando|Auxiliary Police]] units established by the occupation authority participated in [[the Holocaust]] and other atrocities.&lt;ref name="Country profile"/&gt; 30,000 Jews were shot in Latvia in the autumn of 1941.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|127}} Another 30,000 Jews from the Riga ghetto were killed in the Rumbula Forest in November and December 1941, to reduce overpopulation in the ghetto and make room for more Jews being brought in from Germany and the West.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|128}} There was a pause in fighting, apart from partisan activity, until after the [[Battle of Leningrad|siege of Leningrad]] ended in January 1944 and the Soviet troops advanced, entering Latvia in July and eventually capturing Riga on 13 October 1944.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|271}}

More than 200,000 Latvian citizens died during World War II, including approximately 75,000 Latvian [[Jews]] murdered during the Nazi occupation.&lt;ref name="Country profile"/&gt; Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict, mainly on the German side, with 140,000 men in the [[Latvian Legion]] of the [[Waffen-SS]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/16/latvians-march-commemorate-ss-veterans Patriots or Nazi collaborators?

In 1944, when Soviet military advances reached Latvia, heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops, which ended in another German defeat. In the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's "live resources". In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control. The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and [[Latvian national partisans]], soon joined by some who had collaborated with the Germans, began to fight against the new occupier.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, pp. 395–396&lt;/ref&gt;

Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lumans, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving Latvia, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war,&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, pp. 384–385&lt;/ref&gt; returned by the West.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;
The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944–1945, and further deportations followed as the country was [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivised]]
and [[Sovietisation|Sovieticised]].&lt;ref name="Country profile"/&gt; &lt;!-- The first post-war years were marked by particularly dismal and sombre events in the fate of the Latvian nation{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} I'll take this out; let the readers evaluate the events&amp;nbsp;– they are quite self explanatory --&gt;

On 25 March 1949, 43,000 rural residents ("[[kulak]]s") and Latvian patriots ("nationalists") were deported to Siberia in a sweeping [[Operation Priboi]] in all three [[Baltic states]], which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Strods, Heinrihs |author2=Kott, Matthew |year=2002|title=The File on Operation 'Priboi': A Re-Assessment of the Mass Deportations of 1949|journal=Journal of Baltic Studies |volume=33|issue=1|pages= 1–36|doi= 10.1080/01629770100000191}}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation had the desired effect of reducing the anti Soviet partisan activity.&lt;ref name=PBBG/&gt;{{rp|326}} Between 136,000 and 190,000 Latvians, depending on the sources, were imprisoned or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the [[Gulag]]) in the post war years, from 1945 to 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, pp. 398–399&lt;/ref&gt; Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[Gulag]] shack in the [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]], Riga]]
In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into [[collectivisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Bleiere, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive programme to impose [[bilingualism]] was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belarusian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiere, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; An influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiere, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major [[Riga Autobus Factory|machinery factory RAF]] in [[Jelgava]], electrotechnical factories in [[Riga]], chemical factories in [[Daugavpils]], [[Valmiera]] and [[Olaine]]—and some food and oil processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiere, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.

===Restoration of Independence in 1991===
{{Further|Singing Revolution|Baltic Way|On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia}}
In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the [[Freedom Monument]]—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the [[Popular Front of Latvia]], was opposed by the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia|Interfront]]. The Latvian SSR, along with the other [[Baltic states|Baltic Republics]] was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war [[Flag of Latvia]] flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1989, the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] adopted a resolution on the ''[[Occupation of the Baltic states]]'', in which it declared the occupation "not in accordance with law", and not the "will of the Soviet people". Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Council]] in the [[Latvian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|March 1990 democratic elections]]. On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Council adopted the [[Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia]], and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia.&lt;ref name="Imagining"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36JG1JBlNroC&amp;dq=latvia+political+history&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Imagining the Nation: History, Modernity, and Revolution in Latvia|last=Eglitis|first=Daina Stukuls|date=2010-11-01|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271045620|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Imagining" /&gt;

In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship, and that helped sway a large number of ethnic Russians to vote for independence. However, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of Latvia at the day of loss of independence at 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of Latvia, becoming [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship. Still, today there are 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represent 14.1% of population. They have [[Statelessness|no citizenship of any country]], and cannot vote in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/stories-of-statelessness-latvia-and-estonia/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151127055909/http%3A//www.unhcr.org/ibelong/stories%2Dof%2Dstatelessness%2Dlatvia%2Dand%2Destonia/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 November 2015|title=Stories of Statelessness: Latvia and Estonia – IBELONG|date=12 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Soviet coup attempt]].&lt;ref name="FINemb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finland.lv/public/default.aspx?nodeid=38439&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=History |publisher=Embassy of Finland, Riga |quote=Latvia declared independence on 21 August 1991...The decision to restore diplomatic relations took effect on 29 August 1991 |date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saeima]], Latvia's parliament, was again elected in 1993. Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the [[Skrunda-1]] radar station in 1998. The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], were achieved in 2004.

Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many [[Russophone]]s. [[Citizenship]] was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation, or to their offspring.

Coastal regions, especially the western coast of [[Courland Peninsula]], possess a more maritime climate with cooler summers and milder winters, while eastern parts exhibit a more continental climate with warmer summers and harsher winters.&lt;ref name="liepu"/&gt;

Latvia has four pronounced seasons of near-equal length. Winter starts in mid-December and lasts until mid-March. Winters have average temperatures of {{convert|-6|°C|0|abbr=on}} and are characterized by stable snow cover, bright sunshine, and short days. Severe spells of winter weather with cold winds, extreme temperatures of around {{convert|-30|°C|0|abbr=on}} and heavy snowfalls are common. Summer starts in June and lasts until August.

===Environment===
[[File:Turaidas skats uz Gauju 2okt04.JPG|thumb|Latvia has the fifth highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union.]]
Most of the country is composed of fertile lowland plains and moderate hills. In a typical Latvian landscape, a mosaic of vast forests alternates with fields, farmsteads, and pastures. Arable land is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals. Latvia has hundreds of kilometres of undeveloped seashore—lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches.&lt;ref name="Latvia in brief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature and Environment in Latvia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latvia.lv/library/nature-and-environment |title=Nature and Environment |publisher=Latvian Institute |year=2002 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927055604/http://www.latvia.lv/library/nature-and-environment |archivedate=27 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latvia has the 5th highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union, after Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-13-154_en.htm |title=Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey 2012 Buildings, roads and other artificial areas cover 5% of the EU …and forests 40% |publisher=Eurostat Commission |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forests account for {{convert|3497000|ha|abbr=on}} or 56% of the total land area.&lt;ref name="Forestry - Key Indicators"/&gt;

Latvia has over 12,500 rivers, which stretch for {{convert|38000|km|abbr=on}}. Major rivers include the [[Daugava River]], [[Lielupe]], [[Gauja]], [[Venta]], and [[Salaca]], the largest spawning ground for [[salmon]] in the eastern Baltics. There are 2,256 lakes that are bigger than {{convert|1|ha|abbr=on}}, with a collective area of {{convert|1000|km2|abbr=on}}. [[Mire]]s occupy 9.9% of Latvia's territory. Of these, 42% are raised bogs; 49% are fens; and 9% are transitional mires. 70% percent of the mires are untouched by civilisation, and they are a refuge for many rare species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Nature and Environment in Latvia"/&gt;

Agricultural areas account for {{convert|1815900|ha|abbr=on}} or 29% of the total land area.&lt;ref name="Agriculture - Key Indicators"/&gt; With the dismantling of collective farms, the area devoted to farming decreased dramatically – now farms are predominantly small. Approximately 200 farms, occupying {{convert|2750|ha|abbr=on}}, are engaged in ecologically pure farming (using no artificial fertilisers or pesticides).&lt;ref name="Nature and Environment in Latvia"/&gt;

Latvia's [[national park]]s are [[Gauja National Park]] in [[Vidzeme]] (since 1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/eastern-latvia/gauja-national-park|title=Gauja National Park travel - Lonely Planet|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=Lonely Planet|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ķemeri National Park]] in [[Zemgale]] (1997), [[Slītere National Park]] in [[Courland|Kurzeme]] (1999), and [[Rāzna National Park]] in [[Latgale]] (2007).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Latvia has a long tradition of conservation. The first laws and regulations were promulgated in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Nature and Environment in Latvia"/&gt; There are 706 specially state-level protected natural areas in Latvia: four national parks, one biosphere reserve, 42 nature parks, nine areas of protected landscapes, 260 nature reserves, four strict nature reserves, 355 nature monuments, seven protected marine areas and 24 microreserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/protected_areas/|title=Protected areas|publisher=Nature Conservation Agency Republic of Latvia|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally protected areas account for {{convert|12790|km2|abbr=on}} or around 20% of Latvia's total land area.&lt;ref name="Geographical Data - Key Indicators"/&gt; Latvia's Red Book (Endangered Species List of Latvia), which was established in 1977, contains 112 plant species and 119 animal species. Latvia has ratified the international Washington, Bern, and Ramsare conventions.&lt;ref name="Nature and Environment in Latvia"/&gt;

The 2012 [[Environmental Performance Index]] ranks Latvia second, after [[Switzerland]], based on the environmental performance of the country's policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605011220/http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 June 2012 |title=2012 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) |publisher=Yale University and Columbia University in collaboration with The World Economic Forum and European Commission |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Latvia is shared between the Central European and Northern European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Latvia belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of [[Sarmatic mixed forests]]. 56 percent&lt;ref name="Forestry - Key Indicators"/&gt; of Latvia's territory is covered by forests, mostly [[Scots pine]], [[birch]], and [[Norway spruce]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Several species of flora and fauna are considered national symbols. [[Oak]] (''[[Quercus robur]]'', {{lang-lv|ozols}}), and [[Tilia|linden]] (''[[Tilia cordata]]'', {{lang-lv|liepa}}) are Latvia's national trees and the [[Leucanthemum vulgare|daisy]] (''[[Leucanthemum vulgare]]'', {{lang-lv|pīpene}}) its national flower. The white wagtail (''[[White wagtail|Motacilla alba]]'', {{lang-lv|baltā cielava}}) is Latvia's national bird. Its national insect is the [[Adalia bipunctata|two-spot ladybird]] (''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'', {{lang-lv|divpunktu mārīte}}). [[Amber]], fossilized tree resin, is one of Latvia's most important cultural symbols. In ancient times, amber found along the Baltic Sea coast was sought by Vikings as well as traders from Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire. This led to the development of the [[Amber Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latvia.lv/library/national-symbols-latvia |title=National Symbols of Latvia |publisher=Latvian Institute |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926092241/http://www.latvia.lv/library/national-symbols-latvia |archivedate=26 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several nature reserves protect unspoiled landscapes with a variety of large animals.

{{Main|Administrative divisions of Latvia}}
{{See also|List of cities in Latvia|Planning regions of Latvia|Statistical regions of Latvia|Historical regions of Latvia}}
Latvia is a [[unitary state]], currently divided into 110 one-level municipalities ({{lang-lv|novadi}}) and 9 republican cities ({{lang-lv|republikas pilsētas}}) with their own city council and administration: [[Daugavpils]], [[Jēkabpils]], [[Jelgava]], [[Jūrmala]], [[Liepāja]], [[Rēzekne]], [[Riga]], [[Valmiera]], and [[Ventspils]]. There are four [[Cultural regions of Latvia|historical and cultural regions in Latvia]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Courland]], [[Latgale]], [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]], which are recognised in [[Constitution of Latvia]]. [[Selonia]], a part of Zemgale, is sometimes considered culturally distinct region, but it is not part of any formal division. The borders of historical and cultural regions usually are not explicitly defined and in several sources may vary. In formal divisions, Riga region, which includes the capital and parts of other regions that have a strong relationship with the capital, is also often included in regional divisions; e.g., there are five [[planning regions of Latvia]] ({{lang-lv|plānošanas reģioni}}), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions. Under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland, and Zemgale. [[Statistical regions of Latvia]], established in accordance with the EU [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]], duplicate this division, but divides Riga region into two parts with the capital alone being a separate region.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
The largest city in Latvia is Riga, the second largest city is Daugavpils and the third largest city is Liepaja.

According to statistics in late 2013, 45% of the population supported the introduction of the euro, while 52% opposed it.&lt;ref name="apollo.lv"&gt;{{cite web|author=Apollo, redakcija@apollo.lv |url=http://www.apollo.lv/zinas/turpina-pieaugt-iedzivotaju-atbalsts-eiro-ieviesanai/625128 |title=Turpina pieaugt iedzīvotāju atbalsts eiro ieviešanai |publisher=Apollo.lv |accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction of the Euro, Eurobarometer surveys in January 2014 showed support for the Euro to be around 53%, close to the European average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21593502-latvias-president-nominates-laimdota-straujuma-prime-minister-new-currency-new-leader |title=New currency, new leader |work=The Economist |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the year 2000, Latvia has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,39140985&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;screen=detailref&amp;language=en&amp;product=sdi_ed&amp;root=sdi_ed/sdi_ed/sdi_ed1000 |title=Growth rate of real GDP per capita |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |accessdate=28 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012010738/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996%2C39140985&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;screen=detailref&amp;language=en&amp;product=sdi_ed&amp;root=sdi_ed%2Fsdi_ed%2Fsdi_ed1000 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009, exacerbated by the global economic crisis, shortage of credit and huge money resources used for the bailout of Parex bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/finances/?doc=22011|title=Rimsevics: Failing to bail out Parex banka would result in closing down of four banks in Latvia|publisher=The Baltic Course|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009, the biggest fall in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aaron Eglitis |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ao7qqF0UESqc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202141324/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ao7qqF0UESqc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 December 2010 |title=Latvian GDP Shrank 18% in First Quarter, EU's Biggest Fall&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=11 May 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8043972.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Latvian economy in rapid decline | date=11 May 2009 | accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lv real gdp growth.svg|thumb|Real GDP growth in Latvia 1996–2006]]
The economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast-growing economy was heading for implosion of the [[economic bubble]], because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], financed by a serious increase of private [[debt]], as well as a negative foreign [[balance of trade|trade balance]]. The prices of real estate, which were at some points growing by approximately 5% a month, were long perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low-value goods and [[raw material]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Privatisation]] in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been privatised, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. The private sector accounted for nearly 68% of the country's GDP in 2000.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Foreign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the same year, the United States of America exported $58.2 million of goods and services to Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and the [[European Union]], Latvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995—with a 4-year transition period. Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/latvia.pdf|title=TAX CONVENTION WITH LATVIA|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/other_treaties/text.jsp?file_id=241419|title=Agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Latvia on Trade Relations and Intellectual Property Rights Protection|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AirBaltic Boeing 757-200 at RIX.jpg|thumb|An [[airBaltic]] Boeing 757−200WL takes off at [[Riga International Airport]] (RIX)]]
The Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values. The national account deficit for 2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10%.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lg.html|title=Latvia |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|accessdate=15 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]], the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his [[The New York Times|New York Times]] Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most acute problems are on Europe's periphery, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia: Latvia is the new Argentina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/opinion/15krugman.html |title=European Crass Warfare |work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 December 2008 | author=Paul Krugman | date=15 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reuters, 15 March 2010. Retrieved 31 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy. Rating agency [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] raised its outlook on Latvia's debt from negative to stable.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; Latvia's current account, which had been in deficit by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; Kenneth Orchard, senior analyst at [[Moody's Investors Service]] argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The strengthening regional economy is supporting Latvian production and exports, while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the country's 'internal devaluation' is working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toomas Hõbemägi |url=http://www.bbn.ee/article/2010/02/08/Moody_s_Latvian_economy_is_stabilizing |title=Baltic Business News, 8 February 2010 |publisher=Bbn.ee |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[IMF]] concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvia's economy has been recovering strongly since 2010, following the deep downturn in 2008–09. Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand. The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions, and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014. The unemployment rate has receded from its peak of more than 20 percent in 2010 to around 9.3 percent in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/76 by IMF|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2012/pn1276.htm |title=IMF Executive Board Concludes First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia, July 16, 2012 |publisher=imf.org |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan as well as other Asian countries and the West is large.&lt;ref name="wpt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/EXTECAREGTOPTRANSPORT/0,,contentMDK:20647605~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:571121,00.html |title=Latvia |accessdate=8 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908042001/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/EXTECAREGTOPTRANSPORT/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20647605~pagePK%3A34004173~piPK%3A34003707~theSitePK%3A571121%2C00.html |archivedate= 8 September 2008 |df=dmy }}, World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The three biggest ports of Latvia are located in [[Riga]], [[Ventspils]], and [[Liepāja]]. Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products.&lt;ref name="wpt"/&gt; [[Free port of Ventspils]] is one of the busiest ports in the [[Baltic states]]. Apart from road and railway connections, Ventspils is also linked to oil extraction fields and transportation routes of Russian Federation via system of two pipelines from [[Polotsk]], Belarus.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Riga International Airport]] is the busiest airport in the [[Baltic states]] with 6.1 million passengers in 2017. It has direct flight to over 80 destinations in 30 countries. The only other airport handling regular commercial flights is [[Liepāja International Airport]]. 
[[airBaltic]] is the Latvian flag carrier airline and a low-cost carrier with hubs in all three [[Baltic States]], but main base in [[Riga]], Latvia.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Latvian Railways|Latvian Railway]]'s main network consists of 1,860&amp;nbsp;km of which 1,826&amp;nbsp;km is 1,520&amp;nbsp;mm [[Russian gauge]] railway of which 251&amp;nbsp;km are electrified, making it the longest railway network in the [[Baltic States]].

Latvia has three big hydroelectric power stations in [[Pļaviņu HES]] (825MW), [[Rīgas HES]] (402 MW) and [[Ķeguma HES-2]] (192 MW). In the recent years a couple of dozen of wind farms as well as biogas or biomass power stations of different scale have been built in Latvia.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Latvia operates [[Inčukalns underground gas storage facility]], one of the largest [[natural gas storage|underground gas storage facilities]] in Europe and the only one in the Baltic states.

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Latvian people|Russians in Latvia{{!}}Latvian Russians|Latvian Germans|Latvian Jews|Latgalians (modern)|Livonians|Gauja Estonians}}
Latvia's population has been [[multiethnic society|multiethnic]] for centuries, though the demographics shifted dramatically in the 20th century due to the World Wars, the emigration and removal of [[Baltic Germans]], [[the Holocaust]], and occupation by the [[Soviet Union]]. According to the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897, Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, Germans for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/latvia/9.htm Latvia&amp;nbsp;– Population]. Source: ''U.S. Library of Congress.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2011, [[Latvian people|Latvians]] form about 62.1% of the population, while 26.9% are [[Russians in the Baltic states|Russians]], [[Belarusians]] 3.3%, [[Ukrainians]] 2.2%, [[Poles]] 2.2%, [[Lithuanians]] 1.2%, [[Jews]] 0.3%, [[Romani people]] 0.3%, [[Germans]] 0.1%, [[Estonians]] 0.1% and others 1.3%. 250 people identify as [[Livonians]] ([[Baltic Finns|Baltic Finnic]] people native to Latvia). There were 290,660 [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] living in Latvia or 14.1% of Latvian residents, mainly ethnic Russians who arrived after the occupation of 1940 and their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistikas-temas/population-census-2011-key-indicators-33613.html Population Census 2011&amp;nbsp;– Key Indicators]. Csb.gov.lv. Retrieved 19 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, e.g., [[Daugavpils]] and [[Rēzekne]], ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population. Despite the fact that the proportion of ethnic Latvians has been steadily increasing for more than a decade, ethnic Latvians also make up slightly less than a half of the population of the capital city of Latvia – [[Rīga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/lv-people.htm|title=Latvia - Population|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lka.edu.lv/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index&amp;topic=68 |title=About Latvia |publisher=Latvian Academy of Culture |accessdate=28 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629231221/http://www.lka.edu.lv/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index&amp;topic=68 |archivedate=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989, though their share of the population was larger&amp;nbsp;– 1,285,136 (62.1% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TSG11-06.

===Language===
{{further|Language policy in Latvia}}
The sole official language of Latvia is [[Latvian language|Latvian]], which belongs to the [[Baltic languages|Baltic language sub-group]] of the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct [[Livonian language]] of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], which enjoys protection by law; [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]&amp;nbsp;– referred to as either a dialect or a distinct separate language of Latvian&amp;nbsp;– is also formally protected by Latvian law but only as a historical variation of the Latvian language. Russian, which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, is still the most widely used minority language by far (about 34% speak it at home, including people who are not ethnically Russian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.csb.gov.lv/Table.aspx?layout=tableViewLayout1&amp;px_tableid=tautassk_11%5c2011.gada+tautas+skait%c4%ab%c5%a1anas+gal%c4%abgie+rezult%c4%81ti%5cTSG11-071.px&amp;px_language=en&amp;px_type=PX&amp;px_db=tautassk_11&amp;rxid=c8c8a0dd-6a8e-4e89-add7-718c9998db99 |title=THNICITIES OF RESIDENT POPULATION IN STATISTICAL REGIONS, CITIES UNDER STATE JURISDICTION AND COUNTIES BY LANGUAGE MOSTLY SPOKEN AT HOME; ON 1 MARCH 2011 |publisher=Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517201119/http://data.csb.gov.lv/Table.aspx?layout=tableViewLayout1&amp;px_tableid=tautassk_11%5c2011.gada+tautas+skait%c4%ab%c5%a1anas+gal%c4%abgie+rezult%c4%81ti%5cTSG11-071.px&amp;px_language=en&amp;px_type=PX&amp;px_db=tautassk_11&amp;rxid=c8c8a0dd-6a8e-4e89-add7-718c9998db99 |archivedate= 17 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian, most schools also include English, Russian and German in their curricula. English and Russian are also widely accepted in Latvia, especially in business and tourism. {{As of|2014}} there were 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction for 40% of subjects (the remaining 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian).

On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a [[Latvian constitutional referendum, 2012|constitutional referendum]] on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html/|title=Referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/|title=Results of the referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|language=Latvian|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest religion in Latvia is [[Christianity]] (79%),&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt; The largest groups {{As of|2011|lc=y}} were:
* [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]]&amp;nbsp;– 708,773&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija" /&gt;
* [[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Roman Catholic]]&amp;nbsp;– 500,000&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx |title=Tieslietu ministrijā iesniegtie reliģisko organizāciju pārskati par darbību 2011. gadā |language=Latvian |accessdate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126013327/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx |archivedate=26 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]&amp;nbsp;– 370,000&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija" /&gt;

In the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2010, 38% of Latvian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", while 48% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 11% stated that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".

Lutheranism was more prominent before the Soviet occupation, when it was a majority religion of ~60% due to strong historical links with the [[Nordic countries]] and influence of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], and [[Germany]] in general. Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a slightly greater extent than Roman Catholicism in all three [[Baltic states]]. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of 18 March 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in Latvia, but the faith has since experienced a revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/latvia/SOCIETY.html |title=Latvia&amp;nbsp;– SOCIETY |publisher=Mongabay.com |date=18 March 1987 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's Orthodox Christians belong to the [[Latvian Orthodox Church]], a semi-autonomous body within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In 2011, there were 416 [[Jews]] and 319 [[Islam in Latvia|Muslims]] living in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt;

There are more than 600 Latvian [[neopaganism|neopagans]], ''[[Dievturība|Dievturi]]'' (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on [[Latvian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibelesbiedriba.lv/religiju-enciklopedija/statistika.html|title=Statistics of approved parishes in Latvia|date=1 January 2004|accessdate=7 March 2007|work=Reliģiju Enciklopēdija|publisher=The Latvian Bible Society|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.&lt;ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/&gt;

===Education and science===
{{Main|Education in Latvia}}
{{See also|List of universities in Latvia}}
[[File:Latvijas Universitāte - ogre11 - Panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[University of Latvia]]]]
[[University of Latvia]] and [[Riga Technical University]] are two major universities in the country, both established on the basis of Riga Polytechnical Institute and located in [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtu.lv |title=Riga Polytechnical Institute Home Page |publisher=Rtu.lv |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two important universities, which were established on the base of State University of Latvia, are [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]] (established in 1939 on the basis of the Faculty of Agriculture) and [[Riga Stradiņš University]] (established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine)&amp;nbsp;– both nowadays cover a variety of different fields. The [[University of Daugavpils]] is another significant centre of education. Latvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010, which is a 12.9% decline, and in the same period enrolment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people, a 10.3% decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/csp/content/?lng=lv&amp;cat=2300 |title=Latvijas Statistika |publisher=Csb.gov.lv |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latvian policy of science and technology set out the long term goal – transition from labor-consuming economy to knowledge-based economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izm.gov.lv/en/science |title=Ministry of Education and Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2020 the government aims at a 1.5% GDP funding for research and development, with half of the investments coming from the private sector. Latvia develop their scientific potential on the basis of the existing scientific traditions, particularly in organic chemistry, medical chemistry, genetic engineering, physics, materials science and information technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lza.lv |title=Latvian Academy of Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number of inventions, which are patented both nationwide and abroad, are made in the branch of medical chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventions.lza.lv/izgu_en.php |title=Inventions and Inventors of Latvia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latvian healthcare system is a [[universal health care|universal programme]], largely funded through government taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Nov_18/ai_n15860135/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711124324/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Nov_18/ai_n15860135/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 July 2012 |title=Latvia's Healthcare System is Funded by General Taxation and All Latvians and Foreign Residents Are Guaranteed Medical Care &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= 18 November 2005|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Baltic Course – Балтийский курс |url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/analytics/?doc=7137 |title=Latvia has worst health care system in Europe :: The Baltic Course &amp;#124; Baltic States news &amp; analytics |publisher=The Baltic Course |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009, down from 94 in 2007, and 121 in 2006.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/18/business/global/18lat.html?ref=business | work=The New York Times | title=Latvian Health Official Resigns Over Cuts | author=David Jolly | date=18 June 2009 | accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/csp/content/?cat=2310 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216125055/http://www.csb.gov.lv/csp/content/?cat=2310 |archivedate=16 December 2007 |title=The basic indicators of health care, at the end of the year |publisher=Csb.gov.lv |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.european-hospital.com/en/article/29-The_Baltic_States_and_their_health_systems-From_Soviet_to_EU.html |title=The Baltic States and their health systems&amp;nbsp;– From Soviet to EU |publisher=European-Hospital |accessdate=5 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091032/http://www.european-hospital.com/en/article/29-The_Baltic_States_and_their_health_systems-From_Soviet_to_EU.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latvian song festival by Dainis Matisons, 2008-2.jpg|right|thumb|Choirs performing during the 24th [[Latvian Song and Dance Festival]] in 2008]]
Traditional Latvian [[folklore]], especially the dance of the [[folk music|folk songs]], dates back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.li.lv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=124 |title=Welcome to Latvia&amp;nbsp;– Folk Songs |publisher=Li.lv |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 13th and 19th centuries, [[Baltic Germans]], many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into [[German language in Europe|German culture]], formed the upper class.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} They developed distinct cultural heritage, characterised by both Latvian and German influences. It has survived in German Baltic families to this day, in spite of their dispersal to Germany, the United States, Canada and other countries in the early 20th century. However, most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Thus, the mostly peasant local [[paganism|pagan]] heritage was preserved, partly merging with Christian traditions. For example, one of the most popular celebrations is [[Jāņi]], a pagan celebration of the [[summer solstice]]—which Latvians celebrate on the feast day of St. [[John the Baptist]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Historic Centre of Riga-112610.jpg|thumb|[[Historic Centre of Riga]] was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1997.]]
In the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements emerged. They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities. The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded by Latvians as a classical era of Latvian culture. Posters show the influence of other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist [[Bernhard Borchert]] and the French [[Raoul Dufy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} With the onset of World War II, many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely for a Latvian émigré audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latvianart.org/historical.html |title=Historical Background |work=Global Society for Latvian Art |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029113142/http://latvianart.org/historical.html |archivedate=29 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latvian Song and Dance Festival]] is an important event in [[Latvians|Latvian]] culture and social life. It has been held since 1873, normally every five years. Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dziesmusvetki2003.lv/?sadala=15 23rd All Latvian Song Festival]. Retrieved 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Folk songs and classical choir songs are sung, with emphasis on [[a cappella]] singing, though modern popular songs have recently been incorporated into the repertoire as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

After incorporation into the [[Soviet Union]], Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the [[socialist realism]] style of art. During the Soviet era, music became increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the 1980s. At this time, songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity. This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry. Since independence, theatre, [[scenography]], [[choir|choir music]], and classical music have become the most notable branches of Latvian culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

During July 2014, [[Riga]] hosted the 8th [[World Choir Games]] as it played host to over 27,000 choristers representing over 450 choirs and over 70 countries. The festival is the biggest of its kind in the world and is held every two years in a different host city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interkultur.com/competitions-festivals/world-choir-games/riga-2014/ |title=World Choir Games Riga 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205110141/http://www.interkultur.com/competitions-festivals/world-choir-games/riga-2014/ |archivedate=5 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Latvian cuisine}}
Latvian cuisine typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes. Fish is commonly consumed due to Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea. Latvian cuisine has been influenced by the neighbouring countries. Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as potatoes, wheat, barley, cabbage, onions, eggs, and pork. Latvian food is generally quite fatty, and uses few spices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/660594947|title=The cuisine of Latvia|last=Maija.|first=Auliciema, Marianna|last2=Raimonds.|first2=Cerūzis,|date=2004|publisher=Latvian Institute|isbn=998473627X|oclc=660594947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey peas and ham are generally considered as staple foods of Latvians. [[Sorrel soup]] is also consumed by Latvians.&lt;ref name="latvianfood"&gt;[http://www.li.lv/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=487 "Typical Latvian Food and Drink Recipes."] [http://www.li.lv/ Li.lv].

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Latvia}}
[[File:Arena Riga CAN-CZE-2006-05-14.JPG|thumb|[[Arena Riga]] during the [[2006 IIHF World Championship]]]]
Ice hockey is usually considered the most popular sport in Latvia. Latvia has had many famous hockey stars like [[Helmut Balderis]], [[Artūrs Irbe]], [[Kārlis Skrastiņš]] and [[Sandis Ozoliņš]] and more recently [[Zemgus Girgensons]], who the Latvian people have strongly supported in international and NHL play, expressed through the dedication of using the NHL's All Star Voting to bring Zemgus to number one in voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=743166|title=Sabres' Girgensons expands lead as top vote-getter in 2015 NHL All-Star Fan Vote presented by SiriusXM|author=|date=|work=nhl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dinamo Riga]] is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]]. The national tournament is the [[Latvian Hockey Higher League]], held since 1931. The [[2006 IIHF World Championship]] was held in Riga.
[[File:Kristaps Porzingis.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Kristaps Porziņģis]]]]
The second most popular sport is basketball. Latvia has a long basketball tradition, as the [[Latvian national basketball team]] won the first ever [[EuroBasket]] in [[EuroBasket 1935|1935]] and silver medals in [[EuroBasket 1939|1939]], after losing the final to [[Lithuania men's national basketball team|Lithuania]] by one point. Latvia has had many European basketball stars like [[Jānis Krūmiņš]], [[Maigonis Valdmanis]], [[Valdis Muižnieks]], [[Valdis Valters]], [[Igors Miglinieks]], as well as the first Latvian [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[Gundars Vētra]]. [[Andris Biedriņš]] is one of the most well-known Latvian basketball players, who played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] for the [[Golden State Warriors]] and the [[Utah Jazz]]. Current [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players include [[Kristaps Porziņģis]], who plays for the [[New York Knicks]], and [[Dāvis Bertāns]], who plays for the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Former Latvian basketball club [[ASK Riga]] won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] tournament three times in a row before becoming defunct. Currently, [[BK VEF Rīga|VEF Rīga]], which competes in [[Eurocup Basketball|EuroCup]], is the strongest professional basketball club in Latvia. [[BK Ventspils]], which participates in [[EuroChallenge]], is the second strongest basketball club in Latvia, previously winning [[Latvijas Basketbola līga|LBL]] eight times and [[Baltic Basketball League|BBL]] in 2013.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Latvia was one of the [[EuroBasket 2015]] hosts.

Other popular sports include [[association football|football]], [[floorball]], tennis, volleyball, cycling, [[bobsleigh]] and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]]. The [[Latvian national football team]]'s only major [[FIFA]] tournament participation has been the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 UEFA European Championship]].&lt;ref name="uefa.com_2015-11-03"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/teama/team=56558/profile/| title=Latvia team profile| publisher=[[UEFA|Uefa.com]]| date=6 January 2014| accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latvia at the Olympics|Latvia]] has participated successfully in both [[Winter Olympics|Winter]] and [[Summer Olympics]]. The most successful Olympic athlete in the history of independent Latvia has been [[Māris Štrombergs]], who became a two-time Olympic champion in 2008 and 2012 at Men's BMX.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/action/bmx/story/_/id/8255371/colombia-mariana-pajon-latvia-maris-strombergs-win-olympic-bmx-gold-london|title=Pajon, Strombergs win Olympic BMX Finals|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Latvian boxer [[Mairis Briedis]] became the undisputed [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] cruiserweight world champion, the first and only boxer from Latvia and the [[Baltic states]] to hold any one of the four major titles in boxing.

In 2017 Latvian tennis player [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] won the [[2017 French Open – Women's Singles|2017 French Open Women's singles title]] being the first unseeded player to do so in the open era.

The Principality of '''[[Liechtenstein]]''' is a producer of [[wine]]. The country has a climate ideally suited for the cultivation of wine with mountain slopes facing southwest, calcareous soils and an average of 1,500 hours of sunshine a year. The hot dry wind during the summer months, known as the [[foehn]] aids cultivators by having a sweetening effect.

There are over 100 winegrowers in Liechtenstein which produce red and white wines in which despite the small size of the country can produce a significant variety. Liechtenstein is part of the European wine quality system and the international [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|AOC]] classification.

==History==
Viniculture in Liechtenstein dates back to just over two thousand years. Growing began before Christ by a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe that had settled in the area, and during [[Roman Empire|Roman times]] production increased. After the Romans had been driven out of the area by the [[Alamanni]], production virtually ceased, until the growth of Christianity in the 4th century, when monks encouraged the establishment of new vineyards. During the rule of [[Charlemagne]] (742–814), many of the municipalities and  monasteries possessed their own vineyards. 
&lt;ref name="AOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/fl-portal-aktuell?newsid=13038 |title=AOC quality certification for top wines from Liechtenstein |date=26 September 2005 |publisher=Principality of Liechtenstein |accessdate=17 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527221038/http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/fl-portal-aktuell?newsid=13038 |archivedate=27 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time the vineyards surrounding [[Gutenberg Castle]] yielded some three thousand gallons of wine a year. Charlemagne did much to alter the method of production, strongly encouraging better hygiene and pressing of the grapes by making it practice for the wine pressers to wash their feet although he was met with considerable opposition.

The grape, [[Blauburgunder]] or [[Pinot noir]], was introduced by [[Henri, duc de Rohan]] (1579–1638) who strongly encouraged the farmers of the [[Bündner Herrschaft]] to cultivate it.&lt;ref name="AOC"/&gt;
[[Image:Schlossvaduzvineyards.jpg|thumb|left|Vineyards near [[Vaduz]]]]
During the latter half of the 19th century, wine was Liechtenstein's main export alongside cattle. The wine industry in Liechtenstein reached an all-time peak in 1871 when {{convert|790|acre|ha|order=flip}} were designated for wine production.&lt;ref name="AOC"/&gt; After this point however, the opening of the [[Arlberg railway]] saw an increase in foreign competition and in the first half of the 20th century bad harvests and [[parasite]]s caused the wine industry collapse. Attempts by the government to sustain the industry by introducing compulsory crop spraying after 1890 failed.&lt;ref name="AOC"/&gt; However, although the industry had declined significantly, viniculture was still important enough in [[Vaduz]] that its coat of arms, established on 31 July 1932, pictured bunches of grapes. Since the 1970s there has been a regrowth of viniculture, but as of 2008 only {{convert|64|acre|ha|order=flip}} is under cultivation.&lt;ref name="AOC"/&gt;

Today, the most popular white wines are [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling x Sylvaner]], and [[Gewürztraminer]], while red wines most produced are [[Blauburgunder]], [[Zweigelt]], and [[Blaufränkisch]].&lt;ref name="AOC"/&gt; The highest vineyard in the country is the [[Walser]] village of [[Triesenberg]] at 850 meters (2800&amp;nbsp;ft), which has seen some successful experimental growth of the French [[Léon Millot]] grape variety. Other notable brands are the Zweigelt Selektion Karlsberg Profundo and the FL Premier Brut 1996, a vintage sparkling wine, [[pressed (wine)|pressed]] from Rhine Riesling grapes.

Several places in the country have [[wine tasting]] venues. Most notable is the "Hofkellerei des regierenden Fürsten von Liechtenstein", the wine cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein.

'''M.A.D for Peace''' is a not-for-profit organisation based in [[London]], England, which has one main focus: communicating to the general public the importance of our individual responsibility in creating a world in which extreme conflict and its human consequences are ended.

==Background==
M.A.D (Making a Difference) for Peace was founded in 2007 by [[Dr Gill Hicks, MBE FRSA|Dr Gill Hicks MBE FRSA]], survivor of the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005 London bombings]], who lost both her legs that day.  She discovered a great inner strength to not only fight for her life but to learn to walk again using prosthetic legs. Truly grateful to be alive, Hicks now devotes her time to making her life count, to really making a difference.

At M.A.D, peace is a daily activity, a daily consciousness. Drawing on their background in the arts and creative industries, Hicks and her co-director Claire Sawford devise projects which are participatory, encourage people to interact and together to ensure that peace becomes as instinctive an action as recycling and caring about the environment have become.  Just one person’s positive actions within their own community, when multiplied, have a significant effect nationally and globally, and leave a ‘lasting footprint’.

M.A.D’s  work is focused in three key areas - Public Engagement, Education and Bridging Divides in Communities - at local, national and international level.

==Projects==
Each M.A.D project embeds one or more of the five key messages from Gill’s own story of survival: Identity, The Brilliance of Humanity, Determination, Optimism and Choice.
Specific objectives are incorporated to meet the needs of each particular community.

A simple and effective way that M.A.D get people involved is to ask people to see the ‘other’ point of view, encouraging greater understanding and the willingness to resolve conflict and division.

M.A.D’s first Public Engagement project, WALKTALK ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100220022030/http://walktalk.org.uk/ walktalk.org.uk]), was devised to encourage people of all ages and from all walks of life – who might otherwise never have the opportunity to meet - to come together and walk and, most importantly, talk about their beliefs and focus on everything we have in common. Hicks and a small core team including  two co-developer organisations from Yorkshire, and with the support of volunteers from the [[London Ambulance Service]], walked over 250 miles from [[Millennium Square, Leeds]], to [[Trafalgar square|Trafalgar Square, London]], in summer 2008. Their enthusiasm and determination was matched by local communities, creating a lasting footprint in each community through which they passed.

The message with M.A.D’s second major project, launched in Trafalgar Square on 8 May 2009, was equally strong and simple, asking people to literally DRAW A LINE - whether a human chain with friends and colleagues, an intricate piece of artwork or a simple scribble on a sticky note stuck onto the fridge – and use this as a daily reminder that change and real peace starts from within.  The project has been extended as part of M.A.D’s work with schools all over the world as Draw A Line: School to School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madforpeace.org/?cat=21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711051026/http://www.madforpeace.org/?cat=21|archivedate=2010-07-11 |title=M.A.D. Projects |publisher=Madforpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National final==
Each of the 20 participants sang a song of their own choice. After all of them had performed, the jury and televoting cast their votes - each juror had a 25% weighting in the final result (so 75% overall), with the televoting also having a 25% share. The contestants were ranked from 1-20, with 1 being the best. Destiny Chukunyere was announced as the winner of the national final.

'''Riva''' is a fictional kingdom in [[David Eddings]]' '''[[The Belgariad]]'''. It is located on the Isle of the Winds and is the customary meeting place of the Alorn Council.&lt;ref&gt;David Eddings. The Belgariad&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
The Isle of the Winds is a fairly rocky island, with pastures in the mountain valleys. There is only one city of any size, the capital of Riva, which is also the site of the only possible place to land a ship. There is a river coming from the mountains.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The kingdom  was founded in 2000 A.C. by [[Riva Iron-grip]] at the breakup of [[Aloria]]. He constructed a city at the only beach on the Isle and married Beldaran, the daughter of [[Belgarath|Belgarath the Sorcerer]]. In 2018, he had a son named Daran. However, in 2038, Beldaran died, plunging Polgara, Daran, and Belgarath into mourning, and nearly incapacitating Riva.

Daran became regent, and blamed the Rivan Deacon for his mother's death. The next year, he charged the deacon and the whole Bear-cult of witchcraft and exiled them to the remote northern isles. The Bear-cult would never return to the Isle. In 2040, Daran married a woman named Larana, and in 2045, had a son, whom he named Cherek. The celebration was marred, though, by the fact that Riva died the same day.&lt;ref&gt;David Eddings. Polgara the Sorceress&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Wardership ===
The events leading up to the assassination of Gorek the Wise began in 3097, with the signing of the Accords of Val Alorn, which gave merchants the ability to travel to Riva. In 4002, Salmissra sent assassins to the Isle to kill the king, and only the 6 year-old Prince Geran escaped alive. This began a war between the Alorns and the Nyissans, and it was discovered that Zedar was behind the assassination.

Prince Geran went into hiding with Polgara, and Brand, the Warder of Riva, was put in charge. The next few centuries are quite peaceful, until the year 4850, when a total eclipse of the sun announces that [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Torak|Torak]] had come out of seclusion in Ashaba and taken control of Mallorea. These events worried the Alorns, who began to mobilize their armies. In 4865, the Angaraks invaded [[Drasnia]], beginning the Angarak Invasion of the West.&lt;ref&gt;David Eddings. Belgarath the Sorcerer&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The War years ===
The Rivans played a minor role for most of the war, seeing action only in the Drasnian campaign and the [[Battle of Vo Mimbre]]. At the battle, though, it was the Rivan Warder that killed Torak.

After the war was over, the Rivans returned to the peace they had enjoyed for the last few centuries.

=== Restoration of the Monarchy ===
{{Main|The Belgariad}}
In 5369, the Orb of Aldur was stolen from Riva by Zedar. [[Belgarath]] immediately sets out to recover the Orb, bringing along his daughter Polgara and the heir to the throne of Riva, [[Garion]]. After the Orb was recovered in 5371, Garion assumed the throne and was renamed Belgarion. Shortly after his coronation, however, he disappeared to confront Torak, leaving his fiance, [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters|Ce'Nedra]] to lead the armies of the West against the Angaraks. After a battle at Thull Mardu and a duel with Torak, Garion returns home and rules Riva with Ce'Nedra.

However, after a few years, someone attempted to assassinate his pregnant queen. The attempt failed, and Prince Geran II was born in 5380. Not long after, Brand, Warder of Riva, was murdered by the Bear-cult. A force of Rivans and Chereks then attacked the cult fortress of Jarviksholm, beginning the 5th war the Rivans had taken part in. During the battle, someone kidnapped Geran. The Alorn kings blamed the cult and attacked the city of Rheon. After the attack, it was revealed that a woman named Zandramas had been behind the abduction. He immediately pursued her across the planet, eventually killing her and rescuing his son. After this, peace was restored and [[Belgarion]] continues to rule the Isle to this day.&lt;ref&gt;David Eddings. The Malloreon&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sahel]] has long experienced a series of historic droughts, dating back to at least the 17th century. The Sahel region is a climate zone sandwiched between the African Savannah grasslands to the south and the [[Sahara desert]] to the north, across [[West Africa|West]] and Central Africa. While the frequency of drought in the region is thought to have increased from the end of the 19th century, three long droughts have had dramatic environmental and societal effects upon the Sahel nations. Famine followed severe droughts in the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although a partial recovery occurred from 1975-80. The [[2012 Sahel drought|most recent drought]] occurred in 2012.

While at least one particularly severe drought has been confirmed each century since the 17th century, the frequency and severity of recent Sahelian droughts stands out. Famine and dislocation on a massive scale—from 1968 to 1974 and again in the early and mid-1980s—was blamed on two spikes in the severity of the 1960-1980s drought period.&lt;ref name=Batterbury2001&gt;[http://www.simonbatterbury.net/pubs/geogmag.html The Sahel region; assessing progress twenty-five years after the great drought].

As disruptive as the droughts of the late 20th century were, evidence of past droughts recorded in Ghanaian lake sediments suggest that multi-decadal [[megadrought]]s were common in West Africa over the past 3,000 years and that several droughts lasted far longer and were far more severe.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1166352 | last1 = Shanahan | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Overpeck | year = 2009 | first2 = JT | last3 = Anchukaitis | first3 = KJ | last4 = Beck | first4 = JW | last5 = Cole | first5 = JE | last6 = Dettman | first6 = DL | last7 = Peck | first7 = JA | last8 = Scholz | first8 = CA | last9 = King | first9 = JW | title = Atlantic Forcing of Persistent Drought in West Africa | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/324/5925/377 | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5925| pages = 377–380 | pmid = 19372429 |bibcode = 2009Sci...324..377S  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091107172707/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/041609.html Severity, Length of Past Megadroughts Dwarf Recent Drought in West Africa]. Jackson School of Geosciences Online, April 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, summer rainfall in the Sahel has been increasing; this has been associated with an increase in vegetation, forming what has been called a 'greening' of the Sahel. The observed increase in rainfall is accounted for by enhancements in the African easterly jet, which is known to induce wet anomalies. A 2011 study found that the positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband.&lt;ref name="hindawi.com"&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijge/2011/259529/abs/ Wang and Gillies (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Because the Sahel’s rainfall is heavily concentrated in a very small period of the year, the region has been prone to dislocation when droughts have occurred ever since agriculture developed around 5,000 years ago. The Sahel is marked by rainfalls of less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|-1|disp=or}} a year, almost all of which occurs in one continuous season, which can run from several weeks to four months.

Despite this vulnerability, the history of drought and famine in the Sahel do not perfectly correlate. While modern scientific climate and rainfall studies have been able to identify trends and even specific periods of drought in the region, oral and written records over the last millennium do not record famine in all places at all times of drought. One 1997 study, in attempting to map long scale rainfall records to historical accounts of famine in Northern Nigeria, concluded that “the most disruptive historical famines occurred when the cumulative deficit of rainfall fell below 1.3 times the standard deviation of long-term mean annual rainfall for a particular place.”&lt;ref&gt;Aondover Tarhule1 and Ming-Ko Woo. ‘Towards an Interpretation of Historical Droughts in Northern Nigeria’ ''Climatic Change'', no 37, 1997. pp.601-613&lt;/ref&gt; The 1982 to 1984 period, for instance, was particularly destructive to the pastoral [[Fula people]] of Senegal, Mali and Niger, and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of northern Mali and Niger. The populations had not only suffered in the 1968 to 1974 period, but the inability of many to rebuild herds destroyed a decade earlier, along with factors as various as the shift of political power to settled populations with independence in the 1960s, Senegalese-Mauritanian border relations, and Niger's dependence upon falling world uranium prices coinciding in a destructive famine.&lt;ref&gt;David Tenenbaum.

Draper Fund Report, 1985 Sept(14):17-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===600–700 AD===
Surviving contemporary records of climate in the Sahel begin with early [[Muslim]] travellers in the early [[Medieval Warm Period]]. These suggest that Sahel rainfall was relatively low in the 7th and 8th centuries and then increased substantially from about 800 AD.&lt;ref name="Rain1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eaters of the Dry Season: Circular Labor Migration in the West African Sahel |last=Rain |first=David |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=0-8133-3872-7 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a decline in rainfall from about 1300 AD, but an increase again around 200 years later.

===“Little Ice Age” droughts===
According to a study of West African drought based on Ghanaian lake sediments (not eyewitness historical accounts) published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in April 2009: &lt;blockquote&gt;
“The most recent of these [multicentury droughts] occurred between 1400 and 1750 CE (550 to 200 yr B.P.), similar in timing to the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400 to 1850 CE), a well-known interval when Northern Hemisphere temperatures were cooler than at present. In contrast with earlier studies, which reconstructed wetter conditions in East Africa during this period, evidence from [[Lake Bosumtwi]] supports more recent studies suggesting that this interval was dry. Evidence for LIA drought is not restricted to Africa, however. Records from throughout the tropics, including the western Pacific warm pool, the Arabian Sea, continental Asia, and tropical South America all show evidence for dry conditions during this time period.”.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====1640====
The first major historically recorded drought in the Sahel occurred around 1640. Based on the reports of European travellers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenstone.org/greenstone3/nzdl;jsessionid=1AB0DFF58D047EC9E8B55C523A65856F?a=d&amp;d=HASH99771026b305b974da2200.7&amp;c=envl&amp;sib=1&amp;dt=&amp;ec=&amp;et=&amp;p.a=b&amp;p.s=ClassifierBrowse&amp;p.sa= |title=Climate and Man in the Sahel during the Historical Period |accessdate=2008-06-19 |work=World Environmental Library |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219124305/http://www.greenstone.org/greenstone3/nzdl%3Bjsessionid%3D1AB0DFF58D047EC9E8B55C523A65856F?a=d&amp;d=HASH99771026b305b974da2200.7&amp;c=envl&amp;sib=1&amp;dt=&amp;ec=&amp;et=&amp;p.a=b&amp;p.s=ClassifierBrowse&amp;p.sa= |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a major drought after generally wet conditions also took place during the 1680s.

====1740s and 1750s====
Cycles of several wet decades followed by a drought were to be repeated during the 18th century. Sahelian drought again killed hundreds of thousands of people in the 1740s and 1750s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |title=Len Milich: Anthropogenic Desertification vs ‘Natural’ Climate Trends |publisher=Ag.arizona.edu |date=1997-08-10 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211081648/http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |archivedate=2012-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1740s and 1750s was recorded in chronicles of what is today Northern Nigeria, Niger and Mali as the "Great Famine", the worst for at least 200 years prior. It caused massive dislocation of the Sahelian states of the time, but also disrupted the [[Trans Saharan trade]] routes to North Africa and Europe.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1975&gt;Paul E. Lovejoy and Stephen Baier. The Desert-Side Economy of the Central Sudan. The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No. 4 (1975), pp. 551-581&lt;/ref&gt;

====1830s====
Around 1790 dry conditions similar to those of the late 20th century set in&lt;ref name="Rain1999" /&gt; and continued until around 1870. After that, a very wet period set in for around 25 years, followed by a return to drier conditions. While the drying begun around 1895 and caused its first large famine only in the early 20th century, the 1820s and 1830s saw a 12 to 15-year drought and regional instances of major famine from Senegal to Chad. Historical records suggest this drought caused a large-scale emigration from the [[Bornu Empire]], contributing to its rapid decline in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1975 /&gt; In what is now northern Senegal, the [[Imamate of Futa Toro]] was struck by a famine caused by the failure of 1833’s rainy season, leading to waves of famine until 1837.&lt;ref name=Curtin1975&gt;Philip D. Curtin, Economic Change in Precolonial Africa: Senegambia in the Era of the Slave Trade, 2 vols. University of Wisconsin Press (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century droughts===
The first rain gauges in the Sahel date from 1898 and they reveal that a major drought in the 1910s, accompanied by large-scale famine, was followed by wet conditions during the 1920s and 1930s, reaching a peak with the very wet year of 1936. The 1940s saw several minor droughts — notably in 1949 — but the 1950s were consistently wet, and expansion of agriculture to feed growing populations characterised this decade. Many have thought this contributed to the severity of the subsequent Sahel droughts.

===Late 20th century droughts===
[[Burkina Faso]], northern [[Nigeria]], southern [[Niger]], far northern [[Cameroon]] (near [[Lake Chad]]) and central [[Chad]] all struggled with dwindling rain fall from the 1960s.

On May 12 and 26,{{clarify|date=April 2014}} both [[Mauritania]], the [[Sénégal River drainage basin|Sénégal River Area]] and neighbouring parts of both [[Senegal]] and [[Mali]] faced both a drought and famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/222031/127409150030.htm |title=A Thomson Reuters Foundation Service |publisher=AlertNet |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/222031/127549655260.htm |title=A Thomson Reuters Foundation Service |publisher=AlertNet |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A literature review from the ''[[African Journal of Ecology]]'' summarized the environmental changes that species faced after the late 20th century droughts, some of which includes (but is not limited to) severe declines in biodiversity and increases in other disturbances, such as fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther|first=Bruno|date=2016|title=A review of recent ecological changes in the Sahel, with particular reference to land-use change, plants, birds and mammals|url=|journal=African Journal of Ecology|volume=54|issue=3|pages=268|doi=10.1111/aje.12350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 Sahel drought====
{{Main|2012 Sahel drought}}
By the middle of 2010, another drought in the western Sahel was predicted by several organisations for 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/Images/sahel.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/desertificationinsahel.html&amp;h=352&amp;w=620&amp;sz=41&amp;tbnid=aVNb7rLreHj5LM:&amp;tbnh=77&amp;tbnw=136&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DSahel&amp;usg=__X6CSKM4gSWK6qP6rD6sjgddhBL0=&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TC8aTOfeN-GJ4gaPsLjSCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q9QEwAw |title=Google Image Result for sahel.jpg |publisher=Google.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Stewart |url=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/desertificationinsahel.html |title=Desertification in the Sahel |publisher=Oceanworld.tamu.edu |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahel.org.uk/ |title=SOS Sahel |publisher=Sahel.org.uk |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential contributing factors==

Based on Senegal river cycles, precipitation cycles of various El Sahel stations which are related to Solar(89–120 years) Wolf-Gleissberg cycles, and on relations to Nile floods and Equatorial lake levels, Yousef and Ghilly in 2000 anticipated that there is a considerable probability that drought will occur  El Sahel Zone in 2005±4 years. This forecast was correct as drought occurred in El Niger in 2005 and again in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yousef and Ghilly|title=Alert el Sahel countries; drought is approaching|work=virtualacademia.com |url=http://www.virtualacademia.com/pdf/cli209_220.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a series of climate modeling studies performed at [[NOAA]] / [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] indicated that the late 20th century Sahel drought was probably a climatic response to changing sea surface temperature patterns, and that it could be viewed as a combination of natural variability superimposed upon an anthropogenically forced regional drying trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Held |first=I.

R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[GFDL CM2.X]], these climate model simulations indicated that the general late 20th century Sahel drying trend was attributable to human-induced factors; largely due to an increase in [[greenhouse gases]] and partly due to an increase in atmospheric aerosols. A study published in 2013, done at the University of Washington, suggests that atmospheric aerosols caused a downward shift in the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2013|title=SAHEL DROUGHT GENERATED BY DISTANT POLLUTION.|url=|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=94|issue=9|doi=10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00085.1|pmid=|access-date=|via=|bibcode=2013BAMS...94S...1P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift, the study says, left normally rainy areas in Central Africa much drier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report#Working Group I (WGI): The Physical Science Basis|IPCC future scenario A2]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; value of ≈860 ppm) Sahel rainfall could be reduced by up to 25% by year 2100, according to climate models.

A 2006 study by NOAA scientists suggests that the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]] plays a leading role. An AMO warm phase strengthens the summer rainfall over Sahel, while a cold phase reduces it.&lt;ref name="Zhang2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Rong |authorlink= |author2=Delworth, Thomas L.  |year=2006 |title=Impact of Atlantic multidecadal oscillations on India/Sahel rainfall and Atlantic hurricanes |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=33 |issue= 17|pages=L17712 |doi=10.1029/2006GL026267 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=2006GeoRL..3317712Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMO entered a warm phase in 1995 and, assuming a 70-year cycle (following peaks in ≈1880 and ≈1950), will peak around 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Enfield |first=David B. |authorlink= |author2=Cid-Serrano, Luis  |year=2009 |title=Secular and multidecadal warmings in the North Atlantic and their relationships with major hurricane activity |journal=International Journal of Climatology |volume=30 |issue= |pages= n/a|doi=10.1002/joc.1881 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found further evidence for a link between the AMO and West African drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shanahan |first=T.

The recovery of Sahel drought since the 1990s, coined "Sahel Greening" by media, is accounted for by enhancements in both the tropical easterly jet and the African easterly jet, both of which are known to induce wet anomalies.&lt;ref name="hindawi.com"/&gt; Moreover, positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves (AEWs) accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband. Change in the African easterly jet and AEWs are coupled to a northward shift and amplification of convective activity.&lt;ref name="hindawi.com"/&gt;

==United Nations response==
In 1973, The United Nations Sahelian Office (UNSO) was created to address the problems of drought in the Sahel region following the West African Sahel drought of 1968-73. In the 1990s, the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) was adopted and UNSO became the United Nations Development Programme's Office to Combat Desertification and Drought, as its scope broadened to be global rather than only focused on Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/drylands/history.html |title=Drylands Development Centre |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=2012-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208081007/http://www.undp.org/drylands/history.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''XM Satellite Radio''' ('''XM''') was one of the three [[satellite radio]] ([[SDARS]]) and [[online radio]] services in the United States and Canada, operated by [[Sirius XM Holdings]]. It provided pay-for-service radio, analogous to cable television. Its service included 73 different music channels, 39 news, sports, talk and entertainment channels, 21 regional traffic and weather channels and 23 play-by-play sports channels. XM channels were identified by [[Arbitron]] with the label "XM" (e.g., "XM32" for "[[The Bridge (Sirius XM)|The Bridge]]").

The company had its origins in the 1988 formation of the '''American Mobile Satellite Corporation''' (AMSC), a [[consortium]] of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals. In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the '''American Mobile Radio Corporation''' dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1999. The satellite service was officially launched on September 25, 2001.

On July 29, 2008, XM and former competitor [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] formally completed their merger, following U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval, forming Sirius XM Radio, Inc. with XM Satellite Radio, Inc. as its subsidiary.&lt;ref name="cnet080729"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10001299-94.html |title=Sirius And XM close merger |work=CNet.com |first=Dawn |last=Kawamoto |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/11/12/2008-11-12_siriusxm_satellite_merger_brings_changes.html |title=Sirius-XM satellite merger brings changes and cuts |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |work=Daily News |date=November 12, 2008 | location=New York | first=David | last=Hinckley}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/908937/000095012311014617/y88211e10vk.htm|title=2010 Form 10-K, Sirius XM Radio, Inc.|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its merger with Sirius, XM was the largest satellite radio company in the United States.

==Services==
While the satellite receiver radio service was its primary product, XM operated several audio and data services, and advertising.

===Satellite radio===
XM's primary business was satellite radio entertainment. XM carried music, news (both simulcast and syndicated programming), sports, talk radio, comedy (both stand-up and radio shows), and even radio drama. In addition, XM used to broadcast local weather and traffic conditions in its larger markets. The channel lineup was available on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xmradio.com/onxm/full-channel-listing.xmc|title=SiriusXM Channel Lineup - List of Online Music, Talk News &amp; Sports|author=|date=|website=xmradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To receive satellite radio programming, a customer was required to purchase a receiver. Prices ranged from less than $50 to over $200. With a service commitment, it was possible to get a simple receiver for free. Monthly packages started at US$6.99/month but after adding multiple sports channels (which was mandatory to have at that time) the monthly subscription changed to US$14.49/month&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.aspkeeplistening&lt;/ref&gt; (changed since 2011 from US$12.95/month) with add-on "family" radios at US$8.99/month. Best-of-Sirius was available on US accounts for an additional monthly fee. Lifetime packages were also available (USA only). Channel quality was in one of two flavors, stereo music channels at 39 kbit/s and mono talk channels at 16 kbit/s using proprietary compression. Many subscribers have complained about the low quality of satellite radio sound. But providers have stuck with the plan for more channels instead of better quality. HD terrestrial digital radio, a competitor has always used this difference as a selling point.

===XM Radio Online===
[[File:Xm online.jpg|right|thumb|220px|XM Radio's online player prior to their merge with Sirius]]  
XM Radio Online (XMRO), XM's Internet radio product, offered many of XM's music stations and could be accessed from any Internet connected computer, or via the SIRIUS XM [[mobile app]]. Prior to March 11, 2009, XMRO was included with XM Radio subscriptions, or was available separately for $7.99/month to Internet-only subscribers.

===Weather and traffic===
XM also provided data services such as weather information for pilots and weather spotters through its [[Sirius XM Weather &amp; Emergency]] [[datacasting]] service. This up to the minute weather information could be displayed in the cockpit of an aircraft equipped with a satellite weather receiver. Unlike weather radar, which relies on the aircraft's own equipment, the satellite service could give a pilot information about weather anywhere in USA and Canada. The downside is that the various weather streams (radar, cloud coverage, lightning, forecast, TAF, FA, etc...) took around 15 minutes to complete the data download, meaning that the information can be somewhat out-of-date by the time it is shown. In-cockpit radar and lightning receivers returned truly realtime information, but they cost thousands of dollars, did not provide forecasts, nor did they provide complete weather reports. FAA Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) were also available and shown. Certain aircraft had the XM radio service provided to the aircraft's audio system, which allowed passengers to listen to XM radio while flying.&lt;ref name="g1000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garmin.com/products/g1000/ |title=The Choice is as Clear as Glass |work=Garmin.com |accessdate=February 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107090255/http://www.garmin.com/products/g1000/ |archivedate=January 7, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flightdisplay"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://flightdisplay.com/news/2006/10/xm-satellite-weather-now-available-in.html |title=XM Satellite Weather Now Available in Business Aircraft Cabins |publisher=FlightDisplay.com |date=October 24, 2006 |accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial adoption and partnerships===
In 2005, [[AirTran Airways]] began putting XM Satellite Radio on their aircraft, while in January 2006, [[JetBlue Airways]] added XM Radio to their aircraft. [[United Airlines]] started carrying prerecorded XM content in March 2006. [[Zipcar]], an urban car-sharing service in the United States, initially installed XM receivers in all of their vehicles available for daily or hourly rental. However, citing uncertainty in the satellite radio market, Zipcar announced on May 1, 2007 that all XM radios would be removed from its fleet in the following months.

===Customer Service===
In contrast to its high-quality broadcasts, Sirius/XM's customer service has drawn fire from some state governments. In October 2010, Richard Cordray, Ohio's Attorney General, began investigating complaints regarding Sirius XM's policies on billing, customer solicitation as well as subscription renewals and cancellations. The company informed shareholders of the probe shortly thereafter. According to news reports, Arizona, Connecticut, Tennessee, Vermont, and the District of Columbia have expressed interest in participating in the inquiry.

According to [[Reuters]], "The investigations come as [[Sirius XM]], home to programs by Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey, has found its footing and distanced itself from years of huge losses and questions about its business model."&lt;ref name="Reuters01"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report obtained in March 2011, The Better Business Bureau reported receiving over 4500 complaints against Sirius XM in the preceding 36 months, around half of which regarded the company's billing and collection practices.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Missouri, some people registered on the state's do-not-call list have complained about receiving repeated calls from Sirius XM workers or agents after cancelling their subscriptions. Some Florida customers have reported being billed for automatic renewals of accounts they had canceled. Further, Sirius XM was sued in federal court by a customer accusing it of deceptively raising prices.&lt;ref name="Reuters01" /&gt;

The report also stated that "Sirius, in a statement, said it was cooperating with the investigations and that it believed its 'consumer-related practices comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.'"&lt;ref name="Reuters01" /&gt;

===Technology===
XM provided digital programming directly from two high-powered satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] above the equator: XM Rhythm at 85° west [[longitude]] and XM Blues at 115° west longitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/702/xm3-4/xm3-4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204112821/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/702/xm3-4/xm3-4.html |archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to a network of ground-based repeaters. The combination of two satellites and a ground-based repeater network was designed to provide gap-free coverage anywhere within the contiguous U.S., the southern tip of Alaska, and in the southern part of Canada. The signal could also be received in the Caribbean Islands and most of Mexico (reports have stated that areas north of [[Acapulco]] were able to receive a steady signal&lt;ref name="Acapulco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiithreads.com/showpost.php?p=16992&amp;postcount=28 |title=XM radio in Hawaii |work=HawaiiThreads.com |date=December 22, 2004 |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;), however XM is not yet licensed for reception by paid subscribers living in these areas.

The original satellites, XM-1 ("Rock") and XM-2 ("Roll") suffered from a generic design fault on the [[Boeing 702]] series of satellites (fogging of the solar panels), which means that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years.&lt;ref name="SpaceAndTech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceandtech.com/digest/flash2001/flash2001-082.shtml |title=Boeing 702 Satellites Solar Arrays Possibly Defective |work=SpaceandTech.com |date=September 29, 2001 |accessdate=December 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226225020/http://www.spaceandtech.com/digest/flash2001/flash2001-082.shtml |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADA430372"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA430372 |title=Charging of Mirror Surfaces in Space |first=Shu T |last=Lai |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=110 |year=2005 |accessdate=December 26, 2007 |doi=10.1029/2002JA009447 |pages=A01204 |bibcode=2005JGRA..110.1204L}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 ("Rhythm") was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005 and moved into XM-1's previous location of 85° WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115° WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 ("Blues") was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 ("Blues") ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006 into the 115° WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006 XM-1 was then powered down and drifted back to its original location at 85° WL, where it will remain as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 as well was powered down and remains as a backup to XM-4. This makes the current active satellites as XM-3 "Rhythm" and XM-4 "Blues" with two in-orbit spares.&lt;ref name="XMbluesPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC00368"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-265875A1.pdf |title=Satellite Space Applications Accepted for Filing |work=FCC.gov |format=PDF |date=June 9, 2006 |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2005, [[Space Systems/Loral]] announced that it had been awarded a contract for XM-5.&lt;ref name="LoralPR"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://ssloral.com/html/pressreleases/pr20050608.html |title=Space Systems/Loral to Build Next Generation Satellite for XM Satellite Radio |publisher=Space Systems/Loral |date=June 7, 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202232715/http://ssloral.com/html/pressreleases/pr20050608.html |archivedate=February 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SkyrocketXM5"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xm-5.htm |title=XM 5 |work=Skyrocket.de |date=June 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; XM-5 will feature two large unfurlable antennas. Sirius' Radiosat 5, also to be built by Loral, will have a similar single large antenna.

In American and Canadian metropolitan areas, XM and its Canadian licensee "Canadian Satellite Radio" (CSR) and operating as [[Sirius XM Canada]], owned and operated a network of approximately 900 terrestrial [[repeater]] stations, meant to compensate for satellite signal blockage by buildings, tunnels, and bridges. In the United States XM owned and operated approximately 800 repeater sites covering 60 markets; in Canada CSR was installing approximately 80 to 100 repeaters that was planned to be owned and operated by CSR in the 16 largest Canadian cities. The actual number of repeater sites varies as the signal is regularly tested and monitored for optimal performance. The actual number of sites in the United States has dropped from the original 1,000 installed when the service first launched in 2001. The repeaters transmit in the same frequency band as the satellites. A typical city contains 20 or more terrestrial stations. Typically, the receiver owner is unaware when a terrestrial station is being used, unless he or she checks antenna information from the receiver being used. Due to a FCC filing in October 2006, the latest list of XM's US terrestrial repeater network was made available to the public. &lt;!-- This data is available now in both [http://www.whatsonmyxm.com/gmaps/repeaters.php Google Base] (searchable by zip code or city/state) and [http://www.whatsonmyxm.com/gmaps/xmrepeaters.kml Google Earth] formats. --&gt;

The XM signal used 12.5&amp;nbsp;MHz of the [[S band]]: 2332.5 to 2345.0&amp;nbsp;MHz. XM provided 128 kilobits per second of its bandwidth to [[OnStar]] Corporation for use with XM-enabled [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] vehicles, regardless of whether their owners are XM subscribers. American Honda also retained the right to some of the company's bandwidth to transmit messages to [[Acura]] vehicles via a service known as [[AcuraLink]].

XM NavTraffic, an optional service, transmitted coded traffic information directly to vehicle navigation systems using [[Traffic Message Channel|TMC]] technology.

Audio channels on XM were digitally compressed using the [[HE-AAC|CT-aacPlus (HE-AAC)]] codec from [[Coding Technologies]] for most channels, and the [[Advanced Multi-Band Excitation|AMBE]] codec from Digital Voice Systems for some voice channels, including all of the Traffic and Weather channels.

The XM radio signal was broadcast on 6 separate radio carriers within the 12.5&amp;nbsp;MHz allocation. The entire content of the radio service, including both data and audio content, was represented by only two carriers. The other 4 carriers carried duplicates of the same content to achieve redundancy through [[Diversity combining|signal diversity]]. The data on each carrier is encoded using time-delayed and error-correction schemes to enhance availability. Effectively the total radio spectrum used for content is a little over 4&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220151/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }} This XM patent describes the carrier allocation scheme&lt;/ref&gt;

Each two-carrier group broadcast 100 8-kilobit-per-second streams in approximately 4&amp;nbsp;MHz of radio spectrum. These streams were combined using a patented process to form a variable number of channels using a variety of bitrates. Bandwidth is separated into segments of 4-kilobit-per-second virtual "streams" which are combined to form audio and data "channels" of varying bitrates from 4 to 64 kilobits-per-second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220151/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }} XM Patent Method and apparatus for audio output combining&lt;/ref&gt;

XM preprocessed audio content using Neural Audio processors that are optimized for the [[aacPlus]] codec, including [[spectral band replication]] (SBR). Audio was stored digitally in Dalet audio library systems using an industry-standard [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] at 384 kbit/s, sometimes known as [[MUSICAM]]. The audio is further processed by the Neural Audio processors on the way to broadcast.

In the past, the [[Sirius XM Pops]] channel, which aired classical music, was broadcast in [[Surround sound|5.1 surround sound]] audio quality. The technology, titled [[XM HD Surround]], is the result of a partnership between XM and [[Neural Audio Corporation]] which provides content with six discrete channels of digital audio. The former [[XM Live]] channel also broadcast in this format for certain concerts and studio performances. XM manufacturing partners such as [[Denon]], [[Onkyo]], [[Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc.]], and [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] introduced home audio systems capable of playing XM HD Surround. It is not known if the XM HD Surround technology is used on the service in 2015.

==Clear Channel programming agreement==
As part of terrestrial radio giant [[Clear Channel Communications]]' early investment into XM in 1998, the companies entered into agreements which provided for certain programming and director designation arrangements as long as Clear Channel retained the full amount of its original investment in XM. One positive consequence of this was that XM had (and still has) exclusive programming rights to all Clear Channel content, including popular national shows like [[Coast to Coast AM]], but the shows could only be broadcast inside the bandwidth controlled by Clear Channel. In June 2003, Clear Channel entered into a [[Forward contract|forward sales agreement]] relating to its ownership of XM. During the third quarter of 2005, Clear Channel and XM arbitrated the impact of this agreement on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp Operational Assistance Agreement] and the [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091530/000102140803000768/dex106.txt Director Designation Agreement]. The Arbitration Panel decided that the Operational Assistance Agreement would remain in effect, including Clear Channel's right to receive a revenue share of commercial advertising on programming it provides to XM, but declined to enforce the Director Designation Agreement, which forced the Mays family members off the board of directors. Per the original agreement, Clear Channel had the right to program 409.6 kbit/s (or 10%) of XM bandwidth, requiring XM to include commercial advertising on the existing [[Nashville!]], [[KISS-XM|KISS]], [[Mix (XM)|Mix]], and [[Sunny (XM)|Sunny]] (now [[The Music Summit]]). The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free. Exceptions include syndicated music shows which carry network spots. Clear Channel advertising on XM is handled by its subsidiary, [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. Clear Channel also provided existing talk channel programming ([[Fox Sports Radio]], [[Extreme XM]], [[Talk Radio (XM)|Talk Radio]]). Clear Channel also controlled [[America Right]] (formerly Buzz XM), but through a series of show swaps, most non-Clear Channel content was removed and programming control returned to XM Radio. Plans to introduce new regional based talk channels, which would have featured a regional 5 minute newscast for each area of the country, were canceled. Instead, Clear Channel chose to introduce other music and talk channels. Newer channels including [[ReachMD]], [[America's Talk]] remain on the air. [[The Pink Channel]], [[National Lampoon Comedy Radio]], [[WSIX-FM]], [[WLW]], and [[Rock@Random]] were launched and later removed, and replaced by channels like [[Bollywood &amp; Beyond (radio)|Bollywood &amp; Beyond]], [[The Music Summit]], and [[Sixx Sense]], all of which are on the air today.

Seen as a blow to XM's 100% commercial-free music channel status, XM Executive Vice President of Programming Eric Logan released a [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp programming announcement] to XM subscribers on the company's website that reiterated XM's commitment to commercial-free music while noting that XM still had the most commercial-free music and that more commercial-free music channels will be added in the near future to ensure that XM will still have more commercial-free music than competitor [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]. On April 17, 2006, XM launched US Country (XM17), Flight 26 (XM26), XM Hitlist (XM30) and Escape (XM78) to provide commercial free music in the formats of the Clear Channel programmed music channels which were going to begin airing commercials. In response, Sirius has advertised that they are the only satellite radio provider that has 100% commercial-free music channels. Both XM and Sirius air commercials on their news, talk, and sports channels.

The Clear Channel forward sales agreement with [[Bear Stearns|Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc]] was terminated on August 2, 2006. The termination resulted in Clear Channel Investments, Inc. paying Bear Stearns a total of $83.1 million, which was the value of Clear Channel's stake in XM. The accreted value of the debt was $92.9 million, and the fair value of the collar was an asset of $6.0 million, which resulted in a net gain of $3.8 million for Clear Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearchannel.com/Investors/Documents/246.pdf|title=iHeartMedia, Inc.|author=|date=|website=www.clearchannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''XM vs RIAA''==
In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the [[RIAA]] over XM's new portable devices the [[Pioneer Inno|Inno]] and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are equivalent to a downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 [[Audio Home Recording Act]]. In July, XM requested that a federal judge dismiss the case. It should be noted that XM's subscribers can save only songs they hear on the radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded or program their radios to record specific artists. XM's portable devices allow the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast much like a [[VCR]], [[Digital video recorder|DVR]], or [[cassette player]] would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails to listen to a total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.

The idea is not new: [[TimeTrax]] Technologies Corporation, led by CEO Elliott Frutkin, developed an application to record songs to MP3 and tag them with the artist and title information directly from the XM network. In 2005, XM attempted to thwart this practice by discontinuing the required XM PCR radio. [[TimeTrax]] responded by quickly rolling out adaptive interfaces to allow almost any XM subscriber to use their tuner to build music libraries directly from XM broadcasts. There is speculation that these fumbles by XM and its attitude towards the Time Trax technology may have been the warning shot of major troubles between the RIAA and XM.

On January 19, 2007, a district judge ruled that the RIAA could proceed with the lawsuit, rejecting XM's defense that the conduct alleged in the complaint—if proved by the RIAA—would be immune under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1991.&lt;ref name="riaa suit 2007"&gt;{{cite news |title=Suit by Record Companies Against XM Going to Trial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011901680_pf.html |agency=Associated Press |last=Neumeister |first=Larry |date=January 20, 2007 |accessdate=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PCR and DirectPCR==
At the heart of the TimeTrax controversy was the [[XM PCR]]: a computer-controlled XM Receiver. Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to run. A software application on the computer acted as the radio's controls and display, which led to a flurry of third party developers, who wanted to make a PCR replacement. Many of them [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp received Cease and Desist letters] from the XM company{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}}. Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple adapter cable. Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software.

==Merger With Sirius Satellite Radio==

The merger combined the two radio services and created a single Satellite Radio network in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="sirius230306"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=230306 |title=SIRIUS and XM to Combine in $13 Billion Merger of Equals |publisher=PRNewswire ''via'' Sirius.com |date=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=February 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222221224/http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=230306 |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice]] announced on March 24, 2008 that it had closed its investigation of the merger because it "concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius was likely to substantially lessen competition."&lt;ref name="DOJ Closing Statement"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2008/231467.htm |title=Statement of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on its Decision to Close its Investigation of XM Satellite Ratio Holdings Inc.'s Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. |publisher=Department of Justice Antitrust Division |date=March 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325225258/http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2008/231467.htm |archivedate=March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2008, [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] Chairman [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]] told the Washington Post that he had decided to approve the XM-Sirius Merger after the companies agreed in the previous week to concessions intended to prevent the new company from raising prices or stifling competition. Martin issued an order to approve the merger, according to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' – setting the stage for a final vote which could have occurred any time after his recommendation was circulated.

The XM-Sirius Merger gained its final governmental approval from the Federal Communications Commission on July 25, 2008, with Martin and commissioners [[Robert M. McDowell]] and deciding vote [[Deborah Taylor Tate]] voting in the affirmative. As a term of the merger, the combined company will be fined almost $20 million for failing to create and market interchangeable radios capable of receiving signals from both companies prior to the merger.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

==iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry and Android applications==

XM developed a software application for use on the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]] and Apple [[iPod Touch]] devices that allowed XM subscribers to listen to its programming over the Apple devices. The Sirius XM iPhone App became available in the Apple [[iTunes Store]] on June 17, 2009.

All SiriusXM Internet Radio subscribers are able to download the application from the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|iTunes App-Store]] for free. Listening on an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch is included with some subscription packages, a separate fee is required with other packages.

SiriusXM debuted a new web page [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp] to market the application.

On February 4, 2010, SiriusXM released an app for the [[Research In Motion]] [[BlackBerry]] line of smartphones, including the [[BlackBerry Storm|Storm]] (Series 9500), [[BlackBerry Bold|Bold]] (Series 9000 and 9700), [[BlackBerry Tour|Tour]] (Series 9600) and [[BlackBerry Curve|Curve]] (Series 8500 and 8900). Like the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch application, the [[BlackBerry App World|BlackBerry app]] is free but requires a SiriusXM subscription.

SiriusXM is also available for download on [[Android (operating system)|Android devices]] through [[Google Play]].

The applications carry most of the XM music, talk, sports and entertainment programming, as well as some exclusive Internet-only content. The mobile applications also carry a select number of channels from the "Best of SIRIUS/XM" packages, dependent on the subscriber's subscription level.

In November 2004, [[Canadian Satellite Radio]] filed an application with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] to bring the XM service to Canada. Along with [[Sirius Canada]] and the consortium of [[CHUM Limited]] and [[Astral Media]], CSR was one of three applications for national [[subscription radio]] services submitted to the CRTC.

On June 16, 2005, the CRTC approved all three applications. The decisions were appealed to the Canadian federal cabinet by a number of broadcasting, labour, and arts and culture organizations, including the [[Friends of Canadian Broadcasting]], [[CHUM Limited]], and the [[National Campus and Community Radio Association]]. The groups objected to the satellite radio applicants' approach to and reduced levels of [[Canadian content]] and French-language programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, Cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005.

XM's Canadian channels appeared on US receivers on November 17, 2005. On November 29, 2005, XM Canada officially launched.
