{{Moroccan literature}}
'''Ahmad ibn al-Qadi''' or '''Ibn al-Qadi''',(December 18, 1552{{snd}}December 6, 1616), fully '''Shihab al-Din abu l-‘Abbas Ahmad ibn Mohammed ibn Mohammed ibn Ahmed ibn Ali ibn 'Abd er-Rahman ibn Abi'l-' Afiyya el-Miknasi ez-[[Zenata|Zanati]]''', was the leading writer from [[Ahmad al-Mansur]]'s court in [[Morocco]] next to [[Abd al-Aziz al-Fishtali]]. He was also a renowned judge and mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;See entry 'Shihab al-din Abu l-‘Abbas' in ''Encyclopædia Britannica France''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ahmad ibn al-Qadi was born in 18 December 1552 in the Ibn al-qadi family.&lt;ref name="Lévi-Provençal"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Les_historiens_des_Chorfa.html?id=fTFLAAAAYAAJ|title=Les historiens des Chorfa: essai sur la littérature historique et biographique au Maroc du XVIe au XXe siècle|last=Lévi-Provençal|first=Évariste|date=|publisher=Émile Larose|year=1922|isbn=|editor-last=Larose|editor-first=Emile|location=Paris|pages=100|language=fr|quote=|author-link=Évariste Lévi-Provençal|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These latter belonged to the [[Zenata]] Berber tribal confederation, many of whose descendants were established in Fez and Meknes.&lt;ref name="Lévi-Provençal" /&gt; The ibn al-qadi family gave birth to distinguished people, who, during the previous centuries, had held high political or religious offices and had become famous as islamic scholars.&lt;ref name="Lévi-Provençal" /&gt;

Ahmad Ibn al-Qadi studied with [[Abd al-Wahid al-Sijilmasi]], the famous Moroccan mufti and [[Ahmad Baba al Massufi]]. The jurisdiction of [[Salé]] was assigned to him. At the age of 34 he undertook a journey to the east, but his ship was captured by Christians. Ibn al-Qadi spent eleven months in captivity and was released thanks to sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] who paid as ransom the equivalent of 20 thousand ounces of gold.&lt;ref&gt;See entry 'Shihab al-din Abu l-‘Abbas' in ''Encyclopædia Britannica France''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
A number of Ibn al-Qadi's works survive to this day. His primary panegyric work is entitled ''Al-Muntaqa al-maqsur 'ala ma'athir al-khilafat Abi al-Abbas al-Mansur''. This work consists mainly of a meditation upon the great character qualities of al-Mansur which, the scholar argues, showed him to be the rightful caliph of Islam. He also composed two collections of biographies of great documentary value: ''Jadwat al Iqtibas Fi-man halla min al'alam madinata fas'' (The Torch of learning in the recollection of the most influential notables of the city of Fez) and ''Durrat al-hidjāl fī asmā’ al-ridjāl''.

'''Archaeology of [[Bocas del Toro, Panama]]''': The province of [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]] in [[Panama]] has a rich history, beginning with the first European visitors: Christopher Columbus and his son Fernando in 1502 on Columbus’ fourth voyage to the New World. The area was visited frequently from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 18th century by privateers and buccaneers marauding Spanish colonial towns and the ships carrying gold to Europe. However little is known of the inhabitants of the region before the time of European contact. Archaeological research conducted since the middle of the 20th century has begun to illuminate the cultural history as well as development of societies in the region prior to Columbus arriving.

==Geographic Setting==
[[File:Bocas del Toro Archipelago map.png|right|thumb|370px|Bocas del Toro Archipelago]]
[[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]] is one of ten provinces in the [[Republic of Panama]], and is located in the western part of the country. It is bounded by the province of [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]] in the south, the province of [[Veraguas]] (including the [[Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca]] [[Comarca indígena]]) in the east, to the north is the [[Caribbean Sea]] and to the west is the [[Republic of Costa Rica]]. Bocas del Toro also refers to the archipelago which runs roughly northwest to southeast along the coast of the isthmus from the [[Seropta Peninsula]] to the [[Laguna de Chiriquí]] and includes the islands of [[Isla Colón]], [[Isla Solarte]], [[Isla Bastimentos]], [[Isla San Cristóbal]], [[Isla Popa]], and [[Cayo Agua]]. The province is further divided into three districts: [[Chiriquí Grande]], [[Changuinola]], and [[Bocas del Toro District|Bocas del Toro]]. Major cities include [[Changuinola]], [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]], and [[Bocas Town, Bocas del Toro|Bocas del Toro]] or ([[Bocas Town]]) which is also the provincial capital and is located on [[Isla Colon]].
[[File:Countries-Panama-provinces-2005-10-18-en.png|left|thumb|570px|The nine provinces and three provincial-level ''comarcas'' of Panama]]

==Early Research==
The earliest archaeological research in the region was conducted by [[Mathew Stirling]] in 1953 and revealed the existence of shell middens along the coastal plain &lt;ref&gt;Stirling and Stirling 1964&lt;/ref&gt; although very little was published about these. The geographer [[B.L. Gordon]] provided a more discerning interpretation of these middens &lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1962&lt;/ref&gt; and “began to develop a bio-cultural profile of the area”.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon’s excavations yielded mostly mollusk remains, although he described an unknown number of metates and a low density of both ceramic sherds and stone tools in the form of triangular celts. From 1971 through 1972 [[Olga Linares]] conducted test excavations &lt;ref&gt;Linares 1977&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Cerro Brujo]] shell midden site on the [[Aguacate Peninsula]]. This site is located on top of a ridgeline that divides [[Bahía Almirante]] from [[Laguna de Chiriquí]], and is 3&amp;nbsp;km from the shoreline at approximately 140 m above sea level. She describes the site as a hamlet in which cultural material recovered from “two main midden clusters” &lt;ref&gt;Linares 1976&lt;/ref&gt; show an occupation period of 20–30 years from five [[radiocarbon]] dates ranging from AD 960 to AD 985. A complete survey of the [[Aguacate Peninsula]] was conducted by Linares in 1973 and in addition to [[Cerro Brujo]] three similar shell midden sites were located.&lt;ref&gt;Linares 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Research==
The most recent site to be discovered and studied in the province is [[Sitio Drago]] on the northwest shore of [[Isla Colon]], and has been investigated by [[Thomas A. Wake]] of the [[Cotsen Institute of Archaeology]] at [[UCLA]] from 2002 to the present. This site is located on a “stabilized beach ridge” &lt;ref&gt;Wake, et al. 2004: 1&lt;/ref&gt; between the tropical forest of the interior of the island and the coral reef immediately offshore. The site is identified by approximately 15 low mounds of stratified midden over 17 hectares. Test excavations have produced “prestige goods, as well as a wider variety of general artefact types, and a greater diversity of ceramics than seen at [[Cerro Brujo]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, et al. 2004: 2&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural material recovered include a wide variety of ceramic sherds and appliqué figurines which indicate interaction with the [[Pacific Chiriquí]] region, various stone tools (celts, blades), and a diverse collection of faunal remains (bone and mollusk). [[Radiocarbon]] dates from carbonized wood and Raphia nuts provide a timeframe of AD 900 to AD 1150 for the occupation period of the site. The diversity and density of the ceramics and other goods recovered from [[Sitio Drago]] have led Wake to surmise that “Sitio Drago is much larger and appears more internally complex than the loosely organized farming hamlets such as [[Cerro Brujo]],”.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, et al. 2004: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Following Gordon, Linares surmised that the Bocas del Toro region was a marginal area to the supposedly larger and more complex culture area of [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]] on the Pacific coast of the isthmus of [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linares 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The paucity of sites, which appeared solely to be small hamlets identified by shell middens with a low density of stone artifacts, seemed to indicate a very low population spread out over a large area. The [[Bocas del Toro Archipelago|Bocas del Toro]] archipelago of islands was dismissed as having no significant importance, particularly because of Gordon’s assumption that the only sites off the mainland were similar small hamlets with shell middens, as reported to him (it is not mentioned who provided this information) on [[Isla Popa]] and [[Isla Cristóbal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Since the discovery and excavations at [[Sitio Drago]], the Bocas del Toro region has been cast in a new light archaeologically. Wake argues that the assumptions made by Linares are empirically weak &lt;ref&gt;Wake, et al. 2004: 1&lt;/ref&gt; as they are based on a single excavated site and nominal investigation of the surrounding region. Diagnostic ceramics from [[Sitio Drago]] identified as [[Linarte Zoned Red Line]] ware and others “support the idea of trans-isthmian connections”.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, et al. 2004: 3&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the greater diversity and density of stone tools, faunal remains, and prestige items at a site contemporaneous with [[Cerro Brujo]] lend to the hypothesis that the region was more complex socio-politically than previously assumed and that it was an integral part of the “[[Greater Chiriquí]] interaction sphere”.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, et al. 2004: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Investigations==
At this time [[Sitio Drago]] is still being investigated by Wake with colleagues [[Tomas Mendizabal]] and [[Alexis Mojica]] as the [[Proyecto Arqueológico Sitio Drago]] (PASD). In addition to publications forthcoming from Wake, Mendizabal, and Mojica, several new investigations are being conducted by students in coordination with PASD both at the site and in other parts of [[Isla Colón]].

'''Aurelio Chessa''' (30 October 1913 – 26 October 1996) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[anarchist]], [[journalist]] and [[historian]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estelnegre.org/documents/chessa/chessa.html|title=Aurelio Chessa (1913–1996)|publisher=Ateneu Llibertari Estel Negre, Palma de Mallorca|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among researchers of twentieth century anarchism he is also noted as an [[archivist]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoBibPan&gt;{{cite web|title= L’Archivio Famiglia Berneri-Aurelio Chessa|publisher=Comune di Reggio Emilia (Biblioteca Panizzi)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Aurello Chessa was born in [[Putifigari]], a village in the north western part of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoBibPan/&gt; He enlisted as a sailor on 31 March 1931, as a result of which he came to spend long enough in Egypt to learn how to bake Egyptian bread.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; On 9 November 1939 he received a one-year prison sentence for insubordination, following which he spent four months from 24 October 1939 till 27 February 1940 in the San Francesco jail in [[Genoa]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; After the [[Second World War]], in 1945 his maternal uncle, the anarchist Francesco Piras, who had introduced him to the [[Libertarian Movement (Italy) |Libertarian Movement]] fled to France: Chessa took over a large amount of his uncle's archival material on the movement,&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; establishing the basis of a document collection that would grow during the ensuing decades.

In 1945 he started working as a functionary for the [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane|Italian State Railway Company]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; In 1946 he started contributing to "Volontà", a radical journal recently established by [[Giovanna Berneri]], the widow of [[Camillo Berneri]] who had been assassinated in [[Barcelona]] a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; Chessa would continue to work on "Volontà" for many years. In 1947 he was a co-founder of a [[Genoa]] branch of the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|Italian Anarchist Federation (''Federazione anarchica italiana'' / FAI)]], described in one source as a party of the "anti-organisation tendency".&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; The FAI held a congress at [[Canossa]] in 1948 in which he participated, and on 1-2 May 1954 he presided at the FAI's national congress at [[Livorno]] as president of the congress, while insisting that he was participating in a personal capacity and not as the representative of any party, group or faction.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; 

On 26 May 1958 Chessa found himself facing trial in a Genoa court, charged with "Civil Disobedience". The case involved his advocacy of [[abstention]] in that year's [[Italian general election, 1958|General Election]]. He was sentenced to a six-month prison term but given leave to appeal. At his appeal hearing, which took place on 23 December 1958, the court accepted a lesser charge of "Instigation", and a fine was substituted for imprisonment.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; In the same year he was writing articles under the pseudonym "Paratacca" on matters such as voting and democracy: these appeared in {{Interlanguage link multi|Lo Svegliarino|it}}, a newspaper published in [[Carrara]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; Throughout this period he continued to work for the national railway company, and in 1960 his activist participation in the major strike of 8 June in Genoa earned him a reprimand from the railway management.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; Between 1964 and 1967 he wrote several articles about the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ugo Mazzucchelli|it}} trial.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; Meanwhile, in December 1965, he was a co-founder in [[Pisa]] of the "Gruppo d'Iniziativa Anarquista" (GIA), a breakaway faction from the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|FAI]] following policy differences.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt;

Chessa's old friend [[Giovanna Berneri]] died in March 1962 her daughter, [[Giliana Berneri]] passed a large volume of papers on her parents' and grandparents' activist and writing careers within the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|Anarchist movement]] to him. Much of Aurelia Chessa's energy subsequently was devoted to ordering and maintaining what was now a large and growing archive of historical importance. On 4 April 1966 he retired after 22 years of service from his work with the railway and relocated from [[Genoa]] to [[Pistoia]].&lt;ref name=ACsecondoALEN/&gt; The archive was housed successively in various locations including old churches in places that included [[Pistoia]], [[Iglesias, Sardinia|Iglesias]], [[Genoa]], [[Canosa]] and [[Cecina, Tuscany|Cecina]]. The [[:it:Archivio Famiglia Berneri|Archivio Famiglia Berneri-Chessa ''("Berneri-Chesso Family Archive")'']] which has been accommodated in the Biblioteca Panizzi (Panizzi Library) at [[Reggio Emilia]] since 1998.&lt;ref name=ACsecondoBibPan/&gt;

Aurelio Chessa died in 1996 and his daughter, Fiamma Chessa, took on the task of curating the archive her father had accumulated and created.&lt;ref name=CuradiFC&gt;{{cite web|title=Chessa, Fiamma (a cura di) Aurelio Chessa il viandante dell’utopia|url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article4479|publisher=Chessa, Fiamma (a cura di) Aurelio Chessa il viandante dell’utopia, |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Baer Gottlober.jpg|thumb]]
'''Avrom Ber Gotlober''' (January 14, 1811, [[Starokostiantyniv|Starokonstantinov]], [[Volhynian Governorate|Volhynia]] – April 12, 1899, [[Białystok]]) was a [[Jewish]] writer, poet, playwright, historian, journalist and educator from the [[Russian Empire]]. He mostly wrote in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but also wrote poetry and dramas in [[Yiddish]]. His first collection was published in 1835.

Gotlober's last name is often transliterated as Gottlober. He was widely known by his initials, ABG, which in Hebrew and Yiddish are the first three letters, ''alef-bet-giml''.

ABG was a [[maskil]], a leader in the [[haskalah]], the nineteenth-century [[Jewish Enlightenment]] in Russia and Eastern Europe. While his literary output is no longer widely known, he was important for several reasons:

*As a teacher in the state-sponsored schools for Jews, where he taught and influenced two founders of [[Yiddish literature]]: [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]], whom [[Sholom Aleichem]] called "the zeyde (grandfather) of us all", and [[Abraham Goldfaden]], the founder of the professional [[Yiddish theater]].
*As a historian who wrote histories of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]]s (''Bikoret le-toldot ha-Karaim'') and of the [[Hasidism]] and [[Kabbalah]] (''Toldot ha-Kabalah veha-Hasidut'') that are still cited by scholars.
*As a social observer and memoirist, who had the fortune to live long enough to describe the social and political conditions of the 1820s and 1830s for audiences of the 1880s. Scholars widely cite his memoirs (''Zikhronot u-masaot,'' or ''Memoirs and Travels''), his contribution to Sholom Aleichem's ''Yudishe Folks-Bibliothek,'' and his articles in his own periodical ''Ha-Boker Or'' (''The Morning Light'') and in other periodicals.

'''Catherine Crary''', née '''Conrad''' (12 February 1909 – 11 March 1974), was an American [[historian]] of the [[American Revolution]].

==Life and work==
Catherine Snell Crary was born in [[Rochester, New York]] on 12 February 1909. Privately educated, she graduated from [[Mount Holyoke College]] in 1930 with a [[B.A.]]. Two year later, she married Calvert Crary and received her [[Ph.D.]] from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1933. She taught history at [[Brearley School]] in [[New York City]] before becoming a lecturer in history at [[Barnard College]]. Crary was an [[adjunct professor]] of history at [[Finch College]] in 1957–59.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon &amp; Cosner, p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; That latter year, she found a presumed-lost [[holograph]] draft of the [[Federalist No. 64|Federalist Papers No. 64]] in the [[John Jay]] papers at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Digital Library Collections|url=https://dlc.library.columbia.edu/jay/jay_constitution|website=dlc.library.columbia.edu|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had an article in the [[William and Mary Quarterly]] that year that showed that [[James Rivington]], a New York City [[newspaper editor]] during the British occupation of the city, fed information to an American agent. Crary published ''Dear Belle: Letters from a Cadet and Officer to His Sweetheart, 1858–1865'' in 1965 and ''The Price of Loyalty: Tory Writings from the Revolutionary Era'' in 1973. The latter book was honored with the [[American Revolution Bicentennial Roundtable Award]] the following year. She died in New York City on 11 March 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon &amp; Cosner, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy with the Toporovski collection==
In Fall 2017 the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent re-installed its permanent collection and included works by contemporary artists Luc Tuymans, Ria Verhaeghe and Patrick Van Caeckenbergh. The new installation also included a few Russian avantgarde works from the Dieleghem Foundation (Toporovski collection). In 2018, however, the Toporovski collection was claimed to be doubtful concerning their authenticity by a group of art dealers and some scholars in ''The Art Newspaper'' and ''De Standaard''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/leading-curators-and-dealers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/experts-say-russian-modernism-show-ghent-museum-highly-questionable-1198757&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian news claimed that de Zegher insisted the MSK had done art historical research and also worked with two art historians, experts in the field of the Russian avantgarde, stating to be able to prove it with the needed documents. Both of the experts however denied having done an expertise on the works and said to have warned de Zegher not to exhibit the Toporovski collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/russian-avant-garde-exhibition-closes-expose-1210742&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180307_03395199?_section=67923531&amp;adh_i=7ebe505c630155cee7cdcc577175124c&amp;imai=&amp;M_BT=2336723130940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philippinenewsnow.com/art-experts-fume-at-bogus-russian-art-in-belgian-museum/&lt;/ref&gt; De Zegher disputed these claims, however she did not bring forth evidence supporting her own claims as requested by the local political opposition and by the museum board.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tijd.be/cultuur/expo/catherine-de-zegher-de-geschorste-museumdirectrice/9989967.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180307_03395199|title=Raad van bestuur bespreekt positie MSK-directrice De Zegher|last=Sels|first=Geert|work=De Standaard|access-date=2018-11-22|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Director of the MSK and the City of Ghent closed the exhibition and terminated the contract with the owner so that the works could be returned. The latter stated that an investigation will be conducted to verify the authenticity of the works.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/02/20/museum-voor-schone-kunsten-geeft-toporovski-bruiklenen-terug/&lt;/ref&gt; Several Flemish museum directors critiqued the handling of de Zegher and the MSK.&lt;ref name="vrt kunst"&gt;https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/03/05/omstreden-russische-kunst--museumdirecteurs-distantieren-zich-va/&lt;/ref&gt; De Zegher held fast to her claim that they did all the necessary art historical research.&lt;ref name="vrt kunst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/285131/art-experts-fume-fake-russian-art-belgian-museum/&lt;/ref&gt; A former exhibition in France featuring work from the Toporovski's was questioned as well, however the court ruled the paintings to be real.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/the-story-behind-the-dubious-russian-avant-garde-art-show-in-ghent-museum&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the problems surrounding the collection, the museum board has ordered an audit on the event and has suspended de Zegher pending this process.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artforum.com/news/director-of-ghent-s-museum-of-fine-arts-suspended-over-controversial-exhibition-74572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180307_03396055&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish Parlement debated in Februari how to limit the negative effects of this controversy for other Belgian musea&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vlaamsparlement.be/plenaire-vergaderingen/1231847/verslag/1233085&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artforum.com/news/belgian-police-raid-homes-as-investigation-into-ghent-museum-exhibition-continues-74733&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the matter is in the hands of an investigating judge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180209_03348328&lt;/ref&gt;. 

After 7 months of her suspension, 63 artists, among museum directors and intellectuals published a letter in support of Catherine de Zegher. Among those to have signed the letter include artists [[Eija-Liisa Ahtila]], [[Luis Camnitzer]], [[Cristina Iglesias]], [[Simryn Gill]], [[Mona Hatoum]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Luc Tuymans]], and [[Cecilia Vicuña]]; art historian [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]]; [[Catherine David]], deputy director of the Centre Pompidou in Paris; [[Bartomeu Mari]], director of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul; and [[Ann Gallagher]], director of Tate Modern’s British Art collections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2018/10/10/open-letter-artists-art-professionals-decry-suspension-director-ghents-museum-fine-arts/&lt;/ref&gt; The letter reads:

 "We are appalled to see how one of the preeminent women curators of her generation internationally, a wholly professional and widely acclaimed museum director, has been made the plaything of unscrupulous media and of international speculation in the art of the Russian avantgarde, resulting in a severe media process destroying her work and reputation. Through this letter, we affirm our full support for Catherine de Zegher as museum director and as curator. We challenge the local and national authorities concerned on the important issue of having, keeping, protecting and supporting visionary museum directors in their country, remaining independent in their judgement from the pressure media exert and the correlated hype and sensation, and above all from the growing influence of a certain art market linked with finance and power. We ask them to seriously pay attention to the role art and museums play in our cities, regions and in the society at large, the great principles they represent, and the necessity of having inspirational museum directors and curators to lead the way." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vrt.be/content/dam/vrtnieuws/bestanden/2018/Open%20brief%20De%20Zegher.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17th 2018 De Zegher organised a press conference during which she stated that several of the works in the show had since been tested in laboratories and were proven to consist of materials dating from the perod to which they were attributed. She also repeated her earlier statement that art-historical research had been undertaken. No documentary proof was presented, stating instead that evidence would be revealed at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20181017_03851914|title=Catherine de Zegher: “Er is wetenschappelijk bewijs van echtheid meest bekritiseerde werken”|last=gjs|work=Het Nieuwsblad|access-date=2018-11-22|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a simultaneous statement, De Zegher referred to a book to be published in 2019 which will reveal the entire story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hart-magazine.be/nl/opinie-catherine-de-zegher-fake-art-or-fake-news#.W_cRYeIiGM8|title=Opinie Catherine De Zegher: Fake art or fake news?|last=Magazine|first=HART|website=www.hart-magazine.be|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


On November 5th the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art (CiMAM) issued a statement in support of Catherine de Zegher. The full statement reads: 

''“In its capacity as the international association for Museums and Collections of Modern and Contemporary art, and as an affiliate of ICOM, CIMAM wishes to register its deep concern at the treatment of Catherine de Zegher in her capacity as Director of the Museum of Fine Arts (MSK) in Ghent. Since January 2018, as part of investigations into the authenticity of a group of Russian modernist works, Ms de Zegher has been subject to a series of accusations that have not been dismissed nor brought to appropriate conclusion. This has caused considerable damage to her reputation as a museum professional and curator of the highest standing internationally.
''In expressing its support for Ms de Zegher CIMAM also wishes to defend the principles of integrity and respect for museum professionals globally at a time when museums and their directors are being confronted with pressures from the art market, undue interference from governing bodies, and campaigns based on misinformation”''&lt;ref&gt;http://cimam.org&lt;/ref&gt;''

Dibble''' (18 August 1909 – 30 November 2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n82-74252|text=Birth date}} Death date from U News Center (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; was an American academic, [[anthropologist]], [[linguist]], and scholar of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures. A former [[Distinguished Professor]] of Anthropology at the [[University of Utah]], Dibble retired in 1978 after an association with the university as lecturer and researcher spanning four decades.&lt;ref&gt;U News Center (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Post-retirement Dibble continued to conduct and publish research in his area of expertise, studies of [[Mesoamerican literature|Mesoamerican historical literature]] and the [[historiography]] of [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquest-era]] Mesoamerican cultures, in particular those of the [[Aztec]] and others of the [[Mexican altiplano|central Mexican ''altiplano'']]. Among many contributions to the field Dibble is perhaps most recognised for his collaboration with colleague [[Arthur J.O. Anderson]], producing the modern annotated translation into English of the volumes of the [[Florentine Codex]].

Born in [[Layton, Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;Lazar (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Dibble attended the University of Utah, obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history in 1936. Dibble traveled to [[Mexico]] in the year preceding his graduation, and his experiences there shaped the direction of his future career as a Mesoamericanist scholar. Dibble enrolled at the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM) in [[Mexico City]] for [[postgraduate]] studies, completing a [[Master's degree]] in anthropology in 1938. Upon receiving his MA Dibble gained a teaching position at his ''[[alma mater]]'' in Utah commencing in 1939, where he would be based for the remainder of his long academic career. At the same time he pursued his doctoral studies at UNAM, and was awarded his [[PhD]] from UNAM in 1942. Dibble also undertook a year's post-doctoral work at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], in 1943. In 1994, a [[festschrift]] entitled ''Chipping away on earth: studies in prehispanic and colonial Mexico in honor of Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles E. Dibble'' &lt;ref&gt;Eloise Quinones Keber, editor with the assistance of Susan Schroeder and Frederic Hicks, 1994: Lancaster CA, Labyrinthos.&lt;/ref&gt; was published.

'''Cliodynamics''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|l|iː|oʊ|d|aɪ|ˈ|n|æ|m|ɪ|k|s}}) is a transdisciplinary area of research integrating [[cultural evolution]], [[economic history]]/[[cliometrics]], [[macrosociology]], the mathematical modeling of historical processes during the ''[[longue durée]]'', and the construction and analysis of historical databases.{{sfn|Turchin|2008}} Cliodynamics treats history as science. Its practitioners develop theories that explain such dynamical processes as the rise and fall of empires, population booms and busts, spread and disappearance of religions.{{sfn|Sussan|2013}}{{sfn|Schrodt|2005}} These theories are translated into mathematical models. Finally, model predictions are tested against data. Thus, building and analyzing massive databases of historical and archaeological information is one of the most important goals of cliodynamics.{{sfn|Spinney|2012}}

==Etymology==
The word ''cliodynamics'' is composed of ''clio-'' and ''-dynamics''. In Greek mythology, [[Clio]] is the [[muse]] of history. [[Dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]], most broadly, is the study of how and why phenomena change with time.{{sfn|Parry|2013}}

==Origins==
The term was originally coined by [[Peter Turchin]] in 2003,{{sfn|Orf|2013}} and can be traced to the work of such figures as [[Ibn Khaldun]]{{sfn|Tainter|2004|p=488}} [[Alexandre Deulofeu]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Sergey Kapitsa]], [[Randall Collins]], [[John Komlos]], and [[Andrey Korotayev]].

==Mathematical modeling of historical dynamics==
Many historical processes are dynamic (a dynamic process is one that changes with time). [[Population]]s increase and decline, economies expand and contract, states grow and collapse. A very common approach, which has proved its worth in innumerable applications (particularly, but not exclusively, in the [[natural sciences]]), consists of taking a holistic phenomenon and splitting it up into separate parts that are assumed to interact with each other. This is the [[dynamical systems|dynamical systems approach]], because the whole phenomenon is represented as a [[system]] consisting of several elements (or [[subsystem]]s) that interact and change dynamically; that is, over time. In the dynamical systems approach, one sets out explicitly with mathematical formulae how different subsystems interact with each other. This mathematical description is the model of the system, and one can use a variety of methods to study the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] predicted by the model, as well as attempt to test the model by comparing its predictions with observed [[Empirical evidence|empirical]], dynamic evidence. Cliodynamics is the application of this same approach to the [[social sciences]] in general and to the study of historical dynamics in particular.

Cliodynamics practitioners apply [[mathematical model]]s to explain [[macrohistory|macrohistorical]] patterns – things like the rise of [[empire]]s, social discontent, [[civil war]]s, and [[Failed state|state collapse]].{{sfn|Spinney|2012}}{{sfn|Seabright|2004|p=806-7}}{{sfn|Keen|Owen|2017}} Although the focus is usually on the dynamics of large conglomerates of people, the approach of cliodynamics does not preclude the inclusion of human agency in its explanatory theories. Such questions can be explored with agent-based computer simulations.

==Databases and data sources==
Cliodynamics relies on large bodies of evidence to test competing theories on a wide range of historical processes. This typically involves building massive stores of evidence.{{sfn|Spinney|2016}} The rise of [[digital history]] and various research technologies have allowed huge databases to be constructed in recent years. Some prominent databases utilized by cliodynamics practitioners include the following:
* The [[Seshat (project)|Seshat: Global History Databank]], which systematically collects state-of-the-art accounts of the political and social organization of human groups and how societies have evolved through time into an authoritative [http://www.seshatdatabank.info ''databank''].{{sfn|Turchin|Brennan|Currie|Feeney|2015}} Seshat is affiliated also with the [[Evolution Institute]], a non-profit think-tank that "uses evolutionary science to solve real-world problems."
* [https://d-place.org/home ''D-PLACE'']: the Database of Places, Languages, Culture and Environment, which provides data on over 1,400 human social formations{{sfn|Kirby|Gray|Greenhill|Jordan|2016}}
* [http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/worldcul/Archaeo/ ''The Atlas of Cultural Evolution''], an archaeological database created by [[Peter N. Peregrine]]{{sfn|Peregrine|2003}}

==Research==
As of 2016, the main directions of academic study in cliodynamics are:
* The coevolutionary model of [[social complexity]] and warfare, based on the theoretical framework of Cultural [[Multilevel selection#Multilevel selection theory|Multilevel Selection]]{{sfn|Turchin|2003}}{{sfn|Turchin|2005}}{{sfn|Turchin|2009}}{{sfn|Turchin|2011}}{{sfn|Koyama|2016}}
* The study of revolutions and rebellions{{sfn|Goldstone|1991}}{{sfn|Turchin|2003}}{{sfn|Turchin|2005}}
* Structural-demographic theory and secular cycles{{sfn|Turchin|Nefedov|2009}}{{sfn|Korotayev|Malkov|Khaltourina|2006b}}{{sfn|Korotayev|Khaltourina|2006}}{{sfn|Greby|2016}}{{sfn|Zeigler|2010}}{{sfn|Graber|2008}}
* Explanations of the global distribution of languages benefitted from the empirical finding that the geographic area in which a language is spoken is more closely associated with the political complexity of the speakers than with all other variables under analysis.{{sfn|Currie|Mace|2009}}
* [[mathematical modeling]] of the long-term ("millennial") trends of [[World-systems theory|World-systems analysis]],{{sfn|Tsirel|2004}}{{sfn|Korotayev|Malkov|Khaltourina|2006a}}{{sfn|Korotayev|2006|p=44-62 etc.}}
* structural-demographic models of the [[Modern Age]] revolutions, including the Arab revolutions of 2011.{{sfn|Korotayev|Zinkina|2011}}
* The analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has been pioneered by,{{sfn|Dzogang|Lansdall-Welfare|FindMyPast Newspaper Team|Cristianini|2016}}{{sfn|Burkhart|2016}} which showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered in historical newspapers. A similar analysis was performed on social media, again revealing strongly periodic structures.{{sfn|Dzogang|Lansdall-Welfare|Cristianini|2016}}

There are several established venues of peer reviewed cliodynamics research: 
* ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution'']&lt;/ref&gt; 
** peer-reviewed web-based (open-access) journal that publishes on the transdisciplinary area of cliodynamics. It seeks to integrate historical models with data to facilitate theoretical progress.
** The first issue was published in December 2010. Cliodynamics is a member of Scopus and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).
* [[The University of Hertfordshire]]'s Cliodynamics Lab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herts.ac.uk/digital-history/cliodynamics-lab ''The University of Hertfordshire's Cliodynamics Lab'']&lt;/ref&gt;
** first lab in the world dedicated explicitly to the new research area of Cliodynamics. The Cliodynamics Lab is based at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] and is directed by Pieter François, who founded the Lab in 2015.
* [[Santa Fe Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santafe.edu/ Santa Fe Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; 
** private, not-for-profit research and education center where leading scientists grapple with some of the most compelling and complex problems of our time. The institute supports work in complex modeling of networks and dynamical systems. One of the areas of SFI research is Cliodynamics (see [http://www.santafe.edu/docviewer/?f=0f6edcb62e41&amp;g=eJx9zrEKwjAQxvE9T9EpOCVNB8Ghi4LUueAazuQqB5c0NBHp23sPoK7fjw/%2BBy5O3et7WYhxtAkjgX28mLFR9rA1Coxe3M7X29kPvRv8hWmNe4JMoRoh3ajJeaLa1m3voHZzIMwBdYb0da8B5NCb01EXeOLodIn/C8R/FQipMigwH1ywSE8%3D History as Science]).
** In the past the Institute has sponsored a series of conversations and meetings on theoretical history (see, for example, [http://escholarship.org/uc/search?entity=irows_cliodynamics;volume=2;issue=1 An Inquiry into History, Big History, and Metahistory]).

==Criticism==
Critics of the Cliodynamic approach often argue that the complex social formations of the past cannot and should not be reduced to quantifiable, analyzable 'data points', for doing so overlooks each historical society's peculiar circumstances and dynamics.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=309–310}}{{sfn|Lange|2012}}{{sfn|Tainter|2004|p=488–489}} Many historians and social scientists contend that there are no generalizable causal factors that can explain large numbers of cases, but that historical investigation should focus on the unique trajectories of each case, highlighting commonalities in outcomes where they exist. As Zhao notes, "most historians believe that the importance of any mechanisms in history changes, and more important, there is no time-invariant structure that can organize all the historical mechanisms into a system".{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=309–310}}{{sfn|Lange|2012}} Cliodynamicists, on the other hand, contend that there are large-scale, macrohistorical patterns that can explain the historical dynamics of the majority of known cases, and that these patterns can be uncovered through systematic, mathematical analysis. They argue that the ability of cliodynamics research to expose these patterns and to explain historical events demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.{{sfn|Turchin|2008}}

==Fiction==
[[Isaac Asimov]] employed a fictional version of this discipline, what he called [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], as a major [[plot device]] in his [[Foundation series|Foundation]] series of science fiction novels.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Klint. 2013. [https://www.wired.com/2013/04/cliodynamics-peter-turchin/ "Mathematicians Predict The Future With Data from the Past."] ''Wired''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sociocultural evolution|Cultural evolution]]
* [[Generations (book)|''Generations'' (book)]]
* [[Psychohistory (fictional)]] differs from cliodynamics in its attempt to connect individuals directly to societal dynamics. In contrast, cliodynamics analyses societies as groups of individuals nested within ever-larger groups, ultimately and indirectly comprising a society{{sfn|Turchin|2015}}

The '''Dachauer Straße''' is the longest street in [[Munich]] with a length of 11.2 km and is received its named since it is the connecting road to [[Dachau Palace]]. In the north of Munich, it is part of the ''Bundesstraße 304''.

== Route ==
The Dachauer Straße begins today as a [[Track (rail transport)|track]]-leading street of the [[Trams in Munich|tram lines]] 20 and 21 north of the Bahnhofplatz in the district of [[Maxvorstadt]]. Until 1877, the southern part of today's Dachauer Sraße to the height of Marsstraße&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gifex.com/fullsize2-en/2009-09-18-10062/Munich-in-1858.html | title=Munich in 1858 | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Gifex | language= | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was still part of the Schützenstraße. From Hirtenstraße, the Dachauer Straße then also serves for use by motor vehicle traffic, until Elisenstraße, as a one-lane [[One-way traffic]] and then carries on to the Stiglmaierplatz with two opposing lanes. From Stiglmaierplatz, the street picks up the multi-lane traffic coming from the south to Seidlstraße, where it mostly has two lanes through [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg]], to which it then crosses Leonrodplatz and leads to the height of the [[Olympiapark (Munich)|Olympic Park]] under the Landshuter Allee ([[Bundesstraße 2 R|Mittlerer Ring]]) through to the district of [[Moosach (Munich)|Moosach]]. There it crosses at the junction of Wintrich- with the Georg-Brauchle-Ring, at the intersection it once again like the Baubergerstraße and the [[Pelkovenstraße]], continues on with single lanes on both sides and a little further north in [[Feldmoching-Hasenbergl]] after a bend below the track of the [[DB Bahn|DB]] marshalling yard in a western direction, continues as a multi-lane road part of the national road 304. In this bend, the Max-Born-Straße from the East ends here and forms the further course of the national road 304. The Dachauer Straße then leads in a northwesterly direction over the railway tracks and the [[Bundesautobahn 99|A 99]] to the city or county boundary, where it continues in [[Karlsfeld]] under the name Münchner Straße. The northern route of the Dachauer Straße has been changed over time.&lt;ref name="Stadtplan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moesslang.net/muenchen-stadtplan.htm | title=Stadtplan München 1922 | author=Ulrich Mößlang | date= | website= | publisher=Mößlang | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the former village Moosach, the old Dachauer Straße ran, since the middle of the 12th century, on the route of the today's Darmstädter, Batzenhofer and Quedlinburger Straße and received there direct route starting in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kulturreferat.de/flash/kgp10/KGP10_booklet_3aufl.pdf | title=KulturGeschichtsPfad Moosach | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Landeshauptstadt München | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the construction of the marshalling yard Munich North between 1987 and 1991, the road was routed over the tracks again another 400m to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docplayer.org/4835382-Informationsbroschuere-feldmoching-hasenbergl.html | title=Informationsbroschüre Feldmoching-Hasenbergl | author=Christian Ude | date= | website=docplayer.org/ | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As of 1448, [[Horse racing|horse races]] were held every year during the Jakobidult on the route from [[Karlstor|Neuhauser Tor]] to Feldmoching, which is why the route was known until 1878 as "Rennweg".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Regnet | first=C.A. | date=1879 | title=München in guter alter Zeit | language=German | location=München | publisher=Hugendubel Heinrich GmbH | page=119 | isbn=3880342520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, around 1660, the part of the street close to the city bore the name Mosserstraße, derived from "Mossach", since it led from Munich to Moosach.

The structural development of the area more remote from the old town began with the construction of several [[List of barracks in Munich|barracks]] of the [[Bavarian Army]] with its associated infrastructure. Therefore, the then rural environment of Neuhausen was redesigned from the mid-19th century, which brought the district south of the practice area Oberwiesenfeld and north of the parade grounds [[Marsfeld (Munich)|Marsfeld]] the name "barracks district" and significantly accelerated the structural change Neuhausens. From 1866, extensive workshops of the royal armory were built along the Dachauer Straße; at times, more than 1,000 workers were employed there. The last still existent military-related institution is the ''Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München'' (Army Administrative Center Munich). It is located on the site of the former ''[[Eisenbahnkaserne]]'' (railway barracks) number 128.

In 1869, Adele Spitzeder founded her private bank in Dachauer Straße, which became known as ''Dachauer Banken''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zeno.org/Brockhaus-1911/A/Dachauer+Banken | title=Dachauer Banken | author= | date= | website=zeno.org | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 1876, the first Munich [[Horsecar|horse tram]] passed on its route from Promenadeplatz to Nymphenburger Straße/Burgfriedensgrenze ([[Maillingerstraße]]) the Dachauer Straße between Bahnhofplatz and Stiglmaierplatz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mvg.de/ueber/das-unternehmen/zeitreise.html | title=Zeitreise Die Geschichte der MVG | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the [[Westfriedhof (Munich)|west bordering cemetery]] was built. In 1900 the tram route from 1876 was made electric.&lt;ref name="Straßenbahn"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schattenhofer | first=Michael | date= | title=100 Jahre Münchener Straßenbahn | language=German | location= | publisher=Schattenhofer | page= | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the western side opposite the ''Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München'' (Army Administrative Center Munich), the Association for the Improvement of Housing in Munich built a small residential complex in the Ebenau district even before the [[World War I|First World War]], which was used as one of the early examples of [[Subsidized housing|non-profit housing]] construction in Munich. In 1905, the current Heinz Naumann House (number 25) was built by Michael Reifenstuel, which then served as a posthospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927024753/http://www.zdi-ingenieure.de/stiftung.htm | title=Heinz-Naumann-Haus: Studentenwohnheim Dachauer Straße 25 München | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Heinz-Naumann-Stiftung | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the former gas works on the Thalkirchner road and the Kirchstein (now Vogelweideplatz) could not keep up with the growing gas demand of the city, the construction of the gas works Moosach, now number 148, began in 1906. On 25 July 1909, the new tram connection from Stiglmaier to Leonrodplatz was first used. In the restaurant "Zum Deutschen Reich", located on Dachauer Straße, the [[German Workers' Party]] organized meetings in 1919 and 1920, with [[Adolf Hitler]] as speaker. Between 1924 and 1929, the Borstei was built north of the Middle Ring. In 1928, depot 5 for trams was completed in the Dachauer Straße 104, which was put back into service in 1949 after the damages from the war were repaired and then shut down in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tram.org/fmtm/bahnhof3/story.html | title=Das Depot an der Westendstraße | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Freunde des Münchner Trambahnmuseums | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Straßenbahn" /&gt; After request of the realm [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|aviation ministry]] from 1936, development too place on the current factory premises of [[MTU Aero Engines]] (Dachauer Straße 665) and [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN]] commercial vehicles (Dachauer Straße 667) another [[BMW]] factory,&lt;ref name="Weg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acting-art-of-memory.de/phpXplorer/homes/hans/videopodcast.php?link=1995%20Weg%20nach%20Dachau | title=Weg nach Dachau | author=Wolfram P.

The ordered demolition of the plant was prevented by the factory management. After the war, the plant had to be shut down for half a year because of the damages caused by the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822151543/http://www.swm.de/de/unternehmen/swm-profil/historie/historie-gas.html | title=Geschichte der städtischen Gasversorgung Münchens | author= | date=2006 | website= | publisher=Stadtwerke München | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion of the gas supply to Roherd gas took place on 10 November 1975, the plant was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wochenanzeiger.de/article/126448.html | title=Stadtgas durch Erdgas in den 1960er-Jahren ersetzt | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Münchner Wochenanzeiger | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, sections of the tram tracks in Dachauer Straße were renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tramgeschichten.de/2009/11/04/sanierung-leonrodplatz-und-stiglmaierplatz/ | title=Sanierung: Leonrodplatz und Stiglmaierplatz | author= | date=4 November 2008 | website= | publisher=Tramgeschichten | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The that poststall of the city was also located on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mbiallas.net/PhilaOrdner/bildpostkarten.html | title=Bildpostkarten | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Manfred Biallas | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former post office on Dachauer Straße was built by Franz Holzhammer. In addition, Dachauer Straße 90 is home to the Municipal [[Health Department]] and the [[Blood donation|blood doner]] service of the ''Städtische Klinikum München GmbH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.blutspendedienst.com/ | title=Blutspende | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Blutspendedienst des Bayerischen Roten Kreuzes | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the former buildings of the police driving school, the department city center of the [[Munich Fire Department]] is temporarily accommodated there for some years.

== Educational institutions ==
In 1951, an elementary school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Göttler | first=Norbert | date=2008 | title=Nach der "" | language=German | location=München | publisher=Herbert Utz Verlag | page= | isbn=9783831608034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was built on the Dachauer Straße for the children of the Ludwigsfelder camp, and in 1963, at number 98, a primary school was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gsdachauer.musin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=42 | title=Schule | author= | date=2018 | website= | publisher=Grundschule an der Dachauer Straße 98 | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Munich Educational Plant is located at Dachauer Straße 5 and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Vehicle Technology and Aircraft Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Munich at Dachauer Straße 98b.

== Culture ==
In the area of gastronomy, located next to the ''Löwenbräukeller'' at the intersecting Stiglmaierplatz is one of the oldest guest houses in Munich called "Alter Wirt" in Moosach, which was first documented in 1442 as a ''Täfernhaus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biergartenverzeichnis.de/alter-wirt-moosach.html | title=Alter Wirt Moosach | author= | date=8 December 2010 | website= | publisher=Biergartenverzeichnis | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Carl Gabriel had the first ''Lichtspielhaus'' ([[Movie theater]]) in Munich built on Dachauer Straße under the name "The American Bio.-Cie.", which still exists today after several renovations under the name of [[Gabriel Filmtheater]]. Even after the First World War, the Apollo Theater (house numbers 19/21) is  located opposite the confluence of Augustenstraße.&lt;ref name="Stadtplan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digipress-beta.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/calendar/1904-09-07.2143735-X/bsb00007701_00568.html | title=Münchener Ratsch-Kathl | author= | date=8 October 1904 | website= | publisher=Münchener Lokal-Anzeiger | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor [[Karl Valentin]] performed on stage at the ''"Baderwirt"'' under the name ''"Skeleton Giggerl"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.karl-valentin.de/leben/biographie.htm | title=Volkssänger, Alleinunterhalter oder lieber doch was Solides? | author= | date= | website=karl-valentin.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, the [[Münchner Theater für Kinder|Munich Theater for children]], which was previously housed on the [[Leopoldstraße]], is located in the building of the former ''Regina-Lichtspielhauses''&lt;ref name="Weg" /&gt; at Dachauer Straße 46 and in 1982, the Pathos Transport Theater was founded on Dachauer Straße 110 d. In the 1980s, parts of the abandoned military properties in Dachauer Straße 128, which now houses a housing estate and the headquarters of the ''Goethe-Institut'', were used for theater and event purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210031419/http://www.tanztendenz.de/5geschi.htm | title=Geschichte | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Tanztendenz | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210031419/http://www.tanztendenz.de/5geschi.htm | archive-date=10 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the artillery workshops were before the Second World War,&lt;ref name="Stadtplan" /&gt; was until the renovations were completed on the main building, a theater of the [[Munich Kammerspiele]] in a converted industrial hall of ''[[Stadtwerke München]]'' which was classified as a demolition object and only provisionally kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ris-muenchen.de/RII/RII/DOK/SITZUNGSVORLAGE/1167616.pdf | title=Nachfolgelösung für die Hallen an der Dachauer Str. 114 | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Kulturreferat | language=German | accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the spring of 2003 until the beginning of 2010, the event technology of the cultural department and the rooms of the Academy of Fine Arts were housed in the same property on Dachauer Straße 114. There today is the ''Schwere Reiter Theater''.

== Trivia ==
* During the time of National Socialism, Karl Valentin asked the ironic question of what was probably the longest street and answered it with "The Dachauer Straße, of course, since many go out and hardly anyone comes back - from the concentration camp".
[[File:Straßenschild Dachauer Straße Frakturschrift.jpg|250px|right]]
* At the corner of Lampadiusstraße is still an original street sign with the name written in [[Fraktur|German type]].

'''David Baldwin''' ( b. 22 December 1946 (?) d. 4 April 2016) was a British historian, author and former [[university lecturer]], who lived near [[Leicester]], England.&lt;ref name=Hood/&gt;

Baldwin specialised in late Medieval history—"the great medieval families of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]"—and wrote several books about the people and events of the [[Wars of the Roses]].&lt;ref name=ab/&gt; Before retiring from teaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='What was Richard III really like?' – A new study of the last Plantagenet king|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2012/september/what-was-richard-iii-really-like-2019-a-new-study-of-the-last-plantagenet-king|accessdate=18 August 2013|author=University of Leicester|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin had previously worked as a lecturer at both the [[University of Leicester]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite web|title=David Baldwin|url=http://amberleybooks.com/shop/article_9781445601823/Richard-III%3CBR%3E%3CI%3EDavid-Baldwin%3C_I%3E.html?pse=apq|accessdate=18 August 2013|author=Amberley Publishing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085513/http://amberleybooks.com/shop/article_9781445601823/Richard-III%3CBR%3E%3CI%3EDavid-Baldwin%3C_I%3E.html?pse=apq|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, over 25 years before the 2012 excavation and the discovery of the king's body, he predicted that [[Exhumation of Richard III of England|Richard III's remains]] would be found at [[Greyfriars, Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New study from historian who 'predicted' whereabouts of the remains of King Richard III|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/september/30-year-old-predictions-may-be-confirmed|accessdate=18 August 2013|author=University of Leicester|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leicester historian who predicted discovery of Richard III site in book launch|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2013/april/leicester-historian-who-discovered-richard-iii-site-in-book-launch|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Discovery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2013/february/university-of-leicester-announces-discovery-of-king-richard-iii|title=University of Leicester announces discovery of King Richard III|publisher=University of Leicester|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-21063882|title=Richard III dig: DNA confirms bones are king's|publisher=BBC|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burns|first=John F|title=Bones Under Parking Lot Belonged to Richard III|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/europe/richard-the-third-bones.html|accessdate=6 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/FINAL-RESTING-PLACE-KING/story-16893072-detail/story.html|title=Richard III dig: Eyes of world on Leicester as Greyfriars skeleton find revealed|work=[[Leicester Mercury]]|date=13 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208172828/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/FINAL-RESTING-PLACE-KING/story-16893072-detail/story.html|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2010 book, ''Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked'', Baldwin argued  that the 'real' Robin Hood was Roger Godberd, a disinherited supporter of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]].&lt;ref name=Hood&gt;{{cite news|last=PARSONS|first=CHRIS|title=Is this the grave of Robin Hood?

In his 2007 book, ''The Lost Prince: The Survival of Richard of York'', Baldwin discussed the possibility that the younger of the [[Princes in the Tower]], [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Prince Richard]], survived, and was the "[[Richard Plantagenet (Richard of Eastwell)|Richard Plantagenet]]" who died in December 1550 at Eastwell in Kent. Richard had worked as a bricklayer at [[St. John's Abbey, Colchester]], until 1539, but, unusually for someone of his class, could read Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happened to the Princes in the Tower?|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2007/05/nparticle.2007-05-25.html|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes said to have been an illegitimate son of King [[Richard III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/people_and_places/religion_and_ethics/newsid_8949000/8949935.stm BBC Kent: "Richard Plantagenet: Illegitimate heir's tomb in Kent?" 27 August 2010].

A '''docket''' in the United States is the official summary of proceedings in a [[Court|court of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sutton |first=John R. |title=The Juvenile Court and Social Welfare: Dynamics of Progressive Reform |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |year=1985 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=107–146 |jstor=3053396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camdic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/docket|title=docket Meaning, definition in Cambridge English Dictionary|work=cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United Kingdom in modern times it is an official document relating to delivery of something,&lt;ref name=camdic/&gt; with similar meanings to these two elsewhere. In the late nineteenth century the term referred to a large folio book in which [[court clerk|clerk]]s recorded all [[Filing (legal)|filings]] and [[Legal procedure|court proceedings]] for each case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American and English encyclopedia of law |publisher=Edward Thompson company |editor1-last=Cockcroft |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Garland |editor2-first=David Shephard |editor3-last=McGehee |editor3-first=Lucius Polk |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Porterfield |editor4-first=Charles |volume=9 |year=1896–1905 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdgUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA875&amp;lpg=PA875&amp;dq=court+%22a+docket+is%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=2nd |oclc=21556933}}&lt;/ref&gt; although use has been documented  since 1485.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?oe=UTF-8&amp;id=nm5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=docket#v=snippet&amp;q=docket&amp;f=false 1641 Les Termes de la Ley; or certaine difficult and obscure words and termes of the common lawes of this realme expounded]: Docket is a little peece of paper or parchment written, that conteineth in it the effect of a greater writing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical usage==
The term originated in England; it was recorded in the form "doggette" in 1485, and later also as doket, dogget(t), docquett, docquet, and docket.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The derivation and original sense are obscure, although it has been suggested that it derives from the verb "to dock", in the sense of cutting short (e.g. the tail of a dog or horse);&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. Definition of "... brief, summarized statement ... abstract, abridgement, digest, minute" described as obsolete and historical. "A memorandum or register of legal judgements". "A list of causes for trial" given as U.S. usage&lt;/ref&gt; a long document summarised has been ''docked'', or ''docket'' using old spelling. It was long used in England for legal purposes (there was an official called the Clerk of the Dockets in the early nineteenth century), although discontinued in modern [[English law|English legal usage]].

''Docket'' was described in ''The American and English Encyclopedia of Law'' as a courts summary, digest, or register.  A usage note in this 1893 text warns that term docket and calendar are not synonymous.&lt;ref name="AECL"&gt;{{cite book |title=The American and English encyclopedia of law |first=Charles |last=Williams |publisher=Edward Thompson Company |year=1893 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdgUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA875&amp;dq=terminology+docket#v=snippet&amp;q=docket&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1910 law dictionary states the terms ''trial docket'' and ''calendar'' are synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A LAW DICTIONARY CONTAINING DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS AND PHRASES OF AMERICAN AND ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE ANCIENT AND MODERN  |year=1910 |publisher=West Publishing |last=Black |first=Henry Campbell |quote=The name of docket or trial docket sometimes given to the list or calendar causes set to be tried at a specified term prepared by the clerks for the use of the and bar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2c8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=terminology+docket#v=onepage&amp;q=docket&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, court dockets are considered to be [[public records]], and many public records databases and directories include references to court dockets.   Rules of [[civil procedure]] often state that the court clerk shall [[Document|record]] certain information "on the docket" when a specific event occurs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Federal Courts use the [[PACER (law)|PACER (Public Access Court Electronic Records)]] system to house dockets and documents on all federal civil, criminal and bankruptcy cases, available to the public for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts | title = Electronic Public Access Fee Schedule | work = USCourts.gov | accessdate = 2013-08-11 | date = 2013-04-01 | url = http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Fees/ElectronicPublicAccessFeeSchedule.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used informally to refer to a '''court [[calendar]],''' the schedule of the appearances, arguments and/or hearings scheduled for a court.  It may also be used as a [[metonym]] to refer to a court's caseload as a whole.  Thus, either sense may be intended (depending upon the context) in the frequent use of the phrase "crowded dockets" by legal journalists and commentators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Supreme Court===
In its meaning as ''calendar'', the docket of the [[United States Supreme Court]] is different both in its composition and significance.  The justices of the Supreme Court have almost complete discretion over the cases they choose to hear.  From the large number of cases which it receives, only 70 to 100 will be placed on the docket.  The [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] decides which cases to present on behalf of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to U.S. Government and Politics |first=Franco |last=Scardino |publisher=Alpha |isbn=978-1-59257-853-5 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Sri Lanka}}

The '''Pre Anuradhapura period''' or the '''Early kingdoms period''' of [[Sri Lanka]]n [[History of Sri Lanka|history]] begins with the gradual onset of historical records in the final centuries of the [[Prehistory of Sri Lanka|prehistoric period]] and ending in 377 BC. According to the [[Mahavamsa]], the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are the [[Yakshas]] and northern [[Naga people (Lanka)|Naga]] tribes. [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] history traditionally starts in 543 BC at the arrival of [[Prince Vijaya]], a semi-legendary king who was banished from the Indian subcontinent with his 700 followers, and is recorded in the [[Mahavamsa]] chronicle. This period was succeeded by the [[Anuradhapura period]].

==Background==
{{Main|Prehistory of Sri Lanka}}

According to [[folklore]], the [[Naga people (Lanka)|Naga]] people were one of the groups of original inhabitants of Lanka. They were said to have ruled [[Nagadeepa]], or [[Jaffna Peninsula]] and [[Kelaniya]]. Naga people were snake-worshipers. The word Naga was sometimes written in early inscriptions as [[Nair|Nāya]], as in Nāganika&amp;nbsp;– this occurs in the Nanaghat inscription of 150 BC. Until the third century BC they appear as a distinct group in the early Sri Lankan chronices as well as the early Tamil literary works.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John (2011), The Sri Lanka Reader: History, Culture, Politics, Duke University Press, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In the third century BC they started to assimilate to Tamil language and culture, and lost their separate identity.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John (2011), The Sri Lanka Reader: History, Culture, Politics, Duke University Press, p. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political History==
===Tambapanni era===
{{Main|Prince Vijaya|Kingdom of Tambapanni}}

The Kingdom of Tambapanni existed from 543 BC to 505 BC. According to ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the legendary [[Prince Vijaya]] and seven hundreds of his followers came to Sri Lanka after being expelled from [[Sinhapura]] in India. Vijaya is said to have landed on the island on the day of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s death, and after reaching the heaven, the Buddha asked the deities to protect him so that he could spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Prince Vijaya established the [[Kingdom of Tambapanni]]. He married a local [[Yaksha|Yakkhini]] named [[Kuveni]], and their children gave rise to the Pulinda race (identified with the [[Vedda people]]). Vijaya also married a princess of the Pandu kingdom (identified with [[Pandyan kingdom]]), but did not have any children with her. His followers also married maidens sent by the Pandu king, and their descendants gave rise to the Sinhalese race.&lt;ref name="JMS_1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=John M. Senaveratna |title=The story of the Sinhalese from the most ancient times up to the end of "the Mahavansa" or Great dynasty |publisher=Asian Educational Services |date=1997 |pages=7–22 |isbn=978-81-206-1271-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9TeEcMi0e0C&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;pg=PA7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MCR_1984"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=k9DpMY206bMC&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;pg=PA51 |title=Ancient Jaffna |author=Mudaliyar C. Rasanayagam |publisher=Asian Educational Services |year=1984 |isbn=9788120602106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upatissa Nuwara era===
{{Main|Kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara}}

The Kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara existed from 505 to 377 BC when the ruling monarch, [[Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura|Pandukabhaya]] moved the administration to [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura]]. Pandukabhaya was the last monarch of Upatissa Nuwara and the first of Anuradhapura.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Dipavamsa|Mahavamsa|Culavamsa}}

The [[Pali]] chronicles, the [[Dipavamsa]], [[Mahavamsa]], [[Thupavamsa]]&lt;ref name="maha"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070701074732/http://www.lakdiva.org/culavamsa/vol_0.html Geiger-Bode translation of the Mahavamsa]. lakdiva.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Culavamsa]] as well as a large collection of stone inscriptions,&lt;ref name="sila"&gt;[[Paranavithana]] Epigraphics Zeylanica&lt;/ref&gt; the Indian Epigraphical records, the Burmese versions of the chronicles etc., provide an exceptional record for the history of Sri Lanka from about the sixth century BC.

The Mahavamsa, written around 400 AD, using the Dipavamsa, the Attakatha and other written sources available, it correlates well with Indian histories of the period. Emperor [[Asoka]]'s reign is recorded in the Mahavamsa. The Mahavamsa account of the period prior to Asoka's coronation, (218 years after the Buddha's death) seems to be part legend. The account of the Mahavamsa, a Pali text written largely from the Sinhalese perspective, has mythological beginnings but becomes historical from the third century BC, with the arrival of Buddhism under [[Devanampiya Tissa of Sri Lanka]]. Epigraphic sources also appear with the presence of Buddhism, from about the third century BC. The earliest historiographic litearature, such as the Mahavamsa, dates to the sixth century AD. The entire ancient period of history written in the Mahavamsa, is dominated by the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]].  The medieval period in Sri Lanka is taken to begin with the fall of the Anuradhapura Kingdom in AD 1017.

===Legacy===
Within Sri Lanka, the legend of Vijaya is often treated as a factual account of a historical event. However, multiple scholars consider the legend of dubious historicity. [[Satchi Ponnambalam]] called it a "pure flight of fantasy".&lt;ref name="Bruce_2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eww8QyTSxQ8C&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA35 |editor=[[Bruce Kapferer]] |title=Legends of People, Myths of State. Violence, Intolerance, and Political Culture in Sri Lanka and Australia |publisher=Berghahn |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-85745-436-2 |pages=34–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gavin Thomas, the narration of historical events in ''Mahavamsa'' and its continuation ''[[Culavamsa]]'' is "at best questionably-biased, and at worst totally imaginary", aimed at establishing the royal lineage of the Sinhalese and the Buddhist credentials of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fbwsZCO1gUC&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;pg=PA415 |title=The Rough Guide to Sri Lanka |author=Gavin Thomas |page=415 |publisher=Penguin |year=2009 |isbn=9781405385169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to H.W. Codrington, Vijaya is probably a composite character, and the legend is aimed at connecting the early history of Sri Lanka with that of Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap01.html |title=A short history of Lanka |chapter=The beginnings; and the Conversion to Buddhism |author=Humphry William Codrington |publisher=Macmillan |year=1926 |accessdate=20 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Vijaya]] produced four monarchs and two regents who ruled during this period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10271">'''Eugene Shallcross Ferguson''' (1916 – 21 March 2004) was an American [[engineer]], [[History of technology|historian of technology]] and  professor of history at the [[University of Delaware]], particularly known for his 1992 work ''[[Engineering and the Mind's Eye]].''

== Biography ==
Ferguson was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and raised in [[Ridley Park, Pennsylvania]]. He obtained his BS in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in 1937. A part of the curriculum consisted of regular tours to the plants of heavy industry in the region.&lt;ref name="DAH 2004"&gt;[[David A. Hounshell]] 2004. Eugene S. Ferguson, 1916–2004. ''Technology and Culture'' 45 (October 2004):911-921.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he obtained MS in mechanical engineering at [[Iowa State College]],&lt;ref name="DEG 2014"&gt;"Engineering and the Mind’s Eye Eugene S. Ferguson", Review by David E. Goldberg. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, online 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with the thesis entitled "Development of the Engineering Profession in America, 1815–1900."

After graduation Ferguson started working in [[production planning]] at [[Western Electric Company]] in Baltimore. He was also refinery operator at Gulf Refining in Philadelphia shortly before in 1938 starting as construction and maintenance engineer at [[DuPont]]. Here he worked in chemical plants that were highly explosive.&lt;ref name="DEG 2014"/&gt; He later recalled that it was more or less his job "to map where projectiles, including body parts, landed following accidental explosions at the plants so as to understand better what had happened and how to improve both processes and equipment."&lt;ref name="DAH 2004"/&gt; At DuPont he became head of the department, and continued working in numerous plants in the region of Pittsburgh.

From 1942 to 1946 Ferguson served as ordnance officer in the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the South Pacific, and back in the States at the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] in North Charleston, South Carolina. In 1945 he encountered naval commander [[Robert W. Copeland]], who lectured Ferguson in naval history and inspired him to turn to the history of technology. Later hospitalized in a navy hospital, he studied American naval biographies. Here he got the idea to write the first biography on [[Thomas Truxton]], commander of a number of famous US naval ships including {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}} and {{USS|President|1800|6}}, later in 1956 published as ''Truxtun of the Constellation: The Life of Commodore Thomas Truxtun, U.S. Navy, 1755–1822.''&lt;ref name="DAH 2004"/&gt;

After the war in 1946 Ferguson started his academic career as assistant professor at the [[Iowa State College]], teaching mechanical engineering. In between he worked in industry one last time as plant engineer for the Foote Mineral Company in [[Exton, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="DEG 2014"/&gt; He returned to the Iowa State College, where in 1969 he was promoted to associate professor. In those years he was inspired by the Iowa State historian of agriculture [[Earle Dudley Ross]] (1885–1973) and Harvard's first professor of oceanic history [[Robert G. Albion]], to specialize in the history of science.&lt;ref name="DAH 2004"/&gt;  From 1969 to his retirement in 1979 Ferguson was professor of history at the [[University of Delaware]]. In Delaware he was also curator of technology at the [[Hagley Museum and Library]].

Ferguson was a founding member of the [[Society for the History of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://shot.press.jhu.edu/ Society for the History of Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421035505/http://shot.press.jhu.edu/ |date=2006-04-21 }} at shot.press.jhu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; and its eleventh president (1977–78). The Society recognized Ferguson's contribution by creating "The Eugene S. Ferguson Prize for Outstanding Reference Work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://shot.press.jhu.edu/Awards/ferguson.htm The Eugene S. Ferguson Prize for Outstanding Reference Work] at shot.press.jhu.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977 Ferguson himself was awarded the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]], the highest award of the Society for the History of Technology.

== Work ==
Ferguson wrote three major works on the history of technology, starting with "Kinematics of Mechanisms from the Time of Watt" in 1962, and further "Bibliography of the History of Technology." in 1968, and "Engineering and the Mind's Eye" in 1994. He also contributed to the [[Propædia]], the first of three parts of the 15th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.

=== ''The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology'', 1977 ===
Ferguson's 1977 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', entitled "The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology", is credited for clarifying the role of [[visual reasoning]] in the thinking process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard S. Becker]] ''Telling About Society.'' 2007. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In this article he reasoned that "Thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development."&lt;ref name="ESF 1977"&gt;Ferguson, Eugene S. "[http://cgt101.tech.purdue.edu/info/art01_Ferguson_1977.pdf The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318155344/http://cgt101.tech.purdue.edu/info/art01_Ferguson_1977.pdf |date=2014-03-18 }}." ''Science'' 197.4306 (1977): 827&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes his article with the following statement:
:''Much of the creative thought of the designers of our technological world is nonverbal, not easily reducible to words; its language is an object or a picture or a visual image in the mind. It is out of this kind of thinking that the clock, printing press, and snowmobile have arisen. Technologists, converting their nonverbal knowledge into objects directly (as when an artisan fashioned an American ax) or into drawings that have enabled others to build what was in their minds, have chosen the shape and many of the qualities of our man-made surroundings. This intellectual component of technology, which is non-literary and non-scientific, has been generally unnoticed because its origins lie in art and not in science.&lt;br&gt;As the scientific component of knowledge in technology has increased markedly in the 19th and 20th centuries, the tendency has been to lose sight of the crucial part played by nonverbal knowledge in making the "big" decisions of form, arrangement, and texture, that determine the parameters within which a system will operate.''&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Eugene S. (1977, p. 835); Cited in: Becker (2007, p. 167-8)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work claims Ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts. There is ample evidence that visual methods, particularly drawing, play a central role in creating artefacts.

=== ''Engineering and the mind's eye'' 1992 ===
Ferguson later expanded its themes into his 1992 book, ''[[Engineering and the mind's eye]]''. This work wanted to demonstrate that "engineering is as much a matter of intuition and nonverbal thinking as of equations and computation."&lt;ref name="ESF 1992"&gt;Eugene S. Ferguson. ''Engineering and the Mind's Eye.'' MIT press, 1994. Text Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; It also argued that, the "system of engineering education that ignores nonverbal thinking will produce engineers who are dangerously ignorant of the many ways in which the real world differs from the mathematical models constructed in academic minds."&lt;ref name="ESF 1992"/&gt;

One of the chapters is devoted to the tools of [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualisation]], and traces back their origin to the [[Renaissance]]. The inventions of [[printing]], [[linear perspective]] and [[projective geometry]] significantly enhanced man's ability to convey vision into precise drawings, and exactly duplicate it by printing. These images, as [[William Ivins, Jr.]] (1953) had argued, were more than just artistic impression. According to Ivins, the "importance of being able exactly to repeat pictorial statements is undoubtedly greater for science, technology, and general information than it is for art."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Ivins, Jr.]] (1953) '' Prints and Visual Communications.'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays modern projects, Ferguson argued, can require up to thousands of different drawings and charts. For example, in the production of the British VC-10 airplane over 50.000 production drawings were used. Working with the various contractors and suppliers is unthinkable, without the exact duplication.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson (1992, p. 76)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franz Daxecker''' (born May 24, 1945 in [[Munderfing]]) is an Austrian [[ophthalmologist]] and a [[historian of science]].

== Biography ==
Franz Daxecker was a [[typographer]] from 1959 to 1965. He attended the Bundesaufbau-Gymnasium in [[Horn, Austria|Horn]] from 1965 to 1970. He studied at the [[University of Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], and received his doctorate in 1975. In 1985. he was habilitated and in 1993 appointed as the associate professor. He is the deputy director of the Department of Ophthalmology  and Optometry at the [[Innsbruck Medical University]] since 1984, and was director between 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/databasecontent?dbf_0=kdgo-fulltext&amp;dbid=kdgo&amp;dbq_0=Daxecker%2C+Franz&amp;dbsource=%2Fdb%2Fkdgo&amp;dbt_0=fulltext&amp;o_0=AND&amp;sort=person-name-sort Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrtenkalender, vol. 1, 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;580]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ophthalmological publications with reference to the [[refraction]] (spectacle  determination) with the laser, the calculation of [[intraocular lens]], the influence of [[ultraviolet]] to the eye as well as the treatment of [[eye neoplasm]].

Daxecker published extensively about the astronomer [[Christoph Scheiner]] but also [[Oswald von Wolkenstein]], [[Christoph Grienberger]], [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], [[Felice Fontana]], [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], [[Ludwig Mauthner]], [[Richard Seefelder]], Kaspar Pischel, [[Friedrich von Herrenschwand]], [[Burghard Breitner]] and Herbert Schober. Other documents relating to [[spectacles]] representations of the Middle Ages, the history of [[Innsbruck Medical University]],  and [[medicinal plant]]s in the Middle Ages in ophthalmology. He also wrote contributions to encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche, vol. 9, Sp. 120-121 (2000): Christoph Scheiner. ''[[Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche]]''

'''Gerhard Besier''' (born 30 November 1947, in [[Wiesbaden]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[theology|theologian]], [[historian]] and [[politician]] best known for his work on church-state relations in the [[Third Reich]] and in the [[German Democratic Republic]].

==Work==
Besier's publications have focused on church history, including church history during the [[Third Reich]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2079046_ITM Putting old wine into new bottles: the East German Protestant Church's desire to reform state socialism, 1989-90], ''Journal of Church and State'', 22 Sep 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and [[religious freedom]] issues in contemporary society. His views on religious freedom follow the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] American model, a stance which has made him controversial in Germany.&lt;ref name=taz&gt;Staff (2009-06-16).

Besier taught historical theology at [[Heidelberg University]] from 1992 to 2003. From 2003 to 2008, he was the director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research on Totalitarianism at [[Technische Universität Dresden|Dresden University]]; his contract was not renewed following widespread criticism in Germany of his liberal views on [[Scientology]].&lt;ref name=taz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franziska Augstein: ''Die neueste Entlassung.

Formerly considered close to the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] party, Besier joined the left-wing ''[[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]]'' party in April 2009, and was nominated for a safe ''[[Landtag]]'' seat in [[Saxony]].&lt;ref name=taz /&gt; He holds three doctorates, including an honorary doctorate from [[Lund University]] in recognition of his services to religious freedom.&lt;ref name=taz /&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''History of the Second World War''''' is the [[official history]] of the British contribution to the [[Second World War]] and was published by [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO). The immense project was sub-divided into areas to ease publication, ''United Kingdom Military Series'', the ''United Kingdom Civil Series'' for the civilian war effort; the ''Foreign Policy series'', the ''Intelligence series'' and the ''Medical series'' are eponymous. Other volumes not under the aegis of the series but published by HMSO may be read as adjuncts, covering matters not considered in great detail or at all, in one case, in the main series. Further volumes, published after the [[privatisation]] of HMSO or in the series about the [[Special Operations Executive]], are also useful.

The volumes were intended to be read individually, rather than in series, which led to some overlapping but in their introductions to their parts of the series, Sir [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Keith Hancock]] and Sir [[James Ramsay Montagu Butler|James Butler]] wrote that this was to obviate a need to read more volumes than cover the part of the war effort being studied; Hancock edited the Civil Series and Butler the Military Series. The first volume appeared in 1949 and the last in 1993, with a revised edition of one volume appearing in 2004. An unorthodox decision was to cover the conflict from a [[theatre of operations]] point of view rather than by service, to acknowledge that military operations were intimately linked.

The works published before 1970 lack references to unpublished sources until government archives were opened to an extent by the [[Public Records Act 1958]] and the [[Public Records Act 1967]]. The works were published with only references to published sources because British constitutional conventions on the anonymity of government officials and ministers were followed, leading to a somewhat detached narrative style in some cases. A ''parallel series'' of volumes for official use were printed, which referenced the unpublished sources in manuscript, in red ink. A few official copies ''escaped'' into public libraries and these additions can be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9256">'''Homosexuality in ancient Egypt''' is a passionately disputed subject within [[Egyptology]]: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the ancient Egyptians' society fostered about [[homosexuality]]. Only a handful of direct hints still survive and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.

== Depictions of possible homosexuality ==
[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep embrace.jpg|thumb|Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing.]]

===Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep===
The best known case of possible homosexuality in ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials [[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum|Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep]]. Both men lived and served under [[pharaoh]] [[Niuserre]] during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]] (c. 2494&amp;ndash;2345 BC).&lt;ref name=RPH&gt;Richard Parkinson: ''Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature''. In: ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA)'', vol. 81, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same [[mastaba]] tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the [[Eskimo kissing|nose-on-nose touching]] normally represented a kiss.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101020071548/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/africa/niankhkhnum_and_khnumhotep.html Dena Connors-Millard: ''Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.?''] (English).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were [[twin]]s, even possibly [[conjoined twins]]. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

===King Pepi II and his general officer Sasenet===
{{See also|King Neferkare and General Sasenet}}
A well known story, dating back to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], tells about an anonymous citizen, who comes to the audience hall of king [[Pepi II]] (here named by his birth name, ''Neferkarê''). The citizen wants to lament about an unnamed circumstance, but the king does not want to listen to the laments, so he orders his royal musicians to drown the stranger's speech with noise. Disappointed, the stranger leaves the palace. When this happens several times, he orders his friend, the high official ''Tjeti'', to follow the king. The king in turn is frequently leaving the palace during the night. Tjeti finds out that king Pepi II keeps visiting his loyal general officer ''Sasenet'' for several hours, then returning home.&lt;ref name=EBT&gt;Emma Brunner-Traut: ''Altägyptische Märchen. Mythen und andere volkstümliche Erzählungen''. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, {{ISBN|3-424-01011-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter in which king Pepi II visits his loyal general officer is subject of passionate discussions. Especially one certain phrase stays in the centre of investigations: the text says, that "his majesty went into Sasenet's house and did to him what his majesty desired". The phrase "doing what one desires" is a common flowery phrase to describe sex.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Burkard, Heinz J. Thissen: ''Einführung in die altägyptische Literaturgeschichte'' vol. 1 (= ''Einführungen und Quellentexte zur Ägyptologie'',vol. 1). LIT, Berlin 2003, {{ISBN|3-8258-6132-5}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;187–191.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, some scholars are convinced, that the papyrus reveals king Pepi's homosexual interests and his same-sex relationship to his general officer.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt; But other scholars are instead convinced, that the passage is merely an allegoric pun to religious texts, in which the sun god [[Ra|Râ]] visits the underworld god [[Osiris]] during the middle four hours of the night. Thus, king Pepi II would be taking the role of Râ and Sasenet would take the role of Osiris. The phrase "doing what one desires" would therefore be overrated and misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=EBT/&gt; 
[[File:Egyptian homosexual ostraca.jpg|thumb|A Ramesside period ostracon, depicting a homosexual couple in coitus (two men having sex together)]]

===Horus and Seth===
A further famous story about same-sex intercourse can be found in the [[Kahun Papyri]], dating back to the Middle Kingdom. It contains the nearly completely preserved story of the [[Osiris myth]] and the legendary fight for the throne of Egypt between [[Horus]] and [[Set (mythology)|Seth]]. The chapter in question reports that Seth was unutterably jealous about his young nephew Horus, because Horus was very young and popular. He was quite pampered by the other gods. Seth instead had very few companions and he was comparatively unpopular because of his choleric and vindictive behaviour. As a result, Seth tried to either chase away or even kill Horus, no matter what the cost. When Seth constantly fails, he plans to humiliate his rival so badly that Horus would be banned from Egypt forever. Seth invites Horus to a party and convinces the teenage Horus to drink more than Horus could normally cope with. When Horus is drunk, Seth seduces him to sleep over the night in one bed together. When lying together in one bed, Seth grabs Horus and rapes him. But Horus has tricked Seth; his drunkenness was staged. He catches Seth's semen with his hands and hides it. Next morning, Horus runs to his Mother, [[Isis]], to tell her what happened. Isis is first speechless with rage and disbelief. Then she tells Horus' to masturbate, using his semen to lubricate Seth's favorite food (Egyptian lettuce). Totally clueless, Seth eats the manipulated lettuce, then he goes to the divine court to inform on Horus. At first, the divine judges swear at Horus, but when [[Thoth]], the scribe of the court, calls for Seth's semen to emerge from the body of Horus, instead the semen of Horus emerges from the body of Seth. Seth blushes in embarrassment and shock, then flees. Horus is acquitted.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=EBT/&gt;

The famous rape of Horus by his jealous uncle is also subject of passionate discussions. While most scholars agree that the papyrus clearly describes rape, it must remain open, if it actually describes a homosexually driven deed. Background of the dispute are Seth's motives: he does not love Horus; in contrast, he hates his nephew and the rape was clearly performed to humiliate Horus. The only common ground between the rape and homosexuality is that the act was of same-sex nature.&lt;ref name=EBT/&gt; But some scholars are not so sure and point out, that Seth was often credited with questionable sexual interests.

== Ancient Egyptian views ==
It remains unclear, what exact view the ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. No ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=EBT/&gt;

== Talmudic literature ==
In Talmudic literature, the ancient Egyptians are known for their liberal sexual lifestyles and are often used as the prime example of sexual debauchery. [[Rashi]] describes an Egyptian practice for women to have multiple husbands. [[Maimonides]] refers to lesbianism as "the acts of Egypt". While polyandry and lesbianism are characteristics of the ancient Egyptians, male-male homosexual relationships are usually attributed to [[Sodom and Gomorrha|Sodom]], [[Sodom and Gomorrha|Gomorrah]], and [[Amalek]].&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca T. Alpert: ''Like Bread on the Seder Plate: Jewish Lesbians and the Transformation of Tradition''. Columbia University Press, New York 1997, {{ISBN|0231096615}}, page 17–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8037">'''Hydatius''', also spelled '''Idacius''' (c. 400 – c. 469), [[bishop]] of [[Aquae Flaviae]] in the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallaecia]] (almost certainly the modern [[Chaves, Portugal]], in the modern district of [[Vila Real, District|Vila Real]]) was the author of a chronicle of his own times that provides us with our best evidence for the history of [[Hispania]] (that is, the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times) in the 5th century.

==Life==
Hydatius was born around the year 400 in the environs of Civitas Lemica, a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town near modern [[Xinzo de Limia]] in the Spanish [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] province of [[Ourense]]. As a young boy, he travelled as a pilgrim to the [[Holy Land]] with his mother, where he met [[Jerome]] in his hermitage at [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter. ''The Rise of Western Christendom''. (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; About the year 417 he joined the [[clergy]], and in 427 was consecrated bishop probably of Chaves (the Roman ''Aquae Flaviae'') in [[Gallaecia]]. As bishop he had to come to terms with the presence of non-Roman powers, especially a succession of kings of the [[Suevi]], in a province where imperial control became increasingly nominal during the course of his lifetime. The Suevi had settled in Gallaecia in 411, and there was constant friction between them and the local [[Hispania|Hispano]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] provincials. In this context, Hydatius took part in a deputation of the year 431 requesting assistance in dealing with the Suevi from the general [[Flavius Aëtius]], the most important representative of the imperial government in the West.

Along with this concern, Hydatius devoted himself to rooting out [[heresy]], not just in his own episcopal diocese, but in the rest of [[Hispania]] as well. He was in frequent contact with some important bishops of the day, including [[Thoribius of Astorga]] and [[Antoninus of Mérida]]. Together with Thoribius, he petitioned [[Pope Leo I]] for assistance and advice in dealing with  heresy. Though Hydatius consistently characterizes Iberian heretics as [[Manichee]]s, it is generally believed that he meant [[Priscillianist]]s, followers of the ascetic bishop [[Priscillian]], who had been condemned as a heretic by several church councils and executed as a magician by the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Magnus Maximus]] around 385. We know very little else about Hydatius's life, though we know he was kidnapped and imprisoned for a time in 460 by local enemies, which suggests he played an important role in the internal politics of Roman Gallaecia.

Hydatius probably died in 468 or shortly after, since at that point his chronicle breaks off abruptly.

==Chronicle==
Hydatius's main claim to historical importance is the chronicle he wrote towards the end of his life. The chronicle was an historical genre very popular in [[Late Antiquity]], though with precedents in older chronographic genres like the ''[[Fasti consulares]]''. A consciously [[Christian]] genre, the main goal of the chronicle was to place human history in the context of a linear progression from [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according Genesis]] to the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. Under the entry for each year one or several events were listed, usually with great brevity. The greatest exponent of the form had been the fourth-century bishop [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. [[Jerome]] brought the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea up to date as far as the year 378, after translating it into [[Latin]]. Jerome's translation and continuation proved very popular, and others decided to continue Jerome in the same way.

Hydatius was one such continuator. His continuation begins with a preface explaining his debt to Jerome, and then picks up in the year 379. Hydatius had access to a number of chronographic and historical sources and used four parallel chronological systems. Because of this, and particularly towards the end of the chronicle, it can be difficult to translate his chronology into any modern calendar. At the beginning, Hydatius's continuation offers relatively little information for each year. He narrates the events from 427 onward as a contemporary witness and the text becomes increasingly full as the years progress until it resembles an organic literary work more than a typical chronicle.

Hydatius's main concern throughout is to show the dissolution of civil society in the western Roman empire and in Hispania in particular, and he paints a very dark picture of fifth-century life. His deep [[pessimism]] may stem from a belief in the imminent end of the world, since he had read the apocryphal letter of [[Christ]] to [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], which was interpreted to show that the world would end in May 482. Hydatius may thus have believed that he was chronicling the world's last days, and on occasion he deliberately distorted his account to show events in a gloomier light. This is especially true of the narrative climax of his account, the sack in 456 of the Suevi capital at [[Braga]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Theodoric II]], acting in the service of the Roman emperor [[Avitus]]. Regardless of his sometimes very sophisticated literary devices, Hydatius's chronicle is an essential source of information for reconstructing the course of fifth-century events. Moreover, it is our only source for the history of Hispania in the period up to 468, at which point the narrative breaks off.

It is doubtful whether Hydatius is also the author of the ''Fasti consulares'' for the years 245-468, appended to the ''Chronicle'' in the only almost complete manuscript in our possession. The ''Chronicle'' is printed in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina|P.L.]]'' vol. 51, 873-890, and vol. 74, 701-750;  the ''Fasti Consulares'' are found in P.L., vol. 51, 891-914.

==IASA aims==
The IASA constitution &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/iasa-constitution IASA constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;  states the following purposes: 
* To strengthen co-operation between archives and other institutions which preserve sound and audiovisual documents.
* To initiate and encourage activities that develop and improve the organisation, administration and contents of recorded sound and audiovisual collections, and, in pursuance of these aims, to co-operate with other organisations in related fields.
* To study all techniques relevant to the work of sound and audiovisual archives and other institutions which preserve these documents and to disseminate the results of such study on an international scale.
* To encourage, on an international level, the exchange of sound and audiovisual documents and of literature and information relating to these documents.
* To stimulate and further by every means the preservation, documentation and dissemination of all recorded sound and audiovisual collections.

==Membership==
IASA has members from more than 70 countries representing a broad palette of audiovisual archives and personal interests which are distinguished by their focus on particular subjects and areas, for example: archives for all sorts of musical recordings, historic, literary, folkloric and ethnological sound documents, theatre productions and oral history interviews, bio-acoustics, environmental and medical sounds, linguistic and dialect recordings, as well as recordings for forensic purposes.

==IASA activities==
IASA promotes the open and ongoing exchange of ideas and information on current issues in the audiovisual field via annual conferences, an IASA Journal, [http://www.iasa-web.org/listserv list-serve] and the IASA web site.

==Annual conferences==
IASA has held a conference each year since its inception, sometimes in partnership with related organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/past-conferences IASA conferences]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, IASA and the [[Association of Moving Image Archivists]] (AMIA) came together for the first time in a [http://2010.iasa-conference.com/ joint IASA-AMIA conference] held in Philadelphia, USA. With more than 750 participants and more than 100 presentations and lectures this was one of the biggest conferences in the audiovisual archiving field ever. The [http://2013.iasa-web.org/ 2013 conference] in Vilnius, Lithuania, was held in association with the Baltic Audiovisual Archival Council. The [http://2019.iasa-web.org/ 2019 conference] will be in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

==Publications==
IASA follows closely the progress of technology and members can call upon a pool of expertise for help and advice on various aspects, ranging from digitisation to metadata to technical issues. In this regard, IASA has published a number of [https://www.iasa-web.org/iasa-special-and-technical-publications special publications]:
* ''The Safeguarding of the Audio Heritage: Ethics, Principles and Preservation Strategy'' (IASA-TC 03)
* ''Guidelines on the Production and Preservation of Digital Audio Objects'' (IASA-TC 04)
* ''Handling and Storage of Audio and Video Carriers'' (IASA-TC 05)
* ''IASA Cataloguing Rules'' (also a Spanish version as ''Reglas de Catalogación de IASA'')
* ''Task Force on Selection for Digital Transfer''.
* ''Ethical Principles for Sound and Audiovisual Archives''

An initial version of video digitisation and preservation standards, ''Guidelines for the Preservation of Video Recordings'' (IASA-TC 06), was published in 2018.

==Awards and grants==
The organisation issues awards for outstanding contributions to the profession of sound and audiovisual archiving, as well as financial support for research and for participating in annual conferences:
* Since 2004 the IASA Award of Recognition for outstanding service has been awarded each year to an IASA member  
* The status of Honorary Member of IASA is awarded to individuals as a mark of special service in the work of sound and audiovisual archives
* Travel Awards are awarded annually to selected IASA members to offset the costs of active participation in an annual conference.
* Research Grants are awarded on an occasional basis to support original research and publication on audiovisual archiving.

==Collaboration==
IASA has long standing relationships with international organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and [[Europeana]] and is a respected partner in various international audiovisual archive projects. IASA is a founding member of the CCAAA (Co-ordinating Council of Audiovisual Archive Associations).

In 2012 and 2013, IASA hosted the official website of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Day for Audiovisual Heritage]], an event held annually on 27 October to raise awareness of the significance of and threats to sound and moving image heritage worldwide.

==Committees and Sections==
''IASA Committees'' focus on topics that are of common interest to all archives and collections:
* The Organising Knowledge Committee concerns itself with standards and rules as well as with systems, automated or manual, for the documentation and cataloguing of audiovisual media;
* The Discography Committee deals with standards and recommended practices, as well as current and ongoing projects involving published recordings;
* The Technical Committee devotes itself to all technical aspects of recording, storage, preservation and reproduction, including new recording transfer and storage technologies.
* The Training and Education Committee concerns itself with audiovisual archiving Training &amp; Education, as well as concentrated actions in gaining multifunctional training and education material.


''IASA Sections'' provide a platform for the exchange of information between specific types of archives and collections:
* The National Archives Section considers issues facing national collections, whether held in archives, libraries, museums or research institutions, e.g. acquisition policies, legal deposit, the management of large collections;
* The Broadcast Archives Section handles the special responsibilities of audiovisual archives in broadcasting companies;
* The Research Archives Section is concerned with special issues relating to audiovisual archives whose holdings include collections of recordings originally made for research purposes.

==Regional branches==
National and regional branches of IASA, with their own membership and activities, exist for Austria, Britain and Ireland, German-Swissgerman regions, Nordic countries, and Italy.

==Origin of life==

===Pioneer organism===
Wächtershäuser proposes that the earliest form of life, termed "pioneer organism", originated in a volcanic hydrothermal flow at high pressure and high (100&amp;nbsp;°C) temperature. It had a composite structure of a mineral base with catalytic transition metal centers (predominantly [[iron]] and [[nickel]], but also perhaps [[cobalt]], [[manganese]], [[tungsten]] and [[zinc]]). The catalytic centers catalyzed autotrophic carbon fixation pathways generating small molecule (non-polymer) organic compounds from inorganic gases (e.g. [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydrogen cyanide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]). These organic compounds were retained on or in the mineral base as organic ligands of the transition metal centers with a flow retention time in correspondence with their mineral bonding strength thereby defining an autocatalytic "surface metabolism". The catalytic transition metal centers became autocatalytic by being accelerated by their organic products turned ligands. The carbon fixation metabolism became autocatalytic by forming a metabolic cycle in the form of a primitive sulfur-dependent version of the reductive [[citric acid cycle]]. Accelerated catalysts expanded the metabolism and new metabolic products further accelerated the catalysts. The idea is that once such a primitive autocatalytic metabolism was established, its intrinsically synthetic chemistry began to produce ever more complex organic compounds, ever more complex pathways and ever more complex catalytic centers.

===Nutrient conversions===
The [[water gas shift reaction]] (CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) occurs in volcanic fluids with diverse catalysts or without catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Proposed reaction mechanism for reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on FeS:
Ying et al. (2007) have proved that direct transformation of [[mackinawite]] (FeS) to pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on reaction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S till 300&amp;nbsp;°C is not possible without the presence of critical amount of oxidant. In the absence of any oxidant, FeS reacts with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S up to 300&amp;nbsp;°C to give pyrrhotite.
Farid et al. have proved experimentally that mackinawite (FeS) has ability to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO at temperature higher than 300&amp;nbsp;°C. They reported that the surface of FeS is oxidized, which on reaction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gives pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It is expected that CO reacts with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the Drobner experiment to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Early evolution==
Early evolution is defined as beginning with the [[origin of life]] and ending with the [[last universal common ancestor]] ([[LUCA]]). According to the iron–sulfur world theory it covers a [[coevolution]] of cellular organization ([[cellularization]]), the genetic machinery and enzymatization of the [[metabolism]].

===Cellularization===
Cellularization occurs in several stages. It begins with the formation of primitive lipids (e.g. fatty acids or isoprenoid  acids) in the surface metabolism. These lipids accumulate on or in the mineral base. This lipophilizes the outer or inner surfaces of the mineral base, which promotes condensation reactions over hydrolytic reactions by lowering the  activity of water and protons.

In the next stage lipid membranes are formed. While still anchored to the mineral base they form a semi-cell bounded partly by the mineral base and partly by the membrane. Further lipid evolution leads to self-supporting lipid membranes and closed cells. The earliest closed cells are pre-cells (''[[sensu]]'' [[w:de:Otto Kandler|Kandler]]) because they allow frequent exchange of genetic material (e.g. by fusions). According to [[Carl Woese|Woese]], this frequent exchange of genetic material is the cause for the existence of the common stem in the tree of life and for a very rapid early evolution.

===Proto-ecological systems===
William Martin and Michael Russell suggest that the first cellular life forms may have evolved inside alkaline [[hydrothermal vents]] at seafloor spreading zones in the [[deep sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures consist of microscale caverns that are coated by thin membraneous metal sulfide walls. Therefore, these structures would resolve several critical points germane to  Wächtershäuser's suggestions at once:

# the micro-caverns provide a means of concentrating newly synthesised molecules, thereby increasing the chance of forming [[oligomer]]s;
# the steep temperature gradients inside the hydrothermal vent allow for establishing "optimum zones" of partial reactions in different regions of the vent (e.g. monomer synthesis in the hotter, oligomerisation in the colder parts);
# the flow of hydrothermal water through the structure provides a constant source of building blocks and energy (chemical disequilibrium between hydrothermal hydrogen and marine carbon dioxide);
# the model allows for a succession of different steps of cellular evolution (prebiotic chemistry, monomer and oligomer synthesis, peptide and protein synthesis, [[RNA world]], ribonucleoprotein assembly and [[DNA]] world) in a single structure, facilitating exchange between all developmental stages;
# synthesis of lipids as a means of "closing" the cells against the environment is not necessary, until basically all cellular functions are developed.

This model locates the "last universal common ancestor" ([[LUCA]]) within the inorganically formed physical confines of an alkaline hydrothermal vent, rather than assuming the existence of a free-living form of LUCA. The last evolutionary step en route to bona fide free-living cells would be the synthesis of a lipid membrane that finally allows the organisms to leave the microcavern system of the vent. This postulated late acquisition of the biosynthesis of [[lipids]] as directed by genetically encoded peptides is consistent with the presence of completely different types of membrane lipids in [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]] (plus [[eukaryotes]]). The kind of vent at the foreground of their suggestion is chemically more similar to the warm (ca. 100&amp;nbsp;°C) off ridge vents such as [[Lost City (hydrothermal field)|Lost City]] than to the more familiar [[black smoker]] type vents (ca. 350&amp;nbsp;°C).

In an abiotic world, a [[thermocline]] of temperatures and a [[chemocline]] in concentration is associated with the pre-biotic synthesis of organic molecules, hotter in proximity to the chemically rich vent, cooler but also less chemically rich at greater distances.  The migration of synthesized compounds from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration gives a directionality that provides both source and sink in a self-organizing fashion, enabling a proto-metabolic process by which [[acetic acid]] production and its eventual [[Redox|oxidization]] can be spatially organized.

In this way many of the individual reactions that are today found in central metabolism could initially have occurred independent of any developing [[cell membrane]]. Each vent microcompartment is functionally equivalent to a single cell.  Chemical communities having greater structural integrity and resilience to wildly fluctuating conditions are then selected for; their success would lead to local zones of depletion for important precursor chemicals.  Progressive incorporation of these precursor components within a cell membrane would gradually increase [[metabolism|metabolic complexity]] within the cell membrane, whilst leading to greater environmental simplicity in the external environment.  In principle, this could lead to the development of complex catalytic sets capable of [[Autocatalytic set|self-maintenance]].

Russell adds a significant factor to these ideas, by pointing out that semi-permeable [[mackinawite]] (an iron sulfide mineral) and silicate membranes could naturally develop under these conditions and electrochemically link reactions separated in space, if not in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''James Wilford Garner''' (November 22, 1871, [[Pike County, Mississippi]] – December 9, 1938) was an [[Americans|American]] professor of [[political science]].

==Biography==
He graduated from the [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College]] in 1892 and studied at the [[University of Chicago]] (Ph.M., 1900) and at [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D., 1902), where he was a member of the [[Dunning School]].  His dissertation, ''Reconstruction in Mississippi'', though critical of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], was regarded by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] as the fairest of the works of the Dunning School.&lt;ref name=Lemann&gt;{{cite book

'''James Willard Schultz''', or '''Apikuni''', (born August 26, 1859, died June 11, 1947) was a noted [[author]], [[explorer]], [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] guide, fur trader and [[historian]] of the [[Blackfoot|Blackfeet Indians]].&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanna |first=Warren L. |title=Stars over Montana-Men Who Made Glacier National Park History |publisher=Glacier Natural History Association |location=West Glacier, MT |year=1988 |isbn=9780091679064 |chapter=James Willard Schultz-The Pikuni Storyteller|pages=95–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He operated a fur trading post at Carroll, [[Montana]] {{coord|47|34|25|N|108|22|24|W|display=inline|name=Carroll, Montana}} and lived among the [[Pikuni]] tribe during the period 1880-82. He was given the name ''Apikuni'' by the Pikuni chief, ''Running Crane''.&lt;ref name=Hanna/&gt; ''Apikuni'' in Blackfeet means "Spotted Robe."  Schultz is most noted for his 37 books, most about Blackfoot life, and for his contributions to the naming of prominent features in Glacier National Park.

==Early life==
Schultz was born August 26, 1859 in [[Boonville (town), New York|Boonville, New York]] {{coord|43|29|01|N|075|20|12|W|display=inline|name=Boonville, NY}} to well-to-do parents, Frances and Philander Bushrod Schults [as it was spelled at the time].  The house where he was born is marked with a plaque as a New York State Historic Landmark.&lt;ref name=Hanna/&gt;  Young James enjoyed the outdoors and his father ensured he was mentored by experienced outdoorsmen and hunters in the [[Adirondacks]] during camping and hunting trips.  He became an experienced shooter at an early age.

==Early years in Montana==
As a young adult, Schultz moved to [[Fort Conrad]], [[Montana]], on the [[Marias River]]. He stayed at Fort Conrad from 1877 to 1885, and established a trading post there in 1880. During that time period he traded with the [[Pikuni]] and the Blood and established another trading post at [[Carroll, Montana]] on the [[Missouri River]], where he also traded with the [[Cree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv44121 "Guide to the James W. Shultz Papers"], University of Montana&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glacier National Park==
In the mid-1880s, Schultz began to spend more time in the [[Two Medicine]] and [[Saint Mary Lake]]s region of what is now Glacier National Park guiding and outfitting local hunters. In 1885 he sent an article on the St. Mary Lakes to ''[[Forest and Stream]],'' one of his first literary efforts.  At the time [[George Bird Grinnell]] was the magazine's editor, and he became intrigued with Schultz and the Glacier region.  Grinnell solicited Schultz to outfit and guide him on a hunting trip in Glacier in September 1885.  Although the trip was not a great success for Grinnell, he did kill a [[Bighorn Sheep|Bighorn]] ram on a mountain near the Upper [[Saint Mary Lake]] with a single shot.

Schultz promptly named the mountain [[Singleshot Mountain]] to honor Grinnell's feat.  Thus began decades of Schultz naming features in the Glacier regions for clients and friends, and to honor traditional Indian names.&lt;ref name=Hanna/&gt; [[Montana State University Library]] has a [[digital library]] of papers and photographs documenting Schultz's time in Montana and Glacier National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Willard Schultz Photos and Personal Papers Collection|url=http://arc.lib.montana.edu/schultz-0010/|publisher=[[Montana State University Library]]|accessdate=19 July 2014|ref=Collection 10 - James Willard Schultz Papers, 1867-1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schultz first visited Arizona in 1906–07, during which time he assisted [[Jesse Walter Fewkes|J.

==Author==
James Willard Schultz started writing at the age of 21, publishing articles and stories in ''[[Forest and Stream]]'' for 15 years. He did not write his first book until 1907 at age 48. The memoir: ''''My Life as an Indian'' tells the story of his first year living with the Pikuni tribe of Blackfeet Indians east of Glacier.  In 1911, he associated himself with publishers [[Houghton Mifflin]]; the firm published Schultz's subsequent books for the next 30 years. In 1918 he authored ''Bird Woman'', a novel about [[Sacajawea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Indian Heroine |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/57731063/?terms=%22Hart%2BMerriam%2BSchultz%22 |newspaper=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=October 27, 1918 |page=43 |via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = February 1, 2017}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Lone Wolf, provided the illustrations for the novel, and Schultz dedicated the book to him: "Born near the close of the buffalo days he was, and ever since with his baby hands he began to model statuettes of horses and buffalo and deer with clay from the river banks, his one object has been the world of art."&lt;ref name=BLM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://butterflylodgemuseum.org/history/lodge/ | publisher=Butterfly Lodge Museum | title=The Lodge | accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MG&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meadowlarkgallery.com/SchultzHM.htm | publisher=Meadowlark Gallery | title=Hart Merriam Schultz | accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, Schultz wrote and published 37 fiction and non-fiction books dealing with the Blackfeet, [[Kutenai Indians|Kootenai]], and [[Flathead Indians|Flathead]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. His works received critical literary acclaim from the general media as well as academia for his story telling and contributions to ethnology. Sometime after 1902, while living in Southern California, Schultz worked for a while as the literary editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''&lt;ref name=Hanna/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:James Willard Schultz and Lone Wolf, 1920.jpg|thumb|Schultz and his son Lone Wolf, 1920]]

Schultz's first marriage in 1879 was to ''Natahki'' (meaning "Fine Shield Woman"), a Piegan Blackfeet. Natahki was a survivor of the [[Marias massacre|Baker massacre]] in 1870.&lt;ref name=bronzes&gt;{{cite news|title=Historical Society Receives Bronzes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/75130280/?terms=%22Hart%2BMerriam%2BSchultz%22 |newspaper=The Montana Standard |date=June 20, 1971 |page=22 |via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = February 1, 2017}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son named [[Hart Merriam Schultz]], or Lone Wolf (1882–1965). He was named after Schultz's boyhood friend [[Clinton Hart Merriam]].&lt;ref name="Stars 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Warren|title=Stars Over Montana: A Centennial Celebration Of The Men Who Shaped Glacier National Park|date=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=1461746825|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pACeCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=kipps+trading+post+c+hart+merriam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2OgE_2E0nr&amp;sig=qe1xYJGiLIL0qXNJUE41nfelp0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=kipps%20trading%20post%20c%20hart%20merriam&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natahki died in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navajohopiobserver.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubSectionID=514&amp;ArticleID=11643&amp;TM=6832.598 |title=Butterfly Lodge Museum offers glimpse into adventurer's life - Navajo-Hopi Observer - Flagstaff, Arizona |publisher=Navajo-Hopi Observer |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz married again, to Jessica 'Jessie' Schultz. (Jessica Louise Donaldson had been a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Grayling, Montana, and later earned an MA in Anthropology from the University of CA. In 1926-7, as a professor of English at Montana State College, now Montana State University-Bozeman, she helped write and produce a play/pageant entitled 'The Masque of the Absaroka'. It focused on Absaroka (Crow) culture, featuring numerous Native Americans from the Crow Nation. She was a lifelong advocate for Northern Plains Indian culture, and particularly for the welfare of women, assisting with the development of markets for the sale of bead and leather goods.) Jessie made arrangements to publish some of Schultz's works posthumously, such as ''Bear Chief's War Shirt''. She married again after his death, to Henry Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleck|first1=Richard F.|year=1986|title=Review of Bear Chief's War Shirt|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=10|issue=2|pages=148–149|doi=10.2307/1183997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

James Schultz suffered from ill health for most of his last 30 years. Guiding in the rugged Glacier area took its toll physically.  He suffered from incapacitating lung and heart infections. In 1931 he injured his spine.  In 1942 he fell, breaking his left leg and right arm.  In September 1944, a fall at his home in Denver broke his hip and required major surgery to repair. His deteriorating health severely reduced his ability to write and concentrate. After moving to the [[Wind River Reservation]] in Wyoming to be close to the Native American tribes he grew up with, he suffered a fatal heart attack and died on June 11, 1947.  He wanted to be buried in Montana and was laid to rest on the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation|Blackfeet Reservation]] {{coord|48|39|31|N|112|52|18|W|display=inline|name=Blackfeet Indian Reservation}} near [[Browning, Montana]] in the old burial ground of the family of Natahki, his first wife.&lt;ref name=Hanna/&gt;

The '''''Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik''''' or '''''Cronike van der Duytscher Oirden''''' is an important and much discussed chronicle of the [[Teutonic Order]]. It was written in the Netherlands in the late 15th century, and rewritten in a later Prussian version.

This is a '''list of historic fires'''. Urban fires are the most numerous due to loss of life and property, but also included are lists of [[fire]]s in individual structures, ships and other transportation, and mines. A few of the most important wildfires or forest fires are included, but this list is not the primary resource for the most severe wildfires, which is summarized in the [[List of forest fires]].

'''Malcolm Laing''' (1762 – 6 November 1818) was a Scottish historian, advocate and politician.

==Life==
He was born to Robert Laing and Barbara Blaw at the paternal estate of Strynzia or Strenzie, on [[Stronsay]], [[Orkney]]; [[Samuel Laing (travel writer)|Samuel Laing]] and [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] were his brothers. He attended the [[Kirkwall Grammar School|grammar school]] in [[Kirkwall]], and was a student at [[Edinburgh University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=15890|first=Paul J.|last=deGategno}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William White|title=Notes and Queries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LMRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96|year=1861|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Speculative Society]] in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Speculative society of Edinburgh|title=History of the Speculative society of Edinburgh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA153|year=1845|publisher=The society|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785 Laing was admitted advocate, and from 1789 for five years was advocate for poor litigants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Finlay|title=Legal Practice in Eighteenth-Century Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hoaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199|date=6 July 2015|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-29494-3|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1790 he was working on the electoral roll in Orkney, in the Whig interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/constituencies/orkney-and-shetland|title=Orkney and Shetland 1790–1820, History of Parliament Online|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794, with [[Adam Gillies]], he defended [[Joseph Gerrald]] in his sedition case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Vernon|title=Re-reading the Constitution: New Narratives in the Political History of England's Long Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHFgk_PmSW4C&amp;pg=PA37|date=13 November 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58941-3|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir James Mackintosh]], a friend, regarded Laing's delivery as far too fast, and an impediment to his legal career;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis Wood|title=Benjamin Constant: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9r-JAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97766-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn]] commented quite positively on his "hard, peremptory, Celtic manner and accent".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Laing finished [[Robert Henry]]'s ''History of Great Britain'' with a final volume in 1793, and wrote a ''History of Scotland from the Union of the Crowns to the Union of the Kingdoms'' (1800).&lt;ref name="HoP"/&gt; In a second edition of the ''History'' in 1804 half the work was devoted to a ''Dissertation on the participation of Mary Queen of Scots in the Murder of Darnley'' and the [[Casket Letters]], hostile to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Laing, Malcolm|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[George Brodie (historian)|George Brodie]] and [[Ebenezer Marshal]], Laing dwelled on negative feudal and other features of [[early modern]] Scottish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhTOqt4-wD8C&amp;pg=PA254|date=18 December 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52019-5|pages=254–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 also Laing edited ''The Historie and Life of King James the Sext''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Colville|author2=Malcolm Laing|title=The Historie and Life of King James the Sext: Written Towards the Latter Part of the Sixteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WpNUAAAAcAAJ|year=1804|publisher=James Ballantyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By modern standards, Laing erred by endorsing a "Scottish Gothic" theory of the [[Picts]]: that this founding group of the Kingdom of Scotland were not Celts, but had a [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic]] origin. He endorsed the views of [[John Pinkerton]] on the matter, as did [[John Jamieson]] and [[James Sibbald]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''Teutonist Ethnology and Scottish Nationalist Inhibition, 1780–1880'', The Scottish Historical Review Vol. 74, No. 197, Part 1 (Apr., 1995), pp. 45–68, at p. 51. Published by: Edinburgh University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25530660&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ossian critic===
In 1805 Laing published in two volumes ''Poems of Ossian, containing the Poetical Works of James MacPherson in Prose and Verse, with Notes and Illustrations''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; It contained [[juvenilia]] by [[James Macpherson]], fabricator of the [[Ossian]] poems, who had died in 1796. It also described how they might be dependent on modern sources that had been borrowed.&lt;ref name="Curley2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas M. Curley|title=Samuel Johnson, the Ossian Fraud, and the Celtic Revival in Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoFlDwi99wcC&amp;pg=PA8|date=16 April 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40747-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laing's criticism was seminal for a theory that Macpherson had used [[Robert Lowth]]'s study of [[Hebrew verse]] to construction his own alleged translations.
&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Fitzgerald, ''The Style of Ossian'', Studies in Romanticism Vol. 6, No. 1 (Autumn, 1966), pp. 22–33 at pp. 23–4. Published by: Boston University. DOI: 10.2307/25599674. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25599674&lt;/ref&gt;

For Charles James Fox, as explained in a letter to Laing, Macpherson was in the ranks of politically mischievous historians, led by [[David Hume]] and his ''[[The History of England (Hume)|A History of England]]''. Others there were [[Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet]] and [[Thomas Somerville (minister)|Thomas Somerville]]. The underlying issue was Tory and Jacobite [[historical revisionism|revisionism]] of the Whig historical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Rehabilitation of Scottish Jacobitism'', The Scottish Historical ReviewVol. 77, No. 203, Part 1 (Apr., 1998), pp. 58–76, at pp. 63–4. Published by: Edinburgh University Press.
Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25530805&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Ossian debate", on the poems' authenticity to supposed ancient sources, was coming to a head that year. Via [[Robert Anderson (editor and biographer)|Robert Anderson]], Laing was in possession of a confession by Macpherson of the complete fabrication to another party, Sir John Elliott, who had mentioned it to [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]. On the other hand, the ''Report of the Highland Society'' (1805) upheld the authenticity claims. Percy took the eirenic view that the blame game, at least, should cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas M. Curley|title=Samuel Johnson, the Ossian Fraud, and the Celtic Revival in Great Britain and Ireland|date=16 April 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40747-2|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
On 10 September 1805 Laing married Margaret Dempster Carnegie, daughter of Thomas Carnegie and Mary Gardyne.

[[File:Miloš Milojević, ca. 1880.jpg|thumb|Portrait (ca. 1880)]]

'''Miloš S. Milojević''' (1840–1897) was a [[Serbia]]n [[lawyer]], writer and politician. His work has been described as "at a ridge between history and literature", mostly for his travel-recording genre.&lt;ref name="Вемић2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Мирчета Вемић|title=Етничка карта дела Старе Србије: Према путопису Милоша С. Милојевића 1871–1877. год.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIoDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Geografski institut „Jovan Cvijić“ SANU|isbn=978-86-80029-29-0|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Miloš S. Milojević, son of a parish priest, was born at [[Crna Bara (Bogatić)]] in [[Mačva]], [[Serbia]], on 16 October 1840. He graduated with a law degree from [[Belgrade Higher School|Belgrade's Grandes écoles]] in 1862; studied philosophy, philology and history at the [[University of Moscow]], from 1862 to 1865. Milojević returned to Serbia in 1866, worked for the government judicial system, and later taught at high schools in [[Valjevo]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Leskovac]].

He died at Belgrade on 24 June 1897. He was buried in [[Novo Groblje]].

==Historiography==
[[Image:Greater Serbia, Miloš Milojević (1873).jpg|thumb|Milojevic's Greater Serbian map.]]
In 1887 his old fashioned approach to historiography was challenged and debated by [[Ilarion Ruvarac]] and [[Ljubomir Kovačević]] and eventually proved erroneous through critical methods, though not all of his scholarship was marred by their victory. He travelled to the Kosovo and Metohija region in 1871-1877 and left three volumes of data and maps which testify that Serbs were the majority and Albanians the minority population.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} His demographic-statistical structure, however, matched an independent census taken by the Austrian authorities at about the same time.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Because of his ideas about [[Greater Serbia]] and [[Serbisation]], he is also known as '''Mad Milosh''' in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/v_mak/1999/mak9_7_9.html Как бе посърбен Пирот]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/v_mak/1998/v_ruskov.html Владимир Русков, Защо Народната библиотека "Св. св.

'''Mista'arvim'''&lt;ref name="Zitun2012"/&gt; ({{lang-he-n|מסתערבים}}; {{lang-ar|مستعربين|translit=musta'ribīn}}), also spelled '''mista'aravim''',&lt;ref name="SpecialOps2013"/&gt; is the name given to [[counter-terrorism]] units of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], [[Israel Border Police]], and [[Israel Police]] who operate undercover. Such units are specifically trained to assimilate among the local [[Arab]] population. They are commonly tasked with performing intelligence gathering, law enforcement, hostage rescue and counter-terrorism, and to use disguise and surprise as their main weapons.&lt;ref name="Zitun2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SpecialOps2013"/&gt;

The name is derived from the Arabic "Musta'arabi", meaning "those who live among the Arabs", which refers to the [[Musta'arabi Jews]], Arabic-speaking Jews who lived in the Middle East since the beginning of the Arab rule in the 7th century, prior to the arrival of [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardic Jews]] following their [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew ''mista'arvim'' derives from the Arabic مستعربين ''mustaʿribīn'', literally "those who live among the Arabs," or simply "Arabized."&lt;ref name="Zitun2012"/&gt; Israeli Musta'ribeen are special forces who pose undercover as Arabs and operate within Arab societies to accomplish their missions.&lt;ref name="aljazeera01"/&gt; Musta'ribeen dress as Arabs, know the customs and etiquette of Arab society and speak fluent Arabic, in the appropriate dialect. Musta'ribeen have participated in public demonstrations and may support the protests as if they were demonstrators.&lt;ref name="aljazeera01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera02"/&gt;

Gary Spedding, a consultant on the Middle East, said that the activity of Musta'ribeen "allows the Israeli military and border police to identify protesters they wish to arrest and detain. They may also use the opportunity to incite stone throwing so as to justify the use of excessive force."&lt;ref name="independent01"/&gt; Israeli affairs expert Antoine Shalhat claimed that the main missions of the Musta'ribeen "include gathering intelligence, arresting Palestinians, and counterterrorist operations."&lt;ref name="aljazeera01"/&gt;

==Training==
Training for these units consumes about fifteen months:&lt;ref name="SpecialOps2013"/&gt;
* Four months basic infantry training at the Mitkan Adam [[List of Israel Defense Forces bases|army base]] – the IDF Special Training Center.
* Two and a half months of advanced infantry training in the same base.
* Two months of the unit's basic training, which focus on advanced urban navigation and the beginning of counter-terrorism training.
* Four months Mista'arvim course, which covers everything from learning Arab traditions, language, and way of thought, to civilian camouflage (hair dying, contact lenses, clothing).
* One-month courses – sniper, driving and different instructors courses.

==Known units==
The first musta'ribeen unit, known as the "Arab Department" (''Ha-Machlaka Ha-Aravit''), was established in 1942&lt;ref name="aljazeera01"/&gt; as a unit of the [[Palmach]]. Other musta'ribeen groups in Israel have included:

* Sayeret Shaked, a unit of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], which operated undercover in the Gaza Strip in the 1970s
* [[Samson Unit|Sayeret Shimshon]] (Unit 367), which operated in the [[Gaza Strip]] until its disbandment in 1994 after the [[Oslo Accords]]
* Rimon, operating from 1987 until 2005 in Gaza&lt;ref name="aljazeera01"/&gt;
* [[Duvdevan Unit|Sayeret Duvdevan]] (Unit 217), established in the [[West Bank]] in the 1980s and still operating as of 2018&lt;ref name="aljazeera01"/&gt;
* [[Yamas (Israel Border Police unit)|Yamas]], a unit of the [[Israel Border Police]]
* Gideonim (Unit 33), an undercover and mista'arvim unit of the [[Israeli Police]], still operating as of 2012&lt;ref name="Fisher2012"/&gt;
* Hermesh, operating in the [[Judea and Samaria Area]] of the [[West Bank]] until 1994, when it was transferred to the [[Kfir Brigade]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5677">The '''Museums Association''' ('''MA''') is a professional membership organisation based in [[London]] for museum, gallery and heritage professionals, [[museum]]s, galleries and heritage organisations, and companies that work in the museum, gallery and heritage sector of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Geoffrey Lewis, ''For Instruction and Recreation: A Centenary History of the Museums Association''. London: [[Quiller Press]], 1989. {{ISBN|1-870948-37-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers international membership.

==History==
The association was started in 1889 by a small group of museums to protect the interests of museums and galleries. Its inaugural meeting was held at the invitation of the Council of the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]] in [[York]] on 20 June 1889. The MA is the oldest museum association in the world.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Mission==
The MA's mission is inspiring museums to change lives. It advocates for museums, sets ethical standards and runs training and professional development for members wishing to further their careers.&lt;ref name="About the Museums Association"&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/about About the Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The association organises an annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/conference Museums Association Conference and Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; This is Europe's largest event for museum and heritage professionals.&lt;ref name="About the Museums Association"/&gt;

Members receive the monthly ''[[Museums Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal Museums Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; The MA also produces ''Museum Practice'' online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/museum-practice Museum Practice] The latest case studies and best practice by museum professionals around the UK, with an interactive platform for users to share their ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its work with the [[Esmee Fairbairn Foundation]], the MA has created the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/collections/18022011-esmee-fairbairn-collections-fund Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; building on its 2005 report, ''Collections for the Future''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/collections/9839 Collections for the Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MA charts the health of [[UK museums]] through its annual survey, ''Museums in the UK''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumsassociation.org/campaigns/museum-funding/museums-in-the-uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the MA began its "Museums 2020" project to create a vision for the future of the museum sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums2020 Museums 2020]&lt;/ref&gt; It hopes to focus on the impacts that museums will have in the future on individuals, communities, society, and the environment.

In 2013 the MA produced "Museums Change Lives", its campaigning vision for the future of museums. "Museums Change Lives" explores the impact of museums under three main headings: wellbeing, better places, ideas and people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-change-lives Museums Change Lives]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MA's Transformers scheme was piloted in 2014, then rolled out nationally. Transformers is for people in mid-career, supported by any accredited museum (or museum working towards accreditation), looking to change the way they work. Participants are challenged to develop new ways of thinking and supported throughout to engage with experimental ideas, fresh thinking and learning from the experience of experts and innovators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumsassociation.org/professional-development/transformers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the MA launched Collections 2030, a research project looking at the long-term purpose, use and management of museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumsassociation.org/collections/09052018-collections-2030]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The MA has over 8,000 individual members, 580 institutional members, and 250 corporate members.&lt;ref name="About the Museums Association"/&gt;

It runs a professional development scheme, with mentoring and regular training events. "AMA" denotes an Associate of the Museums Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/professional-development/associateship-of-the-museums-association Associateship of the Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt; "FMA" denotes a Fellow of the Museums Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/professional-development/fellowship-of-the-museums-association Fellowship of the Museums Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The MA is governed by a board of trustees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsassociation.org/about/board MA board of trustees]&lt;/ref&gt; from all parts of the UK museum community, elected by members. The current president, as of April 2018, is Maggie Appleton. Previous presidents include David Anderson, David Fleming, Stuart Davies, [[Charles Saumarez Smith]], Jane Glaister, [[Max Hebditch]], Barbara Woroncow and Virginia Tandy.

The association is independently funded by its membership.&lt;ref name="About the Museums Association"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">[[File:Ephesus odeon.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Ephesus]] Odeon, [[Turkey]]]]
'''Odeon''' is the name for several ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings built for music: singing exercises, musical shows, poetry competitions, and the like. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ᾨδεῖον, ''Ōideion'', literally "singing place", or "building for musical competitions"; from the verb ἀείδω, ''aeidō'', "I sing", which is also the root of ᾠδή, ''ōidē'',  "[[ode]]", and of ἀοιδός, ''[[aoidos]]'', "singer".

==Description==
In a general way the construction of an odeon was similar to that of an [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]], but it was only a quarter of the size and was provided with a [[roof]] for [[acoustics|acoustic]] purposes, a characteristic difference. The prototype odeon was the Odeon of [[Pericles]] ([[Odeon of Athens]]), a mainly wooden building by the southern slope of the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. It was described by Plutarch as 'many-seated and many-columned' and may have been square, though excavations have also suggested a different shape, 208 x 62 feet. It was said to be decorated  with the masts and spars of ships captured from the Persians. It was rebuilt by king [[Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia]] after destruction by fire in the [[First Mithridatic War]] in 87–86 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|publisher=OUP|page=617|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[File:Troy Troia Truva 1280866 1280910 Nevit 45 images.jpg|thumbnail|Hadrianic Odeon in Troy IX]]

The oldest known odeon in Greece was the Skias at [[Sparta]], so called from its resemblance to the top of a [[parasol]], said to have been erected by [[Theodorus of Samos]] (600 B.C.); in Athens an odeon near the spring Enneacrunus on the [[Ilissus]] was referred to the age of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]], and appears to have been rebuilt or restored by [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] (c. 330 B.C.). This is probably the building which, according to [[Aristophanes]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'', 1109.&lt;/ref&gt; was used for judicial purposes, for the distribution of corn, and even for the billeting of soldiers.

[[File:Odeon-lyon.jpg|thumb|[[Odeon of Lyon|Odeon of Fourvière]], [[Lyon]], France]]
The most magnificent odeon was the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]] on the southwest cliff of the Acropolis at Athens. It was built in about 160 A.D. by the wealthy sophist and rhetorician [[Herodes Atticus]] in memory of his wife, and considerable remains of the odeon still exist. It had accommodation for 4500/5500 persons, and the ceiling was constructed of beautifully carved beams of cedar wood, probably with an open space in the centre to admit the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sear|2006|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also profusely decorated with pictures and other works of art. Similar buildings also existed in other parts of Greece; at [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], also the gift of Herodes Atticus;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sear|2006|pp=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Patrae]], where there was a famous statue of [[Apollo]]; at [[Smyrna]], [[Tralles]], and other towns in [[Asia Minor]]. The first odeon in Rome was built by Domitian ([[Odeon of Domitian]]), a second by Trajan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3466">'''Pamphile''' or '''Pamphila of Epidaurus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Παμφίλη ἡ Ἐπιδαυρία}}, ''Pamphílē hē Epidauría''; {{abbr|fl.|Active}} {{sc|ad}} 1st century) was a historian who lived in the reign of [[Nero]]. According to the [[Suda]] she was an [[Epidaurus|Epidaurian]];&lt;ref name="suda1"&gt;Suda π 139, ''Pamphile''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] describes her as an [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]] by birth or descent,&lt;ref&gt;Photius, ''Cod.'' 175&lt;/ref&gt; which may be reconciled by supposing that she was a native of Epidaurus, and that her family came from Egypt. Photius summarizes the preface to her work, in which we learn that during the thirteen years she had lived with her husband, from whom she was never absent for a single hour, she was constantly at work upon her book, and that she diligently wrote down whatever she heard from her husband and from the many other learned people who frequented their house, as well as whatever she herself read in books. Hence we can account for the statement in the Suda that some people ascribed her work to her husband. The name of her husband is differently stated. In one passage the Suda speaks of her as the daughter of [[Soteridas of Epidaurus|Soteridas]] and the wife of Socratidas,&lt;ref name="suda1"/&gt; but in another passage she is described as the wife of Soteridas.&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Soteridas'', σ875&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Writings==
The principal work of Pamphile was the ''Historical Commentaries'', a history of [[Greece]] comprising thirty-three books. Photius gives a general idea of the nature of its contents. The work was not arranged according to subjects or according to any settled plan, but it was more like a commonplace book, in which each piece of information was set down as it fell under the notice of the writer, who stated that she believed this variety would give greater pleasure to the reader. Photius considers the work as one of great use, and supplying important information on many points in history and literature. The estimation in which it was held in antiquity is shown not only by the judgment of Photius, but also by the references to it in the works of [[Aulus Gellius]] and [[Diogenes Laërtius]], who appear to have availed themselves of it to a considerable extent. Photius speaks only of eight books but the Suda says that it consisted of thirty-three. The latter must be correct, since we find Gellius quoting the eleventh&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, xv. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty-ninth,&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, xv. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diogenes Laertius]] the twenty-fifth&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, iii. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and thirty-second.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, v. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps no more than eight books were extant in the time of Photius. The work is also referred to by Diogenes Laërtius in other passages.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 24, 68, 76, 90, 98, ii. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the history already mentioned, the Suda says she also wrote an ''Epitome of Ctesias'' in 3 books; a very large number of epitomes of histories and other books; ''On Disputes''; ''On Sex''; and many other works.

He suggests that the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] culture was influenced by these people in the form of possible archaeological remains, customs, costumes, art and even written language.

His theory has been rejected by mainstream historians.&lt;ref name=invented/&gt; Provincial archaeologists and a geologist have said that some of Chiasson's physical evidence of a Chinese settlement—a road up the side of [[Cape Dauphin]] and the stone remains of a wall surrounding the site —were actually built in 1952 by a volunteer fire company fighting a forest fire and again in the 1990s by a gravel company attempting to dig gravel on the cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/no-chinese-ruins-in-cape-breton-archeologists-1.619486|title=No Chinese ruins in Cape Breton: archeologists |date=July 27, 2006 |work=CBC News |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chiasson challenges these statements in his second book, ''Written in the Ruins: Cape Breton Island's Second Pre-Columbian Chinese Settlement.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Written in the Ruins: Cape Breton Island's Second Pre-Columbian Chinese Settlement|last=Chiasson|first=Paul|publisher=Dundurn|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4597-3312-1|location=Toronto|pages=16–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, several years after the reports of the [[Nova Scotian]] archeologists, [[History Television]] aired a one-hour documentary entitled "Mysterious Ruins: Cape Breton".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=231247 |title=Mysterious Ruins: Cape Breton |date=December 11, 2010 |work=History Television }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary explored Chiasson's theory and included interviews with an archeologist and a geologist from the area who viewed the site that Chiasson posits was the location of a pre-Columbian Chinese community. Geologist Sandra Barr of [[Acadia University]] and archaeologist Steve Davis of [[St. Mary's University (Halifax)|St. Mary's University]] stated that they found no evidence of any human settlement on the site. Acadia University reported that "their explanations are mostly ignored in the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Ruins in Cape Breton?|url=http://science.acadiau.ca/news-reader.2881/chinese-ruins-in-cape-breton.html|publisher=Acada University|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary also included interviews with several Chinese architectural historians.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Joe|title=Cape Breton’s Great Wall: Chinese found East coast in 1500s, author says|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/cape-bretons-great-wall-chinese-found-east-coast-in-1500s-author-says|accessdate=1 October 2016|publisher=National Post|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Zhu Guangya, Professor of Architectural History at Southeast University, Nanjing stated (translation), "I believe the site is a ruin from a human settlement.  Further study is required to confirm what kind of settlement it is."{{cn|date=October 2016}} Professor Fang Yong said that "“I feel that what he has found is not yet enough to prove that it is ruins of a Chinese settlement, but it is possible.”&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt;

{{Periods in English History}}
The '''Regency''' in  the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was a period when [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was deemed unfit to rule and his son [[Regent|ruled as his proxy]] as [[prince regent|Prince Regent]]. On the death of George III in 1820, the Prince Regent became [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The term '''Regency''' (or '''Regency era''') can refer to various stretches of time; some are longer than the decade of the formal Regency which lasted from 1811–1820. The period from 1795 to 1837, which includes the latter part of the reign of George III and the reigns of his sons George IV and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], is sometimes regarded as the Regency era, characterised by [[Regency architecture|distinctive trends in British architecture]], [[Regency novel|literature]], [[Regency fashions|fashions]], politics, and culture. It ended in 1837 when [[Queen Victoria]] succeeded William IV.

==Society==
The Regency is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture. This era encompassed a time of great social, political, and economic change. War was waged with [[Napoleon]] and on other fronts, affecting commerce both at home and internationally, as well as politics. Despite the bloodshed and [[Napoleonic War|warfare]], the Regency was also a period of great refinement and cultural achievement, shaping and altering the societal structure of Britain as a whole.

One of the greatest patrons of the arts and architecture was the [[Prince Regent]] himself (the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]). Upper-class society flourished in a sort of mini-Renaissance of culture and refinement. As one of the greatest patrons of the arts, the Prince Regent ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the beautiful and exotic [[Brighton Pavilion]], the ornate [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], as well as many other public works and architecture (see [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]], and [[Decimus Burton]]). Naturally, this required dipping into the treasury and the Regent, and later, the King's exuberance often outstripped his pocket, at the people's expense.&lt;ref&gt;Parissien, Steven. ''George IV: Inspiration of the Regency''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2001. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Society was also considerably stratified. In many ways, there was a dark side to the beauty and fashion in England at this time. In the dingier, less affluent areas of [[London]], thievery, womanising, gambling, the existence of [[rookery (slum)|rookeries]], and constant drinking ran rampant.&lt;ref name="Low_x"&gt;Low, Donald A. ''The Regency Underworld''. Gloucestershire: Sutton, 1999. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; The population boom—the population increased from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820&lt;ref name="Low_x"/&gt;—created a wild, roiling, volatile, and vibrant scene. According to [[Robert Southey]], the difference between the strata of society was vast indeed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of Regency society provided sharp contrast to the Prince Regent's social circle. Poverty was addressed only marginally. The formation of the Regency after the retirement of [[George III]] saw the end of a more pious and reserved society, and gave birth of a more frivolous, ostentatious one. This change was influenced by the Regent himself, who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits. This did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction, thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet, as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Driving these changes was not only money and rebellious pampered youth, but also significant technological advancements. In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' adopted steam printing. By this method it could now print 1,100 sheets every hour, not 200 as before—a fivefold increase in production capability and demand.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Marjorie. ''Manners, Morals, and Class in England, 1774–1859''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1994. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; This development brought about the rise of the wildly popular [[fashionable novel]]s in which publishers spread the stories, rumours, and flaunting of the rich and aristocratic, not so secretly hinting at the specific identity of these individuals. The gap in the hierarchy of society was so great that those of the upper classes could be viewed by those below as wondrous and fantastical fiction, something entirely out of reach yet tangibly there.

Selina was born in [[Ramganj Upazila]] of erstwhile [[Noakhali District]].&lt;ref name="DailyStarIntel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hossain 2012"/&gt; Her father Md Abidur Rahman was a teacher. When after World War II her father's house in [[Feni District]] was seized, the family had to settle back in village. Then 12-year-old Selina was a student in class six and skilled in writing poetry and stories. Due to the traditional conservative rural context she had to put an end to her schooling. At the [[child marriage|age of 14 she was married]] against her consent and she refused to live with her husband. She wanted to study further but could not succeed in the matriculation exam. After 10 years they divorced.&lt;ref name=academy&gt;স্মৃতি: ১৯৭১, Volume 4, Page 98, Bangla Academy, {{ISBN|984-07-3351-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked for some time in ''Salimulla Orphanage'' in 1965 and then joined as secretary to the editor of ''Weekly Begum'' in 1966. In 1967 Selina Parvin joined the ''Weekly Lalana'' as a journalist.

==Death==
On 13 December 1971, like other intellectual martyrs, Selina Parvin was seized by members of the paramilitary force Al-Badr. Her son Sumon was only 7 years old.&lt;ref name=MofidulLong/&gt; She was brutally killed on 14 December and her dead body was later discovered in the Rayerbazar Boddhobhumy. A lone survivor of the killing testified to the court that being blindfolded, he heard a woman [Selina Parvin] screaming and begging Al-Badr men for her life, appealed to spare her as she had a kid and there was none to take care of him but her. But the brutal killers did not spare her. She was instantly killed by charging bayonet as narrated by the witness.&lt;ref name=DS-Tamanna/&gt;&lt;ref name=MofidulLong/&gt; The lone survivor, who managed to loosen the rope with which he was tied and escaped, had described how three prisoners were tortured before being taken out to be shot. Among the victims, Selina Parvin was [later] found with two bayonet wounds, one through the eye and one in the stomach, and two bullet wounds.&lt;ref name=MofidulLong&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoque |first=Mofidul |date=14 December 2013 |title=Long Walk to Justice |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/long-walk-to-justice/ |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2013, [[Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin]], a Muslim leader based in London, and [[Ashrafuz Zaman Khan]], based in the US, were sentenced in absentia after the court found that they were involved in the abduction and murders of 18 people in December 1971 – nine Dhaka University teachers, six journalists including Selina Parvin, and three physicians.&lt;ref name=DS-Tamanna/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Syed Tashfin |date=3 November 2013 |title=UK Muslim leader Chowdhury Mueen Uddin sentenced to death in Bangladesh |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/uk-muslim-leader-chowdhury-mueen-uddin-sentenced-to-death-in-bangladesh-8919895.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanisław Estreicher'''  (26 November 1869 &amp;ndash; 28 December 1939) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[historian]] of Law and [[bibliography|bibliographer]]; professor of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1906. Following the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]], he was briefly offered to form a puppet quasi-government by [[Nazi Germany]]. He paid with his life for his refusal to do it.{{r|Bramstedt}}{{primary inline|reason=Source is from 1945 (reprinted 2013) - need something more recent|date=August 2018}}

==Life==
Stanisław Estreicher grew up in the intellectual atmosphere of an influential professorial dynasty  at the [[Jagiellonian University]].  His father, [[Karol Estreicher (senior)|Karol Józef Teofil Estreicher]], was a leading historian of literature and the University's head librarian.  His brother [[Tadeusz Estreicher|Tadeusz]] was a chemist and pioneer in [[cryogenics]].  His sister Maria was one of the first women in Poland to earn a doctorate (in English philology).  Stanisław Estreicher’s son, [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher, Jr.]], was one of the most important historians at the University and founder of the [[Jagiellonian University Museum]]. His daughter, Krystyna Grzybowska, was a children's-book writer and historian.

After studying at Kraków and Vienna, Estreicher earned his “habilitation” in 1894 and became a professor of the Jagiellonian University in 1906.  Among his circle of associates was a young doctoral candidate, [[Bronisław Malinowski]].  In 1911, 1918 and 1926, Estreicher was the Dean of the Faculty of Law.  In 1919 he was elected Rector of the University and served until 1921.  After the death of his father Karol Józef in 1908, he attempted to complete his father’s unfinished ''Bibliografia Polska'' (begun in 1870), a massive reference work on all significant Polish authors from the 15th to the 19th century.

Estreicher was offered by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] to form a puppet Nazi government in Poland,&lt;ref name="Bramstedt"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifADAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;q=Estreicher%20puppet%20Government |title=Dictatorship and Political Police: The Technique of Control by Fear|last=Bramstedt |first=E.

His wife, Helena née Longchamps, died in March 1940.  His son, Karol Jr., would later complete the Bibliografia Polska.

Su Beng was born 9 November 1918 in Shirin Town, Taihoku Chō, [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Taiwan]] (modern-day [[Shilin District]] of [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]).  After graduating from [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] with a degree in political science and economics in 1942, he left for [[mainland China]] where he worked undercover with the [[Chinese Communists]] (1942–1949). For years, he averted the [[Chinese Communists]]’ bids for him to join the party. Finally he escaped from [[Qingdao]], China, to Taiwan, just as the Chinese Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] soldiers were retreating to Taiwan.
Having returned to Taiwan for about a year, he established the Taiwan Independence Armed Corps in 1950 which plotted for the assassination of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. When the Taiwan Independence Armed Corps' stash of weapons were discovered hidden on land owned by Su Beng's grandmother in 1951, Su Beng was forced to go into hiding.

After several months on the run, he finally fled to Japan in May 1952 by stowing away in a boat exporting bananas. He served four months of detention for attempting to illegally enter the country, but when the Kuomintang reported him missing and wanted for his involvement in the plot to assassinate Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese government granted him [[political asylum]]. Later on in 1954, Su Beng opened up a noodle shop restaurant ({{zh|c=新珍味|poj=Sin-tin-bī|l=New Gourmet|labels=no}}) in [[Ikebukuro]], Japan. Su Beng used the restaurant/residence as a base to continue his work with the underground [[Taiwan independence movement]]. It was also here that he trained burgeoning independence activists and began writing ''[[Modern History of Taiwanese in 400 Years|Taiwan’s 400 Year History]]''. The Japanese version of this book was first published in 1962, the Chinese-language version was published in 1980 and an abridged English version was published in 1986.

==Return from exile==
In 1993 Su Beng returned to reside in Taipei, Taiwan. The following year, April 1994, he began the Taiwan Independence Action motorcade, which he conceived as a way to raise the Taiwanese people’s consciousness. The motorcade makes its rounds from Taipei county to Taipei city, every Saturday and Sunday afternoon, delivering messages calling for Taiwan’s independence and the normalization of Taiwan as a country.

Labeled a radical, violent militant and communist, he has been dubbed the “[[Che Guevara]] of Taiwan". Several tall tales exist about Su Beng’s controversial life decisions, one of which includes electing to have a [[vasectomy]] when he was in his twenties while working undercover for the Communists in China.

==Pen name==
He first used Su Beng as his pen name for ''[[Modern History of Taiwanese in 400 Years|Taiwanese’s 400 Year History]]'' in 1962. In choosing his pen name, he wanted to express his motivation for writing the book. Su Beng believes that once the Taiwanese people understand their unique history, they will be able to know who they are, what they want for themselves and their nation. The two characters which make up his name mean "history" and "clear", respectively. Taken together, they may be interpreted as “history clearly”, as in “to know history clearly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Legendary revolutionist Su Beng places hope on younger generation |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aftr/201711050016.aspx |accessdate=10 October 2018 |agency=Central News Agency |date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''''Translatio studii''''' ([[Latin]] for "transfer of learning") is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] concept, originating in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=Newsom&gt;Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W. Breed, ''Daniel: A Commentary'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of knowledge or learning from one geographical place and time to another. The concept is closely linked to ''[[translatio imperii]]'', which similarly describes the movement of imperial dominance.  Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (verses 39–40).&lt;ref name=Newsom/&gt;

==History of the concept==

It is a celebrated [[Literary topos|topos]] in [[medieval literature]], most notably articulated in the prologue to [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Cligès]]'', composed ca. 1170. There, Chrétien explains that [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] was first the seat of all knowledge, then it came to Rome, and now it has come to France, where, by the grace of God, it shall remain forever more.  

In the [[Renaissance]] and later, historians saw the metaphorical light of learning as moving much as the light of the sun did:  westward.  According to this notion, the first center of learning was [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], followed by [[Jerusalem]], and [[Babylon]].  From there, the light of learning moved westward to [[Athens]], and then west to [[Rome]].  After Rome, learning moved west to [[Paris]].  From there, enlightenment purportedly moved west to [[London]], though other nations laid claim to the mantle, most notably [[Russia]], which would involve a retrograde motion and rupture in the westerly direction.  The [[metaphor]] of ''translatio studii'' went out of fashion in the 18th century, but such English Renaissance authors as [[George Herbert]] were already predicting that learning would move next to America.  

A pessimistic corollary metaphor is the ''translatio stultitiae''.  As learning moves west, as the earth turns and light falls ever westward, so night follows and claims the places learning has departed from.  The metaphor of the ''translatio stultitiae'' informs [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Dunciad]],'' and particularly book IV of the ''Greater Dunciad'' of 1741, which opens with the [[nihilism|nihilistic]] invocation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Yet, yet a moment, one dim Ray of Light
Indulge, dread Chaos, and eternal Night!" (''B'' IV 1-2)

[...]

Suspend a while your Force inertly strong,
Then take at once the Poet, and the Song. (ibid. 7-8)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==

While the term ''translatio studii'' literally means in English the translation of studies, there is an implication within the concept that the transmission of learning also carried with it cultural ideals and information. That being said, there is a lot more to ''translatio studii'' than the simple movement of common concepts from the Mediterranean westward.

According to Karlheinz Stierle, English is what we might consider the current language of this sort of transmission, but "what English is today...Latin was in the first centuries after Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Stierle, Karlheinz. "Translatio Studii and Renaissance: From Vertical to Horizontal Translation." ''The Translatability of Cultures: Figures of the Space Between''. Budick, Sanford and Iser, Wolfgang. Stanford UP, 1996. 56. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In the way that politics and social issues move circulate around the world very often in English, these same concepts traveled along the developing roads from Greece and Italy to England during Medieval times. As religion spread from Rome to [[Londinium]] (or present day Britain) it brought with it other concepts that can still be seen in the Romance languages.

An interesting example of this is the term "translatio" itself. In Ancient times ''translatio'' in Latin meant both ''translation'' and ''transfer''. As time went on, ''translatio'' was designated to only mean transmission and ''traductio'' took on the meaning of what we know as translation. This carried over to the developing Romance languages as time went on. The words ''translation'' in French and ''traslazione'' in Italian mean the displacement of physical objects, and these languages still use other words to mean "translation" in the English sense.&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz, Stierle. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This varies remarkably from the common meaning used in English, which is solely a linguistic concept rather than a spatial one.  In this way, it is clear that historically the significance of ''translatio studii'' concerns the transfer of ideas that hold cultural value.

==''Translatio imperii''==

''[[Translatio imperii]]'' often served as a precedent or coordinate to ''translatio studii''.  A transferral of rule assisted a transferral of culture, and vice versa: "The transferal of power also conveys the phoenix-like reestablishment of culture - as fictionalized in and transmitted by literature - which establishes each new imperial power as the new stronghold of the culturally elite."&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, Sunhee Kim. "Translatio studii et imperii: Sir Gawain as literary critic." Semiotica, Volume 63, Issue 1-2. (2009): 185-204. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is concerned with the progress of learning, ''translatio studii'' provides an overview of intellectual heritage.  Although it may be considered from various angles (e.g., history, linguistics, and literature) the concept of ''translatio studii'' is fundamentally concerned with texts.  "Reading, translating, commenting, interpreting, rewriting — all are common intertextual activities of the ''translatio studii''."&lt;ref&gt;Carron, Jean-Claude. "Imitation and Intertextuality in the Renaissance." New Literary History, Volume 19, No. 3. (1988): 565-579. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Translatio studii'' is based on the assumption that human learning and the potential for human learning originated in [[Greece]] from whence it spread westward to [[Rome]] and then [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, Marian. "Etymology, Genealogy, and the Immutability of Origins." Renaissance Quarterly, Volume 43, No.2. (1990): 332-347. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chrétien de Troyes]], a French poet of the late 12th century, writes of ''translatio studii'' in the opening of [[Cligès]]:

&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Par les livres que nous avons''
''Les fez des anciiens savons''
''Et del siecle qui fu jadis.''
''Ce nos ont nostre livre apris,''
''Que Grece ot de chevalerie''
''Le premier los et de clergie.''
''Puis vint chevalerie a Rome''
''Et de la clergie la some,''
''Qui or est en France venue.''
''Deus doint qu'ele i soit retenue''
''Et que li leus li abelisse''
''Tant que ja mes de France n'isse.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is: "Through the books which we have, we know the deeds of the ancients and of times long passed.  Our books have taught us that Greece had the first fame of chivalry and learning.  Then came chivalry to Rome, and the sum of learning, which now is come to France.  God grant that it remain there, and that it find the place so pleasant that it will never depart from France."&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, Ernst Robert. European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. "Princeton University Press." Princeton, New Jersey. 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece to Rome: theatre==

All Roman comedy stems from Greek New Comedy but rewritten in Latin with slight adjustments to local taste and the long, narrow stage of Roman theatre. It keeps the characteristics of conventional situations from domestic life and stock character-masks that were traditional in the Greek model.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Jennifer, and Craig S. Walker, eds. The Broadview Anthology of Drama: Plays from the Western Theatre. Vol. 1. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman theatre in turn influenced theatre of the [[Renaissance]]. "The nine Greek-style tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (c. 4 B.C.E. -65 C.E.) are especially noteworthy, partly because they were to have a more profound influence on Renaissance tragedians than their Greek originals." Conventions commonly associated with Renaissance tragedies, most popularly [[Shakespeare]], that are owed to Seneca, are revenge tragedies, structure of five acts, use of elaborate speeches, soliloquies, and asides, violence and horror performed on stage (as opposed to Greek tragedies in which all such actions occurred off stage), and an interest in the human condition, morality of nobility, and the supernatural, specifically with its human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Jennifer, and Craig S. Walker, eds. The Broadview Anthology of Drama: Plays from the Western Theatre. Vol. 1. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome also used the Greek language as a model on which to aid the expansion of their power and secure a language for their empire. According to L. G. Kelly, author of ''The True Interpreter: A History of Translation Theory and Practice in the West'' (1979), "Western Europe owes its civilization to its translators."&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, and Spawforth, eds. "Translation." The Oxford Classical Dictionary. 3rd ed. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglo-Norman: ''cortoisie'' and ''romanz''==

''Cortoisie'' is a synthesis of the superiority of French knighthood and learning. As a new distinction of the French knight, ''cortoisie'' implies not only a new style of communication and mastery of language, but a new style of communicative attitude, especially when regarding women. From ''cortoisie'' comes courtly love, a highly disciplined, self-denying, and respectful social form. Ideally, in this form, the knight honors his lady as something sacred. This new ideal of love called for a new ideal of language, according to Chrétien, and so, translations from old, dead Latin into French, or ''romanz'', began. It is this language that replaces Latin as a new and lasting period of high culture, and, in so doing, becomes the real language or medium of ''translatio studii''.&lt;ref&gt;Budick, Sanford, and Wolfgang Isen, eds. The Translatability of Cultures: Figurations of the Space Between. Stanford: Stanford UP, 1996. Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vlade Košića, biskupa sisačkog |website=Biskupija-sisak.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Košić was born in small village of [[Družbinec]] near [[Varaždin]] on May 20, 1959 to Ivan and Marta (née Dombaj) Košić.

He finished primary school in Družbinec, high school in minor seminary in Zagreb in 1978, and theology at the Catholic Theological Faculty in Zagreb in 1985. On June 30, 1985 he was ordained a presbyter of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Archdiocese of Zagreb]]. He received his master's degree in 1989 in dogmatic theology with thesis ''"Treatise "De libero arbitrio et de gratia" of Ivan Paštrić (1636-1708)"'', and on June 23, 1997 doctoral degree with thesis ''"Theologian Franjo Ksaver Pejačević (1707-1781) - Features"'', with [[Ivan Golub]] as supervisor. Since  November 28, 1997 he holds doctor of science.

==Career==
He worked in the Archdiocese of Zagreb as a chaplain in [[Karlovac]]-[[Dubovac (Karlovac)|Dubovac]] (1985-1988) and [[Zagreb]]-Špansko (1988-1990), and as pastor of [[Hrastovica, Croatia|Hrastovica]] (1990-1995) and [[Petrinja]] (1992-1995).

==Controversies==
Vlado Košić is known for his frequent meddling in Croatian politics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/vasa-stranka-vise-nije-demokrscanska-to-sto-ste-napravili-je-politicka-prostitucija---479856.html|title="HDZ više nije demokršćanski, to što ste napravili je politička prostitucija" - Dnevnik.hr|work=Dnevnik.hr|access-date=2017-06-14|language=hr-HR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extreme right-wing political views&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/biskup-kosic-podivljao-zbog-plenkovica-napisao-mu-pismo-pa-ga-objavio-na-fejsu/976853.aspx|title=Biskup Košić podivljao zbog Plenkovića, napisao mu pismo pa ga objavio na Fejsu|access-date=2017-06-14|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he is called by some "Nazi-Bishop", which he refuses to acknowledge stating that he is against any totalitarianism. He was also a strong opponent and critic of left-wing [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović]], calling it "anti-Croatian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/biskup-kosic-zbog-molitve-protiv-sdp-a-optuzuju-me-da-imam-luksuzno-imanje-u-moslavini-1032968 |title='Zbog molitve protiv SDP-a optužuju me da imam luksuzno imanje u Moslavini' - Večernji.hr |website=Vecernji.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Croatian constitutional referendum, 2013|2013 marriage referendum]], Košić described the [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović|Milanović Government]] official's opposition to the referendum as shocking, unacceptable and undemocratic, emphasizing that Croats are Catholic people, cherishing traditions by which they have lived for centuries.&lt;ref name="Košić"&gt;{{citation |url=http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/229789/Default.aspx |title=Biskup Vlado Košić: Ova vlast nije uz narod! |trans-title=Bishop Vlado Košić: This government is not of the people! |date=December 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 23, 2013 |publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused the Government of [[atheism|atheizing]] the population, being eager to erase traditional values, and has called for Governments' resignation.&lt;ref name="Košić"/&gt;

On June 6, 2014, Košić was among the people on [[Zagreb International Airport|Zagreb Airport]] who have welcomed convicted war criminal [[Dario Kordić]] after his release from the [[Graz-Karlau Prison]] where he served 25 years sentence for [[war crime]]s committed against the [[Bosniak]] population during the 1992–94 [[Bosniak-Croat war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/indcident-na-doceku-daria-kordica-muskarac-izvikivao--ubojico--ubojico--pa-ga-okupljeni-poceli-udarati/1197191/ |title=INCIDENT NA DOČEKU DARIA KORDIĆA Muškarac izvikivao 'ubojico, ubojico' pa ga okupljeni počeli udarati |website=Jutarnji.hr |date=2014-06-06 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After media in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the [[Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as well as some NGOs expressed their dismay of Košić's act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/bosanski-muslimani-traze-hitan-odgovor-od-pape--zasto-su-duznosnici-katolicke-crkve-docekali-osudenog-ratnog-zlocinca--/1199034/ |title=BOSANSKI MUSLIMANI TRAŽE HITAN ODGOVOR OD PAPE 'Zašto su dužnosnici Katoličke Crkve dočekali osuđenog ratnog zločinca?' |website=Jutarnji.hr |date=2014-06-13 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; he gave an interview for Sarajevo Catholic Weekly magazine in which he stated that he doesn't believe that Kordić was a war criminal, but was rather a victim of political games regardless of [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] verdict and all evidences that it was based on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/biskup-kosic--krdic-je-nepravedno-osuden/1200426/ |title=Biskup Košić: Krdić je nepravedno osuđen |website=Jutarnji.hr |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2015, President and Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]]  was presented with a petition for the introduction of a Croatian fascist [[Ustaše]] movement salute [[Za dom spremni]] to the official use in the [[Republic of Croatia Armed Forces|Croatian Armed Forces]]. One of the petition signatories was bishop Košić. President Grabar-Kitarović  immediately rejected petition calling it "frivolous, unacceptable and provocative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/bizarnu-peticiju-potpisao-i-simunic-od-predsjednice-traze-da-predlozi-uvodenje-pozdrava--za-dom-spremni--u-oruzane-snage-/1404536/ |title=BIZARNU PETICIJU POTPISAO I ŠIMUNIĆ Od predsjednice traže da predloži uvođenje pozdrava 'Za dom spremni' u Oružane snage! |website=Jutarnji.hr |date=2015-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop of Dubrovnik [[Mate Uzinić]] stated in an interview for [[Jutarnji list]] that salute "Za dom spremni" cannot be acceptable to Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/dubrovacki-biskup-msgr--mate-uzinic--zasto-crkvi-pozdrav--za-dom-spremni--ne-moze-biti-prihvatljiv-/1440210/ |title=DUBROVAČKI BISKUP MSGR.

On December 21, 2015, Košić wrote a Facebook post referring  to the possible coalition agreement between [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) and [[Bridge of Independent Lists]] (MOST) in which he called leader of MOST [[Božo Petrov]] "a sucker and a traitor that throws his party into the jaws of the Communists", and leader of SDP and at the time incumbent Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanović]] "a thief and a fraud". After the media reported about his post general public expressed its dissatisfaction which resulted in Košić deleting his Facebook account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/izbori2015/vlado-kosic-da-ce-petrov-tako-nasjesti-i-odvesti-most-u-ralje-komunista-nisam-se-nadao-1046580 |title=Vlado Košić: Da će Petrov tako nasjesti i odvesti Most u ralje komunista, nisam se nadao - Večernji.hr |website=Vecernji.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/obitelj-boze-petrova-tesko-je-podnijela-napad-biskupa-koscica--komunisti-su-hrvatskom-narodu-nanijeli-najvise-zla-u-njegovoj-povijesti--/1484873/ |title=OBITELJ BOŽE PETROVA TEŠKO JE PODNIJELA NAPAD BISKUPA KOŠČIĆA 'Komunisti su hrvatskom narodu nanijeli najviše zla u njegovoj povijesti!' |website=Jutarnji.hr |date=2015-12-23 |accessdate=2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2016, on the mass celebrated for the ''Assumption of Mary'', Košić, during his homily, urged people to vote on [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]] "for those who will rid us of yugo-communist heritage and carry out [[lustration]]." He also refereed to the trial to [[Josip Perković]] and Zdravko Mustač who were found guilty by German court in a first-instance verdict for murder of Croat nationalist émigré [[Stjepan Đureković]], stating that "not only two members of secret service ([[State Security Administration|UDBA]]) were convicted in Germany but the entire yugo-communist system that killed Croatian patriots abroad as well. It's not clearly stated, so I repeat: communist [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] was convicted as a terrorist state and its Communist regime as criminal because it killed Croats abroad! So today, those who protected killers and the criminal regime can no longer rule in Croatia." However, all of this is false. In addition, he urged God to "remove and prevent forever in their intentions all of those who are serving diabolical dragon and [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piše: F.Ć.

On June 14. 2017, Košić published a furious Facebook post in which he attacked conservative Croatian Prime Minister [[Andrej Plenković]] ([[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]]) for entering a coalition with center-left [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats]] (HNS). Košić wrote that Plenković brought entire country in "grave difficulties by entering a coalition with his yesterday's enemies", adding that Plenković "disregarded city of [[Sisak]] in which HDZ's fraction struggles were used by the town's new "comrade mayor" [referring to social democrat [[Kristina Ikić Baniček]]] to get elected". He concluded his post by saying that Plenković didn't care for Croatian people "which is 86% Roman Catholic" and that he would continue praying for Plenković, despite that "God refuses to hear my prayers due to Plenković's actions.".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During Sunday mass on June 26, 2017 ([[Statehood Day (Croatia)|Croatian Statehood Day]]), Košić called for revision of "fake [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]] history", which according to him, [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communists]] imposed to Croatian people adding that such version of history is still being imposed even today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hr.n1info.com/a214377/Vijesti/Kosic-Nakon-odluke-o-suverenosti-pocela-je-agresija-na-RH.html|title=Košić: Nakon odluke o suverenosti počela je agresija na RH|work=N1 HR|access-date=2017-06-25|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Croatian police arrested a group of [[Croatian Defence Forces]] veterans for yelling "[[Za dom spremni]]" on August 5, 2017, Košić published another Facebook post in which he publicly invited Croatian Minister of Interior [[Davor Božinović]] to resign and proclaimed Plenković's cabinet "anti-Croatian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/biskup-na-facebooku-zatrazio-ministrovu-ostavku-mup-mu-imao-potrebu-odgovoriti-priopcenjem/6448906/|title=Biskup na Facebooku zatražio ministrovu ostavku, MUP mu imao potrebu odgovoriti priopćenjem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2017. Košić stated that "[[Ustaše|ustashism]] isn't a [[fascism]] but a legitimate military act in defence of Croatia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/biskup-kosic-ustastvo-nije-bilo-fasizam-nego-obrana-hrvatske/1003495.aspx|title=Biskup Košić: Ustaštvo nije bilo fašizam nego obrana Hrvatske|access-date=2017-10-27|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windsor''' is a town in [[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]], Vermont, United States. As the "Birthplace of [[Vermont]]", the town is where the [[Constitution of Vermont (1777)|Constitution of Vermont]] was adopted in 1777, thus marking the founding of the [[Vermont Republic]]—a [[sovereign state]] until 1791 when Vermont joined the United States. Over much of its history, Windsor was home to a variety of manufacturing enterprises. The population was 3,553 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Windsor town, Windsor County, Vermont| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

[[File:Windsor, Vermont (2675176211).jpg|thumb|[Print of Windsor from 1886 by [[L.R. Burleigh]] woth list of landmarks depicted]]
One of the [[New Hampshire grants]], Windsor was chartered as a town on July 6, 1761, by colonial governor [[Benning Wentworth]]. It was first settled in August 1764 by Captain Steele Smith and his family from [[Farmington, Connecticut]]. In 1777, the signers of the [[Constitution of the Vermont Republic]] met at [[Old Constitution House]], a tavern at the time, to declare independence from the British Empire (the [[Vermont Republic]] would not become a state until 1791).  In 1820, it was the state's largest town, a thriving center for [[trade]] and [[agriculture]]. In 1835, the first [[dam]] was built across Mill Brook to provide [[water power]]. Factories made [[gun]]s, [[machinery]], [[tinware]], [[furniture]] and [[horse harness|harnesses]]. The community is named for [[Windsor, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Profile for Windsor, Vermont, VT"/&gt;

In 1846, [[American Precision Museum|Robbins and Lawerence]] received a government contract to manufacture firearms. Using advanced machine tools to produce interchangeable parts, they and their associates established factories in the [[Connecticut River]] valley and throughout New England. Two factories, now both closed, sustained the economy of Windsor: Cone Automatic Machine Company and a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] plant.

[[Image:Main Street, Windsor, VT.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street circa 1910]]
Windsor village began development at the end of the 18th century and achieved importance in Vermont history as the location of the framing of the constitution of Vermont. It is known as the birthplace of Vermont, where the state constitution was signed, and acted as the first capital until 1805 when [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]] became the official state capital.&lt;ref name="Profile for Windsor, Vermont, VT"/&gt;

Commerce prospered due to the village's location on the banks of the Connecticut River where several smaller streams run into it. The economy improved in the mid-19th century when Windsor became the first town in the state to break ground for the railroad with the construction of a rail depot. [[Windsor-Mt. Ascutney (Amtrak station)|Windsor Station]] connected the town to out-of-state markets. It was after the railroad went through that the area was discovered by tourists.

Windsor's war memorial, the City Center Veterans Memorial, was created by sculptor [[Lawrence Nowlan]].&lt;ref name=bmta&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Sculptor commissioned to complete Joe Frazier statue has died|url=http://www.timesargus.com/article/20130802/NEWS03/708029923/0/FEATURES10|work=[[Barre Montpelier Times Argus]]|publisher=|date=2013-08-02|accessdate=2013-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221231935/http://www.timesargus.com/article/20130802/NEWS03/708029923/0/FEATURES10|archivedate=2014-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 19.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (51.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), of which 19.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (50.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is land and 0.2&amp;nbsp;square mile (0.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (1.06%) is water. Home to part of [[Mount Ascutney]], Windsor is situated beside the [[Connecticut River]].

The town is crossed by [[Interstate 91]], [[U.S. Route 5]], [[Vermont Route 12]], [[Vermont Route 44]], and [[Vermont Route 44A]]. It is bordered by the town of [[Weathersfield, Vermont|Weathersfield]] to the south, [[West Windsor, Vermont|West Windsor]] to the west, and [[Hartland, Vermont|Hartland]] to the north. To the east, across the Connecticut River, is [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], to which Windsor is connected by the [[Cornish–Windsor Covered Bridge]], one of the longest covered bridges in the world.

In [[common law]], a '''writ''' (Anglo-Saxon ''gewrit'', Latin ''breve'')&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Steinberg ed., ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963) p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial [[jurisdiction]]; in modern usage, this body is generally a [[court]]. [[Warrant (legal)|Warrants]], [[prerogative writ]]s, and [[subpoena]]s are common types of writ, but many forms exist and have existed.

In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English monarch to a specified person to undertake a specified action; for example, in the [[Feudalism in England|feudal era]] a military summons by the king to one of his [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] to appear dressed for battle with retinue at a certain place and time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Palgrave]] (1788-1861), ''Parliamentary Writs and Writs of Military Summons'' (2 volumes, 1827 and 1834)&lt;/ref&gt; An early usage survives in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] in a [[writ of election]], which is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] and, in Australia, by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] for elections for the House of Representatives, or State Governors for State elections) to local officials ([[High Sheriff]]s of every county in the historical UK) to hold a [[general election]]. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''the Community of the Realm in 13th C England'' (London 1970) p.66&lt;/ref&gt; (then consisting primarily of the [[House of Lords]]) whose advice was considered valuable or who were particularly influential, and who were thereby deemed to have been created "[[Hereditary peer|barons by writ]]".

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Habeas corpus]] --&gt;

===Origins===
The writ was a unique development of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, and consisted of a brief administrative order, authenticated (innovatively) by a seal.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Written in the vernacular, they generally made a land grant, or conveyed instructions to a local court. In the beginning, writs were the document issued by the King's Chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the King about an injustice, after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; [[William the Conqueror]] took over the system unchanged, but was to extend it in two ways: first, writs became mainly framed in Latin, not Anglo-Saxon; second, they covered an increasing range of royal commands and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;D. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (London 1966) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors, but it was not until [[Henry II of England|Henry the Second]] that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law.&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 305 and p. 332-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs could take two main forms, open (patent) for all to read, and 'letters close' for one or more specified individuals alone.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''the Community of the Realm in 13th C England'' (London 1970) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

The development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of "off-the-shelf" justice designed to enable the English law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures. The complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer, which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions.  The development was part of the establishment of a [[Court of Common Pleas]], for dealing with commonly made complaints by subjects of the crown, for example: "someone has damaged my property". The previous system of justice at the royal court of Chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming. Thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary, in most cases, to have a case heard in one of the Royal Courts, such as the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] or [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]]. Some franchise courts, especially in the [[County Palatine|Counties Palatine]], had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs. The writ was "served" on (delivered in person to) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ, or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient.

Where a [[plaintiff]] wished to have a case heard by a local court, or by an [[Eyre (legal term)|Eyre]] if one happened to be visiting the County, there would be no need to obtain a writ. Actions in local courts could usually be started by an informal complaint. However, if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of Royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the King's courts, then he would need a writ, a command of the King, to enable him to do this. Initially for [[common law]], recourse to the King's courts was unusual, and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay. For most Royal Courts, the writ would usually have been purchased from the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], although the court of the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]], being in essence another government department, was able to issue its own writs.

While originally writs were exceptional, or at least non-routine devices, [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] suggests that by the time of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154-1189), the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in England.

At first, new writs were drafted to fit each new situation, although in practice the clerks of the Chancery would use wording from previously issued writs, with suitable adjustments, often taken from reference books containing collections of forms of writ, much as in modern times lawyers frequently use fixed precedents or boilerplate, rather than re-inventing the wording of a new legal document. The problem with this approach was that a plaintiff's rights and available forms of action at his disposal, would be defined, and in most cases limited, by the limited variety of writs available to him. Thus the power to create new writs was akin to the power to create new rights, a form of extra-parliamentary legislation. Moreover, a writ, if one could be found fitting the plaintiff's case, provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court, often controlled by a lesser [[nobility|noble]], and instead have it heard by the King's judges. The nobility thus saw the creation of new writs as an erosion of their influence.

Over time, opposition to the creation of new writs by the Chancery increased. For example, in 1256 a court was asked to quash a writ as "novel, unheard of, and against reason" (Abbot of Lilleshall v Harcourt (1256) 96 SS xxix 44). Ultimately in 1258 the King was forced to accept the [[Provisions of Oxford]], which among other things, prohibited the creation of new forms of writ without the sanction of the [[Curia Regis|King's council]]. New writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of Parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static, each writ defining a particular [[form of action]]. It was the role and expertise of a [[solicitor]] to select on his client's behalf the appropriate writ for the proposed legal action. These were purchased from the court by payment of a fee. A [[barrister]] would then be hired by the solicitor to speak for his client in court.

=== Rationalisation of writs ===

With the abolition of the Forms of Action in 1832 and 1833, a profusion of writs was no longer needed, and one uniform writ came into use. After 1852 the need to state the name of the form of action was also abolished. In 1875 the form of writ was altered so that it conformed more to the [[subpoena]] used in the Chancery. A writ was a summons from the Crown, to the parties to the action, with on its back the substance of the action set out, together with a 'prayer' requesting a remedy from the court (for example damages). In 1980 the need for writs to be written in the name of the Crown was ended. From that time, a writ simply required the parties to appear..&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court (Writ and Appearance) 1979 (Statutory Instrument 1979, No. 1716)[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1979/1716/made], discussed in House of Lords in 1980,[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1980/feb/07/rules-of-the-supreme-court-writ-and]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed  part of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]]. The procedure in a [[County Court]], which was established by statute, was to issue a 'summons'.

In 1999 the [[Woolf Reforms]] unified most of the procedure of the Supreme Court and the County Court in civil matters. These reforms brought in the Civil Procedure Rules. Under these almost all civil actions, other than those connected with insolvency, are now commenced by the completion of a 'Claim Form' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'Writ', 'Originating Application', or 'Summons' (see Rules 7 and 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules).

==Writ of election==
In some [[Westminster system]]s, for example Canada and some other [[parliament]]ary systems, the phrase '[[dropping the writ]]' refers colloquially to a [[dissolution of parliament]] and the beginning of an [[election campaign]] to form a new one. This phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a [[writ of election]] must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the [[High Sheriff]]s of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections.

==United States law==
Early [[law of the United States]] inherited the traditional English writ system, in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law [[court]]s were authorized to grant. The [[All Writs Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorizes [[United States federal courts]] to "issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." However, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], adopted in 1938 to govern [[civil procedure]] in the [[United States district court]]s, provide that there is only one [[form of action]] in civil cases, and explicitly abolish certain writs by name. Relief formerly available by a writ is now normally available by a [[lawsuit]] (civil action) or a [[motion (legal)|motion]] in a pending civil action. Nonetheless, a few writs have escaped abolition and remain in current use in the U.S. federal courts:

*The writ of [[habeas corpus]], usually used to test the legality of a prisoner's detention, has expressly been preserved. It is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution (Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the United States federal courts, the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by [[State court (United States)|state courts]]. The writ's application does not stop there: the Supreme Court has held the writ of habeas corpus open to all individuals held by the federal government, including Guantanamo Bay detainees. See [[Boumediene v. Bush]]. 
*By statute, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] uses the writ of [[certiorari]] to review cases from the United States courts of appeals or from the state courts.
*In extraordinary circumstances, the [[United States court of appeals]] can use the [[common law]] writ of [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] under the All Writs Act to control proceedings in the district courts.
*Some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case, a United States district court may use the common law writ of [[error coram nobis]] under the All Writs Act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available.
*The United States district courts normally follow state- in the United States federal courts but are almost never used in practice. In modern times, the All Writs Act is most commonly used as authority for federal courts to issue [[injunction]]s to protect their jurisdiction or effectuate their judgments.

The situation in the courts of the various [[U.S. state]]s varies from state to state but is often similar to that in the federal courts. Some states continue to use writ procedures, such as [[quo warranto]], that have been abolished as a procedural matter in federal courts.

In an attempt to purge [[Latin]] from the language of the law, [[California law]] has for many years used the term ''writ of mandate'' in place of ''writ of mandamus'', and ''writ of review'' in place of ''writ of certiorari''.

===Prerogative writs===
{{main article|Prerogative writ}}

The "prerogative" writs are a subset of the class of writs, those that are to be heard ahead of any other cases on a court's docket except other such writs. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''.

The due process for ''petitions for'' such writs is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of nonauthority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. In this they differ from a motion in a civil process in which the burden of proof is on the movant, and in which there can be a question of [[standing (law)|standing]].

===Other writs===

== Indian law ==
Under the [[India]]n legal system, jurisdiction to issue '[[prerogative writ]]s' is given to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], and to the High Courts of Judicature of all [[States of India|Indian states]]. Parts of the law relating to writs are set forth in the [[Constitution of India]]. The Supreme Court, the highest in the country, may issue writs under Article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and under Articles 139 for enforcement of rights other than Fundamental Rights, while High Courts, the superior courts of the States, may issue writs under Articles 226. '''&lt;u&gt;The Constitution broadly provides for five kinds of "prerogative" writs: ''habeas corpus'', ''certiorari'', ''mandamus'', ''quo warranto'' and prohibition.&lt;/u&gt;''' 

* The ''[[writ of prohibition]]'' is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court. Thus, the higher court transfers the case to itself.
* The ''[[writ of habeas corpus]]'' is issued to a detaining authority, ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court, along with the cause of his or her detention. If the detention is found to be illegal, the court issues an order to set the person free.
* The ''[[writ of certiorari]]'' is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review, together with all supporting files, evidence and documents, usually with the intention of overruling the judgement of the lower court. It is one of the mechanisms by which the [[Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of India|fundamental rights]] of the citizens are upheld.
* The ''[[writ of mandamus]]'' is issued to a subordinate court, an officer of government, or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties.
* The ''[[writ of quo warranto]]'' is issued against a person who claims or usurps a public office. Through this writ the court inquires 'by what authority' the person supports his or her claim.

'''Wu Han''' ({{zh|s=吴晗}}; August 11, 1909 – October 11, 1969) was a Chinese historian and politician. Wu was one of the most important historians in the development of modern historical scholarship in China during the 1930s and 1940s.

In the 1940s he was a leading member of the [[China Democratic League]], a non-aligned political organization during most of the [[Chinese civil war]] which eventually threw its weight behind the [[Communist Party of China]]. After 1949, he served as the Vice Mayor of Beijing.

In November 1965, at the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]], he came under attack for a play he wrote about an upright Ming dynasty official called ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]'', which was later branded as an anti-Mao allegory. His political downfall also resulted in the purge of Beijing Mayor [[Peng Zhen]]. He died in prison in 1969.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Wu Han was born in [[Yiwu]], [[Zhejiang]] in 1909. With support from the Wu clan organization and  with the money from selling his mother's jewelry, he attended university preparatory schools in [[Hangzhou]] and then in Shanghai, where he was inspired by the lectures of [[Hu Shi]]. He entered [[Tsinghua University]] in 1931 and came under the influence of [[Tsiang Tingfu]]. Since he was responsible for the support of his brother and sister, he was unable to go abroad for study. Wu stayed at Tsinghua as a teaching assistant but began to publish important articles on Ming dynasty history using critical techniques to resolve old controversies and raise new questions.

===1937 - 1953===
When the war with Japan broke out in 1937, Wu joined [[National Southwestern Associated University]] in [[Kunming]]. While there, he wrote a full scale biography of the founder of the Ming dynasty, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], published in 1943, expanded and revised in 1947. He became a leading intellectual in the democratic movement of the 1940s, as well as a widely published essayist. Through his part in the [[China Democratic League]] he was enlisted in the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.

When the new [[United Front]] was founded, as a member of the Democratic League, Wu was asked to take the position of Vice Mayor of Beijing in charge of education and cultural affairs for the 6 county municipal area that became a model for municipalities across the PRC. In the 1950s, Wu represented China abroad on cultural tours and popularized his research at home, using figures from history as models and allegorical figures. He became a member of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] secretly in the mid-50s; this was not known by his colleagues or by Party members except at the very highest level. It was only revealed in the Cultural Revolution by the Red Guard accusations after they found his files.

===Later years===
Wu wrote a series of articles  and a play originally published in 1951 and revised many times, on the life of [[Hai Rui]], a Ming dynasty official. In 1960 Wu's [[Beijing opera]], ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]''  became a great success. In November 1965 [[Yao Wenyuan]], later one of the [[Gang of Four]], fired one of the opening shots of the [[Cultural Revolution]] when he attacked Wu and his play on the grounds that Hai Rui was metaphorically equated with [[Peng Dehuai]], and therefore Mao himself with the un-approachable Ming emperor. Wu admitted ideological mistakes but denied that his motives were counter-revolutionary.

Over the next months the controversy grew, and Wu was finally jailed. Although there were reports that Wu Han committed suicide while in prison in 1969, fellow prisoners later reported that he was beaten in prison about a year before he died. It is also thought his tuberculosis may have recurred so it cannot be established how he died.
