{{Orphan|date=June 2016}}
The '''Advanced LIGO Documentary Project''' is a collaboration formed in the summer of 2015 among Caltech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Director [[Les Guthman]] to make the definitive documentary about the [[Advanced LIGO]] project's search for, and expected first detection of, [[gravitational waves]]; and to record a longitudinal video archive of the project for future researchers and historians.  The feature documentary, "LIGO," will be completed in the spring of 2018 and released in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/ligofilms/ecpanel1 |title=''LIGO Film Preview at Explorers Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second documentary focusing on the post-discovery era for [[LIGO]] and its upcoming third science run will be completed in the spring of 2019.

==Nobel Prize==
On October 3, 2017, [[Rainer Weiss]], [[Kip Thorne]] and [[Barry Barish]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for LIGO's historic first observation of gravitational waves in September 2015, one month after principal photography began on the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html |title=''LIGO Nobel Prize Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On September 14, 2015, the Advanced LIGO Documentary team was on location filming at the [[LIGO Livingston Observatory]] when the detection was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligo.org/magazine/LIGO-magazine-issue-8.pdf#page=9|title=''LIGO Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Over the next five months, it had exclusive media access to document the long, careful process of scientific verification that was conducted by the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]] to confirm that the received signal was in fact a gravitational wave, as predicted by [[Albert Einstein]] more than 100 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ligo.org/magazine/LIGO-magazine-issue-8.pdf#page=14|title=''LIGO Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The detection was announced by [[LIGO]] at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington DC on February 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century |title=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its filming of the secret internal confirmation months of the [[gravitational wave detection]] and LIGO's continuing breakthrough science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817 |title=''GW170817 Announcement''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Advanced LIGO Documentary Project filmed LIGO's Nobel Prize week in Stockholm; three important post-detection lectures by Thorne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMxo98Y-KoE |title=''Kip Thorne 2016 Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqJ0fXWRays |title=''Barry Barish 2016 Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LIGO astrophysicist [[Alessandra Buonanno]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmZnE6Ut3p4&amp;feature=youtu.be |title=''Alessandra Buonanno 2016 Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also filmed the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]] semi-annual meeting at [[CERN]] two weeks after its August 2017 detection of two colliding neutron stars, which launched the new age of [[multi-messenger astronomy]] and lead LIGO astrophysicist Daniel Holz to tell the ''New York Times'', "I can’t think of a similar situation in the field of science in my lifetime, where a single event provides so many staggering insights about our universe.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/science/ligo-neutron-stars-collision.html?_r=0 |title=''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the Advanced LIGO Documentary Project produced the two LIGO programs at the [[World Science Festival]] in New York, including the main stage panel moderated by theoretical physicist and best-selling author [[Brian Greene]], featuring five of the key physicists behind the historic detection, including [[Rai Weiss]] and [[Barry Barish]], and four short videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/203778188 |title=''Four Videos for World Science Festival 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Project's exclusive footage inside the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj6vV3T4ok8&amp;t=154s |title=''LIGO 2016 World Science Festival Panel on YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program streams on YouTube and as of January 2018 has been viewed almost 1.6 million times, making it the second-most viewed full-length program in the World Science Festival's ten years of streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj6vV3T4ok8&amp;t=154s |title=''LIGO 2016 World Science Festival Panel on YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2016, the Advanced LIGO Documentary Project received a two-year grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to continue its filming of the LIGO project, now with a focus on the new era of [[gravitational-wave astronomy]] ushered in by the historic detection of [[GW150914]]. In early 2017, [[MathWorks]] joined as sponsoring partner.   

The first video of an eight-part web series, A DISCOVERY THAT SHOOK THE WORLD, produced under the NSF grant, was released in spring 2017: ''Mirrors That Hang on Glass Threads.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/203776385 |title=''Mirrors That Hang on Glass Threads''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second episode, ''The New Age of Gravitational Wave Astronomy,'' was released in summer 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/226227194 |title=''The New Age of Gravitational Wave Astronomy''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Episode 3, ''GW170817: So Many Astonishing Insights About Our Universe,'' was released in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/249961139 |title=''GW170817: So Many Astonishing Insights About Our Universe''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video series streams on YouTube,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVpvE6dOtP58hyzYaBDi8nQ |title=Advanced LIGO Documentary Project YouTube Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; all four LIGO websites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/video/ligo20170811v |title=''LIGO Lab Website''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the Advanced LIGO Documentary Project's Vimeo Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vimeo.com/ligofilms |title=''Advanced LIGO Documentary Project Vimeo Site''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allelomimetic behaviour''' or '''allomimetic''' behaviour is a range of activities in which the performance of a behaviour increases the probability of that behaviour being performed by other nearby animals. Allelomimetic behaviour is sometimes called contagious behaviour and has strong components of [[Social facilitation in animals|social facilitation]], [[imitation]], and group coordination. It is usually considered to occur between members of the same species. An alternate definition is that allelomimetic behaviour is a more intense or more frequent response or the initiation of an already known response, when others around the individual are engaged in the same behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is often referred to as synchronous behaviour, mimetic behaviour, imitative behaviour, and social facilitation.

Allelomimetic behaviour is displayed in all animals and can occur in any stage of life, but usually starts at a young age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=R.M.|date=July 1996|title=Allelomimetic behavior|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0737-0806(96)80221-8|journal=Journal of Equine Veterinary Science|volume=16|issue=7|pages=282–284|doi=10.1016/s0737-0806(96)80221-8|issn=0737-0806}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour will continue throughout life, especially when an individual is living in a large group that emphasizes [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gautrais|first=Jacques|last2=Michelena|first2=Pablo|last3=Sibbald|first3=Angela|last4=Bon|first4=Richard|last5=Deneubourg|first5=Jean-Louis|date=November 2007|title=Allelomimetic synchronization in Merino sheep|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.02.020|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1443–1454|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.02.020|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohesion is seen as a prerequisite for group living, with synchronous activity being crucial for social cohesion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, animals in large cohesive groups face trade-offs when allelomimetic behaviour is adopted. If the behaviour is adopted then the risk of predation or capture decreases significantly but the inter-individual competition for immediate resources, such as food, mates, and space, will increase when cohesion is still stressed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eklund|first=Beatrix|last2=Jensen|first2=Per|date=February 2011|title=Domestication effects on behavioural synchronization and individual distances in chickens (Gallus gallus)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2010.12.010|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=86|issue=2|pages=250–256|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.12.010|issn=0376-6357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many collective group decisions in animals are the result of allelomimetism and can be explained by allelomimetic behaviours. Some examples are the cockroaches choosing a single aggregation site, schooling behaviours in fishes, and pheromone-based path selection in ants that allows all the workers to go down the same path to a specific food source.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Allelomimetic behaviour can also be seen as an animal welfare indicator. For example, if cattle do not have enough room to all lie down simultaneously then it indicates that there are not enough resources present and this can result in lameness of the animals that are forced to stand.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoye|first=Sophie|last2=Porter|first2=Mason A.|last3=Stamp Dawkins|first3=Marian|date=November 2012|title=Synchronized lying in cattle in relation to time of day|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.06.028|journal=Livestock Science|volume=149|issue=1-2|pages=70–73|doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2012.06.028|issn=1871-1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allomimicry is affected by circadian rhythms and circadian cycles of activity within groups which can give the overall appearance of poor animal welfare, if allomimetic behaviour were to be used as a welfare indicator then it must be measured several times throughout the course of a day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It should be noted however, that most mechanisms involved in performing allelomimetic behaviour do not require circadian rhythms to function. Decisions at the individual level are, more often than not, enough to encourage allelomimetism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patterns of allelomimetic behaviour can vary from species to species and can possibly explain other behaviours seen in the animal kingdom.

==Function==
'''Group cohesion''': Social animals often benefit by behaving in a similar manner to others within their group.  This means that when animals switch behaviours, e.g. from lying to grazing, a degree of synchrony is beneficial.  Sometimes this synchrony can be provided by environmental cues, at other times it is provided by the group members themselves. In 1978, Clayton wrote "...where environmental stimuli only provide gross synchrony, socially facilitated behaviour
will provide finer-scale synchrony, and, what is functionally important, greater cohesion of the social group’.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Clayton, D.A., (1978). Socially facilitated behavior. Quarterly Review of
Biology, 53: 373-392&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
Synchronous behaviour is also threatened when animals in a mixed-sex herd have differing nutritional or physical necessities. This causes group instability which often splits the herd up into two separate groups; generally all male and all female, to recreate the mimetic behaviour in a smaller, same-sex group that has more similar needs to the individual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Synchronized, allelomimetic behaviour is also affected by many factors, such as age, general group size, sex, space, resource availability, and domestication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Domestication can also be seen as a threat to allelomimetic behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process of domestication removes many threats like predation, food shortages, and competition from many individuals for breeding by providing basically unlimited food and resources while providing protection from outside predators. Domestication may favour less synchronization for animals and provide an adaptation to mimetic behaviour to save energy in domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Domestication also changes the inter-individual distances between animals and behavioural synchrony in general, both of which are important for anti-predator strategies and responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== In horses ==
[[File:Horses Grazing - geograph.org.uk - 836886.jpg|thumb|444x444px|Allelomimetic behaviour shown in grazing horses. Postural imitation is seen in regards to the stance and position of the legs.]]
Horses, like many animals, learn through imitation of their parents, most often the mother or "[[Mare|broodmare]]", or the owner of the foal if the broodmare is not available. If the foal is paired with its mother it will not only mimic the mare's walking style and speed, but it will also mimic the mare's temperament and general behaviours. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If a foal was to spend much of its early life around a mare that had an unstable temperament, irrational fears and was difficult to work with then it would grow to be an unstable adult that would develop behavioural abnormalities such as balking. Miller (1996) also adds that behavioural issues can also be removed through allelomimetic processes. Balking is a common behaviour in horses and mules that occur from insecurities and fears, and is observed as hesitance with a general fear of moving forward due to the possibility of attack or invasion of their personal space. This behaviour can be eliminated if the owner is fearless, looking forward with their head raised high and marching in place. This shows the horse that there is nothing to fear and eventually the horse will mimic the owner's behaviour, sync their gate to the owner and follow along.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Repeating this behaviour as needed will eventually allow the horse to fully incorporate the owner's fearless behaviour into its repertoire and prevent balking from reoccurring. Bad habits are also learned through mimicry if the vast majority of the animals present a specific habit.[[Cribbing (horse)|Cribbing]] is an example of one such habit. If a foal is raised in an environment where this abnormal behaviour is performed by the older members of the team, then it will mimic the habit as well, even if the behaviour is dangerous to the individual's health.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, the same mimetic behaviour that produces these bad habits can help remove them as well. If a broodmare is unable to train her offspring then it falls to the owner to properly train the foal on proper walking gait, speed, and normal behaviours. If the owner spends enough time with their foal keeping a proper stance (ie, an erect, unmoving torso and flexed knees while walking) then the foal will mimic and perform the proper movements for the rest of its life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== In sheep ==
[[File:The famous sheep herd at the Ginkelse hei near Ede - panoramio.jpg|thumb|475x475px|A herd of sheep spreading out and displaying mimetic foraging behaviour]]
Sheep provide a good basis for the evaluation of allelomimetic behaviour due to their large group sizes and social behaviour. Using them as an experimental subject allows for the determination of the imitative quality and intensity of allelomimetic behaviour within a specific herd. Merino sheep, or ''[[Sheep|Ovis aries]],'' are a prey species and a domesticated breed of sheep that require a healthy balance between predator avoidance and foraging space for each individual in the herd.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginelli|first=Francesco|last2=Peruani|first2=Fernando|last3=Pillot|first3=Marie-Helène|last4=Chaté|first4=Hugues|last5=Theraulaz|first5=Guy|last6=Bon|first6=Richard|date=2015|title=Intermittent collective dynamics emerge from conflicting imperatives in sheep herds|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26465488|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=112|issue=41|pages=12729–12734}}&lt;/ref&gt; They achieve this balance by spreading out to forage for a period of time then quickly running back to the centre of the herd, creating a fastpacking event.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; A fastpacking event is specifically when an individual on the outskirts of the herd changes its behaviour from grazing to running and moves towards the centre of the herd. Fastpacking events are seen as an adaptive behaviour for reducing predation due to the intensity of the response presented in other sheep when one individual is seen running from the outer edges to the centre of the herd.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This behavioural change is also referred to as activation/inactivation rates or switching behaviour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This change influences other sheep to start running to the centre of the herd until all sheep simultaneously stop in the middle and form a tightly packed herd.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The cycle will restart when the herd starts to spread out to forage again. The individual that is displaying the switching behaviour from inactivity (grazing in one spot) to activity (running towards the centre of the herd) or vice versa is generally referred to as the herd leader, and other individuals who mimic the switch from inactivity to activity or activity to inactivity are displaying allelomimetic behaviour.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These activation and inactivation rates are generally more strongly presented in males compared to females and increase as the number of individuals performing an activity increase which is a good indication of imitation present in the herd.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, if a herd had the majority of individuals active the likelihood of another random individual becoming active increases. The same goes for a herd with a majority of individuals being inactive. In experiments, these events are not specific to a singular spot or caused by any external stimuli that would warrant an alarm response in the sheep. In an experiment performed by Gautrais, members of the same sex more often performed mimetic behaviour with each other than when compared to members of a mixed-sex group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Gautrais also focused on behavioural synchrony of activity and inactivity since cohesion of a group involves individuals being active and inactive at the same time rather than syncing every activity to another individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Even in the absence of other animals, individuals will switch between behaviours that require activity and inactivity (''such as digestion, inactivity is good to promote digestion or hunger outweighing the need for rest''). Gautrais believes that this physiological need is what prompted the first individual in his herd experiment to switch from activity to inactivity or vice versa and the other members in the herd to follow suit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, as the number of individuals in a heard decreases, the option to perform mimetic behaviour also decreases. This creates a higher rate of spontaneous switching between activity and inactivity-related behaviours. In contrast, the larger the herd is, the more likely it is for mimetic behaviours to occur with spontaneous switching behaviour occurring in the "herd leader", with other members following suit in a brief period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is due to the number of [[Conspecifics|con-specifics]] present at any given time. If the herd is a small group then there are fewer con-specifics which gives less opportunity for imitation to occur in any given individual and a higher rate of switching from inactivity to activity to inactivity will occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two ideas are proposed when the original running individual can recruit others into the running group and the herd as a whole can coordinate when to stop running during these fastpacking events. The first idea is that the initiation and inhibition of the packing event is based on allelomimetic effects in local interactions, and the second idea was that a close enough distance between herd neighbours will stop running behaviour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These conclusions stem from an idea about optimization processes in sheep that, at an individual level, allows for the balance of exploring as much space as possible to avoid competition for food and keeping in contact with other herd members to avoid predation and reinforce herd cohesion. These optimization processes can adjust the allelomimetic interaction strengths between individuals to ensure both of the above necessities are met.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== In cattle ==
[[File:Cows in mountain.JPG|thumb|280x280px|Social facilitation seen in cattle from all the pictured cattle resting at the same time]]
The synchronous behaviour that is displayed in cattle is what is typically thought of when discussing allelomimetic behaviour.  When the necessary resources for survival, such as food, water, and shelter, are sufficient then cattle will display postural synchrony, lying down or standing while other members of the herd are doing the same.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This phenomenon, also referred to as [[Social facilitation in animals|social facilitation]], occurs in both free-range cattle that live in pastures, and cattle that live primarily in barns. Social facilitation (or allelomimicry) is the first of two main ideas behind cattle mimicking each other's behaviour until the herd acts synchronously, whether it be lying down, standing, or grazing together.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Stoye and Porter, one member of the herd will alter its behaviour (ie. standing to lying down or vice versa) and its nearest neighbour will mimic the behaviour, this behaviour will travel across the herd until all members are performing one action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Stoye and Porter also noted that it was more likely for a cow to display the same behaviour as its nearest neighbour compared to a randomly selected cow from the herd.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This behaviour continues despite the appearance of free will of an individual to graze/stand or lie down, even when the herd is stationary. The second idea behind synchronized behaviour is called concurrent or combined response. This dictates that the collective behaviour is a mere coincidence of each individual animal's decision to change their behaviour based on external (the discovery of food) or internal (exhaustion, the need for rest/food, or similar daily schedules as other members) factors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A human example of a concurrent behaviour is rush hour, many people are driving at the same time due to having a similar schedule to others, not because others are already driving and they decide to as well. Previous studies have identified artificial synchronization of (dairy) cattle behaviour because of consistent milking and feeding times.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This creates a similar daily schedule for all the cattle to follow, which in turn creates collective behaviour between all members during these specific milking and feeding times. According to Stoye and Porter, cattle were most synchronous at night, least synchronous during the afternoon, and intermediately synchronous in the morning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This could be due to all the cattle being milked at similar times in the morning and feeding at similar times during the night, but having no "scheduled activity" to perform during the afternoon.

== In dogs ==

=== Feeding habits ===
[[File:Dogs in Bosnia.JPG|thumb|363x363px|Dogs mimicking feeding behaviours in the presence of another hungry litter-mate]]
Dogs are one of the most common species to produce allelomimetic behaviour and have it go noticed by humans. Studies have been conducted across several breeds of dog regarding eating habits and stress vocalization when alone or with litter-mates. Many results have shown that most dogs will eat more when they are in large groups compared to when they eat alone.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Compton|first=J.M|last2=Scott|first2=J.P|date=1971|title=Allelomimetic behavior system: Distress vocalization and social facilitation of feeding in telomian dogs|url=https://search-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/docview/1290586299?accountid=12378|journal=Journal of Psychology|volume=78(2)|pages=165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been coined as the "social facilitation of eating" and is not specific to certain breeds. In a study conducted by Compton and Scott, 80% of the dogs studied ate more in groups on the majority of trials and the overall group consumption together was larger than the summation of food consumption between each dog eating individually.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; When pups were considered food-satiated (would not eat more food even with a dish in front of them), they would resume eating when a hungry litter-mate was introduced into the room with them. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It was believed that since everything other than the addition of the hungry litter-mate was held constant, the increased appetite in the food-satiated pup was caused by the presence of the hungry pup and allelomimetic behaviour. The allelomimetic behaviour that occurs in dogs develops directly from experiences that occur during the [[critical period]] of development.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Scott's proposed theory of social motivation and the theory of the social facilitation of eating rely heavily on the allelomimetic behavioural system that occurs in these animals.  

=== Isolation and vocalization responses ===
Isolation is a large stressor for many dogs and can result in separation anxiety if they are left alone from others for extended lengths of time during a [[critical period]] in their development. If a puppy is separated from their litter-mates, home pen, or owners during a critical period it will produce an intense negative emotional reaction and the reaction will subside when they return to their litter-mates, home pen, or owners.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This reaction is a natural conditioned learning paradigm that will have to be constantly repeated during their infancy to remove the intensity of the response. When housed with other litter-mates the individual will be strongly motivated to mimic the behaviour of the animals around it.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Introducing other litter-mates who do not experience a severe negative emotion to isolation is one of the ways to avoid negative reactions to isolation in the individual in question. This provides a base for mimetic behaviour to occur and the pup experiencing severe negative emotions will begin to mimic the behaviour of the litter-mates and adopt their neutral behaviour.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Scott and Bronson replicated a study originally conducted by Fredericson in 1952 about vocalization rates of beagle puppies when confined in a box alone or with a companion.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Fredericson found that 75% of puppies would vocalize significantly less when confined with another puppy compared to alone, a result that was replicated and confirmed by Scott and Bronson in 1971.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Many dogs were more distressed when they were placed alone in an unfamiliar environment compared to a known environment, or an unfamiliar environment with litter-mates. This increase in calm behaviour when multiple litter-mates are in an unfamiliar environment is caused by allelomimetic behaviour. If one pup is calm, many dogs will mimic that behaviour, creating a litter of relaxed dogs. Likewise, if there is one distressed pup, many dogs could also mimic the distressed behaviour but the former is more common among experiments.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== In chickens and roosters ==
[[File:White Leghorn Rooster.jpg|thumb|The domesticated white leghorn rooster, a species of rooster used in Eklund and Jensen's experiment]]
[[File:Junglefowl on tree.jpg|left|thumb|270x270px|The wild red junglefowl, an ancestral species used in Eklund and Jensen's experiment]]
Allelomimetic behaviour can often be affected by domestication and lead to the evolution of new [[Social behavior|social behaviours]], or subtle changes in current social behaviours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It is thought that domestication would reduce the level of allelomimetic behaviour in animals due to the removal of many important factors that create mimicries such as predation, food pressures and competition between species members. Since there is no need to worry about possible predation or a lack of resources in a domesticated environment, the allelomimetic behaviours seen in non-domesticated species evolved out and the adaptation to domestication became the new normal. Mimetic behaviours that once incorporated anti-predator strategies or mating strategies became unnecessary and the use of these behaviours decreased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An experiment was conducted by Eklund and Jensen using an ancestor of all domesticated chickens, the red junglefowl, and a domesticated breed, the white leghorn.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  They showed that allelomimetic behaviour was more prominent and used more frequently in the non-domesticated red junglefowl compared to the white leghorn, most likely due to the chance of predation, starvation, and the lack of shelter playing a role in producing these allelomimetic behaviours. Total synchronization only occurred in both species during comforting behaviours such as perching and dust bathing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In activities outside of comfort behaviour, there was little mimetic behaviour in the domesticated white leghorn and inter-individual distances presented by the chickens during perching was larger than the non-domesticated species.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Perching in the red junglefowl occurred more frequently and was more mimetic than in the white leghorn. The social behaviour of the red junglefowl was also affected by allelomimetism, where behaviours such as feather pecking were more synchronized than in the white leghorn.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A difference in feeding synchrony also appeared in females versus males. Females were more likely to mimic other females' eating behaviours compared to a mixed-sex group or males mimicking males.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Sheikh-Lotf-Allah mosque wall and ceiling 2.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan, Iran]]]]
'''[[Aniconism]]''' is a proscription in [[Islam]] against the creation of images of sentient beings. The most absolute proscription is of images of [[God in Islam]], followed by [[depictions of Muhammad]], and then [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophets]] and the [[Ahl al-Bayt|relatives of Muhammad]], but the depiction of all humans and non-human animals is discouraged in the ''[[hadith]]'' and by the long tradition of Islamic authorities, especially [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ones. This has led to [[Islamic art]] being dominated by [[Islamic geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], the barely representational foliage patterns of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], and the 'half-formed' figures (e.g. wings without a body) of [[batik|Indonesian art]]; but [[figurative art]] still has a strong tradition, especially on a small scale in private works for the home or palace. The proliferation of photographic and filmed images today has led to controversy, with some religious authorities stating, for example, that all television is un-Islamic, but this is not a widely held position.

==Theological views==
The [[Quran]], the [[Islamic holy books|Islamic holy book]], does not explicitly prohibit the depiction of human figures; it merely condemns [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199794133|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|87|end=92|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|21|51|end=52|s=ns|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interdictions of figurative representation are present in the hadith, among a dozen of the hadith recorded during the [[History of Islam|latter part of the period]] when they were being written down. Because these hadith are tied to particular events in the life of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], they need to be interpreted in order to be applied in any general manner.

Sunni [[Exegesis|exegetes]] or ''[[tafsir]]'', from the 9th century onward, increasingly saw in them categorical prohibitions against producing and using any representation of living beings. There are variations between religious ''[[madhhab]]'' (schools) and marked differences between different [[Islamic schools and branches|branches of Islam]]. Aniconism is common among [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Sunni sects such as [[Salafi]]s and [[Wahhabi]]s (which are also often [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]), and less prevalent among [[liberal movements within Islam]]. [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sufism|mystical orders]] also have less stringent views on aniconism. On the individual level, whether or not specific Muslims believe in aniconism may depend on how much credence is given to hadith, and how liberal or strict they are in personal practice.

Aniconism in Islam not only deals with the material image, but touches upon mental representations as well. It is a problematic issue, discussed by early [[Theology|theologians]], as to how to describe [[God]], Muhammad and other prophets, and, indeed, if it is permissible at all to do so. God is usually represented by immaterial attributes, such as "holy" or "merciful", commonly known from His "[[Names of God in Islam|Ninety-nine beautiful names]]". Muhammad's physical appearance, however, is amply described, particularly in the traditions on his life and deeds recorded in the biographies known as ''[[Prophetic biography|Sirah Rasul Allah]]''. Of no less interest is the validity of sightings of holy personages made during dreams.

[[Titus Burckhardt]] sums up the role of aniconism in Islamic aesthetics as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of icons in Islam has not merely a negative but a positive role. By excluding all anthropomorphic images, at least within the religious realm, Islamic art aids man to be entirely himself. Instead of projecting his soul outside himself, he can remain in his ontological centre where he is both the viceregent (''khalîfa'') and slave ('''abd'') of God. Islamic art as a whole aims at creating an ambience which helps man to realize his primordial dignity; it therefore avoids everything that could be an 'idol', even in a relative and provisional manner. Nothing must stand between man and the invisible presence of God. Thus Islamic art creates a void; it eliminates in fact all the turmoil and passionate suggestions of the world, and in their stead creates an order that expresses equilibrium, serenity and peace.&lt;ref name="Burckhardt1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Titus Burckhardt|title=Mirror of the intellect: essays on traditional science &amp; sacred art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K9ELNioz18C|accessdate=12 December 2011|date=1 October 1987|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-684-9|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In practice==
[[File:MosqueOfOmar1914.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Dome of the Rock]], [[Jerusalem]]]]

=== Religious core ===
In practice, the core of normative religion in Islam is consistently aniconic. Its embodiment are spaces such as the [[mosque]] and objects like the Quran or the white dress of [[pilgrim]]s entering [[Mecca]], deprived of figurative images. Other spheres of religion (mysticism, popular piety, private level) exhibit in this regard significant variability. Aniconism in secular contexts is even more fluctuating. Generally speaking, aniconism in Islamic societies is restricted in modern times to specific religious contexts. In the past, it was enforced only in some times and places.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Past===
The representation of living beings in Islamic art is not just a modern phenomenon or because of current technology, Westernization or the [[cult of personality|cult of the personality]].

[[File:Pisa-Opera del Duomo-Grifone islamico000.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pisa Griffin]], probably created in the 11th century in [[Al-Andalus]], is the largest Islamic figurative sculpture to survive.]]
The avoidance of idolatry is the main concern of the restrictions on images, and the traditional form for religious cult image, the free-standing sculpture, is extremely rare, and there are no large examples of humans. The [[Pisa Griffin]], of a [[Legendary creature|mythical beast]] and designed to spout water for a fountain, is the largest example, at three feet tall in bronze, and probably only survives because it was taken as booty by the city of [[Pisa]] in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Pisa+Griffin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D-KxTZvfO4TD8QO4_4CWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20Griffin&amp;f=false Mack, p. 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610125727/https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Pisa+Griffin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D-KxTZvfO4TD8QO4_4CWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20Griffin&amp;f=false |date=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the [[Alhambra]], it probably came from [[Al-Andalus]], one of the more relaxed Arabic-speaking regions in this respect. The [[griffin]] and lions cannot easily be regarded as potential idols, given their submissive position (and the lack of religions worshipping lions or griffins), and the same is true of small decorative figures in relief on objects in metalwork, or figures painted on [[Islamic pottery]], both of which are relatively common. In particular [[hunting]] scenes of humans and animals were popular, and presumably regarded as clearly having no religious function. The figures in miniatures were, until the late 16th century, always numerous in each image, small (typically only an inch or two high), and showing the central figures at roughly the same size as the attendants and servants who are usually also shown, thus deflecting potential accusations of idolatry. The books illustrated were most often the classics of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] and historical [[chronicle]]s.

The hadith show some concessions for context, as with the dolls, and condemn most strongly the makers rather than the owners of images. A long tradition of prefaces to ''[[muraqqa]]s'' sought to justify the creation of images without getting involved in discussions of the specific texts, using arguments such as comparing God to an artist.

Miniature painting was mostly patronized by the court circle and is a private form of art; the owner chooses who to show a book or ''muraqqa'' (album). But wall-paintings with large figures were found in early Islam, and in Safavid and later Persia, especially from the 17th century, but were always rare in the Arabic-speaking world. Such paintings are also mainly found in private palaces; examples in public buildings are rare though not unknown, in [[Iran]] there are even some in mosques.

In Islamic sacred architecture, ornamentation consists mainly in arabesques and [[geometry|geometrical]] patterns.&lt;ref name=void/&gt; Mosques do not feature dynamic elements, but aim for a quality of serenity and repose.&lt;ref name=void/&gt; Similarly, weight-bearing elements are not designed along [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] lines to present an image of physical strength; [[cupola]]s for example often feature [[muqarnas]] disguising the transition between the cupola and its supports, creating the impression that the supports, rather than holding up the cupola, have "congealed" from the divine void above.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Titus Burckhardt]] |title=The Void in Islamic Art |journal=Studies in Comparative Religion |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1970 |url=http://qa.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=130 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050237/http://qa.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=130 |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
Depending on which segment of Islamic societies are referred to, the application of aniconism is characterized by noteworthy differences.&lt;ref&gt;See '[[Sura]]' and 'Taswir' in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Factors are the epoch considered, the country, the religious orientation, the political intent, the popular beliefs, the private benefit or the dichotomy between reality and discourse.

Today, the concept of an aniconic Islam coexists with a daily life for Muslims awash with images. TV stations and newspapers (which do present still and moving representations of living beings) have an exceptional impact on public opinion, sometimes, as in the case of [[Al Jazeera]], with a global reach, beyond the Arabic speaking and Muslim audience. Portraits of secular and religious leaders are omnipresent on banknotes&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html Petroleum-related banknotes: Saudi Arabia: Oil Refinery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014731/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html Petroleum-related banknotes: Iran: Abadan Refinery, Iahanshahi-Amouzegar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015444/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coins, in streets and offices (e.g. presidents like [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]], [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], [[Hafez al-Assad|al-Assad]] or [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hassan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]). Anthropomorphic statues in public places are to be found in most Muslim countries ([[Saddam Hussein]]'s are infamous&lt;ref&gt;[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html David Zucchino "U.S. military, not Iraqis, behind toppling of statue" ''Honolulu Advertiser'', July 5, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192226/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as art schools training sculptors and painters. In the [[Egypt]]ian countryside, it is fashionable to celebrate and advertise the returning of pilgrims from Mecca on the walls of their houses.

The [[Taliban]] movement in [[Afghanistan]] banned photography and destroyed non-Muslim artifacts, especially carvings and statues such as the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], generally tolerated by other Muslims, on the grounds that the artifacts are idolatrous or ''[[shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''. However, sometimes those who profess aniconism will practice figurative representation (cf. portraits of Talibans from the [[Kandahar]] photographic studios during their imposed ban on photography&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Lee Anderson]], [[Thomas Dworzak]], ''Taliban'', London (UK), Trolley, 2003, {{ISBN|0-9542648-5-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For Shia communities, portraits of the major figures of Shiite history are important elements of religious devotion. In Iran, portraits of Muhammad and of [[Ali]], printed on pieces of cloth or woven into carpets, are called ''temsal'' ("likenesses") and can be bought around shrines and in the streets, to be hung in homes or carried with oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dabashi|first=Hamid|title=Shi'ism - A Religion of Protest|year=2011|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] portraits of Ali can be found on notoriously ornate trucks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm Saudi Aramco World : Masterpieces to Go: The Trucks of Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008035126/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm |date=October 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; buses and rickshaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/ The Rickshaw Arts of Bangladesh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021211125/http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/ |date=October 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the Sunni tradition, a photographic picture of the deceased can be placed on the Shiite tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml Picture of Golestan e Shohoda cemetery Esfahan -Esfahan, Iran] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075410/http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |date=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html Mashad Martyrs Cemetery at Best Iran Travel.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407170105/http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html |date=April 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A curiosity in Iran is an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] photography supposed to represent Muhammad as a young boy.&lt;ref&gt;Photography by Lehnert &amp; Landrock, titled "Mohamed", Tunis, c. 1906.

[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature painting from the 16th century, depicting Muhammad, his face veiled, ascending on the [[Buraq]] into the Heavens, a journey known as the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]].]]
Medieval Muslim artists found various ways to represent especially sensitive figures such as Muhammad. He is sometimes shown with a fiery [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] hiding his face, head, or whole body, and from about 1500 is often shown with a veiled face. Members of his immediate family and other prophets may be treated in the same way. More generally, it can be believed that since God is absolute, the act of depiction is his own and not that of a human; and miniatures are obviously very crude representations of the reality, so the two cannot be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3232,36-737929@51-735567,0.html LeMonde.fr : JEAN-FRANÇOIS CLÉMENT « Cette affaire de caricatures participe d'une mentalité de «victimisation» » des musulmans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the material level, prophets in manuscripts can have their face covered by a veil&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; or all humans have a stroke drawn over their neck, symbolising the severing of the soul, and clarifying the fact that it is not something alive and imbued with a soul that is depicted: a purposeful flaw to make what is depicted impossible to live in reality (as merely impossible in reality is still often frowned upon or banned, such as representations of comic book characters or unicorns, although exceptions do exist). Calligraphy, the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, has also its figurative side due to anthropo- and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] [[Islamic calligraphy#Calligrams|calligrams]]. Few portraits were attempted, and the ability to create recognisable portraits was rare in Islamic art until the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] tradition began in the late 15th century, although in both Mughal India and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey portraits of the ruler then became very popular in court circles.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|left|A [[hilya]] or description in calligraphy of the appearance of [[Muhammad]] by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]] (d. 1698).]]
Forms of Islamic calligraphy evolved, especially in the Ottoman period, to fulfill a function similar to that of representative art by means of calligraphic representation, when on paper usually with elaborate frames of [[Ottoman illumination]]. These include the name of Muhammad, the ''[[hilya]]'', or description of his physical appearance, similar treatments of one or more of the names of God in Islam, and the ''[[tughra]]'', a calligraphic version of the name of an Ottoman [[sultan]].

===Hadith and exegesis examples===

During its early days, aniconism in Islam was intended as a measure against idolatry, particularly against the statues worshipped by [[Paganism|pagans]]. All hadith presented in this section are Sunni, not Shia.

{{Quote|Narrated [[Aisha]]:&lt;br&gt;(the [[Muhammad's wives|wife of the Prophet]]) I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When [[Allah]]'s Apostle saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] have I committed?' Allah's Apostle said. "What is this cushion?" I said, "I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline on it." Allah's Apostle said, "The makers of these pictures will be punished on the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]], and it will be said to them, 'Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).' " The Prophet added, "The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals)."|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|318}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Aisha, Ummul [[Mu'min]]in:&lt;br&gt;When the Apostle of Allah ([[Peace be upon him (Islam)|peace be upon him]]) arrived after the [[Battle of Tabouk|expedition to Tabuk]] or [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] (the narrator is doubtful), the draught raised an end of a curtain which was hung in front of her store-room, revealing some dolls which belonged to her.&lt;br&gt;He asked: What is this? She replied: My dolls. Among them he saw a horse with wings made of rags, and asked: What is this I see among them? She replied: A horse. He asked: What is this that it has on it? She replied: Two wings. He asked: A horse with two wings? She replied: Have you not heard that Solomon had horses with wings? She said: Thereupon the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed so heartily that I could see his molar teeth.|[[Abu Dawood]]|''[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|41|4914}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Ali ibn Abu Talib:&lt;br&gt;Safinah AbuAbdurRahman said that a man prepared food for Ali ibn Abu Talib who was his guest, and Fatimah said: I wish we had invited the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and he had eaten with us. They invited him, and when he came he put his hands on the side-ports of the door, but when he saw the figured curtain which had been put at the end of the house, he went away. So Fatimah said to Ali: Follow him and see what turned him back. I (Ali) followed him and asked: What turned you back, Apostle of Allah? He replied: It is not fitting for me or for any Prophet to enter a house which is decorated.|Abu Dawood|''Sunan Abu Dawood''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|27|3746}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated 'Aisha:&lt;br&gt;Allah's Apostle returned from a journey when I had placed a curtain of mine having pictures over (the door of) a chamber of mine. When Allah's Apostle saw it, he tore it and said, "The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who try to make the like of Allah's creations." So we turned it (i.e., the curtain) into one or two cushions.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|838}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To show the superiority of the [[Monotheism|monotheist]] faith, Muhammad smashed the idols at the [[Kaaba]]. He also removed paintings that were [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemous to Islam]], while protecting others (the images of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and Jesus) inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.

{{Quote|Narrated [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]]:&lt;br&gt;When Allah's Apostle arrived in Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba while there were idols in it. So he ordered that they be taken out. The pictures of the (Prophets) Abraham and [[Ishmael]], holding arrows of divination in their hands, were carried out. The Prophet said, "May Allah ruin them (i.e. the [[infidel]]s) for they knew very well that they (i.e. Abraham and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]) never drew lots by these (divination arrows). Then the Prophet entered the Ka'ba and said. "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" in all its directions and came out and not offer any prayer therein.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|584}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Muslim b. Subaih reported: I was with Masriuq in the house which had the portrayals of Mary ([[hadrat]] [[Mary in Islam|Maryan]]). Thereupon Masriuq said: These are portraits of Kisra. I said: No, these are of Mary. Masruq said: I heard [[Abdullah, son of Masud|Abdullah b, Mas'ud]] as saying Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said: The most grievously tormented people on the Day of Resurrection would be the painters of pictures. (Muslim said): I read this before Nasr b. 'Ali at-Jahdami and he read it before other narrators, the last one being Ibn Sa'id b Abl at Hasan that a person came to Ibn 'Abbas and said: I am the person who paints pictures; give me a religious verdict about them. He (Ibn 'Abbas) said to him: Come near me (still further). He came near him so much so that he placed his hand upon his head and said: I am going to narrate to yor what I heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I heard him say: All the painters who make pictures would be in the fire of [[Hell]]. The soul will be breathed in every picture prepared by him and it shall punish him in the Hell, and he (Ibn 'Abbas) said: If you have to do it at all, then paint the pictures of trees and lifeless things; and Nasr b. 'Ali confirmed it.|[[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]]|''[[Sahih Muslim]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although [[Arabian mythology|pagans in Muhammad's times]] also worshiped trees and stones, Muhammad opposed only images of animated beings — humans and animals —, as reported by the hadith. Subsequently, geometrical ornamentation became a sophisticated art form in Islam.

{{Quote|Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan:&lt;br&gt;While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, "O [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|father of 'Abbas]]! My sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures." Ibn 'Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's Apostle . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be punished by Allah till he puts life in it, and he will never be able to put life in it.' " Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his face turned pale. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist on making pictures I advise you to make pictures of trees and any other unanimated objects."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|428}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A'isha reported: We had a curtain with us which had portraits of birds upon it. Whenever a visitor came, he found them in front of him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: Change them, for whenever I enter the room) I see them and it brings to my mind (the pleasures) of worldly life. She said: We had with us a sheet which had silk badges upon it and we used to wear it. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ibn Muthanna but with this addition: 'Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not command us to tear that."|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|''Sahih Muslim''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A'isha reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me. and I had a shelf with a thin cloth curtain hangin. over it and on which there were portraits. No sooner did he see it than he tore it and the colour of his face underwent a change and he said: A'isha, the most grievous torment from the Hand of Allah on the Day of Resurrection would be for those who imitate (Allah) in the act of His creation. A'isha said: We tore it into pieces and made a cushion or two cushions out of that.|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|''Sahih Muslim''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5261}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mohammad also warned his followers of dying amongst people that built places of worship at graves and placed pictures in it (i.e. [[Christian]]s).
{{Quote| Narrated 'Aisha:&lt;br&gt;When the Prophet became ill, some of his wives talked about a [[Church (building)|church]] which they had seen in [[Ethiopia]] and it was called Mariya. [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya|Um Salma]] and [[Ramla bint Abi Sufyan|Um Habiba]] had been to Ethiopia, and both of them narrated its (the Church's) beauty and the pictures it contained. The Prophet raised his head and said, "Those are the people who, whenever a pious man dies amongst them, make a place of worship at his grave and then they make those pictures in it. Those are the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|2|23|425}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mohammad made it very clear that [[angel]]s do not like pictures.
{{Quote|Narrated [[Ali ibn Abi Talha|Abu Talha]]:&lt;br&gt;Allah's Apostle said, "[[Islamic view of angels|Angels]] (of mercy) do not enter a house where there are pictures.'" The sub-narrator Busr added: "Then [[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zaid]] fell ill and we paid him a visit. Behold! There was, hanging at his door, a curtain decorated with a picture. I said to 'Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani, the step son of [[Maymuna bint al-Harith|Maimuna]], the wife of the Prophet, "Didn't Zaid tell us about the picture the day before yesterday?" 'Ubaidullah said, "Didn't you hear him saying: 'except a design in a garment'?"|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|841}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Salim's father:&lt;br&gt;Once [[Gabriel]] promised to visit the Prophet but he delayed and the Prophet got worried about that. At last he came out and found [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Gabriel]] and complained to him of his grief (for his delay). Gabriel said to him, "We do not enter a place in which there is a picture or a dog."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|843}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, there are hadith stating that Muhammad permitted dolls belonging to both his wife and daughter in his own house.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Comparison with Judaism and Christianity==

[[Judaism]], which is related to Islam as a monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Mūsa]]), and other prophets, has a [[Idolatry in Judaism|comparable prohibition]] which takes the form of a prohibition on any [[Cult image|idol]] or on any artistic representation of [[God in Judaism|God]]. The third of the three related religions, [[Christianity]], actively practiced aniconism in the [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]], in the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected [[Beeldenstorm|all images in churches]]. But it has generally had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures, and the movement of iconoclasm was at no time supported by the Roman papacy.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

An '''atmosphere''' (from [[Modern Greek]] ἀτμός ''(atmos)'', meaning 'vapour', and σφαῖρα ''(sphaira)'', meaning 'sphere'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29tmo%2Fs ἀτμός] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924182433/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29tmo%2Fs |date=2015-09-24 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510152357/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra%5E |date=2017-05-10 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) is a layer or a set of layers of [[gas]]es surrounding a [[planet]] or other [[solid|material body]], that is held in place by the [[gravity]] of that body. An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low.

The [[atmosphere of Earth]] is composed of [[nitrogen]] (about 78%), [[oxygen]] (about 21%), [[argon]] (about 0.9%)  , carbon dioxide (0.03%) and other gases in trace amounts. Oxygen is used by most [[organism]]s for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]; nitrogen is [[nitrogen fixation|fixed]] by bacteria and [[lightning]] to produce [[ammonia]] used in the construction of [[nucleotides]] and [[amino acids]]; and [[carbon dioxide]] is used by [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] for [[photosynthesis]].  The atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by [[sunlight|solar]] [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], [[solar wind]] and [[cosmic rays]]. The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical [[Modification Detection Code|modification]] of the [[paleoatmosphere]] by living organisms.

The term [[stellar atmosphere]] describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[photosphere]]. Stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound [[molecule]]s.

==Pressure==
 {{main|Atmospheric pressure}}
Atmospheric pressure at a particular location is the [[force]] per unit area perpendicular to a surface determined by the [[weight]] of the vertical column of atmosphere above that location. On Earth, units of air pressure are based on the internationally recognized [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm), which is defined as 101.325 k[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (760&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]] or 14.696 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]). It is measured with a [[barometer]].

[[Atmospheric pressure]] decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing mass of gas above. The height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (an [[irrational number]] with a value of 2.71828...) is called the [[scale height]] and is denoted by ''H''. For an atmosphere with a uniform temperature, the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the product of the mean [[molecular mass]] of dry air and the local acceleration of gravity at that location. For such a model atmosphere, the pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude. However, atmospheres are not uniform in temperature, so estimation of the atmospheric pressure at any particular altitude is more complex.

==Atmospheric escape==
{{main|Atmospheric escape}}
[[Surface gravity]] differs significantly among the planets. For example, the large gravitational force of the giant planet [[Jupiter]] retains light gases such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] that escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules' [[thermal motion]] exceed the planet's [[escape velocity]], allowing those to escape a planet's gravitational grasp. Thus, distant and cold [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Pluto]] are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities.

Since a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of velocities, there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space. Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal [[kinetic energy]], and so gases of low [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is thought that [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] may have lost much of their water when, after being [[Photodissociation|photo dissociated]] into hydrogen and oxygen by solar [[ultraviolet]], the hydrogen escaped. [[Earth]]'s [[magnetic field]] helps to prevent this, as, normally, the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity, including a net 2% of its atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Seki, K. | author2=Elphic, R. C. | author3=Hirahara, M. | author4=Terasawa, T. | author5=Mukai, T. | title=On Atmospheric Loss of Oxygen Ions from Earth Through Magnetospheric Processes | journal=Science | year=2001 | volume=291 | issue=5510 | pages=1939–1941 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5510/1939 | accessdate=2007-03-07 | doi=10.1126/science.1058913 | pmid=11239148 | bibcode=2001Sci...291.1939S | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091045/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5510/1939 | archivedate=2007-10-01 | df= | citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The net effect, taking the most important escape processes into account, is that an intrinsic magnetic field does not protect a planet from atmospheric escape and that for some magnetizations the presence of a magnetic field works to increase the escape rate.&lt;ref name="Gunell et al., 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunell |first=H. |last2=Maggiolo |first2=R. |last3=Nilsson |first3=H. |last4=Stenberg Wieser |first4=G. |last5=Slapak |first5=R. |last6=Lindkvist |first6=J. |last7=Hamrin |first7=M. |last8=De Keyser |first8=J. |year=2018 |title=Why an intrinsic magnetic field does not protect a planet against atmospheric escape |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=614 |pages=L3 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832934 |bibcode = 2018A&amp;A...614L...3G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mechanisms that can cause [[atmospheric escape|atmosphere depletion]] are [[solar wind]]-induced sputtering, [[impact event|impact]] erosion, [[weathering]], and sequestration—sometimes referred to as "freezing out"—into the [[regolith]] and [[polar ice cap|polar caps]].

== Terrain ==
Atmospheres have dramatic effects on the surfaces of rocky bodies. Objects that have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is covered in [[impact crater|craters]]. Without an atmosphere, the planet  has no protection from [[meteoroid]]s, and all of them collide with the surface as [[meteorites]] and create craters.

Most meteoroids burn up as [[meteors]] before hitting a planet's surface. When [[meteoroids]] do impact, the effects are often erased by the action of wind.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} As a result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

[[Wind erosion]] is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres, and over time can erase the effects of both craters and [[volcanoes]]. In addition, since [[liquid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can not exist without pressure, an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface, resulting in [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[ocean]]s. [[Earth]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that [[Mars]] had liquid on its surface in the past.

==Composition==
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Earth's atmospheric [[gas]]es scatter blue light more than other wavelengths, giving [[Earth]] a blue halo when seen from [[space]]]]

A planet's initial atmospheric composition is related to the chemistry and temperature of the local [[solar nebula]] during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases. The original atmospheres started with a rotating disc of gases that collapsed to form a series of spaced rings that condensed to form the planets. The planet's atmospheres were then modified over time by various complex factors, resulting in quite different outcomes.

The atmospheres of the planets [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] are primarily composed of [[carbon dioxide]], with small quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[oxygen]] and traces of other gases.

The composition of Earth's atmosphere is largely governed by the by-products of the life that it sustains. Dry air from [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium, and other "noble" gases (by volume), but generally a variable amount of water vapor is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.

The low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System's [[giant planet]]s—[[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]—allow them more readily to retain gases with low [[molecular mass]]es. These planets have hydrogen–helium atmospheres, with trace amounts of more complex compounds.

Two satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a moon of Saturn, and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of [[nitrogen]].  When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, [[Pluto]] has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun.

Other bodies within the [[Solar System]] have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium. These include the [[Moon]] ([[sodium]] gas), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (sodium gas), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (oxygen), [[Io (moon)|Io]] ([[sulfur]]), and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] ([[water vapor]]).

The first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is [[HD 209458]]b, a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus]]. Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000&amp;nbsp;K, and is steadily escaping into space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet's inflated atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1=Weaver, D. | author2=Villard, R. | title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere | publisher=Hubble News Center | date=2007-01-31 | url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/ | accessdate=2007-03-11 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314043755/http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/ | archivedate=2007-03-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Earth===
{{main|Atmosphere of Earth}}
[[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] consists of a number of layers that differ in properties such as composition, temperature and pressure. The lowest layer is the [[troposphere]], which extends from the surface to the bottom of the [[stratosphere]]. Three quarters of the atmosphere's mass resides within the troposphere, and is the layer within which the Earth's terrestrial weather develops. The depth of this layer varies between 17&amp;nbsp;km at the equator to 7&amp;nbsp;km at the poles. The stratosphere, extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the [[mesosphere]], contains the [[ozone layer]]. The ozone layer ranges in altitude between 15 and 35&amp;nbsp;km, and is where most of the [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the Sun is absorbed. The top of the mesosphere, ranges from 35 to 85&amp;nbsp;km, and is the layer wherein most [[meteors]] burn up. The  [[thermosphere]] extends from 85&amp;nbsp;km to the base of the [[exosphere]] at 690&amp;nbsp;km and contains the [[ionosphere]], a region where the atmosphere is ionised by incoming solar radiation. The ionosphere increases in thickness and moves closer to the Earth during daylight and rises at night allowing certain frequencies of radio communication a greater range. The [[Kármán line]], located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100&amp;nbsp;km, is commonly used to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and [[outer space]]. The [[exosphere]] begins variously from about 690 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km above the surface, where it interacts with the planet's [[magnetosphere]]. Each of the layers has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height.

===Others===
Other astronomical bodies such as these listed have known atmospheres.

==Circulation==
{{main|Atmospheric circulation}}
The circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal differences when [[convection]] becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than [[thermal radiation]]. On planets where the primary heat source is solar radiation, excess heat in the tropics is transported to higher latitudes. When a planet generates a significant amount of heat internally, such as is the case for [[Jupiter]], convection in the atmosphere can transport thermal energy from the higher temperature interior up to the surface.

==Importance==
From the perspective of a planetary [[geologist]], the atmosphere acts to shape a planetary surface. [[Wind]] picks up [[dust]] and other particles which, when they collide with the terrain, erode the [[Terrain|relief]] and leave [[Deposition (sediment)|deposits]] ([[Aeolian processes|eolian]] processes). [[Frost line|Frost]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitations]], which depend on the atmospheric composition, also influence the relief. Climate changes can influence a planet's geological history. Conversely, studying the surface of the Earth leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and climate of other planets.

For a [[meteorologist]], the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is a factor affecting the [[climate]] and its variations.

For a [[biologist]] or [[paleontologist]], the Earth's atmospheric composition is closely dependent on the appearance of the life and its [[evolution]].

The '''Awza'i''' ({{lang-ar|الأوزاعي|al-Awzā‘ī}}) [[madhhab]]  was one of the schools of [[Fiqh]], the Islamic jurisprudence, or [[religious law]] within [[Sunni Islam]] in the 8th century.  Its [[Imam]] was [[Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daralnicosia.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/imam-al-awzai-and-accounting-rulers/|title=Imam al-Awza`i and Accounting Rulers|first=Dar al-Nicosia / دار|last=نيـقـوسـيــا|date=14 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{portal|Sunni Islam|Law}}
==History==
===In the Maghreb and al-Andalus===
Some posit that the reason why the people of Morocco took up the madhhab of Imam Malik, is that the people of Morocco and [[al-Andalus]] were originally upon the madhhab of al-Awza’i. However since the Umayyad conquest of the region and the [[Berber revolt]], Morocco and western Algeria were following [[Kharijites]] schools which were adopted by the ruling dynasties such as the [[Maghrawa]], the emirate of Toudgha and the [[Ibadhi]] [[Rustamid dynasty]]. And, with the exception of [[Tunisia]] and al-Andalus, the Maliki school only became established in the region after the rise of the [[Almoravid dynasty]].

Then during the rule of [[Al-Hakam I]], the official fatwas were changed and given according to the opinion of Malik ibn Anas and the people of [[Medina|al-Madina]]. This was due to the opinion and preference of al-Hakam due to some political benefits he saw and they differ about the actual reason, which still remains unclear. Most hold that it was due to the scholars of al-Andalus travelling to Medina, then when they returned they spoke of the excellence of Malik, his wide knowledge and great station, so they honoured him and preferred his Madhhab. Others say that Imam Malik asked some of the people of al-Andalus about the rule in their region and they described it to him and Malik was very pleased by it since the [[Abbasids]] in that time did not rule in a manner that was agreeable. So, Imam Malik said to the person who told him, ‘We ask Allaah to enlighten our sacred precincts with your rule.’ This was transmitted to the ruler of al-Andalus, who already knew of the knowledge, excellence and piety of Malik; so he led the people to accept his Madhhab and ordered that the madhhab of al-Awza’i be abandoned. Later, the kings of Morocco and the west agreed that the rulings and actions should be according to the preferences of Ibn al-Qaasim al-`Utaqi (a famous student of Malik) only.{{when|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;“Nafh ut-Teeb min Ghasn il-Andalus ir-rateeb,” by Ahmad al-Muqree al-Maghribee (3/158)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Syria===
In Syria, the Madhhab of al-Awza’i remained the main school of thought until the 10th century, when Abu Zar’ah Muhammed ibn Uthman of the Shafi’ee Madhhab was appointed judge of Damascus. Abu Zar’ah began the practice of giving a prize of 100 dinars to any student who memorized the book, Mukhtasr al-Muzanee (the basics of Shafi’ee fiqh). Naturally, the practice caused the Shafi’ee Madhhab to spread rapidly in Syria, until none of al-Awza’i’s followers remained until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;”al-Madkhal,” pg.205-206, and “Fiqh al-Imaam al-Awza’i,” by ‘Abdullah Muhammed al-Jabooree,&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''buffer zone''' is generally a [[wikt:zone|zonal]] area that lies between two or more other areas (often, but not necessarily, [[country|countries]]), but depending on the type of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are [[demilitarized zone]]s, [[border zone]]s and certain restrictive easement zones and [[Green Belt|green belts]]. Such zones may be, but not necessarily be, comprised by a sovereign state, forming a [[buffer state]].

Buffer zones have various purposes, political or otherwise. They can be set up to prevent violence, protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, keep prisoners intent on escaping from rapidly acquiring hostages or a hiding place, and have uses in several other scenarios. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions which are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world.{{examples|date=October 2013}}

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their [[biodiversity]] importance. The buffer zone of a [[protected area]] may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it which links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|protected area categories]] (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/10/ A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Buffer Zones]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

{{cquote|A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage property]]. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the ''Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention'' in 1977. In the most current version of the ''Operational Guidelines'' of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.|cquote}}

The buffer zone is one of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] (BMPs).

=== Improve water quality ===
It shows that the quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse because humans do not use land properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N.

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water. It will have a negative impact on fish and other aquatic life, which can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syversen|first=Nina|last2=Bechmann|first2=Marianne|date=2004-05|title=Vegetative buffer zones as pesticide filters for simulated surface runoff|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|issn=0925-8574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to [[Protected area|protected areas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deroanne-Bauvin|first=J|last2=Delcarte|first2=E|last3=Impens|first3=R|date=1987-01|title=Monitoring of lead deposition near highway: A ten years study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|journal=Science of The Total Environment|volume=59|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilize the riverbanks ===
When the riverbanks are low, due to the plant root can enter the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of plant root, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant root. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion. 

The adsorption capacity of buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, it has a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by [[Flood|floods]], and effectively control the erosion of the beach. 

=== Provide food and habitat to wildlife ===
The riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, the woody parts and leaves of plants can become food for small [[Aquatic animal|aquatic animals]]. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones and then increasing the biodiversity in the area. 

A study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturtevant|first=Brian R|date=1998-10|title=A model of wetland vegetation dynamics in simulated beaver impoundments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=112|issue=2-3|pages=195–225|doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as ''[[Mouse-eared bat|Myotis]]'' and ''[[Marten|Martes]]'' prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=A.

=== Provide [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value ===
As an important part of riparian zone, the vegetation buffer zones form a variety of [[landscape]], and the landscape pattern of combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscape. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland and forest ecosystem make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people's quality of life. 

In the buffer zone, those trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Maurizio|last2=Passoni|first2=Matteo|last3=Thiene|first3=Mara|last4=Tempesta|first4=Tiziano|date=2010-01|title=Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|journal=European Journal of Agronomy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|issn=1161-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. The establishment of vegetation buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify environment and visual effect, improve people's living environment, enrich humanistic landscape and enhance aesthetic value. we need to call on people to pay attention to the importance of the buffer zone, encourage local residents to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and set up checkpoints around the buffer zone to make it more secure and effective.

'''Cell culture''' is the process by which [[cell (biology)|cells]] are grown under controlled conditions, generally outside their natural environment. After the cells of interest have been [[Cell isolation|isolated from living tissue]], they can subsequently be maintained under carefully controlled conditions.  These conditions vary for each cell type, but generally consist of a suitable vessel with a substrate or medium that supplies the essential nutrients ([[amino acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s), [[growth factor]]s, [[hormone]]s, and gases ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and regulates the physio-chemical environment ([[Buffer solution|pH buffer,]] [[osmotic pressure]], [[temperature]]). Most cells require a surface or an artificial substrate (adherent or monolayer culture) whereas others can be grown free floating in culture medium ([[suspension culture]]). The lifespan of most cells is genetically determined, but some cell culturing cells have been “transformed” into immortal cells which will reproduce indefinitely if the optimal conditions are provided.

In practice, the term "cell culture" now refers to the culturing of cells derived from multicellular [[eukaryote]]s, especially [[animal]] cells, in contrast with other types of culture that also grow cells, such as [[plant tissue culture]], [[fungus|fungal]] culture, and [[microbiological culture]] (of [[microbe]]s). The historical development and methods of cell culture are closely interrelated to those of [[tissue culture]] and [[organ culture]]. [[Viral culture]] is also related, with cells as hosts for the viruses.

The [[laboratory]] technique of maintaining live '''[[Immortalised cell line|cell lines]]''' (a population of cells descended from a single cell and containing the same genetic makeup) separated from their original tissue source became more robust in the middle 20th century.&lt;ref name="NIHtimeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?db=Books&amp;rid=mboc4.table.1516|title=Some landmarks in the development of tissue and cell culture|accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/Bioengineering/CellCulture/index.htm|title=Cell Culture|accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 19th-century English physiologist [[Sydney Ringer]] developed [[Lactated Ringer's solution|salt solutions]] containing the chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium suitable for maintaining the beating of an isolated [[heart (biology)|animal heart]] outside the body.&lt;ref name="whonamedit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2119.html|title=Whonamedit - Ringer's solution|publisher=whonamedit.com|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, [[Wilhelm Roux]] removed a portion of the [[medullary plate]] of an [[embryo]]nic chicken and maintained it in a warm saline solution for several days, establishing the principle of tissue culture.&lt;ref name="Zurlow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caat.jhsph.edu/pubs/animal_alts/appendix_c.htm|title=Animals and alternatives in testing|accessdate=2006-04-19|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225204205/http://caat.jhsph.edu/pubs/animal_alts/appendix_c.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ross Granville Harrison]], working at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] and then at [[Yale University]], published results of his experiments from 1907 to 1910, establishing the methodology of [[tissue culture]].&lt;ref name="Schiff"&gt;{{cite web | last = Schiff | first = JudithAnn | name-list-format = vanc | title=An unsung hero of medical research | url = http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_02/old_yale.html|accessdate=2006-04-19 | work = [[Yale Alumni Magazine]] | date = February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell culture techniques were advanced significantly in the 1940s and 1950s to support research in [[virology]]. Growing viruses in cell cultures allowed preparation of purified viruses for the manufacture of [[vaccine]]s. The injectable [[Salk polio vaccine|polio vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk]] was one of the first products mass-produced using cell culture techniques. This vaccine was made possible by the cell culture research of [[John Franklin Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller]], and [[Frederick Chapman Robbins]], who were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for their discovery of a method of growing the virus in monkey [[kidney]] cell cultures.

==Concepts in mammalian cell culture==

===Isolation of cells===
{{Main|Cell isolation}}Cells can be [[Cell isolation|isolated]] from tissues for ''[[ex vivo]]'' culture in several ways. Cells can be easily purified from blood; however, only the [[white blood cell|white cells]] are capable of growth in culture. Cells can be isolated from solid tissues by digesting the extracellular matrix using [[enzyme]]s such as [[Matrix metalloproteinase|collagenase]], [[trypsin]], or [[pronase]], before agitating the tissue to release the cells into suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Voigt N, Pearman CM, Dobrev D, Dibb KM | title = Methods for isolating atrial cells from large mammals and humans | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 86 | pages = 187–98 | date = September 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.07.006 | pmid = 26186893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Louch WE, Sheehan KA, Wolska BM | title = Methods in cardiomyocyte isolation, culture, and gene transfer | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–98 | date = September 2011 | pmc = 3164875 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.012 | pmid = 21723873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, pieces of tissue can be placed in [[growth medium|growth media]], and the cells that grow out are available for culture. This method is known as [[explant culture]].

Cells that are cultured directly from a subject are known as primary cells. With the exception of some derived from tumors, most [[primary cell culture]]s have limited lifespan.

An established or [[immortalised cell line|immortalized cell line]] has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely either through random mutation or deliberate modification, such as artificial [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[telomerase]] [[gene]].
Numerous cell lines are well established as representative of particular [[cell type]]s.

===Maintaining cells in culture===
For the majority of isolated primary cells, they undergo the process of [[senescence]] and stop dividing after a certain number of population doublings while generally retaining their viability (described as the [[Hayflick limit]]).

Cells are grown and maintained at an appropriate [[temperature]] and gas mixture (typically, 37&amp;nbsp;°C, 5% [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] for mammalian cells) in a [[cell incubator]]. Culture conditions vary widely for each cell type, and variation of conditions for a particular cell type can result in different [[phenotype]]s.[[File:DMEM cell culture medium.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of DMEM cell culture medium]]Aside from temperature and gas mixture, the most commonly varied factor in culture systems is the cell [[growth medium]]. Recipes for growth media can vary in [[pH]], glucose concentration, [[growth factors]], and the presence of other nutrients. The growth factors used to supplement media are often derived from the serum of animal blood, such as [[fetal bovine serum]] (FBS), bovine calf serum, equine serum, and porcine serum. One complication of these blood-derived ingredients is the potential for contamination of the culture with viruses or [[prion]]s, particularly in medical [[biotechnology]] applications. Current practice is to minimize or eliminate the use of these ingredients wherever possible and use human [[platelet lysate]] (hPL).&lt;ref&gt;Hemeda, H., Giebel, B., Wagner, W. (16Feb2014) Evaluation of human platelet lysate versus fetal bovine serum for culture of mesenchymal stromal cells Cytotherapy p170-180 issue 2 doi.10.1016&lt;/ref&gt; This eliminates the worry of cross-species contamination when using FBS with human cells. hPL has emerged as a safe and reliable alternative as a direct replacement for FBS or other animal serum. In addition, [[chemically defined medium|chemically defined media]] can be used to eliminate any serum trace (human or animal), but this cannot always be accomplished with different cell types. Alternative strategies involve sourcing the animal blood from countries with minimum [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]/[[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|TSE]] risk, such as The United States, Australia and New Zealand,&lt;ref name="bovalco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bovalco.com/blog/post/view/9|title=Post - Blog &amp;#124; Boval BioSolutions, LLC|publisher=bovalco.com|accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using purified nutrient concentrates derived from serum in place of whole animal serum for cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selbornebiological.com/products/lipimax.htm|title=LipiMAX purified lipoprotein solution from bovine serum|year=2006|work=Selborne Biological Services|accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plating density''' (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for some cell types. For example, a lower plating density makes [[granulosa cell]]s exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as [[progesterone]]-producing [[theca lutein cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Portela VM, Zamberlam G, Price CA | title = Cell plating density alters the ratio of estrogenic to progestagenic enzyme gene expression in cultured granulosa cells | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 2050–5 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19324349 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells can be grown either in suspension or adherent cultures. Some cells naturally live in suspension, without being attached to a surface, such as cells that exist in the bloodstream. There are also cell lines that have been modified to be able to survive in suspension cultures so they can be grown to a higher density than adherent conditions would allow. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or [[microcarrier]], which may be coated with extracellular matrix (such as collagen and laminin) components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent. Another type of adherent culture is organotypic culture, which involves growing cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment as opposed to two-dimensional culture dishes. This 3D culture system is biochemically and physiologically more similar to ''in vivo'' tissue, but is technically challenging to maintain because of many factors (e.g. diffusion).

To address this problem of cell line cross-contamination, researchers are encouraged to authenticate their cell lines at an early passage to establish the identity of the cell line. Authentication should be repeated before freezing cell line stocks, every two months during active culturing and before any publication of research data generated using the cell lines. Many methods are used to identify cell lines, including [[isoenzyme]] analysis, [[human lymphocyte antigen]] (HLA) typing, chromosomal analysis, karyotyping, morphology and [[STR analysis]].&lt;ref name=dunham/&gt;

One significant cell-line cross contaminant is the immortal [[HeLa]] cell line.

===Other technical issues===
As cells generally continue to divide in culture, they generally grow to fill the available area or volume. This can generate several issues:

*Nutrient depletion in the growth media
*Changes in pH of the growth media
*Accumulation of [[apoptosis|apoptotic]]/[[necrosis|necrotic]] (dead) cells
*Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cell cycle arrest, causing cells to stop dividing, known as [[contact inhibition]].
*Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate [[cellular differentiation]].
*[[Heredity|Genetic]] and [[epigenetic]] alterations, with a [[natural selection]] of the altered cells potentially leading to overgrowth of abnormal, culture-adapted cells with decreased differentiation and increased proliferative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen HT, Geens M, Spits C | title = Genetic and epigenetic instability in human pluripotent stem cells | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–205 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23223511 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of cultured cells===
Among the common manipulations carried out on culture cells are media changes, passaging cells, and transfecting cells.
These are generally performed using tissue culture methods that rely on [[aseptic technique]]. Aseptic technique aims to avoid contamination with bacteria, yeast, or other cell lines. Manipulations are typically carried out in a [[biosafety hood]] or [[laminar flow cabinet]] to exclude contaminating micro-organisms. [[Antibiotics]] (e.g. [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]]) and antifungals (e.g.[[amphotericin B]]) can also be added to the growth media.

As cells undergo metabolic processes, acid is produced and the pH decreases. Often, a [[pH indicator]] is added to the medium to measure nutrient depletion.

====Media changes====
In the case of adherent cultures, the media can be removed directly by aspiration, and then is replaced. Media changes in non-adherent cultures involve centrifuging the culture and resuspending the cells in fresh media.

====Passaging cells====
{{main|Passaging}}
Passaging (also known as subculture or splitting cells) involves transferring a small number of cells into a new vessel. Cells can be cultured for a longer time if they are split regularly, as it avoids the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Suspension cultures are easily passaged with a small amount of culture containing a few cells diluted in a larger volume of fresh media. For adherent cultures, cells first need to be detached; this is commonly done with a mixture of [[trypsin]]-[[EDTA]]; however, other enzyme mixes are now available for this purpose. A small number of detached cells can then be used to seed a new culture. Some cell cultures, such as [[RAW cells]] are mechanically scraped from the surface of their vessel with rubber scrapers.

====Transfection and transduction====
{{main|Transfection|Transformation (genetics)}}
Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction of foreign DNA by [[transfection]]. This is often performed to cause cells to [[gene expression|express a gene]] of interest. More recently, the transfection of [[RNAi]] constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], [[infection]] or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal course of reproduction.

===Established human cell lines===
[[File:HeLa Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|right|Cultured [[HeLa]] cells have been stained with [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] turning their [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] blue, and are one of the earliest human cell lines descended from [[Henrietta Lacks]], who died of cervical cancer from which these cells originated.]]
Cell lines that originate with humans have been somewhat controversial in [[bioethics]], as they may outlive their parent organism and later be used in the discovery of lucrative medical treatments. In the pioneering decision in this area, the [[Supreme Court of California]] held in ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' that human patients have no property rights in cell lines derived from organs removed with their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/51C3d120.htm |title=Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 C3d 120 |publisher=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Hybridoma}}
It is possible to fuse normal cells with an [[immortalised cell line]]. This method is used to produce [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]]. In brief, lymphocytes isolated from the [[spleen]] (or possibly blood) of an [[immunization|immunised]] animal are combined with an immortal myeloma cell line (B cell lineage) to produce a [[hybridoma]] which has the antibody specificity of the primary lymphocyte and the immortality of the myeloma. [[Selective growth medium]] (HA or HAT) is used to select against unfused myeloma cells; primary lymphoctyes die quickly in culture and only the fused cells survive. These are screened for production of the required antibody, generally in pools to start with and then after single cloning.

===Cell strains===
A cell strain is derived either from a primary culture or a cell line by the selection or cloning of cells having specific properties or characteristics which must be defined. Cell strains are cells that have been adapted to culture but, unlike cell lines, have a finite division potential. Non-immortalized cells stop dividing after 40 to 60 population doublings&lt;ref name=Hayflick&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayflick L | title = A brief history of the mortality and immortality of cultured cells | journal = The Keio Journal of Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–82 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9785764 | doi = 10.2302/kjm.47.174 | series = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after this, they lose their ability to proliferate (a genetically determined event known as senescence).&lt;ref name=Worthington&gt;{{cite web|title=Worthington tissue guide|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/tissuedissociation/glossary.html|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of cell culture==
Mass culture of animal cell lines is fundamental to the manufacture of viral [[vaccines]] and other products of biotechnology. Culture of human stem cells is used to expand the number of cells and differentiate the cells into various somatic cell types for transplantation.&lt;ref name="pmid14643607"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian L, Saltzman WM | title = Improving the expansion and neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through culture surface modification | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 25 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 1331–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14643607 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stem cell culture is also used to harvest the molecules and exosomes that the stem cells release for the purposes of therapeutic development.&lt;ref name="pmid27190588"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maguire G | title = Therapeutics from Adult Stem Cells and the Hype Curve | journal = ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–3 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27190588 | pmc = 4867479 | doi = 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological products produced by [[recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology in animal cell cultures include [[enzymes]], synthetic [[hormones]], immunobiologicals ([[monoclonal antibodies]], [[interleukins]], [[lymphokines]]), and [[anticancer agents]]. Although many simpler proteins can be produced using rDNA in bacterial cultures, more complex proteins that are [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] (carbohydrate-modified) currently must be made in animal cells. An important example of such a complex protein is the hormone [[erythropoietin]]. The cost of growing mammalian cell cultures is high, so research is underway to produce such complex proteins in insect cells or in higher plants, use of single embryonic cell and [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] embryos as a source for direct gene transfer via particle bombardment, transit [[gene expression]] and [[confocal microscopy]] observation is one of its applications. It also offers to confirm single cell origin of somatic embryos and the asymmetry of the first cell division, which starts the process.

Cell culture is also a key technique for [[cellular agriculture]], which aims to provide both new products and new ways of producing existing agricultural products like milk, [[Cultured meat|(cultured) meat]], fragrances, and rhino horn from cells and microorganisms. It is therefore considered one means of achieving [[animal-free agriculture]]. It is also a central tool for teaching cell biology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto D, Aparicio G, Sotelo-Silveira JR | title = Cell migration analysis: A low-cost laboratory experiment for cell and developmental biology courses using keratocytes from fish scales | journal = Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 475–482 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28627731 | doi = 10.1002/bmb.21071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell culture in two dimensions===
Research in [[tissue engineering]], [[stem cells]] and [[molecular biology]] primarily involves cultures of cells on flat plastic dishes. This technique is known as two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, and was first developed by [[Wilhelm Roux]] who, in 1885, removed a portion of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in warm saline for several days on a flat glass plate. From the advance of [[polymer]] technology arose today's standard plastic dish for 2D cell culture, commonly known as the [[Petri dish]]. [[Julius Richard Petri]], a German [[bacteriologist]], is generally credited with this invention while working as an assistant to [[Robert Koch]]. Various researchers today also utilize culturing [[laboratory flasks]], conicals, and even disposable bags like those used in [[single-use bioreactor]]s.

Aside from Petri dishes, scientists have long been growing cells within biologically derived matrices such as collagen or fibrin, and more recently, on synthetic hydrogels such as polyacrylamide or PEG. They do this in order to elicit phenotypes that are not expressed on conventionally rigid substrates. There is growing interest in controlling [[matrix stiffness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Discher DE, Janmey P, Wang YL | title = Tissue cells feel and respond to the stiffness of their substrate | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5751 | pages = 1139–43 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16293750 | doi = 10.1126/science.1116995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that has led to discoveries in fields such as:

'''3D cell culture in scaffolds'''

Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as ''in vitro'' cell substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types including Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE) would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that, as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more histotypic rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317053872_NIH_PHASE_I_FINAL_REPORT_FIBROUS_SUBSTRATES_FOR_CELL_CULTURE_R3RR03544A|title=NIH Phase I Final Report: Fibrous Substrates for Cell Culture (R3RR03544A) (PDF Download Available)|last=Simon|first=Eric M. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1988 | website=ResearchGate|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 3D cell culture in hydrogels ====
As the natural [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is important in the survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells, different hydrogel culture matrices mimicking natural ECM structure are seen as potential approaches to in vivo –like cell culturing.&lt;ref name="pmid19472329"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tibbitt MW, Anseth KS | title = Hydrogels as extracellular matrix mimics for 3D cell culture | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 103 | issue = 4 | pages = 655–63 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19472329 | pmc = 2997742 | doi = 10.1002/bit.22361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogels are composed of interconnected pores with high water retention, which enables efficient transport of substances such as nutrients and gases. Several different types of hydrogels from natural and synthetic materials are available for 3D cell culture, including animal ECM extract hydrogels, protein hydrogels, peptide hydrogels, polymer hydrogels, and [[3D cell culture in wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel|wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel]].

==== 3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation ====
The [[3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation|3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation]] method (MLM) is the application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields using neodymium magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of a standard petri dish. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer polylysine. [[3D cell culture|3D cell culturing]] is scalable, with the capability for culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to high-throughput low volume systems.

===Tissue culture and engineering===
Cell culture is a fundamental component of [[tissue culture]] and [[tissue engineering]], as it establishes the basics of growing and maintaining cells ''in vitro''.
The major application of human cell culture is in stem cell industry, where [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s can be cultured and cryopreserved for future use. Tissue engineering potentially offers dramatic improvements in low cost medical care for hundreds of thousands of patients annually.

===Vaccines===
[[Vaccine]]s for [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], and [[chickenpox]] are currently made in cell cultures. Due to the [[H5N1]] [[pandemic]] threat, research into using cell culture for [[influenza vaccine]]s is being funded by the [[United States]] government. Novel ideas in the field include [[recombinant DNA]]-based vaccines, such as one made using human [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] (a common cold virus) as a vector,&lt;ref name=quickie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/news/wireservice/0,70102-0.html?tw=wn_index_7 |publisher=Wired.com|title=Quickie Bird Flu Vaccine Created|date=2006-01-26|author=Reuters|work=Wired|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Soloff AC, Lu X, Montecalvo A, Nguyen DC, Matsuoka Y, Robbins PD, Swayne DE, Donis RO, Katz JM, Barratt-Boyes SM, Gambotto A | title = Protection of mice and poultry from lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus through adenovirus-based immunization | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 1959–64 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16439551 | pmc = 1367171 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.80.4.1959-1964.2006 | url = http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/4/1959 | publisher = American Society for Microbiology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of non-mammalian cells==
Besides the culture of well-established immortalised cell lines, cells from primary explants of a plethora of organisms can be cultured for a limited period of time before sensecence occurs (see Hayflick's limit). Cultured primary cells have been extensively used in research, as is the case of fish keratocytes in cell migration studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapanan JL, Cooper KE, Leyva KJ, Hull EE | title = Collective cell migration of primary zebrafish keratocytes | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 326 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–65 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24973510 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee J, Jacobson K | title = The composition and dynamics of cell-substratum adhesions in locomoting fish keratocytes | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 110 ( Pt 22) | pages = 2833–44 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9427291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant cell culture methods===
{{main|Plant tissue culture}}
{{see also|Tobacco BY-2 cells}}
Plant cell cultures are typically grown as cell suspension cultures in a liquid medium or as [[Callus (cell biology)|callus cultures]] on a solid medium. The culturing of undifferentiated plant cells and calli requires the proper balance of the plant growth hormones [[auxin]] and [[cytokinin]].

===Insect cell culture===

Cells derived from [[Drosophila melanogaster]] (most prominently, [[Schneider 2 cells]]) can be used for experiments which may be hard to do on live flies or larvae, such as [[biochemistry|biochemical studies]] or studies using [[siRNA]]. Cell lines derived from the army worm ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', including [[Sf9 (cells)|Sf9]] and [[Sf21]], and from the cabbage looper ''[[Trichoplusia ni]]'', [[High Five cells]], are commonly used for expression of recombinant proteins using [[baculovirus]].

===Bacterial and yeast culture methods===
{{main|Microbiological culture}}
For bacteria and yeasts, small quantities of cells are usually grown on a solid support that contains nutrients embedded in it, usually a gel such as agar, while large-scale cultures are grown with the cells suspended in a nutrient broth.

===Viral culture methods===
{{main|Viral culture}}
The culture of viruses requires the culture of cells of mammalian, plant, fungal or bacterial origin as hosts for the growth and replication of the virus. Whole [[wild type]] viruses, [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] viruses or viral products may be generated in cell types other than their natural hosts under the right conditions. Depending on the species of the virus, infection and [[viral replication]] may result in host cell lysis and formation of a [[viral plaque]].

'''The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies''' (abbreviated '''CAPS''') is an [[independent research]] centre based in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. The centre came into being in July 2006.

CAPS is one of the very few research centres in Afghanistan that are managed and staffed by [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. The centre is engaged in research and policy analysis; education and training; and capacity building and knowledge sharing.

The centre focuses its research on issues pertaining to [[governance]], [[security]], and [[International development|development]]al challenges in Afghanistan. CAPS is also active in sharing its research findings with the Afghans as well as with the international community. It provides pre-deployment training to various contingents of the international community that are deployed in Afghanistan.

'''Denon DL103''' is a MC (moving coil) [[Magnetic cartridge|phono cartridge]] made by [[Denon|DENON]] company.

The DL103 was designed for professional [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast]] use in 1962 using the arms and [[Phonograph|turntables]] of the day. Production has continued uninterrupted since then. There are available different versions upgraded by other companies or individuals involved in [[DIY audio]].

==Technical Specification==
* Stylus: 16.5&amp;nbsp;µm diamond spherical tip
* Cantilever: Aluminum
* Frequency Response: 20 ~ 45&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]
* Output: 0.3&amp;nbsp;mV at 50&amp;nbsp;mm/s
* Output Impedance: 40&amp;nbsp;Ω
* Load Impedance: 100&amp;nbsp;Ω
* Channel Separation: Over 25&amp;nbsp;dB at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz
* Compliance: 5 x 10–6&amp;nbsp;cm/dyne (100&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Tracking Force: 2.3 ~ 2.7g (± 0.3g)
* Weight: 8.5&amp;nbsp;grams

Despite being designed in the 1960s it is still one of the masterpieces in audio technology and can easily compete with contemporary constructions. Due to its construction, Denon DL-103 is recommended as one of the very few cartridges suitable for heavy tonearms. (like in [[Lenco]] or [[Garrard Engineering and Manufacturing Company|Garrard]] turntables)
As a low-output phono cartridge it requires either a step up transformer for a standard MM phono preamp, or phono preamp with built-in MC input.

'''e-engineering''' is a concept that results from the concatenation of two previous ideas: [[distance learning]] and [[remote laboratories]].
Distance learning education has been around since the XIX century when the development of the mail services in England enabled the delivering of correspondence courses by mail. In the second half of the XX century, audio and television players where the first technological means used to deliver new, more engaging distance learning courses. And despite keeping the same way to communicate with students, the now more fast and reliable postal services, the materials were then much more diversified, ranging from carefully constructed texts and audio and video records to conventional broadcast radio and television, in this case, open to all, students and non-students. These were complemented by live individual or group sessions over the phone, between instructor and students, or among students, enabling real interactive teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;Gericota M. et al. "Combining E-Technologies &amp; E-Pedagogies to Create Online Undergraduate Courses in Engineering – an Example of a Successful Experience". ''Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies'', Barcelona, July 2016, pp 4209-4218.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the breakthrough that represents a true turning point in distance learning was the introduction of the concept of e-learning during the 90s, boosted by the two most significant advances in the telecommunications area – the Internet network and the invention of the World Wide Web. With the Internet a fast, reliable and interactive channel of communication between instructor and students or among students was now available, enabling a degree of interaction never achieved before in distance learning and comparable to face-to-face classes. On the other hand, the World Wide Web with its hypertext links enabled the construction of much more diversified and engaging materials, supported by audio, image, and video, readily available and highly interactive. This revolution was accompanied by the massification of personal computers, which made them accessible and affordable. In a decade, from 1990 to 2000, these very expensive machines, complicated to operate and whose access was almost restricted to scientist and engineers and to technical university students, became an indispensable household equipment.
In spite of all these advances, the undergraduate courses on offer were nevertheless restricted. Engineering courses which require the access to specific chemistry, physics, mechanics, electrical machines, electronics or optics laboratories and real-time interaction with equipment and instrumentation, where not available at distance.
This reality is changing due to the creation of remotely accessible laboratories that enable students to perform hands-on lab work remotely, with a level of interactivity and realism never achieved before. A lot of work is being done in the past decade in the area of remote laboratories. In the specialized literature, it is possible to find many examples of different labs for different areas of physics and electrical engineering,&lt;ref&gt;Farah, S., A. Benachenhou, G. Neveux and D. Barataud. "Design of a Flexible Hardware Interface for Multiple Remote Electronic Practical Experiments of Virtual Laboratory". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 8(2), pp. 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priem,F., R. De Craemer, J. Calu, F. Pedreschi, T. Zimmer, S. Saïghi and J. Lilja. "E-Learning in Science and Technology via a Common Learning Platform in a Lifelong Learning Project". ''European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning'' (1), 24 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sousa, N., G. R. Alves and M. Gericota. "An Integrated Reusable Remote Laboratory to Complement Electronics Teaching". ''IEEE Trans. on Learning Technologies'' 3(3), pp. 265-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gravier, C., J. Fayolle, B. Bayard, M. Ates and J. Lardon. "State of the Art About Remote Laboratories Paradigms – Foundations of Ongoing Mutations". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 4(1), pp. 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tawfik, M., E. Sancristobal, S. Martin, G. Diaz and M. Castro. "State-of-the-art remote laboratories for industrial electronics applications". ''Proc. Technologies Applied to Electronics Teaching'', pp. 359-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albu, M. M., K. E. Holbert, G. T. Heydt, S. Dan Grigorescu and V. Truşcă. "Embedding Remote Experimentation in Power Engineering Education". ''IEEE Trans. on Power Systems'' 19(1), pp. 139-143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hercog, D., B. Gergič, S. Uran, K. Jezernik. "A DSP-Based Remote Control Laboratory". ''IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics'' 54(6), pp. 3057-3068.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restivo, M. T., J. Mendes, A. M. Lopes, C. M. Silva and F. Chouzal. "A Remote Laboratory in Engineering Measurement". ''IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics'' 56(12), pp. 4836-4843.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García-Zubia, J., I. Angulo, J. Irurzun, P. Orduña, J. Ruiz, U. Hernández, M. Castro and E. Sancristobal. "Easily Integrable Platform for the Deployment of a Remote Laboratory for Microcontrollers". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 6(3), pp. 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso, A. and P. Gil. "Online Learning in Engineering Courses Using Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks". ''International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy'' 3(1), pp. 76-80.&lt;/ref&gt; each one allowing different degrees of freedom in the configuration of the experiment by the remote user. 
The integration of these remote laboratories as part of fully online undergraduate programs in engineering areas enabled the creation of e-engineering courses. These are e-learning courses in engineering areas where students perform their hands-on laboratory work remotely interacting in real-time with equipment and instrumentation available online 24/7.
The first example of one such course is the L3-EOLES (Electronics and Optics e-Learning for Embedded Systems) course, an entirely online English-taught 3rd year bachelor's degree in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gericota M. et al. "EOLES course - The first accredited online degree course in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems". ''Proceedings of the IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference'', Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia, March 2015, pp 410-417.&lt;/ref&gt; The course, that started being offered in the school year 2014/15, is currently in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu G. et al. "Overview of the first year of the L3-EOLES training", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation'', Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, Madrid, February 2016, pp 396-399.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed as a specialization year, this course is oriented towards a currently expanding field in the electrical and computer engineering area, the field of electronics and optics for embedded systems. This area of knowledge requires students to be able to perform experimental work to acquire the expected technical experimental skills. The execution of laboratory assignments over the Internet required the development of remotely accessible experimental laboratories enabling students to interact in real-time with real experimental setups. This innovative training has been accredited by the educational authorities in Tunisia, Morocco, and France.&lt;ref&gt;E-learning tools. L3-EOLES - The university of future at home!

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.5|"The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all "the ends of the world are come," and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants: and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern thought has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea." The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' described by [[Walter Pater]]]]

'''Ekphrasis''' or '''ecphrasis''',  comes from the Greek for the description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical exercise,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chambers Dictionary'', Chambers Harrap, Edinburgh 1993 {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in the adjectival form '''ekphrastic''', is a vivid, often dramatic, verbal description of a [[Visual arts|visual work of art]], either real or imagined. In [[Classical antiquity|ancient times]], it referred to a description of any thing, person, or [[experience]]. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐκ ''ek'' and φράσις ''phrásis'', 'out' and 'speak' respectively, and the verb ἐκφράζειν ''ekphrázein'', "to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name".

According to the [[Poetry Foundation]], "an ekphrastic poem is a vivid description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art."&lt;ref&gt;The Poetry Foundation, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/glossary-term/ekphrasis Glossary Terms: Ekphrasis] (accessed 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an ekphrastic poem is a poem inspired or stimulated by a work of art.

Ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a [[rhetorical device]] in which one medium of [[art]] tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its [[essence]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness.
A descriptive work of [[prose]] or [[poetry]], a [[film]], or even a [[photograph]] may thus highlight through its ''rhetorical'' vividness what is happening, or what is shown in, say, any of the [[visual art]]s, and in doing so, may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. One example is a painting of a sculpture: the painting is "telling the story of" the sculpture, and so becoming a storyteller, as well as a story (work of art) itself. Virtually any type of [[artistic media|artistic medium]] may be the actor of, or subject of ekphrasis. One may not always be able, for example, to make an accurate sculpture of a book to retell the story in an authentic way; yet if it's the spirit of the book that we are more concerned about, it certainly can be conveyed by virtually any medium and thereby enhance the artistic impact of the original book through [[synergy]].

In this way, a painting may represent a sculpture, and vice versa; a poem portray a picture; a sculpture depict a heroine of a novel; in fact, given the right circumstances, any art may describe any other art, especially if a ''rhetorical element'', standing for the sentiments of the artist when she/he created her/his work, is present. For instance, the distorted faces in a crowd in a painting depicting an original work of art, a sullen countenance on the face of a sculpture representing a historical figure, or a film showing particularly dark aspects of neo-Gothic architecture, are all examples of ekphrasis.

== History ==

=== Plato's forms, the beginning of ekphrasis ===
In the ''Republic'', Book X, Plato discusses [[substantial form|forms]] by using real things, such as a [[bed]], for example, and calls each way a bed has been made, a "bedness". He commences with the original form of a bed, one of a variety of ways a bed may have been constructed by a craftsman and compares that form with an ideal form of a bed, of a perfect [[archetype]] or image in the form of which beds ought to be made, in short, the [[epitome]] of bedness.

In his analogy, one bedness form shares its own bedness – with all its shortcomings – with that of the ideal form, or template. A third bedness, too, may share the ideal form. He continues with the fourth form also containing elements of the ideal template or archetype which in this way remains an ever-present and invisible ideal version with which the craftsman compares his work. As bedness after bedness shares the ideal form and template of all creation of beds, and each bedness is associated with another ad infinitum, it is called an "infinite regress of forms".

=== From form to ekphrasis ===
It was this epitome, this template of the ideal form, that a craftsman or later an artist would try to reconstruct in his attempt to achieve perfection in his work, that was to manifest itself in ekphrasis at a later stage.

Artists began to use their own literary and artistic [[genre]] of art to work and reflect on another art to illuminate what the eye might not see in the original, to elevate it and possibly even surpass it.

=== Plato and Aristotle ===
For [[Plato]] (and [[Aristotle]]), it is not so much the form of each bed that defines ''bedness'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~jjacobs1/utpictura/1.htm|title=Ecphrasis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[mimesis|mimetic]] stages at which beds may be viewed that defines ''bedness.'' 
# a bed as a physical entity is a mere form of bed
# any view from whichever perspective, be it a side elevation, a full panoramic view from above, or looking at a bed end-on is at a second remove
# a full picture, characterising the whole bed is at a third remove
# ekphrasis of a bed in another art form is at a fourth remove

=== Socrates and Phaedrus ===
In another instance, [[Socrates]] talks about ekphrasis to [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] thus:&lt;br /&gt;
"You know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing,
which makes it truly correspond to painting.&lt;br /&gt;
The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive,&lt;br /&gt;
but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the same with written words; they seem to talk&lt;br /&gt;
to you as if they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything&lt;br /&gt;
about what they say, from a desire to be instructed,&lt;br /&gt;
they go on telling you just the same thing forever".&lt;ref&gt;Plato: ''Phaedrus'' 275d&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==

=== In literature ===

The fullest example of ekphrasis in antiquity can be found in [[Philostratus III|Philostratus of Lemnos]]' ''Eikones'' which describes 64 pictures in a Neapolitan villa.  Ekphrasis is described in [[Aelius Festus Aphthonius|Aphthonius]]' ''[[Progymnasmata]]'', his [[textbook]] of [[style guide|style]], and later classical literary and rhetorical textbooks, and with other classical literary techniques was keenly revived in the Renaissance.

In the Middle Ages, ekphrasis was less often practiced, especially as regards real objects, and historians of [[medieval art]] have complained that the accounts of monastic chronicles recording now vanished art concentrate on objects made from valuable materials or with the status of [[relic]]s, and rarely give more than the cost and weight of objects, and perhaps a mention of the subject matter of the [[iconography]].

The [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods made much use of ekphrasis. In Renaissance Italy, Canto 33 of [[Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' describes a picture gallery created by Merlin. In Spain, [[Lope de Vega]] often used allusions and descriptions of Italian art in his plays, and included the painter [[Titian]] as one of his characters. [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] also incorporated works of art in dramas such as ''The Painter of his Dishonor''. [[Cervantes]], who spent his youth in Italy, utilized many Renaissance frescoes and paintings in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and many of his other works. In England, [[Shakespeare]] briefly describes a group of erotic paintings in [[Cymbeline]], but his most extended exercise is a 200-line description of the Greek army before Troy in [[The Rape of Lucrece]]. Ekphrasis seems to have been less common in France during these periods.

Instances of ekphrasis in [[19th century literature]] can be found in the works of such influential figures as Spanish novelist [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], French poet, painter and novelist [[Théophile Gautier]], Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]], and Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].

[[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby Dick]], or The Whale'' features an intense use of ekphrasis as a stylistic manifesto of the book in which it appears. In the chapter "The Spouter Inn", a painting hanging on the wall of a whaler's inn is described as irreconcilably unclear, overscrawled with smoke and defacements. The narrator, so-called Ishmael, describes how this painting can be both lacking any definition and still provoking in the viewer dozens of distinct possible understandings, until the great mass of interpretations resolves into a Whale, which grounds all the interpretations while containing them, an indication of how Melville sees his own book unfolding around this chapter.

In Pérez Galdós's ''Our Friend Manso'' (1882), the narrator describes two paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]] to point to the shipwreck of ideals; while in  ''La incógnita'' (1889), there are many allusions and descriptions of Italian art, including references to [[Botticelli]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Masaccio]], [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], etc.

In [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s 1888 work ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'', the first act begins with the description of a painting of a mermaid dying on the shore and is followed by a description of a sculpture that depicts a woman having a nightmare of an ex-lover returning to her.  Both works of art can be interpreted as having much importance in the overall meaning of the play as protagonist Ellida Wangel both yearns for her lost youth spent on an island out at sea and is later in the play visited by a lover she thought dead.  Furthermore, as an interesting example of the back-and-forth dynamic that exists between literary ekphrasis and art, in 1896 (eight years after the play was written) Norwegian painter [[Edvard Munch]] painted an image similar to the one described by Ibsen in a painting he entitled (unsurprisingly enough) ''Lady from the Sea''.  Ibsen's last work [[When We Dead Awaken]] also contains examples of ekphrasis as the play's protagonist, Arnold Rubek, is a sculptor who several times throughout the play describes his masterpiece "Resurrection Day" at length and in the many different forms the sculpture took throughout the stages of its creation.  Once again the evolution of the sculpture as described in the play can be read as a reflection on the transformation undergone by Rubek himself and even as a statement on the progression Ibsen's own plays took as many scholars have read this final play (stated by Ibsen himself to be an 'epilogue') as the playwright's reflection on his own work as an artist.

The Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] employed ekphrasis most notably in his novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''.  In this novel, the protagonist, Prince Myshkin, sees a painting of a dead Christ in the house of Rogozhin that has a profound effect on him.  Later in the novel, another character, Hippolite, describes the painting at much length depicting the image of Christ as one of brutal realism that lacks any beauty or sense of the divine.  Rogozhin, who is himself the owner of the painting, at one moment says that the painting has the power to take away a man's faith, a comment that Dostoyevsky himself made to his wife Anna upon seeing the actual painting that the painting in the novel is based on, ''[[The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb]]'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]].  The painting was seen shortly before Dostoyevsky began the novel.  Though this is the major instance of ekphrasis in the novel, and the one which has the most thematic importance to the story as a whole, other instances can be spotted when Prince Myshkin sees a painting of Swiss landscape that reminds him of a view he saw while at a sanatorium in Switzerland, and also when he first sees the face of his love interest, Nastasya, in the form of a painted portrait.  At one point in the novel, Nastasya, too, describes a painting of Christ, her own imaginary work that portrays Christ with a child, an image which naturally evokes comparison between the image of the dead Christ.

The Irish aesthete and novelist [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890/1891) tells how Basil Hallward paints a picture of the young man named Dorian Gray. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, who espouses a new hedonism, dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and all pleasures of the senses. Under his sway, Dorian bemoans the fact that his youth will soon fade. He would sell his soul so as to have the portrait age rather than himself. As Dorian engages in a debauched life, the gradual deterioration of the portrait becomes a mirror of his soul. There are repeated instances of notional ekphrasis of the deteriorating figure in the painting throughout the novel, although these are often partial, leaving much of the portrait's imagery to the imagination. The novel forms part of the magic portrait genre. Wilde had previously experimented with employing portraits in his written work, as in [[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]] (1889).

[[Anthony Powell]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' begins with an evocation of the painting by [[Poussin]] which [[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|gives the sequence its name]], and contains other passages of ekphrasis, perhaps influenced by the many passages in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.

In the 20th century, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s "[[24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai]]" uses an ekphrastic frame, descriptions of [[Hokusai]]'s famous series of woodcuts, as a structural device for his story.

==== Ekphrastic poetry ====

Ekphrastic poetry may be encountered as early as the days of [[Homer]] whose [[Iliad]] (Book 18) describes the [[Shield of Achilles]], with how [[Hephaestus]] made it as well as its completed shape.&lt;ref name="writingaboutart"&gt;Munsterberg, Marjorie, Writing About Art: [http://writingaboutart.org/pages/ekphrasis.html Ekphrasis] (retrieved 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Famous later examples include [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] when he describes what [[Aeneas]] sees engraved on the doors of [[Carthage]]'s temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and [[Catullus 64]], which contains an extended ekphrasis of an imaginary coverlet with the story of [[Ariadne]] picked out on it.

Ekphrastic poetry flourished in the [[romanticism|Romantic]] era and again among the [[pre-Raphaelite]] poets. A major poem of the English Romantics – [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]]— provides an example of the artistic potential of ekphrasis. The entire poem is a description of a piece of pottery that the narrator finds immensely evocative. [[Felicia Hemans]] made extensive use of ekphrasis &lt;ref&gt;Grant F. Scott. ''The Fragile Image: Felicia Hemans and Romantic Ekphrasis'' in ''Felicia Hemans. Reimagining Poetry in the Nineteenth Century''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-333-80109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as did [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], especially in her ''Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures''. [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s "double-works" exemplify the use of the genre by an artist mutually to enhance his visual and literary art. Rossetti also ekphrasised a number of paintings by other artists, generally from the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='For "Our Lady of the Rocks", by Leonardo da Vinci'|url=http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/5-1848.raw.html|website=Rossetti Archive|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include [[Michael Field (author)|Michael Field]]'s 1892 volume ''Sight and Song'', which contains only ekphrastic poetry; [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s poem 'Before the Mirror', which ekphrasises [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s [[Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl]], hinted at only by the poem's subtitle, "Verses Written under a Picture"; and [[Robert Browning]]'s [[My Last Duchess]], which although a [[dramatic monologue]], includes some description by the Duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand.

Ekphrastic poetry is still commonly practised. Twentieth-century examples include [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s "Archaïscher Torso Apollos",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/gr/Rilke.html|title=Rainer Maria Rilke, Torso of an Archaic Apollo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1952), a poem by [[W.H. Auden]],&lt;ref name="writingaboutart" /&gt; which brings the tradition back to its start with an ironic retelling of the episode in Homer (see above), where [[Thetis]] finds very different scenes from those she expects. In contrast, his earlier poem ''[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]]'' describes a particular real and very famous painting ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', thought until recently to be by rather than after [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], which is also described in the poem by [[William Carlos Williams]] ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]''.{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}

=== In, or as, art history ===

Since the types of objects described in classical ekphrases often lack survivors to modern times, art historians have often been tempted to use descriptions in literature as sources for the appearance of actual Greek or Roman art, an approach full of risk. This is because ekphrasis typically contains an element of competition with the art it describes, aiming to demonstrate the superior ability of words to "paint a picture".  Many subjects of ekphrasis are clearly imaginary, for example those of the epics, but with others it remains uncertain the extent to which they were, or were expected to be by early audiences, at all accurate.

This tendency is by no means restricted to classical art history; the evocative but vague mentions of objects in metalwork in ''[[Beowulf]]'' are eventually always mentioned by writers on [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and compared to the treasures of [[Sutton Hoo]] and the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. The ekphrasic writings of the lawyer turned bishop [[Asterius of Amasea]] (fl. around 400) are often cited by art historians of the period to fill gaps in the surviving artistic record.  The inadequacy of most medieval accounts of art is mentioned above; they generally lack any specific details other than cost and the owner or donor, and hyperbolic but wholly vague praise.

Journalistic art criticism was effectively invented by [[Denis Diderot]] in his long pieces on the works in the [[Paris Salon]], and extended and highly pointed accounts of the major exhibitions of new art became a popular seasonal feature in the journalism of most Western countries.  Since few if any of the works could be illustrated description and evocation was necessary, and the cruelty of descriptions of works disliked became a part of the style.

As [[art history]] began to become an academic subject in the 19th century, exphrasis as [[formal analysis]] of objects was regarded as a vital component of the subject, and by no means all examples lack attractiveness as literature.  Writers on art for a wider audience produced many descriptions with great literary as well as art historical merit; in English [[John Ruskin]], both the most important journalistic critic and popularizer of historic art of his day, and [[Walter Pater]], above all for his famous evocation of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', are among the most notable.  As photography in books or on television allowed audiences a direct visual comparison to the verbal description, the role of ekphrasic commentary on the images was even perhaps increased.

Ekphrasis has also been an influence on art; for example the ekphrasis of the Shield of Achilles in Homer and other classical examples were certainly an inspiration for the elaborately decorated large serving dishes in silver or [[silver-gilt]], crowded with complicated scenes in [[relief]], that were produced in 16th century [[Mannerist]] metalwork.

=== In music ===

There are a number of examples of ekphrasis in music, of which the best known is probably ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a [[suite (music)|suite]] in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for [[piano]] by the Russian composer [[Modest Mussorgsky]] in 1874, and then very popular in various arrangements for orchestra. The suite is based on real pictures, although as the exhibition was dispersed, most are now unidentified.

The first movement of ''[[Three Places in New England]]'' by [[Charles Ives]] is an ekphrasis of the [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]] in Boston, sculpted by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. Ives also wrote a poem inspired by the sculpture as a companion piece to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mortensen|first=Scott|title=Orchestral Set No. 1: Three Places in New England – Notes|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Ives/WK_OS_1_Three_Places.htm|work=A Charles Ives Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachmaninoff]]'s symphonic poem ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' is a musical evocation of [[Böcklin]]'s [[Isle of the Dead (painting)|painting of the same name]]. [[King Crimson]]'s song "[[Starless and Bible Black|The Night Watch]]", with lyrics written by [[Richard Palmer-James]], is an ekphrasis on [[Rembrandt]]'s painting ''[[The Night Watch]]''.

=== Notional ekphrasis ===

Notional ekphrasis may describe mental processes such as dreams, thoughts and whimsies of the imagination. It may also be one art describing or depicting another work of art which as yet is still in an inchoate state of creation, in that the work described may still be resting in the imagination of the artist before he has begun his creative work. The expression may also be applied to an art describing the origin of another art, how it came to be made and the circumstances of its being created. Finally it may describe an entirely imaginary and non-existing work of art, as though it were factual and existed in reality.

== In ancient literature ==


=== Greek literature ===

==== ''The Iliad'' ====

The [[shield of Achilles]] is described by Homer in a famous example of ekphrastic poetry, used to depict events that have occurred in the past and events that will occur in the future. The shield contains images representative of the [[Cosmos]] and the inevitable fate of the city of Troy. The shield of Achilles features the following nine depictions:
# The Earth, Sea, Sky, Moon and the Cosmos (484–89)
# Two cities – one where a wedding and a trial are taking place, and one that is considered to be Troy, due to the battle occurring inside the city (509–40)
# A field that is being ploughed (541–49)
# The home of a King where the harvest is being reaped (550–60)
# A vineyard that is being harvested (561–72)
# A herd of cattle that is being attacked by two lions, while the Herdsman and his dogs try to scare the lions off the prize bull (573–86)
# A sheep farm (587–89)
# A scene with young men and women dancing (590–606)
# The mighty Ocean as it encircles the shield (607–609)

==== ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]'' ====

Although not written as elaborately as previous examples of ekphrastic poetry, from lines 609–614 the belt of [[Heracles|Herakles]] is described as having "marvelous works,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Odyssey of Homer|last=Lattimore|first=Richmond|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|year=1967|location=New York|at=lines 609–614}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as animals with piercing eyes and hogs in a grove of trees. It also contains multiple images of battles and occurrences of manslaughter. In ''the Odyssey,'' there is also a scene where Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, must prove to his wife, Penelope, that he has proof that Odysseus is still alive. She asks him about the clothes Odysseus was wearing during the time when the beggar claims he hosted Odysseus. Homer uses this opportunity to implement more ekphrastic imagery by describing the golden brooch of Odysseus, which depicts a hound strangling a fawn that it captured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''The Argonautika'' ====

The Cloak of Jason is another example of ekphrastic poetry. In ''[[Argonautica|The Argonautika]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodios|first1=Apollonios|title=The Argonautika|at=lines 720–763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason's cloak has seven events embroidered into it:

# The forging of Zeus' thunderbolts by the Cyclops (730-734)
# The building of Thebes by the sons of Antiope (735–741)
# Aphrodite with the shield of Ares (742–745)
# The battle between Teleboans and the Sons of Electryon (746–751)
# Pelops winning Hippodameia (752–758)
# Apollo punishing Tityos (759–762)
# Phrixus and the Ram (763–765)

The description of the cloak provides many examples of ekphrasis, and not only is modeled off of Homer's writing, but alludes to several occurrences in Homer's epics ''the Iliad'' and ''the Odyssey''. Jason's cloak can be examined in many ways. The way the cloak's events are described is similar to the catalogue of Women that Odysseus encounters on his trip to the Underworld.&lt;ref name="University of Berkeley, California"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulloch|first1=Anthony|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=www.academia.edu|page=59|url=https://www.academia.edu/367874/Jasons_Cloak|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloak and its depicted events lend more to the story than a simple description; in true ekphrasis fashion it not only compares Jason to future heroes such as Achilles and Odysseus, but also provides a type of foreshadowing. Jason, by donning the cloak, can be seen as a figure who would rather resort to coercion, making him a parallel to Odysseus, who uses schemes and lies to complete his voyage back to Ithaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association (1974-)|date=1 January 1980|volume=110|pages=263–286|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason also bears similarities to Achilles; by donning the cloak, Jason is represented as an Achillean heroic figure due to the comparisons made between his cloak and the shield of Achilles. He is also takes up a spear given to him by Atalanta, not as an afterthought, but due to his heroic nature and the comparison between himself and Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|date=1993|publisher=The University of California Press|page=120|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jason only wears the cloak while going to meet with Hypsipyle, it foreshadows the changes that Jason will potentially undergo during his adventure. Through the telling of the scenes on the cloak, Apollonios relates the scenes on the cloak as virtues and morals that should be upheld by the Roman people, and that Jason should learn to live by. Such virtues include the piety represented by the Cyclops during the forging of Zeus' thunderbolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association |date=1 January 1980|volume=110|page=265|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reminiscent of the scene in ''the Iliad'' when Thetis goes to see Hephaestus, and requisitions him to create a new set of armor for her son Achilles. Before he began creating the shield and armor, Hephaestus was forging 20 golden tripods for his own hall, and in the scene on Jason's cloak we see the Cyclops performing the last step of creating the thunderbolts for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|page=122|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman literature ===

==== ''The Aeneid'' ====

''[[Aeneid|The Aeneid]]'' is an epic that was written by Virgil during the reign of Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. While the epic itself mimics Homer's works, it can be seen as propaganda for Augustus and the new Roman empire.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R. D.|date=1981|title=The Shield of Aeneas|jstor=41591854|journal=Vergilius|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield of Aeneas is described in book eight, from lines 629–719.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This shield was given to him by his mother, Venus, after she asked her husband Vulcan to create it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aeneid of Virgil|last=Ahl|first=Frederick|publisher=Oxford World's Classics|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-923195-9|location=Great Britain|at=lines 372–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene is almost identical to Thetis, the mother of Achilles, asking Hephaestus to create her son new weapons and armor for the battle of Troy.

The difference in the descriptions of the two shields are easily discernible; the shield of Achilles depicts many subjects, whereas the shield made for Aeneas depicts the future that Rome will have, containing propaganda in favor of the Emperor Augustus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much like other ekphrastic poetry, it depicts a clear catalogue of events:

# The She Wolf and the suckling Romulus and Remus (629–634)
# The Rape of the Sabine Women (635–639)
# Mettius pulled apart by horses (640–645)
# Invasion of Lars Parsona (646–651)
# Manlius guarding the capitol (652–654)
# Gauls invading Rome (655–665)
# Tartarus with Cato and Catiline (666–670)
# The Sea around the width of the shield (671–674)
# The Battle of Actium (675–677)
# Augustus and Agrippa (678–684)
# Antony and Cleopatra (685–695)
# Triumph (696–719)

There is speculation as to why Virgil depicted certain events, while completely avoiding others such as Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Virgil clearly outlined the shield chronologically, but scholars argue that the events on the shield are meant to reflect certain Roman values that would have been of high importance to the Roman people and to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://classicsvic.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/penwillvol18.pdf|title=Reading Aeneas' Shield|last=Penwill|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values may include ''virtus, clementia, iustitia'', and ''pietas'', which were the values inscribed on a shield given to Augustus by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=S. J.|date=November 1997|title=The Survival and Supremacy of Rome: The Unity of the Shield of Aeneas|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8428342&amp;fileId=S0075435800058081|journal=The Journal of Roman Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instance of ekphrasitc poetry maybe Virgil's attempt to relate more of his work to Augustus.

Earlier in the epic, when Aeneas travels to Carthage, he sees the temple of the city, and on it are great works of art that are described by the poet using the ekphrastic style. Like the other occurrences of ekphrasis, these works of art describe multiple events. Out of these, there are eight images related to the Trojan War:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Depictions of Agamemnon and Menelaus, Priam and Achilles (459)
# Greeks running from Trojan soldiers (468)
# The sacking of the tents of Rhesus and the Thracians, and their deaths by Diomedes (468–472)
# Troilus being thrown from his Chariot as he flees from Achilles (473–478)
# The women of Troy in lamentation, praying to the gods to help them (479–482)
# Achilles selling Hektor's body (483–487)
# Priam begging for the return of his son, with the Trojan commanders nearby (483–488)
# Penthesilea the Amazon, and her fighters (489–493)

==== ''The Metamorphoses'' ====

There are several examples of ekphrasis in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''; one in which Phaeton journeys to the temple of the sun to meet his father Phoebus. When Phaeton gazes upon the temple of the sun, he sees the following carvings:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamorphoses|last=Martin|first=Charles|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The seas that circle the Earth, the surrounding lands, and the sky (8–9)
# The gods of the sea and the Nymphs (10–19)
# Scenes of men, beasts, and local gods (20–21)
# Twelve figures of the Zodiac, six on each side of the door to the temple (22–23)

== Other aspects ==

=== Educational value of using ekphrasis in teaching literature ===

The rationale behind using examples of ekphrasis to teach literature is that once the connection between a poem and a painting are recognized for example, the student's emotional and intellectual engagement with the literary text is extended to new dimensions. The literary text takes on new meaning and there is more to respond to because another art form is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Joseph O'Beirne, and Lucy Floyd Morcock Milner. Bridging English. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice, 1999. pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as the material taught has both a visual and linguistic basis new connections of understanding are formed in the student's brain thus creating a stronger foundation for understanding, remembrance and internalization. Using ekphrasis to teach literature can be done through the use of [[higher order thinking]] skills such as distinguishing different perspectives, interpreting, inferring, sequencing, compare and contrast and evaluating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">In [[electrical engineering]], '''electric machine''' is a general term for [[machine]]s using [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]s, such as [[electric motor]]s, [[electric generator]]s, and others. They are [[electromechanical]] energy converters: an electric motor converts electricity to [[mechanical power]] while an electric generator converts mechanical power to electricity. The moving parts in a machine can be rotating (''rotating machines'') or linear (''linear machines'').  Besides motors and generators, a third category often included is [[transformer]]s, which although they do not have any [[moving parts]] are also energy converters, changing the [[voltage]] level of an [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan. Handbook of Transformer Design and Applications, Chap. 1 p1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric machines, in the form of generators, produce virtually all electric power on Earth, and in the form of electric motors consume approximately 60% of all electric power produced. Electric machines were developed beginning in the mid 19th century and since that time have been a ubiquitous component of the  infrastructure. Developing more efficient electric machine technology is crucial to any global conservation, [[green energy]], or [[alternative energy]] strategy.

==Generator==
[[File:ManitobaHydroPointeduBois Generator.jpg|thumb|Electric generator.]]
{{main|Electric generator}}
An electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. A generator forces [[electrons]] to flow through an external [[electrical circuit]].  It is somewhat analogous to a water pump, which creates a flow of water but does not create the water inside.  The source of mechanical energy, the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]], may be a reciprocating or turbine [[steam engine]], water falling through a [[hydropower|turbine or waterwheel]], an [[internal combustion engine]], a [[wind turbine]], a hand [[crank (mechanism)|crank]], [[compressed air]] or any other source of mechanical energy.

The two main parts of an electrical machine can be described in either mechanical or electrical terms. In mechanical terms, the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is the rotating part, and the [[stator]] is the stationary part of an electrical machine. In electrical terms, the armature is the power-producing component and the field is the magnetic field component of an electrical machine. The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator. The [[magnetic field]] can be provided by either [[electromagnet]]s or [[permanent magnet]]s mounted on either the rotor or the stator. Generators are classified into two types, [[AC generator]]s and [[DC generator]]s.

===AC generator===
An [[AC generator]] converts mechanical energy into [[AC electricity|alternating current electricity]]. Because power transferred into the field circuit is much less than power transferred into the armature circuit, AC generators nearly always have the field winding on the rotor and the armature winding on the stator.

AC generators are classified into several types.
*In an [[induction generator]], the stator magnetic flux induces currents in the rotor. The prime mover then drives the rotor above the synchronous speed, causing the opposing rotor flux to cut the stater coils producing active current in the stater coils, thus sending power back to the electrical grid. An induction generator draws reactive power from the connected system and so cannot be an isolated source of power. 
*In a [[alternator|Synchronous generator (alternator)]], the current for the magnetic field is provided by a separate [[Excitation (magnetic)|DC current source]].

===DC generator===
An electric generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. An electric generator works based on the principle that whenever conductor cuts the magnetic field, an emf is induced which will cause the current to flow if conductor circuit is closed. Take the working of simple loop Generator as an example.

==Motor==
[[File:Silniki by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Electric motor.|236x236px]]
{{main|Electric motor}}
An electric motor converts [[electrical energy]] into [[mechanical energy]]. The reverse process of electrical generators, most [[electric motors]] operate through interacting [[magnetic fields]] and [[electrical conductor|current-carrying conductors]] to generate rotational force. Motors and generators have many similarities and many types of electric motors can be run as generators, and vice versa.
Electric motors are found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, [[power tools]], and [[hard drive|disk drives]]. They may be powered by direct current or by alternating current which leads to the two main classifications: [[AC motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s.

===AC motor===
{{main|AC motor}}
An [[AC motor]] converts alternating current into mechanical energy. It commonly consists of two basic parts, an outside stationary stator having coils supplied with alternating current to produce a rotating magnetic field, and an inside rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.
The two main types of AC motors are distinguished by the type of rotor used.
*[[induction motor|Induction (asynchronous) motor]], the rotor magnetic field is created by an [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator magnetic field to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction motor rotors, which are [[squirrel-cage rotor]], [[wound rotor motor|wound rotor]] and [[solid core rotor]].
*[[Synchronous motor]], it does not rely on induction and so can rotate exactly at the supply frequency or sub-multiple. The magnetic field of the rotor is either generated by direct current delivered through slip rings ([[Excitation (magnetic)|exciter]]) or by a permanent magnet.

===DC motor===
{{main|DC motor}}
The [[brushed DC electric motor]] generates torque directly from DC power supplied to the motor by using internal commutation, stationary permanent magnets, and rotating electrical magnets. Brushes and springs carry the electric current from the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. [[Brushless DC motor]]s use a rotating permanent magnet in the rotor, and stationary electrical magnets on the motor housing. A motor controller converts DC to [[alternating current|AC]].  This design is simpler than that of brushed motors because it eliminates the complication of transferring power from outside the motor to the spinning rotor.
An example of a brushless, synchronous DC motor is a [[stepper motor]] which can divide a full rotation into a large number of steps.

==Other electromagnetic machines==
Other electromagnetic machines include the [[Amplidyne]], [[Synchro]], [[Metadyne]], [[Adjustable-speed_drive#Eddy_current_drives|Eddy current clutch]], [[Eddy current brake]], [[Dynamometer#Eddy_current_type_absorber|Eddy current dynamometer]], [[Dynamometer#Hysteresis_dynamometers|Hysteresis dynamometer]], [[Rotary converter]], and [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard set]]. A rotary converter is a combination of machines that act as a mechanical rectifier, inverter or frequency converter. The Ward Leonard set is a combination of machines used to provide speed control. Other machine combinations include the Kraemer and Scherbius systems.

==Transformer==
[[File:Trafostation Alter Hellweg IMGP4722.jpg|thumb|Transformer.]]
{{main|Transformer}}
A transformer is a static device that converts [[alternating current]] from one voltage level to another level (higher or lower), or to the same level, without changing the frequency. A transformer transfers [[electrical energy]] from one [[electrical network|circuit]] to another through [[inductive coupling|inductively coupled]] conductors—the transformer's coils.  A varying [[electric current]] in the first or ''primary'' winding creates a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core and thus a varying [[magnetic field]] through the ''secondary'' winding. This varying magnetic field [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] a varying [[electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]] or "[[volt]]age" in the secondary winding. This effect is called [[mutual induction]].

There are three types of transformers
# Step-up transformer
# Step-down  transformer
# [[Isolation transformer]]

There are four types of transformers based on structure
# core type
# shell type
# power type
# instrument type

==Electromagnetic-rotor machines==
''Electromagnetic-rotor machines'' are machines having some kind of electric current in the rotor which creates a magnetic field which interacts with the stator windings. The rotor current can be the internal current in a permanent magnet (PM machine), a current supplied to the rotor through brushes (Brushed machine) or a current set up in closed rotor windings by a varying magnetic field (Induction machine).

===Permanent magnet machines===
''PM machines'' have permanent magnets in the rotor which set up a magnetic field. The magnetomotive force in a PM (caused by orbiting electrons with aligned spin) is generally much higher than what is possible in a copper coil. The copper coil can, however, be filled with a ferromagnetic material, which gives the coil much lower [[magnetic reluctance]]. Still the magnetic field created by modern PMs ([[Neodymium magnet]]s) is stronger, which means that PM machines have a better torque/volume and torque/weight ratio than machines with rotor coils under continuous operation. This may change with introduction of superconductors in rotor.

Since the permanent magnets in a PM machine already introduce considerable magnetic reluctance, then the reluctance in the air gap and coils are less important. This gives considerable freedom when designing PM machines.

It is usually possible to overload electric machines for a short time until the current in the coils heats parts of the machine to a temperature which cause damage. PM machines can in less degree be subjected to such overload because too high current in the coils can create a magnetic field strong enough to demagnetise the magnets.

===Brushed machines===
''Brushed machines'' are machines where the rotor coil is supplied with current through brushes in much the same way as current is supplied to the car in an electric [[slot car]] track. More durable brushes can be made of graphite or liquid metal. It is even possible to eliminate the brushes in a "brushed machine" by using a part of rotor and stator as a transformer which transfer current without creating torque. Brushes must not be confused with a commutator. The difference is that the brushes only transfer electric current to a moving rotor while a commutator also provide switching of the current direction.

There is iron (usually [[Transformer#Construction|laminated steel cores]] made of [[sheet metal]]) between the rotor coils and teeth of iron between the stator coils in addition to black iron behind the stator coils. The gap between rotor and stator is also made as small as possible. All this is done to minimize magnetic reluctance of the [[magnetic circuit]] which the magnetic field created by the rotor coils travels through, something which is important for optimizing these machines.

Large brushed machines which are run with DC to the stator windings at synchronous speed are the most common generator in [[power plant]]s, because they also supply [[reactive power]] to the grid, because they can be started by the turbine and because the machine in this system can generate power at constant speed without a controller. This type of machine is often referred to in the literature as a synchronous machine.

This machine can also be run by connecting the stator coils to the grid, and supplying the rotor coils with AC from an inverter. The advantage is that it is possible to control rotating speed of the machine with a fractionally rated inverter. When run this way the machine is known as a [[Doubly fed electric machine#Double fed induction generator|brushed double feed "induction" machine]]. "Induction" is misleading because there is no useful current in the machine which is set up by induction.

===Induction machines===
[[Induction motor|''Induction machines'']] have short circuited rotor coils where a current is set up and maintained by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. This requires that the rotor rotates at other than synchronous speed, so that the rotor coils are subjected to a varying magnetic field created by the stator coils. An induction machine is an asynchronous machine.

Induction eliminates the need for brushes which is usually a weak part in an electric machine. It also allows designs which make it very easy to manufacture the rotor. A metal cylinder will work as rotor, but to improve efficiency a "squirrel cage" rotor or a rotor with closed windings is usually used. The speed of asynchronous induction machines will decrease with increased load because a larger speed difference between stator and rotor is necessary to set up sufficient rotor current and rotor magnetic field. Asynchronous induction machines can be made so they start and run without any means of control if connected to an AC grid, but the starting torque is low.

A special case would be an induction machine with superconductors in the rotor. The current in the superconductors will be set up by induction, but the rotor will run at synchronous speed because there will be no need for a speed difference between the magnetic field in stator and speed of rotor to maintain the rotor current.

Another special case would be the [[Doubly fed electric machine#Brushless doubly fed versions|brushless double fed induction machine]], which has a double set of coils in the stator. Since it has two moving magnetic fields in the stator, it gives no meaning to talk about synchronous or asynchronous speed.

==Reluctance machines==
[[Reluctance motor|''Reluctance machines'']] have no windings in rotor, only a ferromagnetic material shaped so that "electromagnets" in stator can "grab" the teeth in rotor and move it a little. The electromagnets are then turned off, while another set of electromagnets is turned on to move stator further. Another name is step motor, and it is suited for low speed and accurate position control. Reluctance machines can be supplied with PMs in stator to improve performance. The “electromagnet” is then “turned off” by sending a negative current in the coil. When the current is positive the magnet and the current cooperate to create a stronger magnetic field which will improve the reluctance machine’s maximum torque without increasing the currents maximum absolute value.

==Electrostatic machines==
In [[Electrostatic motor|''electrostatic machines'']], torque is created by attraction or repulsion of electric charge in rotor and stator.

[[Electrostatic generator]]s generate electricity by building up electric charge.  Early types were [[friction]] machines, later ones were influence machines that worked by [[electrostatic induction]].  The [[Van de Graaff generator]] is an electrostatic generator still used in research today.

==Homopolar machines==
[[Homopolar motor|''Homopolar machines'']] are true DC machines where current is supplied to a spinning wheel through brushes. The wheel is inserted in a magnetic field, and torque is created as the current travels from the edge to the centre of the wheel through the magnetic field.

==Electric machine systems==
For optimized or practical operation of electric machines, today's electric machine systems are complemented with electronic control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9824">An '''embedded pushdown automaton''' or '''EPDA''' is a [[computational model]] for parsing languages generated by [[tree-adjoining grammar]]s (TAGs). It is similar to the [[context-free grammar]]-parsing [[pushdown automaton]], except that instead of using a plain [[stack (data structure)|stack]] to store symbols, it has a stack of iterated stacks that store symbols, giving TAGs a generative capacity between context-free grammars and [[context-sensitive grammar]]s, or a subset of the [[mildly context-sensitive grammar]]s.
Embedded pushdown automata should not be confused with [[nested stack automata]]  which have more computational power.{{citation needed|reason=This claim is currently supported only by the order in which both notions appear in the 'Automata theory: formal languages and formal grammars' overview table below.|date=February 2014}}

==History and applications==
EPDAs were first described by K. Vijay-Shanker in his 1988 doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vijay-Shanker |first=K. |authorlink= |date=January 1988 |title= A Study of Tree-Adjoining Grammars |journal=Ph.D. Thesis |publisher= [[University of Pennsylvania]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8804974 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since been applied to more complete descriptions of classes of mildly context-sensitive grammars and have had important roles in refining the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. Various subgrammars, such as the [[linear indexed grammar]], can thus be defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weir |first=David J. |year=1994 |title=Linear Iterated Pushdowns|journal=Computational Intelligence|volume=10 |issue= 4|pages=431–439 |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/resources/papers/ci94.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-20|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8640.1994.tb00007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPDAs are also beginning to play an important role in natural language processing.

While natural languages have traditionally been analyzed using context-free grammars (see [[transformational-generative grammar]] and [[computational linguistics]]), this model does not work well for languages with crossed dependencies, such as Dutch, situations for which an EPDA is well suited. A detailed linguistic analysis is available in Joshi, Schabes (1997).&lt;ref name="Joshi.Schabes.1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=Aravind K. |authorlink= |author2=Yves Schabes |year=1997 |title= Tree-Adjoining Grammars |journal=Handbook of Formal Languages |publisher=Springer |volume=3 |issue= |pages=69–124 |url= http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~joshi/joshi-schabes-tag-97.pdf |accessdate= 2014-02-07 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
An EPDA is a finite state machine with a set of stacks that can be themselves accessed through the ''embedded stack''. Each stack contains elements of the ''stack alphabet'' &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and so we define an element of a stack by &lt;math&gt;\,\sigma_i \in \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, where the star is the [[Kleene closure]] of the alphabet.

Each stack can then be defined in terms of its elements, so we denote the &lt;math&gt;\,j&lt;/math&gt;th stack in the automaton using a double-dagger symbol: &lt;math&gt;\,\Upsilon_j = \ddagger\sigma_j = \{\sigma_{j,k}, \sigma_{j,k-1}, \ldots, \sigma_{j,1} \}&lt;/math&gt;,{{clarify|reason=Usually, curly braces build a set (where element ordering and repetition is ignored, e.g. {a,c,a,b} denotes the same set as {a,b,c}), while in a stack, ordering and repetition does matter. Probably, the notation used here is wrong, or at least misleading.|date=February 2014}} where &lt;math&gt;\,\sigma_{j, k}&lt;/math&gt; would be the next accessible symbol in the stack. The ''embedded stack'' of &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; stacks can thus be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\,\{\Upsilon_j \} = \{\ddagger\sigma_m,\ddagger\sigma_{m-1}, \ldots, \ddagger\sigma_1 \} \in (\ddagger\Gamma^+)^*&lt;/math&gt;.{{clarify|reason=In the sentence before, (upsilon sub j) was explained to equal (ddagger (sigma sub j)), hence {upsilon sub j} would equal {ddagger (sigma sub j)}; however, now it is claimed to equal {ddagger (sigma sub m),...,ddagger (sigma sub 1)} instead. Moreover, in the rightmost term, it should be explained whether (((ddagger Gamma) sup +) sup *) or ((ddagger (Gamma sup +)) sup *) is meant, and what ddagger applied to the stack alphabet Gamma,or to (Gamma sup +), is supposed to mean. Finally, is should be explicitly mentioned that +, as I guessed, denotes the Kleene plus.|date=February 2014}}

We define an EPDA by the septuple (7-tuple)

:&lt;math&gt;\,M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, Q_\textrm{F}, \sigma_0)&lt;/math&gt; where

* &lt;math&gt;\,Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''states'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the finite set of the ''input alphabet'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the finite ''stack alphabet'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,q_0 \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the ''start state'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,Q_\textrm{F} \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''final states'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\sigma_0 \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial stack symbol''
* &lt;math&gt;\,\delta : Q \times \Sigma \times \Gamma \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is the ''transition function'', where &lt;math&gt;\,S&lt;/math&gt; are finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\,Q\times (\ddagger\Gamma^+)^* \times \Gamma^* \times (\ddagger\Gamma^+)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the transition function takes a state, the next symbol of the input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to be pushed and popped onto the ''embedded stack'', the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the ''embedded stack'' is pushed and popped, the current stack is optionally pushed back onto the ''embedded stack'', and any other stacks one would like are pushed on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can be pushed both above and below the current stack.

A given configuration is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\,C(M) = \{q,\Upsilon_m \ldots \Upsilon_1, x_1, x_2\} \in Q\times (\ddagger\Gamma^+)^* \times \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,q&lt;/math&gt; is the current state, the &lt;math&gt;\,\Upsilon&lt;/math&gt;s are the stacks in the ''embedded stack'', with &lt;math&gt;\,\Upsilon_m&lt;/math&gt; the current stack, and for an input string &lt;math&gt;\,x=x_1 x_2 \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,x_1&lt;/math&gt; is the portion of the string already processed by the machine and &lt;math&gt;\,x_2&lt;/math&gt; is the portion to be processed, with its head being the current symbol read. Note that the empty string &lt;math&gt;\,\epsilon \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is implicitly defined as a terminating symbol, where if the machine is at a final state when the empty string is read, the entire input string is ''accepted'', and if not it is ''rejected''. Such ''accepted'' strings are elements of the language

:&lt;math&gt;\,L(M) = \left\{ x | \{q_0,\Upsilon_0,\epsilon,x\} \rightarrow_M^* \{q_\textrm{F},\Upsilon_m \ldots \Upsilon_1, x, \epsilon\} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,q_\textrm{F} \in Q_\textrm{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,\rightarrow_M^*&lt;/math&gt; defines the transition function applied over as many times as necessary to parse the string.

An informal description of EPDA can also be found in Joshi, Schabes (1997),&lt;ref name="Joshi.Schabes.1997"/&gt; Sect.7, p.&amp;nbsp;23-25.

Weir's Control Language Hierarchy is a containment {{clarify span|hierarchy of countable set of language classes|date=August 2014}} where the ''Level-1'' is defined as context-free, and ''Level-2'' is the class of tree-adjoining and the other three grammars.

Following are some of the properties of Level-''k'' languages in the hierarchy:
*Level-''k'' languages are properly contained in the Level-(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) language class
*Level-''k'' languages can be parsed in &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3\cdot2^{k-1}})&lt;/math&gt; time
*Level-''k'' contains the language &lt;math&gt;\{a_1^n \dotso a_{2^k}^n|n\geq0\}&lt;/math&gt;, but not &lt;math&gt;\{a_1^n \dotso a_{2^{k+1}}^n|n\geq0\}&lt;/math&gt;
*Level-''k'' contains the language &lt;math&gt;\{w^{2^{k-1}}|w\in\{a,b\}^*\}&lt;/math&gt;, but not &lt;math&gt;\{w^{2^{k-1}+1}|w\in\{a,b\}^*\}&lt;/math&gt;
Those properties correspond well (at least for small ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1) to the conditions of mildly context-sensitive languages imposed by Joshi, and as ''k'' gets bigger, the language class becomes, in a sense, less mildly context-sensitive.

In [[aviation]], '''endurance''' is the maximum length of time that an aircraft can spend in [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruising flight]].  Endurance is different from [[range (aeronautics)|range]], which is a measure of distance flown. For example, a typical [[sailplane]] exhibits high endurance characteristics but poor range characteristics.

Endurance can be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;E=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}dt=-\int_{W_1}^{W_2}\frac{dW}{F}=\int_{W_2}^{W_1}\frac{dW}{F}&lt;/math&gt;

where W stands for fuel weight, F for fuel flow, and t for time.

Endurance can factor into aviation design in a number of ways. Some aircraft, such as the [[P-3 Orion]] or [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane, require high endurance characteristics as part of their mission profile (often referred to as '''[[Loiter (aeronautics)|loiter]] time (on target)'''). Endurance plays a prime factor in finding out the [[fuel fraction]] for an aircraft.
Endurance, like range, is also related to fuel efficiency; fuel-efficient aircraft will tend to exhibit good endurance characteristics.

Its scope covers scientific research and teaching [[epigraphy]]. It tryes to become more interested on the youngest and the general public.

It has been developed with funding from the Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad) and [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epigraphia3d.es/ |title=Epigraphia 3D - Inicio |website=Epigraphia3d.es |date= |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2013, [[Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología]] (FECYT) funded the project "Descifrando inscripciones romanas en 3D: Ciencia epigráfica virtual" (''Decrypting Roman inscriptions in 3D: virtual epigraphic Science''). This project was proposed as a multidisciplinary work where participate historians, linguists and engineers. Its objective was to provide "the first collection of Roman inscriptions in 3D, worldwide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epigraphia.hypotheses.org/421 |title=Epigraphia 3D: proyecto de innovación científica en epigrafía &amp;#124; E-pigraphia |website=Epigraphia.hypotheses.org |date=1 December 2014|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the epigraphy more interesting to the youngest and facilitating its study.

The first phase comprised the collection 37 inscriptions from [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|Museo Arqueológico Nacional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigüedades Griegas y Romanas.|url=http://www.man.es/man/museo/el-museo-por-dentro/departamentos-investigacion/clasicas.html|website=Museo Arqueológico Nacional|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Natio''nal'' Archaeological Museum of Spain''), of different types (funerary, votive ...) and support (stone, metal, clay ...). It was made a bibliography card for each inscription, with its main data. In 2014 the project was funded again from the FECYT to model a selection of 59 inscriptions from the collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Romano de Mérida]] (National Museum of Roman Art in Mérida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La ULPGC obtiene un nuevo proyecto de innovación científica concedido por la FECYT para digitalizar inscripciones del Museo de Arte Romano de Mérida|url=https://www.ulpgc.es/noticia/ulpgc-obtiene-nuevo-proyecto-innovacion-cientifica-concedido-fecyt-digitalizar-inscripciones|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=ULPGC - Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|date=27 February 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This second phase of the project continues to be developed. Still it is not possible to visualise any of the inscriptions in the official website. However, it can be visualized  the inscriptions that already have been  modelling in the profile of [[Sketchfab]] of Epigraphia 3D.

==Project results==
[[File:Captura_Sketcfab_Epigraphia_3d.png|alt= Captura del perfil de Sketchfab de Epigraphia 3D|thumb|316x316px|Captura del perfil de Sketchfab de Epigraphia 3D]]
At the beginning of 2016, Epigraphia accumulated 97 3D models on Sketchfab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/epigraphia3d/ |title=epigraphia3d on |website=Sketchfab.com |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate = 10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of the publics and with its respective bibliography card.

The project has a website with information about the own project, galleries with the 3D models and a section with "Resources" created by the researchers with the objective of to introduce the Latin epigraphy to the general public. This divulgative section has:
* '''Introduction''': what is epigraphy, its history, specialized resources (journals and databases), about the epigraphic supports and how to study and edit an inscription.
* '''Language and Literature: '''an introduction to [[Latin]], their cases and declensions, transcription of names, verb forms and structure for each type of inscriptions.
* '''Latin script''': on the Latin alphabet and types of writing ([[Roman square capitals]] and [[Roman cursive|cursive]]).
* '''Roman family''': introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of the [[Roman family]], marriage and a series of activities.
* '''Roman religion''': introduction to [[Roman temple]], its gods, priests, rites and imperial cult started in the time of [[Augustus]].
* '''Funerary world''': about death and life in the Roman afterlife, and their rites and funerary inscriptions.
Besides, it has an interactive map in which they have marked the origin of each one of the 37 pertaining registrations to the collection.

The emergence of [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|religious behavior]] by the [[Neolithic religion|Neolithic period]] has been discussed in terms of [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolutionary psychology]], the [[origin of language]] and [[mythology]], cross-cultural comparison of the [[anthropology of religion]], as well as evidence for spirituality or cultic behavior in the [[Paleolithic religion|Upper Paleolithic]], and similarities in [[Chimpanzee spirituality|great ape behavior]].

==Nonhuman religious behaviour==
Humanity's closest living relatives are [[common chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/bonobos-join-chimps-closest-human-relatives/|title= Bonobos Join Chimps as Closest Human Relatives|first=Ann |last= Gibbons|date= Jun 13, 2012|access-date= July 19, 2018|language= en|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180620222146/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/bonobos-join-chimps-closest-human-relatives/|archive-date= June 20, 2018|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 8802414|pmc = 2756412|author1=Ajit Varki|author2= Daniel H.

It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while non-human primates are not religious, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for [[symbolic communication]], a sense of social norms, realization of "[[self]]" and a concept of continuity.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, Barbara (2007).

Gavira, and Peter Frances. [[Prehistoric Life (book)|Prehistoric Life: the Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth]]. New York, N.Y.: DK Pub., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other evidences have revealed that ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]'' have made cave art, which would be a way of symbolic thinking close to the religious one &lt;ref&gt;D.

== Relevant prerequisites for human religion ==

===Increased brain size===
In this set of theories, the religious mind is one consequence of a brain that is large enough to formulate religious and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Religious ideas can theoretically be traced to the evolution of brains large enough to make possible the kind of abstract thought necessary to formulate religious and philosophical ideas|authorlink=Paul R. Ehrlich|last=Ehrlich|first=Paul|title=Human Natures: Genes, Cultures, and the Human Prospect |isbn=978-1-55963-779-4|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mHFsScY8ewMC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2000|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[human evolution]], the hominid brain tripled in size, peaking 500,000 years ago. Much of the brain's expansion took place in the [[neocortex]]. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neuronal computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/1/11|title=How unique is the human neocortex?|first1=Zoltán|last1=Molnár|first2=Alex|last2=Pollen|date=1 January 2014|journal=Development|volume=141|issue=1|pages=11–16|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=dev.biologists.org|doi=10.1242/dev.101279|pmid=24346696}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dunbar's number|Dunbar's theory]], the relative [[Neocortex#Neocortex ratio|neocortex size]] of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Processing power limits social group size: computational evidence for the cognitive costs of sociality|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20131151|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2013-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 3712454|pmid = 23804623|page = 20131151|volume = 280|issue = 1765|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2013.1151|first = T.|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = R. I. M.|last2 = Dunbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bondedness and sociality|journal = Behaviour|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 1568-539X|pages = 775–803|volume = 147|issue = 7|doi = 10.1163/000579510X501151|first = Robin I. M.|last = Dunbar|first2 = Susanne|last2 = Shultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chimpanzees the neocortex occupies 50% of the brain, whereas in modern humans it occupies 80% of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88783/9-brainy-facts-about-neocortex|title=9 Brainy Facts About the Neocortex|author=|date=17 November 2016|website=mentalfloss.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robin Dunbar]] argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the [[speciation]] of [[Archaic humans|archaic homo sapiens]] about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion. The study is based on a [[regression analysis]] of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |title=THE SOCIAL BRAIN: Mind, Language, and Society in Evolutionary Perspective |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |year=2003 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ADunbar+intitle%3ATHE+SOCIAL+BRAIN%3A+Mind%2C+Language%2C+and+Society+in+Evolutionary+Perspective&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2003&amp;as_yhi=2003&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214723/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that religion may have grown out of evolutionary changes which favored larger brains as a means of cementing group coherence among savannah hunters, after that larger brain enabled reflection on the inevitability of personal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Jay Gould|author2=Paul McGarr|author3=Steven Peter Russell Rose|title=The richness of life: the essential Stephen Jay Gould|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC|year=2007|publisher=W.

===Tool use===
[[Lewis Wolpert]] argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief. The manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object which does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact. Furthermore, one must understand how the tool would be used, that requires an understanding of [[causality]].&lt;ref name="wolpert"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0|quote=with regard to hafted tools, One would have to understand that the two pieces serve different purposes, and imagine how the tool could be used,| author=Lewis Wolpert| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs.&lt;ref name="wolpert2"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0| quote= Belief in cause and effect has had the most enormous effect on human evolution, both physical and cultural. Tool use, with language, has transformed human evolution and let to what we now think of as belief|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HP35qPdfioAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpert contends use of tools composed of more than one component, such as hand axes, represents an ability to understand cause and effect. However, recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait. For example, chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches, which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality.  Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/can-an-ape-learn-to-be-human-2332047.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Steve | last=Connor | title=Can an ape learn to be human? | date=August 5, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree. The degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex: the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3190564 | pmid=22013351 | doi=10.4103/0973-1229.33001 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Neurobiology of spirituality | year=2008 | journal=Mens Sana Monogr | pages=63–80 | last1 = Mohandas | first1 = E}} {{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of language===
{{See also|Origin of language|Myth and religion}}
Religion requires a system of symbolic communication, such as language, to be transmitted from one individual to another. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive-linguistic base".&lt;ref name="lieberman"/&gt; From this premise science writer [[Nicholas Wade]] states: 
:"Like most behaviors that are found in societies throughout the world, religion must have been present in the ancestral human population before the dispersal from Africa 50,000 years ago. Although religious rituals usually involve dance and music, they are also very verbal, since the sacred truths have to be stated. If so, religion, at least in its modern form, cannot pre-date the emergence of language. It has been argued earlier that language attained its modern state shortly before the exodus from Africa. If religion had to await the evolution of modern, articulate language, then it too would have emerged shortly before 50,000 years ago."&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;*"[[Nicholas Wade|Wade, Nicholas]] – ''Before The Dawn, Discovering the lost history of our ancestors''.  Penguin Books, London, 2006.  p. 8 p. 165" {{ISBN|1-59420-079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief. While the former does not require prior development of language, the latter does. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief. A socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed by social sanction.

===Morality and group living===
{{Main|Evolution of morality|Morality#Evolution}}
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality. Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many [[social animal]]s, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments. According to [[Michael Shermer]], the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:
{{quote|attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness. In a 2008 study, de Waal and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys side by side and gave them a simple task to complete: Giving a rock to the experimenter. They were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task, and the monkeys obliged. But if one of the monkeys was given grapes, something interesting happened:
After receiving the first piece of cucumber, the capuchin monkey gave the experimenter a rock as expected. But upon seeing that the other monkey got grapes, the capuchin monkey threw away the next piece of cucumber that was given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/health/chimpanzee-fairness-morality/index.html|title=Morality: It's not just for humans - CNN|first=By Elizabeth Landau,|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Chimpanzees live in [[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic [[hominid]]s lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. Humans also apply a degree of judgment and reason not otherwise seen in the animal kingdom.

Psychologist Matt J. Rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include [[supernatural]] agents. By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/science/20moral.html Nicholas Wade.

Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological, not ethical, in nature.

==Evolutionary psychology of religion==
{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that expressed in early [[Homo#list of species|''Homo'' genus]], through the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]]. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to [[natural selection]] and has selective advantage, or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf Evolutionary Religious Studies (ERS): A Beginner's Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204211/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, believed that religion was an [[exaptation]] or a [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.&lt;ref name="henig"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html|title=Darwin's God|date=4 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf Toward an evolutionary psychology of religion and personality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm|title=The evolutionary psychology of religion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063432/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |author=[[Steven Pinker]]|date=29 October 2004|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion.|year= 2004|journal= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.687.8586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of collective religious belief identified the agents as deities that standardized the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically "hardwired" into the human condition. One controversial proposal, the [[God gene]] hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]] gene, predispose to spirituality.&lt;ref name="kluger2004"&gt;{{cite news

Another view is based on the concept of the [[triune brain]]: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by [[Paul D. MacLean]]. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio-biological conditioning and social sanction. Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex.

Yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in religion.  Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire | title = God's Brain | publisher = Prometheus Books | date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-61614-164-6}} see pages 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of [[War#Motivations|hierarchies]] of [[Killer ape theory|warriors]], which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote [[fertility]] and [[family|kinship]].

Still another view, proposed by F.H. Previc, is that human religion was a product of an increase in dopaminergic functions in the human brain and a general intellectual expansion beginning around 80 kya.&lt;ref&gt;Previc, F.H. (2009).

==Prehistoric evidence of religion==
{{See also|Paleolithic religion|Prehistoric religion}}

The exact time when humans first became [[religion|religious]] remains unknown, however research in evolutionary archaeology shows credible evidence of religious-cum-ritualistic behaviour from around the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (45-200 [[tya (unit)|thousand years ago]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/784|title=On the Origin of Religion|first=Elizabeth|last=Culotta|date=6 November 2009|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5954|pages=784–787|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.326_784|pmid=19892955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleolithic burials===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Skhul burial.jpg|thumb|right|400px|90,000 year old double burial of Homo sapiens at [[Qafzeh]] cave in Israel]] --&gt;
The earliest evidence of religious thought is based on the ritual treatment of the dead. Most animals display only a casual interest in the dead of their own species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8209 Elephants may pay homage to the dead]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual burial thus represents a significant change in human behavior. Ritual burials represent an awareness of life and death and a possible belief in the [[afterlife]]. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "burials with grave goods clearly signify religious practices and concern for the dead that transcends daily life."&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title=Uniquely Human|isbn=978-0-674-92183-2| year=1991|last=Lieberman| authorlink=Philip Lieberman |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for treatment of the dead comes from [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] in Spain. At this location the bones of 30 individuals believed to be ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' have been found in a pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Q3nOqkJQwoC&amp;pg=PA158 |title=How Symbols, Language, and Intelligence Evolved from Early Primates to Modern Human|authorlink=Stanley Greenspan|last=Greenspan|first=Stanley|isbn=978-0-306-81449-5|year=2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Neanderthals]] are also contenders for the first [[Hominidae|hominids]] to intentionally bury the dead. They may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The presence of these [[grave goods]] may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife. Neanderthal burial sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq and [[Krapina]] in Croatia and [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|title= The Neanderthal dead:exploring mortuary variability in Middle Palaeolithic Eurasia|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|archivedate= 2008-09-10|df= }}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|author=|date=|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC article on the Neanderthals|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21606040|quote=Neanderthals buried their dead, and one burial at [[Shanidar]] in Iraq was accompanied by grave goods in the form of plants. All of the plants are used in recent times for medicinal purposes, and it seems likely that the Neanderthals also used them in this way and buried them with their dead for the same reason. Grave goods are an archaeological marker of belief in an afterlife, so Neanderthals may well have had some form of religious belief.}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in Israel located at [[Qafzeh]]. Human remains have been dated to 100,000 years ago. Human skeletons were found stained with [[red ochre]]. A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons.&lt;ref name="lieberman2"&gt;. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA163 Uniquely Human page 163]&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Lieberman states:
:"Burial rituals incorporating grave goods may have been invented by the anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East roughly 100,000 years ago".&lt;ref name="lieberman2"/&gt;

Matt Rossano suggests that the period between 80,000–60,000 years before present, following the retreat of humans from the Levant to Africa, was a crucial period in the evolution of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Springer%20chapter.pdf|title=The African Interregnum: The "Where," "When," and "Why" of the Evolution of Religion|year=2009|last=Rossano|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00128-4_9|first1=Matt|pages=127–141|series=The Frontiers Collection|isbn=978-3-642-00127-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of symbolism===
The use of [[Religious symbolism|symbolism in religion]] is a universal established phenomenon. Archeologist [[Steven Mithen]] contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art. When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRyMgrYx3EUC&amp;pg=PA147 Symbolism and the Supernatural]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Uniqueness and Symbolization|url=http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|quote=This 'coding of the non-visible' through abstract, symbolic thought, enabled also our early human ancestors to argue and hold beliefs in abstract terms. In fact, the concept of God itself follows from the ability to abstract and conceive of 'person'|access-date=2008-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527011227/http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|archive-date=2009-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as [[red ochre]]. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes. Among extant hunter gatherer populations around the world, red ochre is still used extensively for ritual purposes. It has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood, sex, life and death.&lt;ref name="rossano"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of red ochre as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] and [[Steven Mithen]], only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas. Upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic. Cave paintings at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] depict creatures that are half human and half animal.

Organised religion traces its roots to the [[neolithic revolution]] that began 11,000 years ago in the [[Near East]] but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world. The invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to a [[sedentism|sedentary lifestyle]]. The consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. The transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment. While bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs, these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority, justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals.
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability through the following ways:
*Justifying the central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services.
*Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However, states and nations are composed of many thousands of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' he argues that the leading cause of death among hunter-gatherer societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;

The states born out of the Neolithic revolution, such as those of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, were [[theocracies]] with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and spiritual leaders.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt; Anthropologists have found that virtually all state societies and chiefdoms from around the world have been found to justify political power through divine authority. This suggests that political authority co-opts collective religious belief to bolster itself.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt;

===Invention of writing===
{{See also|History of writing}}
Following the neolithic revolution, the pace of technological development (cultural evolution) intensified due to the invention of writing 5000 years ago. Symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible. Printing invented only over a thousand years ago increased the speed of communication exponentially and became the main spring of cultural evolution.
Writing is thought to have been first invented in either Sumeria or Ancient Egypt and was initially used for accounting. Soon after, writing was used to record myth. The first religious texts mark the beginning of [[History of religion|religious history]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are one of the oldest known religious texts in the world, dating to between 2400–2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 | title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|first= Wallis|last= Budge|authorlink = E.

In pre-literate societies, religious ideas were based on an [[oral tradition]], the contents of which were articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society's inhabitants. With the advent of writing, information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group (clergy). Humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten. Writing therefore enabled religions to develop coherent and comprehensive doctrinal systems that remained independent of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnnnAwMfeV0C&amp;pg=PA160#PPA160,M1|chapter=Holy Book:The Invention of writing and religious cognition|title=Magic, Miracles, and Religion: A Scientist's Perspective | first=Ilkka|last=Pyysiäinen|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7591-0663-5|publisher=AltMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing also brought a measure of objectivity to human knowledge. Formulation of thoughts in words and the requirement for validation made mutual exchange of ideas and the sifting of generally acceptable from not acceptable ideas possible. The generally acceptable ideas became objective knowledge reflecting the continuously evolving framework of human awareness of reality that [[Karl Popper]] calls 'verisimilitude' – a stage on the human journey to truth.&lt;ref&gt;''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972, Rev. ed., 1979, {{ISBN|0-19-875024-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Film à clef'' is the film equivalent of the literary ''[[roman à clef]]'', and the two share the same techniques.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

Many ''films à clef'' are [[biopic]]s of Hollywood personalities.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

'''Historically significant lunar eclipses''' are [[Lunar eclipse|eclipses of the Moon]] that are mentioned in historical accounts in connection with a significant event. Lunar eclipses are somewhat rare events, although not as rare as solar eclipses, because unlike solar eclipses they can be viewed from anywhere on the dark side of the Earth. Throughout history lunar eclipses have been held to be responsible for lost battles, and have helped make possible extraordinary escapes.

==29 January 1137 BC==
{{See|List of 12th-century BCE lunar eclipses}}
The first mention of a lunar eclipse was found in the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] book Zhou-Shu, a book of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. The book was discovered in 280 AD, in a [[tomb]] of a king or noblemen. The eclipse mentioned in this book took place many centuries before that time. Professor S.M. Russell believes that the eclipse described in the book may refer to the event that happened on 29 January 1137 BC (-1136).&lt;ref name="The Observatory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE-1199--1100.html|title=Catalog of Lunar Eclipses:  -1199 to  -1100|website=Eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==9 October 425 BC==
{{See|List of 5th-century BCE lunar eclipses}}
When eclipses were not well understood, they were sometimes associated with unnatural forces. [[Witch]]es from the Greek region of [[Thessaly]] claimed the ability to extinguish the moon's light and draw it down from the sky. In his famous comedy ''[[The Clouds]]'' (419 BC), [[Aristophanes]] describes the eclipse that took place two years prior to that.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;
{{cquote|the moon deserted her course and the sun at once veiled his beam threatening, no longer to give you light, if Cleon became general...&lt;ref name="The clouds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE-0499--0400.html|title=Catalog of Lunar Eclipses:  -0499 to  -0400|website=Eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==28 August 413 BC==
{{See|List of 5th-century BCE lunar eclipses}}
This eclipse happened during [[Sicilian Expedition#Second Battle of Syracuse|Second Battle of Syracuse]]. Just as the Athenians were preparing to sail home, there was a [[lunar eclipse]], and [[Nicias]], described by [[Thucydides]] as a particularly superstitious man, asked the priests what he should do. The priests suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed. The Syracusans took advantage of this, and 76 of their ships attacked 86 Athenian ships in the harbor. The Athenians were defeated and [[Eurymedon (strategos)|Eurymedon]] was killed. Many of the ships were pushed up on to the shore, where [[Gylippus]] was waiting. He killed some of the crews and captured 18 beached ships, but a force of Athenians and Etruscans forced Gylippus back.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt; [[Plutarch]] described this eclipse and the superstitious response:

{{cquote|And when all were in readiness, and none of the enemy had observed them, not expecting such a thing, the moon was eclipsed in the night, to the great fright of Nicias and others, who, for want of experience, or out of superstition, felt alarm at such appearances.&lt;ref name="Plutarch"/&gt;}}

==22 May 1453==
{{See|List of 15th-century lunar eclipses}}
{{Main|May 1453 lunar eclipse}}
This partial lunar eclipse was seen during the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (the capture of the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]]), during the siege that lasted from Thursday, 5 April 1453 until Tuesday, 29 May 1453), after which the city fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The lunar eclipse was considered to be fulfilling a prophecy for the city's demise. It is said a blood moon took place during the eclipse.

==1 March 1504==
{{See|List of 16th-century lunar eclipses}}
{{Main|March 1504 lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Columbus using a lunar eclipse to impress the [[Indigenous people]] of Jamaica.&lt;BR&gt;From ''Astronomie Populaire'' 1879, p 231 fig. 86]]
On 30 June 1503, [[Christopher Columbus]] beached his two last [[caravel]]s and was stranded in [[Jamaica]]. The [[indigenous people]] of the island welcomed Columbus and his crew and fed them, but Columbus' sailors cheated and stole from the natives. After six months, the natives halted the food supply.&lt;ref name="Columbus" /&gt;

Columbus had on board an [[almanac]] authored by [[Regiomontanus]] of [[astronomical]] tables covering the years 1475–1506; upon consulting the book, he noticed the date and the time of an upcoming lunar eclipse. He was able to use this information to his advantage. He requested a meeting for that day with the [[Cacique]], the leader, and told him that his [[god]] was angry with the local people's treatment of Columbus and his men. Columbus said his god would provide a clear sign of his displeasure by making the rising full Moon appear "inflamed with wrath".

The lunar eclipse and the red moon appeared on schedule, and the indigenous people were impressed and frightened. The son of Columbus, Ferdinand, wrote that the people:

{{cquote|with great howling and lamentation came running from every direction to the ships laden with provisions, praying to the Admiral to intercede with his god on their behalf...}}

Columbus timed the eclipse with his [[hourglass]], and shortly before the totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened indigenous people that they were going to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="Columbus"/&gt; When the moon started to reappear from the shadow of the Earth, he told them that his god had pardoned them.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

=== Fictionalized variations===
In 1885 [[H. Rider Haggard]] used an altered version of the real story of the rescue of Columbus in his novel, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''. In that novel, [[Allan Quatermain]] and his fellow Englishmen use their foreknowledge of a solar eclipse to claim that they will black out the sun as proof of their powers, and save captive girls from an unjust death sentence.

In 1889 [[Mark Twain]] used a similar plot device in his novel, ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''. In that novel, Hank Morgan, a 19th-century resident of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], after a blow to the head, awakens to find himself inexplicably transported back in time to [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval England]] at the time of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. When Morgan is about to be burned at the stake, he pretends to conjure a [[solar eclipse]] that he knew was about to happen; this prediction saves Morgan's life.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

Another novel that used a solar-eclipse scene modeled after Columbus' lunar eclipse was [[Bolesław Prus]]' historical novel, ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and the Solar Eclipse", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1997, no. 4, pp. 471-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar plot also features in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]''.

==15 July 1916==
{{See|List of 20th-century lunar eclipses}}
{{Main article|July 1916 lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Lunar eclipse path July 15 1916 1.jpg|The path of the [[July 1916 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse on 15 July 1916]]|thumb|200px]]
The [[Ross Sea party]] was a component of [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from [[Cape Evans]]. There was [[sea ice]] between them and the relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, [[Aeneas Mackintosh]] and [[Victor Hayward]], decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a [[blizzard]] hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried to look for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during [[polar night]] the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely dim light of the stars.

The weather did not cooperate during the full moon of June, but on 15 July, everything seemed to be just right: calm weather, thick ice, clear skies and a full Moon. The men started their journey in the morning. When the Moon rose, however, the men were surprised to find it was about to be eclipsed. [[Ernest Wild]] wrote later: {{quote|text="I thought we were going to be left in darkness but a very little bit of the rim remained to light us..."}} 
Although the eclipse continued for few hours, the men were fortunate because it was only a partial eclipse. They reached Cape Evans later on the same day.&lt;ref name="Polar castaways"/&gt;

'''Human furniture''' is [[furniture]] in which a person's body is used as a tray, foot stool, chair, table, cabinet or other item. '''Forniphilia''' is the practice of creating human furniture. Examples of human furniture have appeared in [[modern art]] and in [[pornography]].

==Art==
A model used as human furniture may be nude or semi-nude to add to the [[Eroticism|erotic]] or aesthetic appeal. [[Allen Jones (artist)|Allen Jones']] sculptures [[Hatstand, Table and Chair|''Hatstand'', ''Table'' and ''Chair'']], made in 1969, which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, is a classic example of the depiction of forniphilia as art.&lt;ref name="turned down stanley"&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin Gayford |title =Allen Jones: The day I turned down Stanley Kubrick |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |place=London |date=8 October 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3668398/Allen-Jones-The-day-I-turned-down-Stanley-Kubrick.html |accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bondage==
The term ''forniphilia'' was coined by [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] artist [[Jeff Gord]]&lt;ref name="Jeff Gord Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialkink.com/articles.php?do=view&amp;id=92 |title=Jeff Gord Interview |publisher= |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422130006/http://socialkink.com/articles.php?do=view&amp;id=92 |archivedate=22 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hames&gt;[[Ashley Hames]], ''Sin Cities'', Tonto Books, 2008, {{ISBN|0-9556326-0-9}}, pp. 184–188&lt;/ref&gt; who specialized in the subgenre and maintained the website "House of Gord" on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Literary / Liberal Entanglements: Toward a Literary History for the Twenty-First Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4E0DwAAQBAJ|first1=Corrinne|last1=Harol|first2=Mark|last2=Simpson|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2017|isbn=9781442630901|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forniphilia as a form of bondage usually involves the subject being tightly bound and expected to stay immobile for a prolonged period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-toi/The-kinks-of-virtual-men/articleshow/1911674.cms | title=The kinks of virtual men | date=15 April 2007 | journal=[[The Times of India]] | accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often gagged (see [[forniphilic gag]]) and/or placed in position where there is a danger of being [[smother]]ed. In many of Jeff Gord's human furniture creations, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]] were also used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.houseofgord.com/b/orgasm/penetration/fucking-machines/ Fucking Machines]&lt;/ref&gt; Proper safety requires frequent checks of the submissive's well-being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7614">"Ischemic cell death", or "Oncosis", is a form of accidental cell death. The process is characterized by an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] depletion within the cell leading to impairment of ionic pumps, cell swelling, clearing of the cytosol, dilation of the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], mitochondrial condensation, chromatin clumping, and cytoplasmic bleb formation.&lt;ref&gt;Weerasinghe, Priya, and L. Maximilian Buja. "Oncosis: an important non-apoptotic mode of cell death." Experimental and molecular pathology 93.3 (2012): 302-308.&lt;/ref&gt; Oncosis refers to a series of cellular reactions following injury that precedes cell death. The process of oncosis is divided into three stages. First, the cell becomes committed to oncosis as a result of damage incurred to the plasma membrane through toxicity or ischemia, resulting in the leak of ions and water due to ATP depletion.&lt;ref&gt;Weerasinghe, Priya, and L. Maximilian Buja. "Oncosis: an important non-apoptotic mode of cell death." Experimental and molecular pathology 93.3 (2012): 302-308.&lt;/ref&gt; The ionic imbalance that occurs subsequently causes the cell to swell without a concurrent change in membrane permeability to reverse the swelling.&lt;ref&gt;Weerasinghe, Priya, and L. Maximilian Buja. "Oncosis: an important non-apoptotic mode of cell death." Experimental and molecular pathology 93.3 (2012): 302-308.&lt;/ref&gt; Stage two the reversibility threshold for the cell is passed and it becomes committed to cell death. During this stage the membrane becomes abnormally permeable to trypan blue and propidium iodide, indicating membrane compromise.&lt;ref&gt;Weerasinghe, Priya, and L. Maximilian Buja. "Oncosis: an important non-apoptotic mode of cell death." Experimental and molecular pathology 93.3 (2012): 302-308.&lt;/ref&gt; The final stage is cell death and removal of the cell via phagocytosis mediated by an inflammatory response.&lt;ref&gt;Scarabelli, T. M., Knight, R., Stephanou, A., Townsend, P., Chen-Scarabelli, C., Lawrence, K., Gottlieb, R., Latchman, D., &amp; Narula, J. (2006). Clinical implications of apoptosis in ischemic myocardium. Current problems in cardiology, 31(3), 181-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Although ''ischemic cell death'' is the accepted name of the process, the alternative name of ''oncosis'' was introduced as the process involves the affected cell(s) swelling to an abnormally large size in known models. This is thought to be caused by failure of the [[Plasma membrane|plasma membrane's]] ionic pumps. The name ''oncosis'' (derived from ''ónkos'', meaning largeness, and ''ónkosis'', meaning swelling) was first introduced in 1910 by [[pathologist]] [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Majno|author2=Joris|title=Apoptosis, oncosis, and necrosis. An overview of cell death.|journal=Am. J. Pathol.|year=1995|volume=146|issue=1|pages=1–2;16–19|pmid=7856735|pmc=1870771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to Apoptosis==
Oncosis and apoptosis are distinct processes of cellular death. Oncosis is characterized by cellular swelling caused by a failure in [[ion pump]] function. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death involves a series of cell shrinking processes, beginning with cell size reduction and [[pyknosis]], followed by cell budding and [[karyorrhexis]], and [[phagocytosis]] by [[macrophages]] or neighboring cells due to size decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Majno, G., &amp; Joris, I. (1995). Apoptosis, oncosis, and necrosis. An overview of cell death. The American journal of pathology, 146(1), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The phagocytic disposal of apoptotic cells prevents the release of cellular debris that could induce an inflammatory response in neighboring cells.&lt;ref&gt;Ren, Y., &amp; Savill, J. (1998). Apoptosis: the importance of being eaten. Cell Death &amp; Differentiation, 5(7), 563-568.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, the leakage of cellular content associated with membrane disruption in oncosis often incites an inflammatory response in neighboring tissue, causing further cellular injury.&lt;ref&gt;Ren, Y., &amp; Savill, J. (1998). Apoptosis: the importance of being eaten. Cell Death &amp; Differentiation, 5(7), 563-568.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, apoptosis and the degradation of intracellular organelles is mediated by [[caspase]] activation, particularly [[caspase-3]].&lt;ref&gt;Earnshaw, W. C., Martins, L. M., &amp; Kaufmann, S. H. (1999). Mammalian caspases: structure, activation, substrates, and functions during apoptosis. Annual review of biochemistry, 68(1), 383-424.&lt;/ref&gt; Oligonuclosomal DNA fragmentation is initiated by caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease following caspase-3 mediated cleavage of the enzyme’s inhibitor, ICAD.&lt;ref&gt;Enari, M., Sakahira, H., Yokoyama, H., Okawa, K., Iwamatsu, A., &amp; Nagata, S. (1998). A caspase-activated DNase that degrades DNA during apoptosis, and its inhibitor ICAD. Nature, 391(6662), 43-50.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the oncotic pathway has been shown to be caspase-3 independent.&lt;ref&gt;Weerasinghe, Priya, and L. Maximilian Buja. "Oncosis: an important non-apoptotic mode of cell death." Experimental and molecular pathology 93.3 (2012): 302-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary determinant of cell death occurring via the oncotic or apoptotic pathway is cellular ATP levels.&lt;ref&gt;Eguchi Y, Shimizu S and Tsujimoto Y (1997) Intracellular ATP levels determine cell death fate by apoptosis or necrosis. Cancer Res. in press&lt;/ref&gt; Apoptosis is contingent upon ATP levels to form the energy dependent [[apoptosome]].&lt;ref&gt;Eguchi Y, Shimizu S and Tsujimoto Y (1997) Intracellular ATP levels determine cell death fate by apoptosis or necrosis. Cancer Res. in press&lt;/ref&gt; A distinct biochemical event only seen in oncosis is the rapid depletion of intracellular ATP.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, N., Smith, M. W., Maki, A., Berezesky, I. K., &amp; Trump, B. F. (1994). Role of cytosolic Ca2+ and protein kinases in the induction of the hsp70 gene. Kidney International, 45(4), 1093-1104.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of intracellular ATP results in a deactivation of sodium and potassium [[ATPase]] within the compromised cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, N., Smith, M. W., Maki, A., Berezesky, I. K., &amp; Trump, B. F. (1994). Role of cytosolic Ca2+ and protein kinases in the induction of the hsp70 gene. Kidney International, 45(4), 1093-1104.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of ion transport at the cell membrane leads to an accumulation of sodium and chloride ions within the cell with a concurrent water influx, contributing to the hallmark cellular swelling of oncosis.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, N., Smith, M. W., Maki, A., Berezesky, I. K., &amp; Trump, B. F. (1994). Role of cytosolic Ca2+ and protein kinases in the induction of the hsp70 gene. Kidney International, 45(4), 1093-1104.&lt;/ref&gt; As with apoptosis, oncosis has been shown to be genetically programmed and dependent on expression levels of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) in [[HeLa cells]]. An increase in UCP-2 levels leads to a rapid decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing mitochondrial [[NADH]] and intracellular ATP levels, initiating the oncotic pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, E. M., Xu, D., Fergusson, M. M., Combs, C. A., Xu, Y., &amp; Finkel, T. (2002). Regulation of cellular oncosis by uncoupling protein 2. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277(30), 27385-27392.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-apoptotic gene product Bcl-2 is not an active inhibitor of UCP-2 initiated cell death, further distinguishing oncosis and apoptosis as distinct cellular death mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, E. M., Xu, D., Fergusson, M. M., Combs, C. A., Xu, Y., &amp; Finkel, T. (2002). Regulation of cellular oncosis by uncoupling protein 2.

'''Jigar Shah''' (born August 30, 1974) is a clean energy entrepreneur in creating market-driven solutions and eliminating market barriers to address [[climate change]].  Shah has recognized this as "Creating Climate Wealth."

Shah maintains that Climate Wealth is created when mainstream investors team up with entrepreneurs, corporations, mainstream capital, and governments at scale to solve the big problems of our time while generating compelling financial returns – not concessionary returns.&lt;ref name="Jigar Shah"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/user/jigar-shah|title=Fast Company: Jigar Shah|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current business initiatives==
Shah is the co-founder and President of Generate Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://gigaom.com/2014/12/04/these-investors-are-using-the-solar-as-a-service-model-for-resources/  |title=Meet Generate Capital, a new way to fund energy projects |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah was the founder and CEO of SunEdison (NASDAQ: SUNE), where he pioneered “no money down solar” and unlocked a multi-billion-dollar solar market, creating the largest solar services company worldwide. Shah is author of ''Creating Climate Wealth: Unlocking the Impact Economy, 2013 Icosa Publishing''.  The book talks about the prominent role of business model innovation, more than new technology, in attracting mainstream capital and unlocking transformational change. In the book, the author pictures reaching our 2020 climate change goals as means to create the next economy with the equivalent of 100,000 companies worldwide, each generating $100 million in sales. Shah argues that, while new technical innovation is valuable, deployment of existing technologies are the key to reaching our near-term climate targets.

Shah serves as a board member of the ''Carbon War Room'', a global organization he previously served as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solarplaza.com/article/solar-guru-jigar-shah-on-his-new-book-creating-cli|title= Solar Guru Jigar Shah on his new book: 'Creating Climate Wealth'|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah has also become an outspoken advocate to end all energy subsidies, including those for renewable energy, to "create a level playing field." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/republican-congressman-to-oil-and-gas-industry-no-more-subsidies|title=Jigar Shah argues for an end to fossil fuel subsidies -- and a phase-out of clean energy subsidies'|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Jigar served as a mentor for Unreasonable at Sea, a technology business accelerator for social entrepreneurs seeking to scale their ventures in international markets. Founded by Unreasonable Group, [[Semester at Sea]], and  [[Stanford]]'s [[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semesteratsea.org/discover-sas/signature-programs/past-programs/unreasonable-at-sea/&lt;/ref&gt; Shah writes for Unreasonable Group's venture UNREASONABLE.is, a hub for [[social entrepreneurs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unreasonable.is/?s=jigar+shah&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Energy Gang==
Shah is currently co-host of The Energy Gang,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greentechmedia.com/podcast/the-energy-gang&lt;/ref&gt; a podcast dedicated to exploring the technological, political and market forces driving energy and environmental issues.  On a recent episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://soundcloud.com/the-energy-gang/week-7-trump-dumps-the-climate|title=Week 7: Trump Dumps the Environment|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah introduced the Jigar Shah Rule - "Countries should not have stupid policy".  As noted by co-host Stephen Lacy, the new ruling is pulled directly from the Jigar Shah Playbook, which suggests you must have competitive options such as volumetric reductions and feed-in tariffs, and the way these were designed seven to eight years ago do not work.

==Past business initiatives==
From 2009 to March 2012, Shah served as the first CEO of the [[Carbon War Room]], the global organization founded by Richard Branson and Virgin United that works to harness the power of entrepreneurship to deploy solution technologies at scale.

Prior to his tenure as Carbon War Room CEO, Shah founded [[SunEdison]] in 2003. The company simplified solar as a service through the implementation of the [[power purchase agreement]] (PPA) business model. That model changed the status quo, allowing organizations to purchase solar energy services under long-term predictably priced contracts and avoid the significant capital costs of ownership and operation of solar energy systems. The SunEdison business model is a recognized{{Vague|date=January 2014}} catalyst that helped turn solar PV into a multi-billion{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} dollar industry worldwide.

Shah previously worked in strategy for [[BP Solar]] and as a contractor for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] on alternative vehicles and fuel cell programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jigar-shah/|title = Jigar Shah Bio |accessdate= 22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born in India, Shah moved to the United States with his family when he was one year old.

In the visual arts, '''late modernism''' encompasses the overall production of most recent art made between the aftermath of World War II and the early years of the 21st century. The terminology often points to similarities between late modernism and post-modernism although there are differences. The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is [[contemporary art]]. Not all art labelled as contemporary art is modernist or post-modern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modern and late modernist traditions, as well as artists who reject modernism for post-modernism or other reasons. [[Arthur Danto]] argues explicitly in ''After the End of Art'' that contemporaneity was the broader term, and that postmodern objects represent a subsector of the contemporary movement which replaced modernity and modernism, while other notable critics: [[Hilton Kramer]],&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp. 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Kirk Varnedoe]],&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe - Passages'', critical essay, [[Artforum]], Nov. 2003 by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others have argued that postmodern objects are at best relative to modernist works.

The jargon which encompasses the two terms ''late modernism'' and ''[[postmodern art]]'' is used to denote what may be considered as the ultimate phase of [[modern art]], as art at the end of [[modernism]] or as certain tendencies of [[contemporary art]].

There are those who argue against a division into modern and [[postmodern]] periods. Not all critics agree that the stage called modernism is over or even near the end. There is no agreement that all art after modernism is post-modern. [[Contemporary art]] is the more-widely used term to denote work since roughly 1960, though it has many other uses as well. Nor is post-modern art universally separated from modernism, with many critics seeing it as merely another phase in [[modern art]] or as another form of late [[modernism]].

As with all uses of the term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt; This is not to say that the phase of art denoted by post-modernism is accepted, merely that the need for a term to describe movements in art after the peak of [[abstract expressionism]] is well established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.

In literature, the term '''late modernism''' refers to works of literature produced after World War II. However, several different definitions of late modernist literature exist. The most common refers to works published between 1930 and 1939, or 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory" ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pages 840–855, November 2011;  J. H. Dettmar "Modernism". David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are modernists, such as [[Basil Bunting]] (1900–85) and [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888-1965), writing later than 1945, and [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot published two plays in the 1950s and Bunting's long modernist poem "[[Briggflatts]]" was published in 1965. The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910-1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (1936- ) are, amongst other writing in the second half of the 20th century, who have been described as late modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt; There is the further question as to whether late modernist literature differs in any important way from the modernist works produced before 1930. To confuse matters, more recently the term late modernism has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially the [[Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from postmodernism==
Late modernism describes movements which both arise from, and react against, trends in [[modernism]] and reject some aspect of modernism, while fully developing the conceptual potentiality of the modernist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171&lt;/ref&gt; In some descriptions post-modernism as a period in art is completed, whereas in others it is a continuing movement in [[contemporary art]]. In art, the specific traits of modernism which are cited are generally formal purity, [[medium specificity]], [[art for art's sake]], the possibility of [[authenticity in art]], the importance or even possibility of universal truth in art, and the importance of an avant-garde and originality. This last point is one of particular controversy in art, where many institutions argue that being visionary, forward looking, cutting edge and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and that postmodern therefore, represents a contradiction of the value of "art of our times".

One compact definition offered is that while post-modernism acts in rejection of modernism's grand narratives of artistic direction, and to eradicate the boundaries between high and low forms of art, to disrupt genre and its conventions with collision, collage and fragmentation. Post-modern art is seen as believing that all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore irony, parody and humor are the only positions which cannot be overturned by critique or later events.

Many of these traits are present in modern movements in art, particularly the rejection of the separation between high and low forms of art. However, these traits are considered fundamental to post-modern art, as opposed to merely present in one degree or another. One of the most important points of difference, however, between post-modernism, and modernism, as movements in art, is modernism's ultimately progressive stance that new works be more "forward looking" and advanced, whereas post-modern movements generally reject the notion that there can be advancement or progress in art per se, and thus one of the projects of art must be the overturning of the "myth of the [[avant-garde]]". This relates to the negation of what post-structuralist philosophers call "[[metanarratives]]".

[[Rosalind Krauss]] was one of the important annunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over, and that the new artistic era existed in a post-liberal and post-progress normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171, Part II, ''Toward Post-Modernism'', pp. 196-291.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this viewpoint is explained by [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] in ''The Shock of the New''&lt;ref&gt;''The Shock of the New'' [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], Publisher: Knopf; Revised edition (August 13, 1991),&lt;/ref&gt; in his chapter "The Future That Was":

{{Quote|
Where did this new academy begin? At its origins the ''avant-garde'' myth had held the artist to be a precursor; the significant work is the one that prepares the future. The cult of the precursor ended by cluttering the landscape with absurd prophetic claims. The idea of a cultural ''avant-garde'' was unimaginable before 1800. It was fostered by the rise of [[liberalism]]. Where the taste of religious or secular courts determined patronage, "subversive" innovation was not esteemed as a sign of artistic quality. Nor was the artist's autonomy, that would come with the [[Romanticism|Romantics]].

As with all uses of the term postmodern there are critics of its application. [[Kirk Varnedoe]], for instance, stated that there is no such thing as postmodernism, and that the possibilities of modernism have not yet been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, p. 4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics are currently in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt;

[[Hilton Kramer]] describes postmodernism as "a creation of modernism at the end of its tether".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oliver Bennett, ''Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p. 131. {{ISBN|0-7486-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in [[Frederic Jameson]]'s analysis, does not hold that there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of [[high modernism]]; instead, postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism, giving birth to new modernisms.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Jameson, ''Foreword'' to Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pxvi. {{ISBN|0-7190-1450-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical movements in modern art ==

Radical movements in Modernism, Modern art, and radical trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to late modernism and postmodernism emerged around World War I and particularly in its aftermath. With the introduction of the use of industrial artifacts in art, movements such as [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] as well as techniques such as [[collage]] and artforms such as cinema and the rise of [[reproduction]] as a means of creating artworks. Both [[Pablo Picasso]] the [[Modernist]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] the rebel created important and influential works from [[found objects]].

===Fauvism, cubism, dada, surrealism as the precedent===
{{main|Fauvism|Cubism|Dada|Surrealism}}

[[File:Matissedance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[The Dance (second version)]]'', 1909 [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]]]
In the early 20th century, following [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]'s impact as Fauvist painters and [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]'s monumental innovations and the worldwide success of [[Cubism]] and the emboldening of the [[avant-garde]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art, because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]." The ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'',  was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, that shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as [[Dada]].

Dadaism can be viewed as part of the modernist propensity to challenge established styles and forms, along with [[Surrealism]], [[futurism]] and [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a chronological point of view Dada is located solidly within modernism, however a number of critics have held that it anticipates postmodernism, while others, such as [[Ihab Hassan]] and [[Steven Connor]], consider it a possible changeover point between modernism and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Pegrum, ''Challenging Modernity: Dada Between Modern and Postmodern'', Berghahn Books, 2000, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|1-57181-130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fauvism]] and [[Henri Matisse]] in particular became an important influence on both [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field painting]], important milestones of Late Modernism. ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' is commonly recognized as "a key point of Matisse's career and in the development of modern painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; With its large expanse of blue, simplicity of design and emphasis on pure feeling the painting was enormously influential to American artists who viewed it at [[MoMA]] in New York City.

===High art and culture===

The ignition point for the definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as [[kitsch]] by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably [[Clement Greenberg]] with his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'', first published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html Avant-Garde and Kitsch]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg proved to be an articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for High art and culture. In 1961 ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by [[Clement Greenberg]] was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] [[art critic]] and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of [[Modern art]] history, and the history of [[modernism]] and Late Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Pollock: abstract expressionism===
{{main|Jackson Pollock|Abstract expressionism|Process art|Western painting}}

During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art gets made at the mid-century point. Pollock's move — away from easel painting and conventionality — was a liberating signal to his contemporaneous artists and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing, essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. [[Abstract expressionism]] in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them.

===Neo-Dada, collage and assemblage===

{{main|Collage|Assemblage art|Installation art}}

Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combined manufactured items — with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and [[commercial photography]].

[[Leo Steinberg]] uses the term postmodernism in 1969 to describe Rauschenberg's "flatbed" picture plane, containing a range of cultural images and artifacts that had not been compatible with the pictorial field of premodernist and modernist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp in Hal Foster (ed), ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 44. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] goes further, identifying the significance of Rauschenberg's work not as a representation of, in Steinberg's view, "the shift from nature to culture", but as a demonstration of the impossibility of accepting their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamp]], between modernism and postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s and 1970s===

[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|[[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], ''CUBI VI'', 1963]]
In abstract painting and sculpture during the 1950s and 1960s [[Geometric abstraction]] emerged as an important direction in the works of many sculptors and painters. In painting [[color field painting]], [[minimalism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. The New Informalists, Art News, v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; constituted radical new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira - Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp.40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Rose, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/american-painting-the-twentieth-century/oclc/416195315&amp;referer=brief_results American painting, the twentieth century](New York : Skira/Rizzoli, 1986.) {{ISBN|2-605-00308-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Sir Anthony Caro]], [[Mark di Suvero]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Isaac Witkin]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Kenneth Snelson]], [[Al Held]], [[Ronald Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;
Michael Fried. "Ronald Davis: Surface and Illusion." Artforum, vol. 5, no. 8. April, 1967. pp. 37-41, Cover Illus.: Six-Ninths Blue, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Peter Reginato]], were some of the artists whose works characterized abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyrical abstraction]] shares similarities with [[color field]] painting and [[abstract expressionism]] especially in the freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field]] painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in [[action painting]] there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Richard Saba]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;"Shade acrylic canvases in which geometric shapes are juxtaposed". [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery. The New Yorker. Oct. 3, 1977 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; and dozens of others continued to produce vital and influential paintings.

===Minimalism and post-minimalism===

{{main|Minimalism|Postminimalism}}
[[File:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Tuttle]], ''Red Canvas'', 1967]]
By the early 1960s [[minimalism]] emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]). Important artists who emerged as pioneers of [[minimalism]] include [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ronald Bladen]] among others. These artists also frequently employed [[shaped canvas]]es, as in the example by [[Richard Tuttle]] shown at right. [[Minimal art]] rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. [[Minimalism]] argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting and sculpture, as opposed to other areas, is a late modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the post modern movement.

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'', examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name=Foster36/&gt;

In the late 1960s the term [[Post-minimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, ''[[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalind Krauss]] argues that by 1968 artists such as Morris, LeWitt, Smithson and Serra had "entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist."&lt;ref name=Krauss287&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' pp.287&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the category of sculpture to include [[land art]] and [[architecture]], "brought about the shift into postmodernism."&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' (1979). pp.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late [[modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

===Process art===
{{Main|Process art}}

By the late 1960s however, [[process art]] emerged as a revolutionary concept and movement that encompassed painting and sculpture, via [[lyrical abstraction]] and the [[postminimalist]] movement, and in early [[Conceptual Art]]. [[Eva Hesse]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Hannah Wilke]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], and [[Alan Saret]], were some of the process artists that emerged during the 1960s. Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, scale, size, and plastic and real space.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop art===
{{main|Pop art|Western painting}}
The term "pop art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era.&lt;ref&gt;''Topics in American Art since 1945'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], 1975 by W.W. Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement rejected [[abstract expressionism]] and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement. While later American examples include the bulk of the careers of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and his use of [[Benday dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a clear connection between the radical works of [[Duchamp]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ist — with a sense of humor; and [[pop art]]ists like [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

In general pop art and [[minimalism]] began as modernist movements, a shift in the paradigm and a philosophical split between [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and anti-formalism in the early 1970s caused those movements to be viewed by some as precursors, or transitioning to postmodern art. Other modern movements cited as influential to postmodern art are [[Conceptual art]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] and the use of techniques such as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[collage]], [[bricolage]] and art forms which used recording or reproduction as the basis for artworks.
 
There are differing opinions as to whether pop art is a late modernist movement or is [[Postmodern]]. Thomas McEvilly, agreeing with [[Dave Hickey]], says that postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of pop art in 1962, "though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts."&lt;ref name=McEvilly29&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p. 29. {{ISBN|90-5701-311-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Jameson]], too, considers pop art to be postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Jameson in Hal Foster, ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 111. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way that Pop art is postmodern is that it breaks down what [[Andreas Huyssen]] calls the "Great Divide" between high art and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism emerges from a "generational refusal of the categorical certainties of high modernism."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sim, ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'', Routledge, 2001. p. 148. {{ISBN|0-415-24307-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although to presuppose that [[modernism]] stands for "high art" only, and is in any way certain as to what constitutes "high" art is to profoundly and basically misunderstand modernism.

===Performance art and happenings===

{{main|Performance art|List of performance artists|Happenings}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]] performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of [[contemporary art]]. [[Yves Klein]] in France, and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The [[Living Theater]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]] located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], [[New York City]], and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The works were characterized by the reductive philosophies of [[minimalism]], and the spontaneous improvisation, and expressivity of [[abstract expressionism]].

During the same period — the late 1950s through the mid-1960s various [[avant-garde]] artists created [[Happenings]]. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in varied specified locations. Often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physical exercise, costumes, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random and seemingly disconnected acts. [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]] among others were notable creators of Happenings.

===Fluxus===

{{main|Fluxus}}
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as, "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement – as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against, "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 196. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and low===

[[File:OtternessSculpture.JPG|thumb|Tom Otterness sculpture in Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, [[Battery Park City]], New York City]]
As a kind of response to [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 [[Kirk Varnedoe]] and [[Adam Gopnik]] curated ''High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture'', at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The exhibition attempted to elucidate the extent that artists and high culture drew on and from popular culture. Although universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Kirk Varnedoe, 1946&amp;ndash;2003'' - Front Page - Obituary - [[Art in America]],  Oct, 2003 by Marcia E. Vetrocq&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is remembered today as a benchmark of the conflict between late modernism and postmodernism.

==Movements associated with Postmodern art==

===Conceptual art===
{{main|Conceptual art}}

[[Conceptual art]] became an important development in contemporary art in the late 1960s, it delivered an influential critique on the status quo. Late modernism expanded and contracted during the late 1960s and for some, conceptual art made a complete break with modernism. Sometimes it is labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in [[deconstruction]] of what makes a work of art, "art". Conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, offend or attack notions held by many of the people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Thus, because ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was exhibited, it was a sculpture. [[Marcel Duchamp]] famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Duchamp]]&lt;/ref&gt; Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross that features a chess game, where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between [[John Cage]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Tudor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s 4' 33" which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]''.  Many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself.

=== Installation art ===

{{main|Installation art}}
An important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved [[installation art]] and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature.  One example being the signs of [[Jenny Holtzer]] which use the devices of art to convey specific messages, such as "Protect Me From What I Want".  Installation Art has been important in determining the spaces selected for museums of contemporary art in order to be able to hold the large works which are composed of vast collages of manufactured and found objects. These installations and collages are often electrified, with moving parts and lights.

They are often designed to create environmental effects, as [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' which was a row of barrels intended to create a [[traffic jam]].

=== Intermedia and multi-media ===

{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]], a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[Concrete Poetry]], [[Found objects]], [[Performance art]], and [[Computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a [[Concrete poet]], married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes, "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms", in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0-631-23213-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[Video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with [[performance art]], where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

=== Appropriation art and neo-conceptual art ===

{{main|Appropriation art|neo-conceptual art}}
In his 1980 essay ''The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism'', [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] identifies the re-emergence of an [[allegorical]] impulse as characteristic of postmodern art. This impulse can be seen in the [[appropriation art]] of artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Robert Longo]] because, "Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation art debunks modernist notions of artistic genius and originality and is more ambivalent and contradictory than modern art, simultaneously installing and subverting ideologies, "being both critical and complicit."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997. p. 186. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neo-expressionism ===
{{main|Neo-expressionism}}

The return to the traditional art forms of sculpture and painting in the late 1970s and early 1980s seen in the work of [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] artists such as [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]] has been described as a postmodern tendency,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Woods, ''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press, 1999. p. 125. {{ISBN|0-7190-5211-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first coherent movements to emerge in the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, p. 842. {{ISBN|0-495-00480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong links with the commercial art market has raised questions, however, both about its status as a postmodern movement and the definition of postmodernism itself. Hal Foster states that neo-expressionism was complicit with the conservative cultural politics of the Reagan-Bush era in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Foster36&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, p. 36. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]] disregards the "large promotional operations dubbed 'neo-expressionism' in Germany", (an example of a "fad that maintains itself by means of publicity") as a too easy way for him "to demonstrate that postmodernism is nothing but the last gasp of modernism." These critiques of neo-expressionism reveal that money and public relations really sustained contemporary art world credibility in America during the same period that conceptual and feminist art practices were systematically reevaluating modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 210. {{ISBN|0-19-284239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutional Critique ===
{{main|Institutional Critique}}

Critiques on the institutions of art (principally museums and galleries) are made in the work of [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]] and [[Hans Haacke]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the beginning of the 21st century contemporary painting, contemporary sculpture and contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting, sculpture and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit. Frank Stella's ''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality and an excellent example of Late Modernism.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[hyperrealism]], [[photorealism]], [[expressionism]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[pop art]], [[op art]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[monochrome painting]], [[neo-expressionism]], [[collage]], [[intermedia]] painting, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] painting, [[digital painting]], [[postmodern]] painting, [[Neo-Dada]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], traditional [[figure painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century. The New European Painting of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, with painters like [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Luc Tuymans]], has opened a complex and interesting dialogue with the legacy of American color field and lyrical abstraction on the one hand and figurality on the other hand.

'''Legalswipe''' is a free [[mobile app|app]] that offers general [[legal advice]] and protection to people randomly stopped and questioned by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/06/29/new-smartphone-app-offers_n_7690380.html |publisher=[[Huffington Post Canada]] |title= Legalswipe, New App, Offers Legal Advice For Random Cop Encounters |date= June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christien Levien, a [[Law of Canada|Canadian lawyer]], conceived Legalswipe to educate civilians about their [[Natural and legal rights|legal rights]] during their interaction with police. The idea of the app was born from Levien's encounter with police and his difficulty in navigating the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ontariotoday/2015/08/25/is-carding-inherently-racist |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |title= Is carding inherently racist? |date= August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/smartphone-app-offers-legal-advice-for-police-encounters-1.2446034 |publisher=CTV News |title= Smartphone app offers legal advice for police encounters |date= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawtimesnews.com/201602155222/focus-on/focus-apps-can-unchain-lawyers-from-desk-developer |publisher=Law Times News |title= Focus: Apps can unchain lawyers from desk: developer |date= February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/news/alumnus-christien-levien-14-creates-legal-advice-app-legalswipe |publisher= University of Ottava |title= Alumnus Christien Levien (’14) Creates Legal Advice App, Legalswipe |date= July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lint Center for National Security Studies''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] created to provide [[Student financial aid (United States)|merit-based scholarships]] for [[counterintelligence]] and [[national security]] workers and scholars, and to advance the study of national security. The center is [[veteran]] and [[Ethnic minority|minority]] operated and managed, using an all-volunteer force to promote awareness of their scholarship opportunities through online media projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intpolicydigest.org/2014/05/20/lint-center-launches-new-awareness-web-video/|title=Lint Center Launches New Awareness Web Video|last=Coleman|first=Timothy|website=International Policy Digest|access-date=2016-03-15}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lint Center utilizes three programs of [[mentorship]], publishing, and scholarship, and aims to fill a niche void in counterintelligence by recognizing new potential and providing practitioner guidance to those aspiring to advance national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lintcenter.org/about-us/|title=About Us|website=The Lint Center for National Security Studies|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lint Center was founded in 2007 by retired [[Special agent|Special Agent]] James Lint to develop emerging leaders in national security and [[intelligence assessment]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/blog/2014/09/11/911-made-counterterrorism-%25E2%2580%2598-more-pressing-priority%25E2%2580%2599-nation-and-these-volunteers|title=9/11 Made Counterterrorism ‘a More Pressing Priority’ for the Nation and for These Volunteers|date=11 September 2014|website=Points of Light|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lint Center's primary focus is to provide support for the next generation of America’s national security workforce by helping to achieve educational goals. Its mission statement is to provide a support system for those who serve freedom around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mclwestchester.org/news/viewarticle.asp?fn=Lint-Center-Announces-2012-Scholarship-Competition|title=Lint Center Announces 2012 Scholarship Competition|date=5 July 2012|website=MCLWestchester.org|publisher=Marine Corps League Westchester County Detachment|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center involves a scholarship and mentorship program, with more than 200 volunteer professionals mentoring students pursuing careers in national [[intelligence service]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As an all-volunteer force, the center has no administrative costs or overhead and all funds from donations go directly to scholarships.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hstoday.us/channels/dodnational-defense/single-article-page/points-of-light-foundation-recognize-lint-center-for-national-security-studies.html|title=Homeland Security Today: Points of Light Foundation Recognize Lint Center for National Security Studies|last=Vicinanzo|first=Amanda|date=1 October 2014|website=HSToday.us|publisher=Homeland Security Today|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mentorship program ==
The Lint Center's mentoring team consists of active and retired national security practitioners from the military, defense, intelligence and academic communities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/business-2/lint-center-for-national-security-studies-lauded-on-911-by-bushs-points-of-light-foundation-25623/|title=Lint Center for National Security Studies Lauded on 9/11 by Bush’s Points of Light Foundation|last=Ruth|first=Lisa M.|website=Communities Digital News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These volunteers provide mentees with the opportunity to ask for advice, seek guidance on career paths and options, and gain a better understanding of the protocols within their field of interest. Anna Hyonjoo Lint, Ph.D., the center's Vice Chairwoman, explained that “The purpose of the Center is to empower, enhance, and enable the next generation of America’s counterintelligence and national security workforce through scholarship initiatives.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lint Center announces new national security scholarships|date=17 December 2012|website=Examiner.com|publisher=AXS Digital Group LLC|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mentoring program also serves to dispel myths about careers in intelligence and security, since the nature of intelligence work is secretive and known to the public primarily through movies and television.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/programs/recognition/dpol/awards/5303|title=Lint Center for National Security Studies|website=Points of Light|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship program ==
The Lint Center awards merit-based scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in programs focused on counterintelligence and national security studies as well as cultural understanding. Financial support for the scholarships include private and corporate sponsors, including global intelligence company [[Stratfor]], the [[OPSEC]] Professional Society, and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]] Association.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Applicants to the Lint Center scholarships must write an essay demonstrating "their ability to think outside the box when it comes to national security."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since 2007, the Lint Center has awarded 36 scholarships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recipients of the center's scholarships are connected with mentors within the students' field of interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2015, the Lint Center announced a partnership with a new corporate sponsor, [[Spies of Washington Tour]], which provides comprehensive tours featuring the [[history of espionage]] and intelligence operations in the United States. The sponsor donated tours to the winners of the 2015 Lint Center scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timothywcoleman.com/lint-center-announces-partnership-spies-washington-tour/|title=Lint Center Announces Partnership with Spies of Washington Tour|website=Timothy W.

A '''magnetogravity wave''' is a type of [[plasma wave]]. A magnetogravity wave is an [[sound|acoustic]] [[gravity wave]] which is associated with fluctuations in the background [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Y-Q. |last=Lou |year=1996 |title=Trapped Coronal Magnetogravity Modes |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=272 |issue= 5261|pages=521–523 |jstor=2890096|bibcode=1996Sci...272..521L |doi=10.1126/science.272.5261.521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[gravity wave]] refers to a classical fluid wave, and is completely unrelated to the relativistic [[gravitational wave]].

'''Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMarchive)''' is an online community archive founded in 2003 by Matthew Norman, Alison Surtees, [https://about.me/abigail_ward Abigail Ward], [[CP Lee]] and Dave Rofe. It was created as a way of celebrating and raising awareness of Greater Manchester's musical heritage and protecting collections of material held by individuals and institutions relating to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/about_us.php|title=Manchester District Music Archive: Mission Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 2015 it became a registered charity.

== Beginnings ==
The archive, originally named Manchester District Music Archive, came about in 2003 after Surtees and Norman had the idea of making a documentary about the Greater Manchester music scene, loosely based on [[CP Lee]]’s book ‘Shake, Rattle and Rain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unconvention: Alison Surtees | url= http://unconventionhub.org/alison-surtees | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the subject was too vast to be contained within a documentary, Surtees and Norman, alongside Dave Rofe and CP Lee, decided to launch a campaign to create a Greater Manchester music museum. Abigail Ward joined the team shortly afterwards and began to develop an online presence for the project. Lee's book covered the history of Manchester music from 1955 - 1995 and contained an extensive band list at the end of the book, which was used a starting point when populating the band list on the Manchester Digital Music Archive website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CerysmaticFactory: Shake Rattle and Rain: Popular Music Making in Manchester 1955 - 1995 by CP Lee | url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/shake_rattle_and_rain.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminar was held at [[Urbis]] in 2004 to officially launch the newly constituted organisation with a panel featuring [[Jon Savage]], [[CP Lee]], [[Guy Garvey]], [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] and Jan Hargreaves. Hundreds attended the event and it was announced that the intention was to set up a museum where people could donate items of music ephemera to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=21 September 2004 | title=CerysmaticFactory: Manchester District Music Archive Seminar | url= http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/mdma_seminar_210904.php | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founders then spent a number of years trying to create a physical space for the archive but after years of struggling to find something suitable, a website was set up in 2006, which allowed users to upload images of their own personal artefacts, along with associated memories, relating to Greater Manchester music, musicians, DJs and venues. This online archive was developed by Abigail Ward with web designer Ashley Kennerley (Go Bang! Design).

In 2007 and 2014, Manchester Digital Music Archive won the Big Chip best not-for-profit project award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MDMA {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/MDMA2007|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Best Not for Profit Project {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/BNFPP2014|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015 the site has in excess of 3000 members who have uploaded material relating to more than 3350 bands, 600 DJs and 1000 venues. Users are encouraged to provide memories and anecdotes along with their artefacts and the only stipulation is that items need to be linked to acts or venues from Greater Manchester. All genres of music are covered and as well as an extensive collection of pop memorabilia, the archive includes material relating to the history of the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and the [[The Hallé|Halle Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester District Music Archive Homepage | url= http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/ | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can comment on and discuss items uploaded by others or curate online themed exhibitions using material from the site. The site has a number of these exhibitions on various subjects including [[Moss Side]] and [[Hulme]] club culture, [[City Fun]] fanzine, Manchester's [[LGBT]] music and club culture and [[Royal Northern College of Music]] students who served in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Manchester District Music Archive: Exhibitions | url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/exhibitions.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable status ==
In November 2015, the organisation became a registered charity and in June 2017 changed its name to Manchester Digital Music Archive. The board of trustees are Dave Carter, CP Lee, Cathy Brooks, Aidan O'Rourke and Sarah Feinstein.

== Physical Presence ==
The archive exists online but has held numerous events and exhibitions at venues around Greater Manchester. In 2008 it held an event at [[Islington Mill]] which explored the city’s 1980s electro-funk scene, curated by DJ [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]]. The event included music and discussion and also showed the premiere of the Tim Forde documentary 'Birth of The British B-Boy', which tells the story of breakdancing in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electrofunkroots: Electrospective Press Release | url= http://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/electrospective-event-press-release | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following investment from [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/|title=Heritage Lottery Fund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDMarchive held an exhibition, ''Defining Me: Musical Adventures in Manchester'' ,at The Lowry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Lowry: What’s On – Defining Me: Musical Adventures In Manchester | url= http://www.thelowry.com/event/defining-me-musical-adventures-in-manchester | accessdate = 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 5-month show co-curated by members of MDMarchive's online community. The exhibition attracted a 32,000 visitors. There were a number of spin-off events featuring Greater Manchester music luminaries in conversation, including [[Barry Adamson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barry Adamson  - onstage interview &amp; audience Q&amp;A|url = http://www.manchesterhistoriesfestival.org.uk/whatson/barryadamson|website = Manchester Histories|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Cummins (photographer)|Kevin Cummins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seven of Kraak Gallery’s best events|url = http://www.timeout.com/manchester/blog/seven-of-kraak-gallerys-best-events-081715|website = Time Out Manchester|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Boon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ever fallen in love with Richard Boon?|url = http://www.northernsoul.me.uk/ever-fallen-in-love-with-richard-boon/|website = Northern Soul|access-date = 2016-01-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the project ended with a community concert at [[Band on the Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Musical Adventures in Manchester'- featuring The Prospectors with Graham Massey &lt; Events {{!}} Band on the Wall|url = http://bandonthewall.org/events/4292/|website = bandonthewall.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring British rave pioneer [[Graham Massey]] in collaboration with The Prospectors, a collective of disabled musicians from [[Stockport]].

The archive also has a regular presence in the ''Louder Than Words'' festival - an annual event focused on literature within the music industry. In 2014 MDMarchive hosted a panel discussion which saw Elbow's Guy Garvey, Jaheda Choudhury-Potter of Ajah UK and [[Everything Everything]]'s Jon Higgs talk about Greater Manchester lyricism in music .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EnglandEvents.co.uk: Manchester: Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly | url=http://englandevents.co.uk/manchester-hear-my-voice-in-your-head-and-think-of-me-kindly/35912 | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year it hosted another session, this time focusing on the work of virtual archives and included panellists from MDMarchive as well as writer [[Anita Sethi]] and Jez Collins from the Birmingham Music Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Louder Than Words: Festival Programme 2015 | url=http://louderthanwordsfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Louder-Than-Words-Events1.pdf | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Manchester Digital Music Archive won further investment from Heritage Lottery Fund for ''Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hlf.org.uk/our-projects/rebel-music-sound-politics-and-protest-manchester|title=Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester {{!}} Heritage Lottery Fund|website=www.hlf.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/news.php?id=209|title=MDMarchive wins Heritage Lottery support for Rebel Music project : MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|website=MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a project exploring the intertwined histories of music and political activism across the ten boroughs of the Greater Manchester. The project will focus in particular on the musical achievements of women and the LGBT+ community.

Throughout the project, MDMarchive will be working with teams of volunteers from the two chosen communities (women and LGBT+ people) to co-produce a programme of events, two physical pop-up exhibitions, a series of digital exhibitions, six short films and three guided heritage walks. The volunteers will also access training on how to preserve and share their own musical heritage.

The first physical exhibition, ''Queer Noise: The History of LGBT+ Music &amp; Club Culture in Manchester'', will be held at the [[People's History Museum|People’s History Museum]] from July–September 2017 as part of ''Never Going Underground 2017'', a major exhibition marking 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. The second exhibition, ''Woman: Breaking The Rules'' is slated for February 2018 and will coincide with 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage.

'''Mycorestoration''' is the use of [[fungi]] to restore degraded environments. It is a multi-method approach to restore damaged habitats such as [[oil spill]] sites and [[logging roads]], while also restoring the health of targeted forest sites that have been compromised in development. Mycorestoration is also used to control insect populations. It generally uses a four-tier approach of [[mycofiltration]], [[mycoforestry]], [[mycoremediation]], and [[mycopesticides]]. The mycelia of a number of different gilled fungi are used in some of these applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wildlandscpr.org/biblio-notes/evaluating-use-mycorestoration-decommissioned-roads-arizona | title=Evaluating the Use of Mycorestoration on Decommissioned Roads in Arizona | publisher=Wildlands CPR | date=December 11, 2005 | accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">'''New rhetorics''' is an [[interdisciplinary field]]&lt;ref name="Andreea"&gt;Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ''Rhetorics: New Rhetorics'', in Wolfgang Donsbach (ed.), ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaching for the broadening of [[classical rhetorics|classical rhetorical canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Per example in ''Defining the New Rhetoric'' and ''Professing the New Rhetoric''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"&gt;New and Alternative Rhetorics - William DeGenaro, ''Who says?: working-class rhetoric, class consciousness, and community'', Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The New Rhetoric is a result of various efforts of bringing back rhetorics from the marginal status&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; it attained by its image and 'negative connotations' of "political lies, corporate spin, long list of Greek and Roman terms for patterns of expression no one knowingly uses, purple prose, boiler-plate arrangement schemas, unimaginative reproductions of bullshit and so on"&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George Pullman, ''Rhetorically Speaking, What’s New?'', Georgia State University, What is the New Rhetoric? conference&lt;/ref&gt; if not to its previous place of a discipline "associated with social and intellectual prestige"&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; then at least to the level of the other contemporary fields in the social, cultural and linguistic studies. Notoriously the field emerged after the work of [[Chaïm Perelman]] and [[Lucille Olbrechts-Tyteca]] in their book ''The New Rhetoric'' (1969)&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas M. Carr, Jr. ''Some Consequences of The New Rhetoric: A Critical Study'', Argumentation 7: 475-479, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; but both the notion and the idea for the need of "new" rhetoric, different from the "old" one can be traced to the works of [[Kenneth Burke]] - ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' (1950) and ''Rhetoric - Old and New'' (1967),.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary M. White, [https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3113888/ Re-examining Kenneth Burke on "identification" in the "new" rhetoric],  dissertation @ Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;

What helped the emergence of New rhetoric was the ideas of the [[epistemic]] status of rhetoric, the notion of a clearly definable rhetorical core and other.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt;

New rhetorics attempts to preserve the original field but it also has tense relationship with it.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; For example, New Rhetoric attempts to break up with the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalistic]] and [[logocentric]] (i.e. [[patriarchal]]) [[Neo-Aristotelian]] analysis in favour of interplay between [[Text (literary theory)|text]] and [[Context (language use)|context]], but according to DeGenaro it does not succeed to place itself outside the "Western-patriarchal" with being unable to departure from "elite backgrounds and scopes of study"&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"/&gt; to a diversity of voices, topics, etc. This probably makes New Rhetoric rather a ground for the '''postmodern rhetoric'''&lt;ref&gt;Not the rhetoric of [[postmodernism]] but postmodern theory and analysis in rhetorics.&lt;/ref&gt; which "puts into question the identities of the speaker, the audience, and the messages that pass between them"&lt;ref name="Gary1"&gt;Gary E. Aylesworth, ''Rhetoric, Postmodern'' ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; with evaluating the [[intersubjective]] philosophy&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry Brummett, ''Some Implications of "Process" or "Intersubjectivity": Postmodern Rhetoric'', Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Penn State University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; because of the inherently accepted in the [[postmodern philosophy|postmodernistic philosophy]] idea that "differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by cancelling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or defaced in the course of traversing them."&lt;ref name="Gary2"&gt;Gary Aylesworth, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#8 Postmodernism]'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6395">The '''Ortega hypothesis''' holds that average or mediocre [[scientists]] contribute substantially to the advancement of [[science]].&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;

== Citation research ==
The Ortega hypothesis is widely held,&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; but a number of systematic studies of scientific [[citations]] have favored the opposing "Newton hypothesis", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after [[Isaac Newton]]'s statement that he "stood on the shoulders of giants").&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;  Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and criminology.&lt;ref name=Oromaner/&gt;

The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data.&lt;ref name=MacRoberts/&gt; Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics.&lt;ref name=Kretschmer/&gt; Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them.&lt;ref name=Hoerman/&gt; Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results.&lt;ref name=Goudsmit/&gt;&lt;ref name=eponym/&gt; Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results.&lt;ref name=Goudsmit/&gt;

== The name ==
The name of the hypothesis refers to [[José Ortega y Gasset]], who wrote in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' that "astoundingly mediocre" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science.&lt;ref name=Ortega/&gt; Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific [[geniuses]] create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that [[Albert Einstein]] drew upon the ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Ernst Mach]] to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone.&lt;ref name=Szava/&gt;

The "Ortega hypothesis" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as "mechanical work of the mind" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it.&lt;ref name=Szava/&gt;

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Formulations}}
The '''path integral formulation''' of [[quantum mechanics]] is a description of quantum theory that generalizes the [[action (physics)|action principle]] of [[classical mechanics]].  It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or [[functional integral]], over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a [[probability amplitude|quantum amplitude]].

This formulation has proven crucial to the subsequent development of [[theoretical physics]], because manifest [[Lorentz covariance]] (time and space components of quantities enter equations in the same way) is easier to achieve than in the operator formalism of [[canonical quantization]]. Unlike previous methods, the path integral allows a physicist to easily change [[coordinates]] between very different [[canonical coordinates|canonical]] descriptions of the same quantum system. Another advantage is that it is in practice easier to guess the correct form of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a theory, which naturally enters the path integrals (for interactions of a certain type, these are ''coordinate space'' or ''Feynman path integrals''), than the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. Possible downsides of the approach include that [[unitarity]] (this is related to conservation of probability; the probabilities of all physically possible outcomes must add up to one) of the [[S-matrix]] is obscure in the formulation. The path-integral approach has been proved to be equivalent to the other formalisms of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Thus, by ''deriving'' either approach from the other, problems associated with one or the other approach (as exemplified by Lorentz covariance or unitarity) go away.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|loc=Chapter 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The path integral also relates quantum and [[stochastic]] processes, and this provided the basis for the grand synthesis of the 1970s, which unified [[quantum field theory]] with the [[statistical mechanics|statistical field theory]] of a fluctuating field near a [[second-order phase transition]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] is a [[diffusion equation]] with an imaginary diffusion constant, and the path integral is an [[analytic continuation]] of a method for summing up all possible [[random walk]]s.

The basic idea of the path integral formulation can be traced back to [[Norbert Wiener]], who introduced the [[Wiener integral]] for solving problems in diffusion and [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Demichev|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was extended to the use of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] in quantum mechanics by [[P. A. M. Dirac]] in his 1933 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1933}}&lt;br&gt;PDF:[http://www.hep.anl.gov/czachos/soysoy/Dirac33.pdf The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Vleck|1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete method was developed in 1948 by [[Richard Feynman]]. Some preliminaries were worked out earlier in his doctoral work under the supervision of [[John Archibald Wheeler]]. The original motivation stemmed from the desire to obtain a quantum-mechanical formulation for the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] using a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] (rather than a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]) as a starting point.

[[File:Three paths from A to B.png|thumbnail|250px|These are just three of the paths that contribute to the quantum amplitude for a particle moving from point A at some time {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to point B at some other time {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]

== Quantum action principle ==

In quantum mechanics, as in classical mechanics, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is the generator of time translations. This means that the state at a slightly later time differs from the state at the current time by the result of acting with the Hamiltonian operator (multiplied by the negative [[imaginary unit]], {{math|−''i''}}). For states with a definite energy, this is a statement of the [[de Broglie relation]] between frequency and energy, and the general relation is consistent with that plus the [[superposition principle]].

The Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is derived from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], which is a more fundamental quantity relative to [[special relativity]]. The Hamiltonian indicates how to march forward in time, but the time is different in different [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. The Lagrangian is a [[Lorentz scalar]], while the Hamiltonian is the time component of a [[four-vector]]. So the Hamiltonian is different in different frames, and this type of symmetry is not apparent in the original formulation of quantum mechanics.

The Hamiltonian is a function of the position and momentum at one time, and it determines the position and momentum a little later. The Lagrangian is a function of the position now and the position a little later (or, equivalently for infinitesimal time separations, it is a function of the position and velocity). The relation between the two is by a [[Legendre transformation]], and the condition that determines the classical equations of motion (the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s) is that the [[action (physics)|action]] has an extremum.

In quantum mechanics, the Legendre transform is hard to interpret, because the motion is not over a definite trajectory. In classical mechanics, with [[discretization]] in time, the Legendre transform becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon H = p(t)\big(q(t + \varepsilon) - q(t)\big) - \varepsilon L&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\dot q&lt;/math&gt; holds {{math|''q''(''t'' + ''ε'')}} fixed. The inverse Legendre transform is

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon L = \varepsilon p \dot{q} - \varepsilon H,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \dot q = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p},&lt;/math&gt;

and the partial derivative now is with respect to {{mvar|p}} at fixed {{mvar|q}}.

In quantum mechanics, the state is a [[quantum superposition|superposition of different states]] with different values of {{mvar|q}}, or different values of {{mvar|p}}, and the quantities {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} can be interpreted as noncommuting operators. The operator {{mvar|p}} is only definite on states that are indefinite with respect to {{mvar|q}}. So consider two states separated in time and act with the operator corresponding to the Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i\big[p \big(q(t + \varepsilon) - q(t)\big) - \varepsilon H(p, q) \big]}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the multiplications implicit in this formula are reinterpreted as ''matrix'' multiplications, the first factor is

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-ip q(t)},&lt;/math&gt;

and if this is also interpreted as a matrix multiplication, the sum over all states integrates over all {{math|''q''(''t'')}}, and so it takes the [[Fourier transform]] in {{math|''q''(''t'')}} to change basis to {{math|''p''(''t'')}}. That is the action on the Hilbert space – '''change basis to {{mvar|p}} at time {{mvar|t}}'''.

Next comes

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-i\varepsilon H(p,q)},&lt;/math&gt;

or '''evolve an infinitesimal time into the future'''.

Finally, the last factor in this interpretation is

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i p q(t + \varepsilon)},&lt;/math&gt;

which means '''change basis back to {{mvar|q}} at a later time'''.

This is not very different from just ordinary time evolution: the {{mvar|H}} factor contains all the dynamical information – it pushes the state forward in time. The first part and the last part are just Fourier transforms to change to a pure {{mvar|q}} basis from an intermediate {{mvar|p}} basis.
{{quote box|align=right|width=42em|quote=...we see that the integrand in (11) must be of the form {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iF''/''h''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|F}} is a function of {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which remains finite as {{mvar|h}} tends to zero. Let us now picture one of the intermediate {{mvar|q}}s, say {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as varying continuously while the other ones are fixed. Owing to the smallness of {{mvar|h}}, we shall then in general have ''F''/''h'' varying extremely rapidly. This means that {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iF''/''h''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will vary periodically with a very high frequency about the value zero, as a result of which its integral will be practically zero. The only important part in the domain of integration of {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is thus that for which a comparatively large variation in {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} produces only a very small variation in {{mvar|F}}. This part is the neighbourhood of a point for which {{mvar|F}} is stationary with respect to small variations in {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We can apply this argument to each of the variables of integration ... and obtain the result that the only important part in the domain of integration is that for which {{mvar|F}} is stationary for small variations in all intermediate {{mvar|q}}s. ... We see that {{mvar|F}} has for its classical analogue {{math|{{intmath|int|''T''|''t''}} ''L dt''}}, which is just the action function, which classical mechanics requires to be stationary for small variations in all the intermediate {{mvar|q}}s. This shows the way in which equation (11) goes over into classical results when {{mvar|h}} becomes extremely small. |source=Dirac (1933), p. 69}}

Another way of saying this is that since the Hamiltonian is naturally a function of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}, exponentiating this quantity and changing basis from {{mvar|p}} to {{mvar|q}} at each step allows the matrix element of {{mvar|H}} to be expressed as a simple function along each path. This function is the quantum analog of the classical action. This observation is due to [[Paul Dirac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirac further noted that one could square the time-evolution operator in the {{mvar|S}} representation:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i\varepsilon S},&lt;/math&gt;

and this gives the time-evolution operator between time {{mvar|t}} and time {{math|''t'' + 2''ε''}}. While in the {{mvar|H}} representation the quantity that is being summed over the intermediate states is an obscure matrix element, in the {{mvar|S}} representation it is reinterpreted as a quantity associated to the path. In the limit that one takes a large power of this operator, one reconstructs the full quantum evolution between two states, the early one with a fixed value of {{math|''q''(0)}} and the later one with a fixed value of {{math|''q''(''t'')}}. The result is a sum over paths with a phase, which is the quantum action. Crucially, Dirac identified in this article the deep quantum-mechanical reason for the [[principle of least action]] controlling the classical limit (see quotation box).

== Feynman's interpretation ==

Dirac's work did not provide a precise prescription to calculate the sum over paths, and he did not show that one could recover the Schrödinger equation or the [[canonical commutation relation]]s from this rule. This was done by Feynman.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Both noted that in the limit of action that is large compared to the reduced [[Planck's constant]] {{mvar|ħ}} (using [[natural units]], {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}}), or the classical limit, the path integral is dominated by solutions which are in the neighborhood of [[stationary point]]s of the action.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the classical path arises naturally in the classical limit.

Feynman showed that Dirac's quantum action was, for most cases of interest, simply equal to the classical action, appropriately discretized. This means that the classical action is the phase acquired by quantum evolution between two fixed endpoints. He proposed to recover all of quantum mechanics from the following postulates:
# The [[probability]] for an event is given by the squared modulus of a complex number called the "probability amplitude".
# The [[probability amplitude]] is given by adding together the contributions of all paths in configuration space.
# The contribution of a path is proportional to {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iS''/''ħ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|S}} is the [[Action (physics)|action]] given by the [[time integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] along the path.

In order to find the overall probability amplitude for a given process, then, one adds up, or [[integral|integrates]], the amplitude of the 3rd postulate over the space of ''all'' possible paths of the system in between the initial and final states, including those that are absurd by classical standards. In calculating the probability amplitude for a single particle to go from one space-time coordinate to another, it is correct to include paths in which the particle describes elaborate [[curlicues]], curves in which the particle shoots off into outer space and flies back again, and so forth. The '''path integral''' assigns to all these amplitudes ''equal weight'' but varying [[phase (waves)|phase]], or argument of the [[complex number]]. Contributions from paths wildly different from the classical trajectory may be suppressed by [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] (see below).

Feynman showed that this formulation of quantum mechanics is equivalent to the [[Quantization (physics)|canonical approach to quantum mechanics]] when the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momentum.  An amplitude computed according to Feynman's principles will also obey the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] corresponding to the given action.

The path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the [[transition amplitude]] (corresponding to the classical [[correlation function]]) as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state. A [[Feynman diagram]] is a graphical representation of a [[perturbative]] contribution to the transition amplitude.

== Path integral in quantum mechanics ==

=== Time-slicing derivation ===
{{main|Relation between Schrödinger%27s equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics}}
One common approach to deriving the path integral formula is to divide the time interval into small pieces. Once this is done, the [[Lie product formula|Trotter product formula]] tells us that the noncommutativity of the kinetic and potential energy operators can be ignored.

For a particle in a smooth potential, the path integral is approximated by [[zigzag]] paths, which in one dimension is a product of ordinary integrals. For the motion of the particle from position {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} at time {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} at time {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the time sequence
:&lt;math&gt;t_a = t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_{n-1} &lt; t_n &lt; t_{n+1} = t_b&lt;/math&gt;
can be divided up into {{math|''n'' + 1}} smaller segments {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n'' + 1}}, of fixed duration
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \Delta t = \frac{t_b - t_a}{n + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This process is called ''time-slicing''.

An approximation for the path integral can be computed as proportional to

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \cdots \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}
 \exp \left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_a}^{t_b} L\big(x(t), v(t)\big) \,dt\right) \,dx_0 \, \cdots \, dx_n, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''(''x'', ''v'')}} is the Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system with position variable {{math|''x''(''t'')}} and velocity {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''ẋ''(''t'')}} considered (see below), and {{mvar|dx&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponds to the position at the {{mvar|j}}th time step, if the time integral is approximated by a sum of {{mvar|n}} terms.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For a simplified, step-by-step derivation of the above relation, see [http://www.quantumfieldtheory.info/website_Chap18.pdf Path Integrals in Quantum Theories: A Pedagogic 1st Step].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the limit {{mvar|''n'' → ∞}}, this becomes a [[functional integral]], which, apart from a nonessential factor, is directly the product of the probability amplitudes {{math|{{bra-ket|''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''|''x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} (more precisely, since one must work with a continuous spectrum, the respective densities) to find the quantum mechanical particle at {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the initial state {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} and at {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the final state {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Actually {{mvar|L}} is the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of the one-dimensional system considered,
:&lt;math&gt; L(x, \dot x) = T-V=\frac{1}{2}m|\dot{x}|^2-V(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and the abovementioned "zigzagging" corresponds to the appearance of the terms

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\varepsilon \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} L \left(\tilde x_j, \frac{x_j - x_{j-1}}{\varepsilon}, j \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

in the [[Riemann sum]] approximating the time integral, which are finally integrated over {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} with the integration measure {{math|''dx''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''dx&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{mvar|x̃&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an arbitrary value of the interval corresponding to {{mvar|j}}, e.g. its center, {{math|{{sfrac|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''−1&lt;/sub&gt;|2}}}}.

Thus, in contrast to classical mechanics, not only does the stationary path contribute, but actually all virtual paths between the initial and the final point also contribute.

===Path integral formula===

In terms of the wave function in the position representation, the path integral formula reads as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{Z}\int_{\mathbf{x}(0)=x}\mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}\, e^{iS[\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}}]}\psi_0(\mathbf{x}(t))\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denotes integration over all paths &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0)=x&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a normalization factor. Here &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the action, given by
:&lt;math&gt;S[\mathbf{x},\dot\mathbf{x}]=\int dt\, L(\mathbf{x}(t),\dot\mathbf{x}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Path integral example.webm|thumb|The diagram shows the contribution to the path integral of a free particle for a set of paths.]]

=== Free particle ===

The path integral representation gives the quantum amplitude to go from point {{mvar|x}} to point {{mvar|y}} as an integral over all paths. For a free-particle action (for simplicity let {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}})
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int \frac{\dot{x}^2}{2}\, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

the integral can be evaluated explicitly.

To do this, it is convenient to start without the factor {{mvar|i}} in the exponential, so that large deviations are suppressed by small numbers, not by cancelling oscillatory contributions:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) = \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \exp\left(-\int_0^T \frac{\dot{x}^2}{2} \,dt\right) \,Dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Splitting the integral into time slices:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x, y; T) = \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \prod_t \exp\left(-\tfrac12 \left(\frac{x(t + \varepsilon) - x(t)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2 \varepsilon \right) \,Dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|Dx}} is interpreted as a finite collection of integrations at each integer multiple of {{mvar|ε}}. Each factor in the product is a Gaussian as a function of {{math|''x''(''t'' + ''ε'')}} centered at {{math|''x''(''t'')}} with variance {{mvar|ε}}. The multiple integrals are a repeated [[convolution]] of this Gaussian {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;}} with copies of itself at adjacent times:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) = G_\varepsilon * G_\varepsilon * \cdots * G_\varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;

where the number of convolutions is {{math|{{sfrac|''T''|''ε''}}}}. The result is easy to evaluate by taking the Fourier transform of both sides, so that the convolutions become multiplications:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{K}(p; T) = \tilde{G}_\varepsilon(p)^{T/\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform of the Gaussian {{mvar|G}} is another Gaussian of reciprocal variance:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}_\varepsilon(p) = e^{-\frac{\varepsilon p^2}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

and the result is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{K}(p; T) = e^{-\frac{T p^2}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform gives {{mvar|K}}, and it is a Gaussian again with reciprocal variance:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) \propto e^{ -\frac{(x - y)^2}{2T}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The proportionality constant is not really determined by the time-slicing approach, only the ratio of values for different endpoint choices is determined. The proportionality constant should be chosen to ensure that between each two time slices the time evolution is quantum-mechanically unitary, but a more illuminating way to fix the normalization is to consider the path integral as a description of a stochastic process.

The result has a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths of the exponential factor can be seen as the sum over each path of the probability of selecting that path. The probability is the product over each segment of the probability of selecting that segment, so that each segment is probabilistically independently chosen. The fact that the answer is a Gaussian spreading linearly in time is the [[central limit theorem]], which can be interpreted as the first historical evaluation of a statistical path integral.

The probability interpretation gives a natural normalization choice. The path integral should be defined so that
:&lt;math&gt;\int K(x - y; T) \,dy = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This condition normalizes the Gaussian and produces a kernel that obeys the diffusion equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = \frac{\nabla^2}{2} K.&lt;/math&gt;

For oscillatory path integrals, ones with an {{mvar|i}} in the numerator, the time slicing produces convolved Gaussians, just as before. Now, however, the convolution product is marginally singular, since it requires careful limits to evaluate the oscillating integrals. To make the factors well defined, the easiest way is to add a small imaginary part to the time increment {{mvar|ε}}. This is closely related to [[Wick rotation]]. Then the same convolution argument as before gives the propagation kernel:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) \propto e^\frac{i(x - y)^2}{2T},&lt;/math&gt;

which, with the same normalization as before (not the sum-squares normalization – this function has a divergent norm), obeys a free Schrödinger equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = i \frac{\nabla^2}{2} K.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that any superposition of {{mvar|K}}s will also obey the same equation, by linearity. Defining
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_t(y) = \int \psi_0(x) K(x - y; t) \,dx = \int \psi_0(x) \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(t) = y} e^{iS} \,Dx,&lt;/math&gt;

then {{mvar|ψ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} obeys the free Schrödinger equation just as {{mvar|K}} does:
:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi_t = -\frac{\nabla^2}{2} \psi_t.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Simple harmonic oscillator ===
The Lagrangian for the simple harmonic oscillator is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \tfrac12 m \dot{x}^2 - \tfrac12 m \omega^2 x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Write its trajectory {{math|''x''(''t'')}} as the classical trajectory plus some perturbation, {{math|''x''(''t'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') + ''δx''(''t'')}} and the action as {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + ''δS''}}. The classical trajectory can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{c}(t) = x_i \frac{\sin\omega(t_f - t)}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)} + x_f \frac{\sin\omega(t - t_i)}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;


This trajectory yields the classical action
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S_\text{c} &amp; = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \mathcal{L} \,dt = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \left(\tfrac12 m\dot{x}^2 - \tfrac12 m\omega^2 x^2 \right) \,dt \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac 1 2 m\omega \left( \frac{(x_i^2 + x_f^2) \cos\omega(t_f - t_i) - 2 x_i x_f}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)} \right)~.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next, expand the non-classical contribution to the action {{mvar|δS}} as a Fourier series, which gives
:&lt;math&gt;S = S_\text{c} + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \tfrac12 a_n^2 \frac{m}{2} \left( \frac{(n \pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \omega^2(t_f - t_i) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the propagator is
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) &amp; = Q e^\frac{i S_\text{c}}{\hbar} \prod_{j=1}^\infty \frac{j \pi}{\sqrt{2}} \int da_j \exp{\left( \frac{i}{2\hbar}a_j^2 \frac{m}{2} \left( \frac{(j \pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \omega^2(t_f - t_i) \right) \right)} \\[6pt]
&amp; = e^\frac{i S_\text{c}}{\hbar} Q \prod_{j=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \left( \frac{\omega(t_f - t_i)}{j \pi} \right)^2 \right)^{-\frac12}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for some normalization
:&lt;math&gt; Q = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi i \hbar (t_f - t_i)}}~. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the infinite-product representation of the [[sinc function]],
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{j=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{j^2} \right) = \frac{\sin\pi x}{\pi x}, &lt;/math&gt;
the propagator can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = Q e^\frac{i S_\text{c}}{\hbar} \sqrt{ \frac{\omega(t_f - t_i)}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)} } = e^\frac{i S_c}{\hbar} \sqrt{ \frac{m\omega}{2\pi i \hbar \sin\omega(t_f - t_i)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  One may write this propagator in terms of energy eigenstates as
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) &amp; = \left( \frac{m \omega}{2 \pi i \hbar \sin\omega T } \right)^\frac12 \exp{ \left( \frac{i}{\hbar} \tfrac12 m \omega  \frac{ (x_i^2 + x_f^2) \cos \omega T - 2 x_i x_f }{ \sin \omega T } \right) } \\[6pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp{ \left( - \frac{i E_n T}{\hbar} \right) } \psi_n(x_f)^{*} \psi_n(x_i)~.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identities {{math|''i'' sin ''ωT'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt; (1 − ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|cos ''ωT'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt; (1 + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, this amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \left( \frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar} \right)^\frac12 e^\frac{-i \omega T} 2 \left( 1 - e^{-2 i \omega T} \right)^{-\frac12} \exp{ \left( - \frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar} \left( \left(x_i^2 + x_f^2\right) \frac{ 1 + e^{-2 i \omega T} }{ 1 - e^{- 2 i \omega T}} - \frac{4 x_i x_f e^{-i \omega T}}{1 - e^{ - 2 i \omega T} }\right) \right) }.&lt;/math&gt;

One may absorb all terms after the first {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωT''/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} into {{math|''R''(''T'')}}, thereby  obtaining
:&lt;math&gt; K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \left( \frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar} \right)^\frac12 e^\frac{-i \omega T } 2 \cdot R(T).&lt;/math&gt;

One may  finally expand {{math|''R''(''T'')}} in  powers of {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt;}}: All  terms in this expansion get multiplied by the {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωT''/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} factor in the front,  yielding terms  of the form
:&lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-i\omega T}{2} e^{-i n\omega T} = e^{-i \omega T \left( \frac12 + n\right) } \quad\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;
Comparison  to the above eigenstate expansion  yields the  standard energy spectrum for the simple harmonic oscillator,
:&lt;math&gt;E_n = \left( n + \tfrac12 \right) \hbar \omega~.&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Propagator#Basic examples: propagator of free particle and harmonic oscillator}}

===Coulomb potential===
Feynman's time-sliced approximation does not, however, exist for the most important quantum-mechanical path integrals of atoms, due to the singularity of the [[Coulomb potential]] {{math|{{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''r''}}}} at the origin. Only after replacing the time {{mvar|t}} by another path-dependent pseudo-time parameter
:&lt;math&gt;s = \int \frac{dt}{r(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
the singularity is removed and a time-sliced approximation exists, which is exactly integrable, since it can be made harmonic by a simple coordinate transformation, as discovered in 1979 by [[İsmail Hakkı Duru]] and [[Hagen Kleinert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duru|Kleinert|1979|loc=Chapter 13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of a path-dependent time transformation and a coordinate transformation is an important tool to solve many path integrals and is called generically the [[Duru–Kleinert transformation]].

=== The Schrödinger equation ===

{{Main|Relation between Schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics}}

The path integral reproduces the Schrödinger equation for the initial and final state even when a potential is present. This is easiest to see by taking a path-integral over infinitesimally separated times.
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(y;t+\varepsilon) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(x;t)\int_{x(t)=x}^{x(t+\varepsilon)=y} e^{i\int\limits_t^{t+\varepsilon} \left(\frac{\dot{x}^2}{2} - V(x)\right)\, dt}\, Dx(t) \, dx\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the time separation is infinitesimal and the cancelling oscillations become severe for large values of {{mvar|ẋ}}, the path integral has most weight for {{mvar|y}} close to {{mvar|x}}. In this case, to lowest order the potential energy is constant, and only the kinetic energy contribution is nontrivial. (This separation of the kinetic and potential energy terms in the exponent is essentially the [[Lie product formula|Trotter product formula]].) The exponential of the action is
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-i\varepsilon V(x)} e^{i\frac{\dot{x}^2}{2}\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term rotates the phase of {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} locally by an amount proportional to the potential energy. The second term is the free particle propagator, corresponding to {{mvar|i}} times a diffusion process. To lowest order in {{mvar|ε}} they are additive; in any case one has with (1):

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(y;t+\varepsilon) \approx \int \psi(x;t) e^{-i\varepsilon V(x)} e^\frac{i(x-y)^2 }{ 2\varepsilon} \,dx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned, the spread in {{mvar|ψ}} is diffusive from the free particle propagation, with an extra infinitesimal rotation in phase which slowly varies from point to point from the potential:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = i\cdot \left(\tfrac12\nabla^2 - V(x)\right)\psi\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this is the Schrödinger equation. Note that the normalization of the path integral needs to be fixed in exactly the same way as in the free particle case. An arbitrary continuous potential does not affect the normalization, although singular potentials require careful treatment.

=== Equations of motion ===

Since the states obey the Schrödinger equation, the path integral must reproduce the Heisenberg equations of motion for the averages of {{mvar|x}} and  {{mvar|ẋ}} variables, but it is instructive to see this directly. The direct approach shows that the expectation values calculated from the path integral reproduce the usual ones of quantum mechanics.

Start by considering the path integral with some fixed initial state
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{x(0)=x} e^{iS(x,\dot{x})}\, Dx\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now note that {{mvar|''x''(''t'')}} at each separate time is a separate integration variable. So it is legitimate to change variables in the integral by shifting: {{math|''x''(''t'') {{=}} ''u''(''t'') + ''ε''(''t'')}} where {{math|''ε''(''t'')}} is a different shift at each time but {{math|''ε''(0) {{=}} ''ε''(''T'') {{=}} 0}}, since the endpoints are not integrated:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{u(0)=x} e^{iS(u+\varepsilon,\dot{u}+\dot{\varepsilon})}\, Du\,&lt;/math&gt;

The change in the integral from the shift is, to first infinitesimal order in {{mvar|ε}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{u(0)=x} \left( \int \frac{\partial S }{ \partial u } \varepsilon + \frac{ \partial S }{ \partial \dot{u} } \dot{\varepsilon}\, dt \right) e^{iS} \,Du\,&lt;/math&gt;

which, integrating by parts in {{mvar|t}}, gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{u(0)=x} -\left( \int \left(\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial S}{\partial \dot{u}} - \frac{\partial S}{\partial u}\right)\varepsilon(t)\, dt \right) e^{iS}\, Du\,&lt;/math&gt;

But this was just a shift of integration variables, which doesn't change the value of the integral for any choice of {{mvar|''ε''(''t'')}}. The conclusion is that this first order variation is zero for an arbitrary initial state and at any arbitrary point in time:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \psi_0\left| \frac{\delta S}{\delta x}(t) \right|\psi_0 \right\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
this is the Heisenberg equation of motion.

If the action contains terms which multiply {{mvar|ẋ}} and {{mvar|x}}, at the same moment in time, the manipulations above are only heuristic, because the multiplication rules for these quantities is just as noncommuting in the path integral as it is in the operator formalism.

=== Stationary-phase approximation ===

If the variation in the action exceeds {{mvar|ħ}} by many orders of magnitude, we typically have destructive interference other than in the vicinity of those trajectories satisfying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]], which is now reinterpreted as the condition for constructive interference. This can be shown using the method of stationary phase applied to the propagator. As {{mvar|ħ}} decreases, the exponential in the integral oscillates rapidly in the complex domain for any change in the action. Thus, in the limit that {{mvar|ħ}} goes to zero, only points where the classical action does not vary contribute to the propagator.

=== Canonical commutation relations ===

The formulation of the path integral does not make it clear at first sight that the quantities {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|p}} do not commute. In the path integral, these are just integration variables and they have no obvious ordering. Feynman discovered that the non-commutativity is still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see this, consider the simplest path integral, the brownian walk. This is not yet quantum mechanics, so in the path-integral the action is not multiplied by {{mvar|i}}:

:&lt;math&gt;S=  \int \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{mvar|''x''(''t'')}} is fluctuating, and the derivative is defined as the limit of a discrete difference.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t)} \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the distance that a random walk moves is proportional to {{math|{{sqrt|''t''}}}}, so that:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t) \approx \sqrt{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the random walk is not differentiable, since the ratio that defines the derivative diverges with probability one.

The quantity {{mvar|xẋ}} is ambiguous, with two possible meanings:

:&lt;math&gt;[1] = x \frac{dx}{dt}  = x(t) \frac{x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\varepsilon } &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[2] = x \frac{dx}{dt} = x(t+\varepsilon) \frac{x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

In elementary calculus, the two are only different by an amount which goes to 0 as {{mvar|ε}} goes to 0. But in this case, the difference between the two is not 0:

:&lt;math&gt;[2] - [1] =  \frac{\big( x(t + \varepsilon) - x(t)\big )^2}{\varepsilon} \approx \frac \varepsilon \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

give a name to the value of the difference for any one random walk:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\big(x(t+\varepsilon)- x(t)\big)^2 }{\varepsilon} = f(t)&lt;/math&gt;

and note that {{math|''f''(''t'')}} is a rapidly fluctuating statistical quantity, whose average value is 1, i.e. a normalized "Gaussian process". The fluctuations of such a quantity can be described by a statistical Lagrangian
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L =  (f(t)-1)^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the equations of motion for {{mvar|f}} derived from extremizing the action {{mvar|S}} corresponding to {{mathcal|L}} just set it equal to 1. In physics, such a quantity is "equal to 1 as an operator identity". In mathematics, it "weakly converges to 1". In either case, it is 1 in any expectation value, or when averaged over any interval, or for all practical purpose.

Defining the time order to ''be'' the operator order:
:&lt;math&gt;[x, \dot x] = x \frac{dx}{dt} - \frac{dx}{dt} x = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the [[Itō lemma]] in [[stochastic calculus]], and the (euclideanized) canonical commutation relations in physics.

For a general statistical action, a similar argument shows that
:&lt;math&gt;\left[x , \frac{\partial S }{ \partial \dot x} \right] = 1&lt;/math&gt;
and in quantum mechanics, the extra imaginary unit in the action converts this to the canonical commutation relation,
:&lt;math&gt;[x,p ] = i&lt;/math&gt;

=== Particle in curved space ===

For a particle in curved space the kinetic term depends on the position, and the above time slicing cannot be applied, this being a manifestation of the notorious [[operator ordering problem]] in Schrödinger quantum mechanics. One may, however, solve this problem by transforming the time-sliced flat-space path integral to curved space using a multivalued coordinate transformation ([[nonholonomic mapping]] explained [http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/b5/psfiles/pthic10.pdf here]).

=== Measure-theoretic factors ===
Sometimes (e.g. a particle moving in curved space) we also have measure-theoretic factors in the functional integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \mu[x] e^{iS[x]} \,\mathcal{D}x.&lt;/math&gt;
This factor is needed to restore unitarity.

For instance, if
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int \left( \frac{m}{2} g_{ij} \dot{x}^i \dot{x}^j - V(x) \right) \,dt,&lt;/math&gt;
then it means that each spatial slice is multiplied by the measure {{math|{{sqrt|''g''}}}}. This measure cannot be expressed as a functional multiplying the {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''x''}} measure because they belong to entirely different classes.

==Euclidean path integrals==
It is very common in path integrals to perform a [[Wick rotation]] from real to imaginary times. In the setting of quantum field theory, the Wick rotation changes the geometry of space-time from Lorentzian to Euclidean; as a result, Wick-rotated path integrals are often called Euclidean path integrals.

===Wick rotation and the Feynman–Kac formula===
If we replace &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;-it&lt;/math&gt;, the time-evolution operator &lt;math&gt;e^{-it\hat{H}/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;e^{-t\hat{H}/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;. (This change is known as a [[Wick rotation]].) If we repeat the derivation of the path-integral formula in this setting, we obtain&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013|loc=Section 20.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{Z}\int_{\mathbf{x}(0)=x} e^{-S_{\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}})/\hbar}\psi_0(\mathbf{x}(t))\, \mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{Euclidean}}&lt;/math&gt; is the Euclidean action, given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}})=\int\left[ \frac{m}{2}|\dot\mathbf{x}(t)|^2+V(\mathbf{x}(t))\right] \,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
Note the sign change between this and the normal action, where the potential energy term is negative. (The term ''Euclidean'' is from the context of quantum field theory, where the change from real to imaginary time changes the space-time geometry from Lorentzian to Euclidean.)

Now, the contribution of the kinetic energy to the path integral is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z}\int_{\mathbf{x}(0)=x} f(\mathbf{x})e^{-\frac{m}{2}\int |\dot\mathbf{x}|^2dt}\, \mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; includes all the remaining dependence of the integrand on the path. This integral has a rigorous mathematical interpretation as integration against the [[Wiener process|Wiener measure]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\mu_{x}&lt;/math&gt;. The Wiener measure, constructed by [[Norbert Wiener]] gives a rigorous foundation to [[Brownian motion#Einstein.27s theory|Einstein's mathematical model of Brownian motion]]. The subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_x&lt;/math&gt; is supported on paths &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0)=x&lt;/math&gt;.

We then have a rigorous version of the Feynman path integral, known as the [[Feynman–Kac formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013|loc=Theorem 20.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=\int e^{-\int V(\mathbf{x}(t)\,dt/\hbar}\,\psi_0(\mathbf{x}(t)) \,d\mu_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;,

where now &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the Wick-rotated version of the Schrödinger equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(x,t) = -\hat H \psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the Wick-rotated Schrödinger equation does not have a direct physical meaning, interesting properties of the Schrödinger operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be extracted by studying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the study of quantum field theories from the path-integral perspective, in both the mathematics and physics literatures, is done in the Euclidean setting, that is, after a Wick rotation. In particular, there are various results showing that if a Euclidean field theory with suitable properties can be constructed, one can then undo the Wick rotation to recover the physical, Lorentzian theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glimm|Jaffe|1981|loc=Chapter 19.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is much more difficult to give a meaning to path integrals (even Euclidean path integrals) in quantum field theory than in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief account of the origins of these difficulties, see {{harvtxt|Hall|2013|loc=Section 20.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The path integral and the partition function ===

The path integral is just the generalization of the integral above to all quantum mechanical problems—
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \int  e^\frac{i\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{x}]}{\hbar}\, \mathcal{D}\mathbf{x} \quad\text{where }\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{x}]=\int_0^T L[\mathbf{x}(t),\dot\mathbf{x}(t)]\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[action (physics)|action]] of the classical problem in which one investigates the path starting at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} and ending at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''T''}}, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denotes integration over all paths. In the classical limit, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{x}]\gg\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, the path of minimum action dominates the integral, because the phase of any path away from this fluctuates rapidly and different contributions cancel.&lt;ref name="Feynman-Hibbs"&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|Hibbs|Styer|2010|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection with [[statistical mechanics]] follows. Considering only paths which begin and end in the same configuration, perform the [[Wick rotation]] {{math|''it'' {{=}} ''τ''}}, i.e., make time imaginary, and integrate over all possible beginning-ending configurations. The Wick-rotated path integral—described in the previous subsection, with the ordinary action replaced by its "Euclidean" counterpart—now resembles the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of statistical mechanics defined in a [[canonical ensemble]] with inverse temperature proportional to imaginary time, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''τ''|''ħ''}}}}. Strictly speaking, though, this is the partition function for a [[statistical field theory]].

Clearly, such a deep analogy between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics cannot be dependent on the formulation. In the canonical formulation, one sees that the unitary evolution operator of a state is given by

:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha;t\rangle=e^{-\frac{iHt}{\hbar}}|\alpha;0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the state {{mvar|α}} is evolved from time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. If one makes a Wick rotation here, and finds the amplitude to go from any state, back to the same state in (imaginary) time {{mvar|iT}} is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \operatorname{Tr} \left[e^\frac{-HT}{\hbar}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

which is precisely the partition function of statistical mechanics for the same system at temperature quoted earlier. One aspect of this equivalence was also known to [[Erwin Schrödinger]] who remarked that the equation named after him looked like the [[diffusion equation]] after Wick rotation. Note, however, that the Euclidean path integral is actually in the form of a ''classical'' statistical mechanics model.

== Quantum field theory ==
{{Quantum field theory}}
Both the Schrödinger and Heisenberg approaches to quantum mechanics single out time and are not in the spirit of relativity. For example, the Heisenberg approach requires that scalar field operators obey the commutation relation

:&lt;math&gt;[\varphi(x), \partial_t \varphi(y)] = i \delta^3(x - y)&lt;/math&gt;

for two simultaneous spatial positions {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, and this is not a relativistically invariant concept. The results of a calculation ''are'' covariant, but the symmetry is not apparent in intermediate stages. If naive field-theory calculations did not produce infinite answers in the continuum limit, this would not have been such a big problem – it would just have been a bad choice of coordinates. But the lack of symmetry means that the infinite quantities must be cut off, and the bad coordinates make it nearly impossible to cut off the theory without spoiling the symmetry. This makes it difficult to extract the physical predictions, which require a [[renormalization|careful limiting procedure]].

The problem of lost symmetry also appears in classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian formulation also superficially singles out time. The Lagrangian formulation makes the relativistic invariance apparent. In the same way, the path integral is manifestly relativistic. It reproduces the Schrödinger equation, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the canonical commutation relations and shows that they are compatible with relativity. It extends the Heisenberg-type operator algebra to [[operator product expansion|operator product rules]], which are new relations difficult to see in the old formalism.

Further, different choices of canonical variables lead to very different-seeming formulations of the same theory. The transformations between the variables can be very complicated, but the path integral makes them into reasonably straightforward changes of integration variables. For these reasons, the Feynman path integral has made earlier formalisms largely obsolete.

The price of a path integral representation is that the unitarity of a theory is no longer self-evident, but it can be proven by changing variables to some canonical representation. The path integral itself also deals with larger mathematical spaces than is usual, which requires more careful mathematics, not all of which has been fully worked out. The path integral historically was not immediately accepted, partly because it took many years to incorporate fermions properly. This required physicists to invent an entirely new mathematical object – the [[Grassmann variable]] – which also allowed changes of variables to be done naturally, as well as allowing [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|constrained quantization]].

The integration variables in the path integral are subtly non-commuting. The value of the product of two field operators at what looks like the same point depends on how the two points are ordered in space and time. This makes some naive identities [[Anomaly (physics)|fail]].

=== The propagator ===

In relativistic theories, there is both a particle and field representation for every theory. The field representation is a sum over all field configurations, and the particle representation is a sum over different particle paths.

The nonrelativistic formulation is traditionally given in terms of particle paths, not fields. There, the path integral in the usual variables, with fixed boundary conditions, gives the probability amplitude for a particle to go from point {{mvar|x}} to point {{mvar|y}} in time {{mvar|T}}:

:&lt;math&gt;K(x, y; T) = \langle y; T \mid x; 0 \rangle = \int_{x(0)=x}^{x(T)=y} e^{i S[x]} \,Dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the [[propagator]]. Superposing different values of the initial position {{mvar|x}} with an arbitrary initial state {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} constructs the final state:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_T(y) = \int_x \psi_0(x) K(x, y; T) \,dx = \int^{x(T)=y} \psi_0(x(0)) e^{i S[x]} \,Dx.&lt;/math&gt;

For a spatially homogeneous system, where {{math|''K''(''x'', ''y'')}} is only a function of {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}}, the integral is a [[convolution]], the final state is the initial state convolved with the propagator:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_T = \psi_0 * K(;T).&lt;/math&gt;

For a free particle of mass {{mvar|m}}, the propagator can be evaluated either explicitly from the path integral or by noting that the Schrödinger equation is a diffusion equation in imaginary time, and the solution must be a normalized Gaussian:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x, y; T) \propto e^\frac{i m(x - y)^2}{2T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the Fourier transform in {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}} produces another Gaussian:

:&lt;math&gt;K(p; T) = e^\frac{i T p^2}{2m},&lt;/math&gt;

and in {{mvar|p}}-space the proportionality factor here is constant in time, as will be verified in a moment. The Fourier transform in time, extending {{math|''K''(''p''; ''T'')}} to be zero for negative times, gives Green's function, or the frequency-space propagator:
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{F}(p, E) = \frac{-i}{E - \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the reciprocal of the operator that annihilates the wavefunction in the Schrödinger equation, which wouldn't have come out right if the proportionality factor weren't constant in the {{mvar|p}}-space representation.

The infinitesimal term in the denominator is a small positive number, which guarantees that the inverse Fourier transform in {{mvar|E}} will be nonzero only for future times. For past times, the inverse Fourier transform contour closes toward values of {{mvar|E}} where there is no singularity. This guarantees that {{mvar|K}} propagates the particle into the future and is the reason for the subscript "F" on {{mvar|G}}. The infinitesimal term can be interpreted as an infinitesimal rotation toward imaginary time.

It is also possible to reexpress the nonrelativistic time evolution in terms of propagators going toward the past, since the Schrödinger equation is time-reversible. The past propagator is the same as the future propagator except for the obvious difference that it vanishes in the future, and in the Gaussian {{mvar|t}} is replaced by {{math|−''t''}}. In this case, the interpretation is that these are the quantities to convolve the final wavefunction so as to get the initial wavefunction:
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{B}(p, E) = \frac{-i}{-E - \frac{i\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;
Given the nearly identical only change is the sign of {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|ε}}, the parameter {{mvar|E}} in Green's function can either be the energy if the paths are going toward the future, or the negative of the energy if the paths are going toward the past.

For a nonrelativistic theory, the time as measured along the path of a moving particle and the time as measured by an outside observer are the same. In relativity, this is no longer true. For a relativistic theory the propagator should be defined as the sum over all paths that travel between two points in a fixed proper time, as measured along the path (these paths describe the trajectory of a particle in space and in time):

:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y, \Tau) = \int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\Tau)=y} e^{i \int_0^\Tau \sqrt{{\dot x}^2} - \alpha \,d\tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral above is not trivial to interpret because of the square root. Fortunately, there is a heuristic trick. The sum is over the relativistic arc length of the path of an oscillating quantity, and like the nonrelativistic path integral should be interpreted as slightly rotated into imaginary time. The function {{math|''K''(''x'' − ''y'', ''τ'')}} can be evaluated when the sum is over paths in Euclidean space:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y, \Tau) = e^{-\alpha \Tau} \int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\Tau)=y} e^{-L}.&lt;/math&gt;

This describes a sum over all paths of length {{math|Τ}} of the exponential of minus the length. This can be given a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths is a probability average over a path constructed step by step. The total number of steps is proportional to {{math|Τ}}, and each step is less likely the longer it is. By the [[central limit theorem]], the result of many independent steps is a Gaussian of variance proportional to {{math|Τ}}:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y,\Tau) = e^{-\alpha \Tau} e^{-\frac{(x - y)^2}{\Tau}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The usual definition of the relativistic propagator only asks for the amplitude is to travel from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|y}}, after summing over all the possible proper times it could take:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y) = \int_0^\infty K(x - y, \Tau) W(\Tau) \,d\Tau,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''W''(Τ)}} is a weight factor, the relative importance of paths of different proper time. By the translation symmetry in proper time, this weight can only be an exponential factor and can be absorbed into the constant {{mvar|α}}:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y) = \int_0^\infty e^{-\frac{(x - y)^2}{\Tau} -\alpha \Tau} \,d\Tau.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Feynman diagram#Schwinger representation|Schwinger representation]]. Taking a Fourier transform over the variable {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}} can be done for each value of {{math|Τ}} separately, and because each separate {{math|Τ}} contribution is a Gaussian, gives whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian with reciprocal width. So in {{mvar|p}}-space, the propagator can be reexpressed simply:
:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \int_0^\infty e^{-\Tau p^2 - \Tau \alpha} \,d\Tau = \frac{1}{p^2 + \alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the Euclidean propagator for a scalar particle. Rotating {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be imaginary gives the usual relativistic propagator, up to a factor of {{math|−''i''}} and an ambiguity, which will be clarified below:
:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \frac{i}{p_0^2 - \vec{p}^2 - m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be interpreted in the nonrelativistic limit, where it is convenient to split it by [[partial fractions]]:

:&lt;math&gt;2 p_0 K(p) = \frac{i}{p_0 - \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m^2}} + \frac{i}{p_0 + \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For states where one nonrelativistic particle is present, the initial wavefunction has a frequency distribution concentrated near {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''}}. When convolving with the propagator, which in {{mvar|p}} space just means multiplying by the propagator, the second term is suppressed and the first term is enhanced. For frequencies near {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''}}, the dominant first term has the form

:&lt;math&gt;2m K_\text{NR}(p) = \frac{i}{(p_0 - m) - \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the expression for the nonrelativistic [[Green's function]] of a free Schrödinger particle.

The second term has a nonrelativistic limit also, but this limit is concentrated on frequencies that are negative. The second pole is dominated by contributions from paths where the proper time and the coordinate time are ticking in an opposite sense, which means that the second term is to be interpreted as the antiparticle. The nonrelativistic analysis shows that with this form the antiparticle still has positive energy.

The proper way to express this mathematically is that, adding a small suppression factor in proper time, the limit where {{math|''t'' → −∞}} of the first term must vanish, while the {{math|''t'' → +∞}} limit of the second term must vanish. In the Fourier transform, this means shifting the pole in {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} slightly, so that the inverse Fourier transform will pick up a small decay factor in one of the time directions:

:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \frac{i}{p_0 - \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m^2} + i\varepsilon} + \frac{i}{p_0 - \sqrt{\vec{p}^2+m^2} - i\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

Without these terms, the pole contribution could not be unambiguously evaluated when taking the inverse Fourier transform of {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The terms can be recombined:

:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \frac{i}{p^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

which when factored, produces opposite-sign infinitesimal terms in each factor. This is the mathematically precise form of the relativistic particle propagator, free of any ambiguities. The {{mvar|ε}} term introduces a small imaginary part to the {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which in the Minkowski version is a small exponential suppression of long paths.

So in the relativistic case, the Feynman path-integral representation of the propagator includes paths going backwards in time, which describe antiparticles. The paths that contribute to the relativistic propagator go forward and backwards in time, and the [[Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation|interpretation]] of this is that the amplitude for a free particle to travel between two points includes amplitudes for the particle to fluctuate into an antiparticle, travel back in time, then forward again.

Unlike the nonrelativistic case, it is impossible to produce a relativistic theory of local particle propagation without including antiparticles. All local differential operators have inverses that are nonzero outside the light cone, meaning that it is impossible to keep a particle from travelling faster than light. Such a particle cannot have a Green's function which is only nonzero in the future in a relativistically invariant theory.

=== Functionals of fields ===

However, the path integral formulation is also extremely important in ''direct'' application to quantum field theory, in which the "paths" or histories being considered are not the motions of a single particle, but the possible time evolutions of a [[field (physics)|field]] over all space.  The action is referred to technically as a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the field: {{math|''S''[''ϕ'']}}, where the field {{math|''ϕ''(''x&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} is itself a function of space and time, and the square brackets are a reminder that the action depends on all the field's values everywhere, not just some particular value. ''One'' such given function {{math|''ϕ''(''x&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} of [[spacetime]] is called a ''field configuration''. In principle, one integrates Feynman's amplitude over the class of all possible field configurations.

Much of the formal study of QFT is devoted to the properties of the resulting functional integral, and much effort (not yet entirely successful) has been made toward making these [[functional integral]]s mathematically precise.

Such a functional integral is extremely similar to the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] in [[statistical mechanics]].  Indeed, it is sometimes ''called'' a [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]], and the two are essentially mathematically identical except for the factor of {{mvar|i}} in the exponent in Feynman's postulate 3. [[Analytic continuation|Analytically continuing]] the integral to an imaginary time variable (called a [[Wick rotation]]) makes the functional integral even more like a statistical partition function and also tames some of the mathematical difficulties of working with these integrals.

=== Expectation values ===

In [[quantum field theory]], if the [[action (physics)|action]] is given by the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{mathcal|S}} of field configurations (which only depends locally on the fields), then the [[time-ordered]] [[vacuum expectation value]] of [[polynomially bounded]] functional {{mvar|F}}, {{math|{{angbr|''F''}}}}, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle = \frac{\int\mathcal{D}\varphi F[\varphi]e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]}}{\int\mathcal{D}\varphi e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol {{math|∫{{mathcal|D}}''ϕ''}} here is a concise way to represent the infinite-dimensional integral over all possible field configurations on all of space-time. As stated above, the unadorned path integral in the denominator ensures proper normalization.

=== As a probability ===
Strictly speaking, the only question that can be asked in physics is: ''What fraction of states satisfying condition {{mvar|A}} also satisfy condition {{mvar|B}}?'' The answer to this is a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a [[conditional probability]], written as {{math|P(''B''{{!}}''A'')}}. In terms of path integration, since {{math|P(''B''{{!}}''A'') {{=}} {{sfrac|P(''A''∩''B'')&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;P(''A'')}}}}, this means

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(B\mid A) = \frac
{\sum_{F \subset A \cap B}\left| \int\mathcal{D}\varphi O_\text{in}[\varphi]e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]}  F[\varphi]\right|^2}
{\sum_{F \subset A} \left|\int\mathcal{D}\varphi O_\text{in}[\varphi] e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]} F[\varphi]\right|^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the functional {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;[''ϕ'']}} is the superposition of all incoming states that could lead to the states we are interested in. In particular, this could be a state corresponding to the state of the Universe just after the [[Big Bang]], although for actual calculation this can be simplified using heuristic methods. Since this expression is a quotient of path integrals, it is naturally normalised.

=== Schwinger–Dyson equations ===
{{Main|Schwinger–Dyson equation}}

Since this formulation of quantum mechanics is analogous to classical action principle, one might expect that identities concerning the action in classical mechanics would have quantum counterparts derivable from a functional integral. This is often the case.

In the language of functional analysis, we can write the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
(the left-hand side is a [[functional derivative]]; the equation means that the action is stationary under small changes in the field configuration).  The quantum analogues of these equations are called the [[Schwinger–Dyson equation]]s.

If the [[functional measure]] {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''ϕ''}} turns out to be [[Translational symmetry|translationally invariant]] (we'll assume this for the rest of this article, although this does not hold for, let's say [[nonlinear sigma model]]s), and if we assume that after a [[Wick rotation]]

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]},&lt;/math&gt;

which now becomes
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-H[\varphi]}&lt;/math&gt;
for some {{mvar|H}}, it goes to zero faster than a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of any [[polynomial]] for large values of {{mvar|φ}}, then we can [[integration by parts|integrate by parts]] (after a Wick rotation, followed by a Wick rotation back) to get the following Schwinger–Dyson equations for the expectation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \frac{\delta F[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi} \right\rangle = -i \left\langle F[\varphi]\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta\varphi} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for any polynomially-bounded functional {{mvar|F}}. In the [[deWitt notation]] this looks like&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/Path_integral Jean Zinn-Justin (2009), ''Scholarpedia'' '''4'''(2):8674 ].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle F_{,i} \right\rangle = -i \left\langle F \mathcal{S}_{,i} \right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are the analog of the [[on-shell]] EL equations. The time ordering is taken before the time derivatives inside the {{math|{{mathcal|S}}&lt;sub&gt;,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

If {{mvar|J}} (called the [[source field]]) is an element of the [[dual space]] of the field configurations (which has at least an [[affine structure]] because of the assumption of the [[translational invariance]] for the functional measure), then the [[generating functional]] {{mvar|Z}} of the source fields is '''defined''' to be

:&lt;math&gt;Z[J] = \int \mathcal{D}\varphi e^{i\left(\mathcal{S}[\varphi] + \langle J,\varphi \rangle\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^n Z}{\delta J(x_1) \cdots \delta J(x_n)}[J] = i^n \, Z[J] \, \left\langle \varphi(x_1)\cdots \varphi(x_n)\right\rangle_J,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{,i_1\cdots i_n}[J] = i^n Z[J] \left \langle \varphi^{i_1}\cdots \varphi^{i_n}\right\rangle_J,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle_J = \frac{\int \mathcal{D}\varphi F[\varphi]e^{i\left(\mathcal{S}[\varphi] + \langle J,\varphi \rangle\right)}}{\int\mathcal{D}\varphi e^{i\left(\mathcal{S}[\varphi] + \langle J,\varphi \rangle\right)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Basically, if {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''φ'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''{{mathcal|S}}[''φ'']&lt;/sup&gt;}} is viewed as a functional distribution (this shouldn't be taken too literally as an interpretation of [[Quantum field theory|QFT]], unlike its Wick-rotated [[statistical mechanics]] analogue, because we have [[time ordering]] complications here!), then {{math|{{angbr|''φ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ... ''φ''(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}}} are its [[moment (mathematics)|moments]], and {{mvar|Z}} is its [[Fourier transform]].

If {{mvar|F}} is a functional of {{mvar|φ}}, then for an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] {{mvar|K}}, {{math|''F''[''K'']}} is defined to be the operator that substitutes {{mvar|K}} for {{mvar|φ}}. For example, if

:&lt;math&gt;F[\varphi] = \frac{\partial^{k_1}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}}\varphi(x_1)\cdots \frac{\partial^{k_n}}{\partial x_n^{k_n}}\varphi(x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

and {{mvar|G}} is a functional of {{mvar|J}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;F\left[-i\frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right] G[J] = (-i)^n \frac{\partial^{k_1}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}}\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x_1)} \cdots \frac{\partial^{k_n}}{\partial x_n^{k_n}}\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x_n)} G[J].&lt;/math&gt;

Then, from the properties of the [[functional integral]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \varphi(x)} [\varphi] + J(x)\right\rangle_J = 0&lt;/math&gt;

we get the "master" Schwinger–Dyson equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \varphi(x)}\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J] + J(x)Z[J] = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{,i}[-i\partial]Z + J_i Z = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the functional measure is not translationally invariant, it might be possible to express it as the product {{math|''M''[''φ''] {{mathcal|D}}''φ''}}, where {{mvar|M}} is a functional and {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''φ''}} is a translationally invariant measure. This is true, for example, for nonlinear sigma models where the [[target space]] is diffeomorphic to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. However, if the [[target manifold]] is some topologically nontrivial space, the concept of a translation does not even make any sense.

In that case, we would have to replace the {{mathcal|S}} in this equation by another functional
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{S}} = \mathcal{S} - i\ln M.&lt;/math&gt;

If we expand this equation as a [[Taylor series]] about ''J'' {{=}} 0, we get the entire set of Schwinger–Dyson equations.

== Localization ==
The path integrals are usually thought of as being the sum of all paths through an infinite space–time. However, in [[local quantum field theory]] we would restrict everything to lie within a finite ''causally complete'' region, for example inside a double light-cone. This gives a more mathematically precise and physically rigorous definition of quantum field theory.

=== Ward–Takahashi identities ===
{{main|Ward–Takahashi identity}}

Now how about the [[on shell]] [[Noether's theorem]] for the classical case? Does it have a quantum analog as well? Yes, but with a caveat. The functional measure would have to be invariant under the one parameter group of symmetry transformation as well.

Let's just assume for simplicity here that the symmetry in question is local (not local in the sense of a [[gauge symmetry]], but in the sense that the transformed value of the field at any given point under an infinitesimal transformation would only depend on the field configuration over an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point in question). Let's also assume that the action is local in the sense that it is the integral over spacetime of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], and that
:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}(x)]=\partial_\mu f^\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt;
for some function {{mvar|f}} where {{mvar|f}} only depends locally on {{mvar|φ}} (and possibly the spacetime position).

If we don't assume any special boundary conditions, this would not be a "true" symmetry in the true sense of the term in general unless {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}} or something. Here, {{mvar|Q}} is a [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] which generates the one parameter group in question. We could have [[antiderivation]]s as well, such as [[BRST quantization|BRST]] and [[supersymmetry]].

Let's also assume
:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\varphi\, Q[F][\varphi]=0&lt;/math&gt;
for any polynomially-bounded functional {{mvar|F}}. This property is called the invariance of the measure. And this does not hold in general. See [[anomaly (physics)]] for more details.

Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\varphi\, Q\left[F e^{iS}\right][\varphi]=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which implies
:&lt;math&gt;\langle Q[F]\rangle +i\left\langle F\int_{\partial V} f^\mu\, ds_\mu\right\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is over the boundary. This is the quantum analog of Noether's theorem.

Now, let's assume even further that {{mvar|Q}} is a local integral

:&lt;math&gt;Q=\int d^dx\, q(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;q(x)[\varphi(y)] = \delta^{(d)}(X-y)Q[\varphi(y)] \,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;q(x)[S]=\partial_\mu j^\mu (x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\mu}(x)=f^\mu(x)-\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}(x) Q[\varphi] \,&lt;/math&gt;

(this is assuming the Lagrangian only depends on {{mvar|φ}} and its first partial derivatives! More general Lagrangians would require a modification to this definition!). Note that we're NOT insisting that {{math|''q''(''x'')}} is the generator of a symmetry (i.e. we are ''not'' insisting upon the [[gauge principle]]), but just that {{mvar|Q}} is.  And we also assume the even stronger assumption that the functional measure is locally invariant:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\varphi\, q(x)[F][\varphi]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we would have

:&lt;math&gt;\langle q(x)[F] \rangle +i\langle F q(x)[S]\rangle=\langle q(x)[F]\rangle +i\left\langle F\partial_\mu j^\mu(x)\right\rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt;q(x)[S]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\varphi(x)]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]=\partial_\mu j^\mu(x)\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\varphi(x)]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above two equations are the '''Ward–Takahashi identities'''.

Now for the case where {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}}, we can forget about all the boundary conditions and locality assumptions. We'd simply have

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle Q[F]\right\rangle =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^dx\, J(x)Q[\varphi(x)]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== The need for regulators and renormalization ==

Path integrals as they are defined here require the introduction of [[Regularization (physics)|regulators]]. Changing the scale of the regulator leads to the [[renormalization group]]. In fact, renormalization is the major obstruction to making path integrals well-defined.

== The path integral in quantum-mechanical interpretation ==

In one [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the "sum over histories" interpretation, the path integral is taken to be fundamental, and reality is viewed as a single indistinguishable "class" of paths that all share the same events.  For this interpretation, it is crucial to understand what exactly an event is. The sum-over-histories method gives identical results to canonical quantum mechanics, and Sinha and Sorkin&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinha|Sorkin|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim the interpretation explains the [[Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox]] without resorting to [[action at a distance|nonlocality]].

Some{{who|date=August 2014}} advocates of interpretations of quantum mechanics emphasizing [[decoherence]] have attempted to make more rigorous the notion of extracting a classical-like "coarse-grained" history from the space of all possible histories.

== Quantum gravity ==
Whereas in quantum mechanics the path integral formulation is fully equivalent to other formulations, it may be that it can be extended to quantum gravity, which would make it different from the [[Hilbert space]] model. Feynman had some success in this direction, and his work has been extended by [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gell-Mann|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches that use this method include [[causal dynamical triangulation]]s and [[spinfoam]] models.

== Quantum tunneling ==
[[Quantum tunnelling]] can be modeled by using the path integral formation to determine the action of the trajectory through a potential barrier. Using the [[WKB approximation]], the tunneling rate ({{math|Γ}}) can be determined to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma = A_\mathrm{o} \exp \left(-\frac{S_\mathrm{eff}}{\hbar}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

with the effective action {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;}} and pre-exponential factor {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This form is specifically useful in a [[dissipative system]], in which the systems and surroundings must be modeled together. Using the [[Langevin equation]] to model [[Brownian motion]], the path integral formation can be used to determine an effective action and pre-exponential model to see the effect of dissipation on tunnelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caldeira|Leggett|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, tunneling rates of macroscopic systems (at finite temperatures) can be predicted.

Preclinical or small-animal Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ([[SPECT]]) is a radionuclide based [[molecular imaging]] modality for small laboratory animals&lt;ref&gt;Meikle SR, et al. Small animal SPECT and its place in the matrix of molecular imaging technologies. Phys Med Biol. 2005; 50(22):R45-61.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. mice and rats). Although SPECT is a well-established imaging technique that is already for decades in use for clinical application, the limited resolution of clinical SPECT (~10&amp;nbsp;mm) stimulated the development of dedicated small animal SPECT systems with sub-mm resolution. Unlike in clinics, '''preclinical SPECT''' outperforms preclinical coincidence [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] in terms of resolution (best spatial resolution of SPECT - 0.25mm,&lt;ref name ="Ivashchenko et al 2014"&gt;Ivashchenko et al. Quarter-Millimeter-Resolution Molecular Mouse Imaging with U-SPECT+. Mol Imaging. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; PET ≈ 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;ref&gt;Walker MD, et al. Performance Assessment of a Preclinical PET Scanner with Pinhole Collimation by Comparison to a Coincidence-Based Small-Animal PET Scanner. J Nucl Med. 2014; 55(8):1368-1374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tai Y, et al. Performance Evaluation of the microPET Focus: A Third-Generation microPET Scanner Dedicated to Animal Imaging. J Nucl Med. 2005; 46(3):455-463.&lt;/ref&gt; ) and, at the same time, allows to perform fast dynamic imaging of animals (less than 15s time frames&lt;ref name = "Vaissier et al"&gt;Vaissier PEB, et al. Fast spiral SPECT with stationary γ-cameras and focusing pinholes. J Nucl Med. 2012; 53(8):1292-9.&lt;/ref&gt;).

SPECT imaging requires administration of small quantities of γ-emitting radiolabeled molecules (commonly called "[[Radioactive tracer|tracers]]") into the animal prior to the image acquisition. These tracers are biochemically designed in such a way that they accumulate at target locations in the body. The radiation emitted by the tracer molecules (single [[Photon|γ-photons]]) can be detected by [[Gamma camera|gamma detectors]] and, after image reconstruction, results in a 3-dimensional image of the tracer distribution within the animal. Some key radioactive isotopes used in preclinical SPECT are [[99mTc|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]], [[Iodine-123|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I]], [[Iodine-125|&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I]], [[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]], [[Indium-111|&lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;In]], [[Gallium 67 scan|&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]] and [[Thallium|&lt;sup&gt;201&lt;/sup&gt;Tl]].

Preclinical SPECT plays an important role in multiple areas of [[translational research]]&lt;ref name ="Bernsen et al"&gt;Bernsen MR, et al. The role of preclinical SPECT in oncological and neurological research in combination with either CT or MRI. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2014; 41(1):36-49.&lt;/ref&gt; where SPECT can be used for non-invasive imaging of radiolabeled molecules, including antibodies, peptides, and nanoparticles. Among major areas of its applications are oncology, neurology, psychiatry, cardiology, orthopedics, pharmacology and internal medicine.

== Basic imaging principle of preclinical SPECT ==

Due to the small size of the imaged animals (a mouse is about 3000 times smaller than a human measured by weight and volume), it is essential to have a high spatial resolution and detection efficiency for the preclinical scanner.

=== Spatial resolution ===

Looking at spatial resolution first, if we want to see the same level of details relatively to e.g. the size of the organs in a mouse as we can see in a human, the spatial resolution of clinical SPECT needs to be improved by a factor of ∛3000≈15 or higher. Such an obstacle forced scientists to look for a new imaging approach for preclinical SPECT that was found in exploiting the pinhole imaging principle.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman FJ, et al. The pinhole: gateway to ultra-high-resolution three-dimensional radionuclide imaging. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2007; 34(2):151-61.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pinhole imaging.jpg|thumbnail|When pinhole imaging is used, the high magnification of the projection greatly reduces the resolution loss due to detector blurring]]

A [[Pinhole camera|pinhole collimator]] consists of a piece of dense material containing only a single hole, which typically has the shape of a double cone. First attempts to obtain SPECT images of rodents with a high resolution were based on use of pinhole collimators attached to convectional gamma cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Weber DA, et al. Pinhole SPECT: an approach to ''in vivo'' high resolution SPECT imaging in small laboratory animals. J Nucl Med. 1994; 35: 342-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaszczak RJ, et al. Pinhole collimation for ultra-high-resolution, small-field-of-view SPECT. Phys Med Biol. 1994; 39: 425-37.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a way, by placing the object (e.g. rodent) close to the aperture of the pinhole, one can reach a high [[magnification]] of its projection on the detector surface and effectively compensate for the limited intrinsic resolution of the detector.

The combined effects of the finite aperture size and the limited intrinsic resolution are described by:

&lt;math&gt;R= \sqrt{ { \left ({d_e \over M} \right ) ^2} +  { \left ({R_i \over M} \right ) ^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rentmeester et al"&gt;Rentmeester MCM, et al. Optimizing multi-pinhole SPECT geometries using an analytic model. Phys Med Biol. 2007; 52:2567-2581.&lt;/ref&gt;

d&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; - effective pinhole diameter, R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - intrinsic resolution of the detector, M – projection magnification factor.

The resolution of a SPECT system based on the pinhole imaging principle can be improved in one of three ways:

* by decreasing the effective diameter of the pinhole
* by increasing the magnification factor
* by using detectors with higher intrinsic resolution

The exact size, shape and material of the pinhole are important to obtain good imaging characteristics and is a subject of collimator design optimization studies via e.g. use of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulations]].
Modern preclinical SPECT scanners based on pinhole imaging can reach up to 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm spatial or 0.015μL volumetric resolution for ''in vivo'' mouse imaging.

=== Detection efficiency ===
[[File:Mouse SPECT scan - circulation of radiolabeled nanoparticles.gif|thumb|Animated maximum intensity projections of SPECT/CT mouse scans acquired after administration of 0.26 MBq of &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;In-labelled nanoparticles. Images illustrates ''in vivo'' biodistribution of the particles within the animal.]]
The detection efficiency or sensitivity of a preclinical pinhole SPECT system is determined by:&lt;ref name="Rentmeester et al"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metzler SD, et al. Resolution- versus sensitivity-effective diameter in pinhole collimation: experimental verification. Phys Med Biol. 2005; 50:5005-5017.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S = {{N {d_e}^2} \over {{16r_c}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

S – detection efficiency (sensitivity), d&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;-effective pinhole diameter with penetration, N – total number of pinholes, r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; – collimator radius (e.g. object-to-pinhole distance).

The sensitivity can be improved by:

* increasing the pinhole diameter
Possible drawbacks: degradation of spatial resolution

* decreasing the object-to-pinhole distance (e.g. placing the animal as close as possible to the pinhole aperture)
* using multiple pinholes that simultaneously capture projections from multiple angles
Possible drawbacks: When multiple pinhole projections are projected on a single detector surface, they can either overlap each other (multiplexing projections) or be fully separated (non-overlapping projections). Although pinhole collimators with multiplexing projections allow reaching a higher sensitivity (by allowing to use a higher number of pinholes) when compared to non-overlapping designs, they also suffer from multiple artifacts in reconstructed SPECT images.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe  RK, et al. A stationary hemispherical SPECT imager for three-dimensional brain imaging. J Nucl Med.1993; 34:474-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meike SR, et al. A prototype coded aperture detector for small animal SPECT. IEEE Trans Nucl Sci. 2002; 49:2167-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Audenhaege K, et al. The Evaluation of Data Completeness and Image Quality in Multiplexing Multi-Pinhole SPECT.  IEEE Trans Med Imag. 2015; 34: 474-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vunckx K, et al. Effect of Overlapping Projections on Reconstruction Image Quality in Multipinhole SPECT. IEEE Trans Med Imag.2008; 27: 972-83.&lt;/ref&gt; The artifacts are cause by ambiguity about the origin of γ -photons detected in the areas of the overlap.

* decreasing the size of the "[[Field of view|field-of-view]]"
Placing the animal close to the pinhole aperture comes at the cost of reducing the size of the area that can be imaged at a given time (the "field-of-view") compared to imaging at a lower magnification. However, when combined with moving the animal (the so-called "scanning-focus method" &lt;ref name ="Branderhorst et al"&gt;Branderhorst W, et al. Targeted multi-pinhole SPECT. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2001; 38(3):552-61.&lt;/ref&gt;) a larger area of interest can still be imaged with a good resolution and sensitivity.

The typical detection efficiency of preclinical SPECT scanner lies within a 0.1-0.2% (1000-2000 cps/MBq) range, which is more than tenfold higher than the average sensitivity of clinical scanners.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen MT. Recent Advances in SPECT imaging. J Nucl Med. 2007; 48(4):661-673.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, dedicated high-sensitivity collimators can allow &gt;1% detection efficiency and maintain sub-mm image resolution.&lt;ref name = "Ivashchenko et al 2015"&gt;Ivashchenko, et al. Ultra-high-sensitivity sub-mm mouse SPECT. J Nucl Med. 2015; 56(3):470-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System design ===

Multiple pinhole SPECT system designs have been proposed, including rotating gamma camera, stationary detector but rotating collimator, or completely stationary camera&lt;ref&gt;Furenlid LR, et al. FastSPECTII: A Second-Generation High-Resolution Dynamic SPECT Imager. IEEE Trans Nucl Sci. 2004; 51(3):631-635.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Have F, et al. U-SPECT-II: An Ultra-High-Resolution Device for Molecular Small-Animal Imaging. J Nucl Med. 2009; 50(4):599-605.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a large number of pinholes surround the animal and simultaneously acquire projections from a sufficient number of angles for tomographic image reconstruction. Stationary systems have several advantages over non-stationary systems:

* no need for repetitive system geometry recalibration
Why: due to the stable position of the detector(s) and the collimator

* unlike non-stationary systems, stationary systems are very well suited for dynamic SPECT imaging
Why: because all required angular information is acquired simultaneously by multiple pinholes.

Modern stationary preclinical SPECT systems can perform dynamic SPECT imaging with up to 15s time-frames during total body &lt;ref name="Vaissier et al" /&gt; and up to 1s time-frames during "focused" (e.g. focusing  on heart) &lt;ref name="Branderhorst et al"/&gt; image acquisitions.
[[File:15 secod TB.gif|thumbnail|Fast pharmacokinetics: 15s-frame &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-MDP mouse SPECT scan acquired with a stationary SPECT system]]

=== Multimodality imaging ===
[[File:Matrix of medical imaging.jpg|thumb|The matrix of medical imaging and comparative performance of different imaging modalities]]
Medical imaging encompasses many different imaging modalities, which can roughly be divided into anatomical and functional imaging. Anatomical modalities (e.g. [[CT scan|CT]], [[MRI]]) mainly reveal the structure of the tissues and organs, while the functional modalities (SPECT, PET and [[Medical optical imaging|optical imaging]]) mainly visualize the physiology and function of the tissue. Because none of the existing imaging modalities can provide information on all aspects of structure and function, an obvious approach is to either alter one imaging modality to the task (e.g. special imaging sequences in MRI) or to try to image a subject using multiple imaging modalities. Following the multimodality approach, in recent years the combination of a SPECT/CT system became a standard molecular imaging modality combination in both the pre-clinical and clinical fields, where the structural information of CT complements the functional information from SPECT. Nevertheless, integration of SPCECT with other imaging modalities (e.g. SPECT/MR, SPECT/PET/CT&lt;ref name="Bernsen et al" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cherry SR. Multimodality In Vivo Imaging Systems: Twice the Power or Double the Trouble. Annu Rev Biomed Eng. 2006; 8:35-62.&lt;/ref&gt;) is not uncommon.

== Reconstruction ==

A SPECT measurement consists of 2-dimensional projections of the radioactive source distribution that are obtained with collimator(s) and gamma-detector(s). It is the goal of an image reconstruction algorithm to accurately reconstruct the unknown 3-dimensional distribution of the radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Qi J, et al. Iterative reconstruction techniques in emission computed tomography. Phys Med Biol. 2006; 51(15):R541-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization algorithm&lt;ref&gt;Lange K, et al. EM reconstruction algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. J Comput Assist Tomogr. 1984; 8:306-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepp LA, et al. Maximum likelihood reconstruction for emission tomography. IEEE Trans Med Imag. 1982; 1(2):113-22.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Expectation–maximization algorithm|MLEM]]) is an important "gold standard" in iterative image reconstruction of SPECT images, but it is also a computationally costly method. A popular solution of this obstacle is based on the use of so-called block-iterative reconstruction methods. With block-iterative methods, every iteration of the algorithm is subdivided into many subsequent sub-iterations, each using a different subset of the projection data. An example of a widely used block-iterative version of MLEM is the Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization algorithm&lt;ref&gt;Hudson HM, et al. Accelerated image-reconstruction using ordered subsets of projection data. IEEE Trans Med Imag. 1994; 13(4):601-609.&lt;/ref&gt; (OSEM). The reconstruction speedup of a full iteration OSEM over a single iteration MLEM is approximately equal to the number of subsets.

=== Quantification ===

Preclinical SPECT is a quantitative imaging modality. The uptake of SPECT tracers in organs (regions) of interest can be calculated from reconstructed images. The small size of laboratory animals diminishes the photon’s attenuation in the body of the animal (compared to one in human-sized objects). Nevertheless, depending on the energy of γ-photons and the size of the animal that is used for imaging, correction for photon attenuation and scattering might be required to provide good quantification accuracy. A detailed discussion about effects affecting quantification of SPECT images can be found in Hwang et al.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang AB, et al. Assessment of the sources of error affecting the quantitative accuracy of SPECT imaging in small animals. Phys Med Biol. 2008. 53:2233-2252.&lt;/ref&gt;

== SPECT tracers ==
SPECT tracers emit single γ-photons with the energy of the emitted photon depending on the isotope that was used for radiolabeling of the tracer. Thus, in cases when different tracers are radiolabeled with isotopes of different energies, SPECT provides the ability to probe several molecular pathways simultaneously (multi-isotope imaging). Two examples of common multi-isotope tracer combinations used for SPECT imaging are &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-[[Sodium iodide|NaI]]/&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-[[pertechnetate]] (thyroid function&lt;ref&gt;Society of Nucler Medicine Procedure Guideline for Thyroid Scintigraphy. V3.0 Thyroid Scintigraphy. September 10, 2006. http://snmmi.files.cms-plus.com/docs/Thyroid_Scintigraphy_V3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) or &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-MAG3/&lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;In-[[Pentetic acid|DTPA]] (assessment of [[Radioisotope renography|renal filtration]]).

The time the tracer can be followed ''in vivo'' strongly depends on the half-life of the isotope used for radiolabeling of the compound. The wide range of relatively long-lived isotopes (compared to the isotopes typically used in PET) that can be used for SPECT imaging provide a unique possibility to image slow kinetic processes (days to weeks).
  
Another important characteristic of SPECT is the simplicity of tracer radiolabeling procedure that can be performed with a wide range of commercially available labelling kits.

== Preclinical SPECT versus PET ==

Preclinical SPECT and PET are two very similar molecular imaging modalities used for noninvasive visualization of biodistribution of radiolabel tracers that are injected into an animal. The major difference between SPECT and PET lies in the nature of the radioactive decay of their tracers. SPECT tracer emits single γ-photons with the energy of photons that depends on the isotope that was used for radiolabeling. In PET, the tracer emits positrons that, after annihilation with electrons in the subject, produce a pair of 511 keV annihilation photons emitted into opposite directions. Coincidental detection of these annihilation photons is used for image formation in PET. As a result, different detection principles have been developed for SPECT and PET tracers, which has led to separate SPECT and PET scanners.

Comparison of preclinical SPECT and PET is provided in the table below

== Modern preclinical SPECT ==

Currently there are four main commercially available preclinical SPECT systems: U-SPECT ([http://www.milabs.com MILabs]), Inveon ([http://www.healthcare.siemens.com/molecular-imaging Siemens Medical Solutions]), X-SPECT (Gamma Medica) and [http://www.mediso.com/products.php?fid=2 NanoScan] (Mediso, previously Bioscan). All together they enable up to 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm spatial resolution (0.015μL volumetric resolution) and up to 1 second-frame dynamic noninvasive SPECT imaging of rodents. Comparison of performance of commercially available preclinical SPECT systems can be found in Deleye et al.&lt;ref&gt;Deleye, et al. Performance evaluation of small-animal multipinhole μSPECT scanners for mouse imaging. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2013; 40:744-758.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in translational research ==

SPECT can be used for diagnostic or therapeutic imaging. When a radioactive tracer is labeled with primary gamma-emitting isotopes (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I, &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;In, &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I), the acquired images provide functional information about the bio-distribution of the compound that can be used for multiple diagnostic purposes. Examples of diagnostic applications: metabolism and perfusion imaging, cardiology, orthopedics.

When SPECT tracer is labeled with a combined gamma and α- or β-emitting isotope (e.g. [[Isotopes of bismuth|&lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;Bi]]  or &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I), it is possible to combine cancer [[radioisotope therapy]]  with [[Alpha particle|α-]] or [[Beta particle|β- particles]] with noninvasive imaging of response to the therapy that is achieved with SPECT.

==History==
[[File:PymantuningCanoe.jpg|thumb|right|Canoeing near the lab]]
The University of Pittsburgh established a biological field station at [[Presque Isle, Pennsylvania]] on the shores of [[Lake Erie]] in 1926. However, the creation of [[Presque Isle State Park]] crowded out the modest field station, and in 1949 the field station moved to [[Pymatuning State Park (Pennsylvania)|Pymatuning State Park]].&lt;ref name="Trib2009" /&gt; The University of Pittsburgh obtained a lease from the state for a {{convert|13|acre|adj=on}} wooded peninsula adjacent to the Pennsylvania State Fish Hatchery which became known as the Sanctuary Lake Site. The first building was constructed on this site in 1952. Over time more research buildings were erected on the site in order to satisfy the educational and research needs of the University of Pittsburgh and visiting faculty and students from other colleges and universities in Western Pennsylvania.

By 1965, the university had outgrown the Sanctuary Lake Site facilities and it obtained a second lease from the [[Pymatuning State Park (Pennsylvania)|Pymatuning State Park]] for a dedicated housing site.
As the Housing Site expanded and developed, the Sanctuary Lake Site was dedicated to maintaining modern research and teaching facilities. Today, this site has modern facilities for housing instructors, researchers, and students as well as a Dining Hall, Kitchen, and Recreation Hall.

Major renovations and building projects were undertaken in the mid-1990s that resulted in a 30% increase in space and included the installation of numerous pieces of equipment and lab renovations. Among the projects was a new $81,000 {{convert|1700|sqft|m2}} administration building with a library and a $102,000 faculty housing unit that was completed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sajna  | first = Mike |url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-lay=a&amp;-format=d.html&amp;storyid=7121&amp;-Find| title=Pitt's Pymatuning lab moves into modern age of ecology research | newspaper = University Times |publisher=University of Pittsburgh | date= 1997-07-24| accessdate=2009-05-14 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2000, the University of Pittsburgh has renovated and expanded the facilities, as well as adding a significant increase in land. This has included the acquisition of three research properties, Wallace Woods, Beagle Road, and the Livingston Farm, that total {{convert|360|acre}}. In addition, the university has constructed five additional labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymabouthistory.htm| title=History of the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the lab has been awarded a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to construct a new $1.2 million, {{convert|3600|sqft|m2|sing=on}} laboratory building to be completed in 2014 that will contain three new research labs including new animal care space for bird researches and sterile lab space for molecular and microbial biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biology.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/facilities-images/NSF%20announcement.pdf | first=Rick | last=Relyea| title=New Lab for PLE!

==Facilities==
[[File:DSC 0996 (5097506993).jpg|thumb|right]]
The lab and teaching facilities of the Pymatuning Laboratory are located within public lands consisting of an {{convert|11000|acre|sing=on}} Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation area owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In addition, the Pymatuning Laboratory owns 360 acres of research sites that includes tracts of forest, successional field, and [[wetland]] along Linesville Creek in the Pymatuning [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and another tract of successional meadow, designated for experimental plantings and manipulations, a few miles from the laboratory site. An [[old-growth forest]] preserve of the [[Western Pennsylvania Conservancy]] also is managed by the Lab. Facilities include 10 research labs, cabins, dormitories, a dining hall, and lecture rooms. The lab is also stocked with a variety of equipment for research as well as recreational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymresfacilities.htm| title=Research Facilities at Pymatuning |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctuary Lake Site===
[[File:PymatuningPittSancLake.jpg|thumb|right|Lab buildings at the Sanctuary Lake Site]]
The Sanctuary Lake Site is the original research site for the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology since 1949 and is situated on Sanctuary Lake, a protected waterway, which several of the original classrooms overlook. This 13 acre site contains eight research laboratories, a stockroom, environmental chambers, a -40 °C freezer, wireless internet, a computer lab, and 24-hour emergency power back-up. There is also a library and a large lecture hall that can accommodate more than 100 people.

===Livingston Road Laboratory===
The Livingston Road Laboratory, affectionately called "the farm", is the newest facility at PLE and contains {{convert|134|acre}} of field and forest, offering a variety of venues for observation or experimentation. In addition, there is a newly constructed {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}} building containing aquatic and terrestrial research laboratories, a large garage for storage, two water wells, temperature controlled rooms, offices, restrooms, dsl internet access, and a modern security system.

===Beagle Road Site===
The Beagle Road Site is a {{convert|23|acre|sing=on}} site that supports an old-field community and is currently the location for a variety of old-field and aquatic mesocosm experiments.

===Wallace Woods===
Wallace Woods is a {{convert|26|acre|sing=on}} site that contains a fairly mature second-growth forest. It also includes a stretch of Linesville Creek for aquatic study. The vegetation of this site has been particularly well studied over the years, allowing providing significant potential for future research projects.

===Tryon-Weber Woods===
Tryon-Weber Woods is an {{convert|84|acre|sing=on}} site of forested land that is stewarded by Pymatuning Lab and owned by the Western Pennsylvania Nature Conservancy. It contains a mature [[Beech-maple forest|American beech-sugar maple woods]] and is considered to be one of the finest examples of such an old-growth forest in northwestern Pennsylvania.

===Janette Rose Tryon Reserve===
The Janette Rose Tryon Reserve contains {{convert|80|acre}} of forested land that was selectively logged in recent decades. The land contains second-growth timber and a substantial number of wetlands located within the forest mosaic.

===Residences===
Various on-site and off-site residences exist at the Pymatuning Lab to house up to 120 students and researchers.&lt;ref name="Trib2013"/&gt;

====Housing Site====
[[File:PittPymatuninglabRecBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|Inside Recreation Hall at the Housing Site]]
The Housing Site, located on the shores of Pymatuning Lake, contains most of the residential opportunities for students and researchers.  The site is composed of ten residence structures and also includes on-site equipped kitchens, a laundry facility, dining hall, and Recreational Hall that features a fireplace, satellite television, [[pool table]], [[foosball]] table, and [[ping-pong]] table. The entire lake-shore housing site is served by high-speed, wireless internet. The Housing Site also maintains a supply of recreation equipment including [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, a [[volleyball]] court, and a [[Horseshoes|horseshoe]] pit, and is nearby are beaches for swimming and trails for hiking, biking, bird watching, and running.

Undergraduate and graduate student housing is provided in three [[Dormitory|dormatories]]: the Mountain Laurel Men's Dorm, White-tailed Deer Women's Dorm, and the Bald Eagle Dorm.  The dorms consist of a large room with 4 single beds and attached bath. A lounge area in each dorm serves as a social center and contains desktop computers that are connected to the internet. Residents take meals in the Dining Hall or use a communal kitchen in the Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymcourseliving.htm| title=Courses at the PLE - Living at the Field Station |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers can obtain housing in the two-story Ruffled grouse Apartments or in one of six cabins.  The apartments consist of 2 bedrooms that share bath and a kitchen which is equipped with microwaves, stoves, refrigerators, dishes, utensils and cookware. Each bedroom has a private entrance and has either one double bed or 2 single beds and, if available, can be rented as a unit to provide family housing. The cabins which each have a living room, equipped kitchen, bath and 1, 2, or 3 bedrooms. Cabin bedrooms may contain either one double or two single beds. If space is available, 2 and 3 bedroom cabins may be rented to provide family housing.&lt;ref name="researchhousing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymreshousing.htm| title=Housing for PLE Researchers |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Off-site housing====
The Hartman House is located about a mile north of Linesville. It is a two-story house with living room, kitchen, bath, one large bedroom and three small bedrooms. The Hartman House also may be rented to provide housing for a family. Another off-site housing location exists at the Sanctuary Lake Site in the Former Director's House, also called the Hatchery House, which is a two-story, three bedroom facility with a living room, kitchen and bathroom that can also provide family housing.&lt;ref name="researchhousing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/Frame/pymaboutdirections.htm |title=Directions to Pymatuning &amp; Maps |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiometry''' is a set of techniques for [[measurement|measuring]] [[electromagnetic radiation]], including [[visible light]]. Radiometric techniques in [[optics]] characterize the distribution of the radiation's [[power (physics)|power]] in space, as opposed to [[photometry (optics)|photometric]] techniques, which characterize the light's interaction with the human eye. Radiometry is distinct from [[quantum optics|quantum]] techniques such as [[photon]] counting.

The use of [[radiometer]]s to determine the temperature of objects and gasses by measuring radiation flux is called [[pyrometry]].  Handheld pyrometer devices are often marketed as [[infrared thermometer]]s.

Radiometry is important in [[astronomy]], especially [[radio astronomy]], and plays a significant role in [[Earth remote sensing]]. The measurement techniques categorized as ''radiometry'' in optics are called [[Photometry (astronomy)|''photometry'']] in some astronomical applications, contrary to the optics usage of the term.

'''Spectroradiometry''' is the measurement of absolute radiometric quantities in narrow bands of wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|publisher=[[Focal Press]] | author=Leslie D. Stroebel | author2=Richard D. Zakia | last-author-amp=yes | date=1993 | edition=3rd|page=115 |isbn=0-240-51417-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=spectroradiometry+intitle:%22Focal+Encyclopedia+of+Photography%22#PPA115,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiometric quantities ==
{{SI radiometry units}}

== Integral and spectral radiometric quantities ==
[[Integral]] quantities (like [[radiant flux]]) describe the total effect of radiation of all [[wavelength]]s or [[frequency|frequencies]], while [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] quantities (like [[spectral power]]) describe the effect of radiation of a single wavelength ''λ'' or frequency ''ν''. To each integral quantity there are corresponding spectral quantities, for example the radiant flux Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the spectral power Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; and Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Getting an integral quantity's spectral counterpart requires a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit transition]]. This comes from the idea that the precisely requested wavelength [[photon]] existence probability is zero. Let us show the relation between them using the radiant flux as an example:

Integral flux, whose unit is [[watt|W]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Spectral flux by wavelength, whose unit is {{nobreak|W/[[metre|m]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = {\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e} \over \mathrm{d}\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the radiant flux of the radiation in a small wavelength interval [''λ'', ''λ'' + d''λ''].
The area under a plot with wavelength horizontal axis equals to the total radiant flux.

Spectral flux by frequency, whose unit is {{nobreak|W/[[hertz|Hz]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = {\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e} \over \mathrm{d}\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the radiant flux of the radiation in a small frequency interval [''ν'', ''ν'' + d''ν''].
The area under a plot with frequency horizontal axis equals to the total radiant flux.

The spectral quantities by wavelength ''λ'' and frequency ''ν'' are related to each other, since the product of the two variables is the [[speed of light]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda \cdot \nu = c&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = {c \over \lambda^2} \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu},&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = {c \over \nu^2} \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda},&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \nu \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral quantity can be obtained by the spectral quantity's integration:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \int_0^\infty \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}\, \mathrm{d}\lambda = \int_0^\infty \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}\, \mathrm{d}\nu = \int_0^\infty \lambda \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}\, \mathrm{d} \ln \lambda = \int_0^\infty \nu \Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}\, \mathrm{d} \ln \nu.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3074">'''Range state''' is a term generally used in [[zoogeography]] and [[conservation biology]] to refer to any [[nation]] that exercises jurisdiction over any part of a [[range (biology)|range]] which a particular [[species]], [[taxon]] or [[biotope]] inhabits, or crosses or overflies at any time on its normal [[Animal migration|migration]] route.  The term is often expanded to ''also'' include, particularly in [[international waters]], any nation with vessels flying their flag that engage in exploitation (e.g. hunting, fishing, capturing) of that species.&lt;ref name="CMG-text"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.cms.int/documents/convtxt/cms_convtxt_english.pdf | title=Convention Text | booktitle=Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals | accessdate=17 February 2012 | location=Bonn, Germany | date=23 June 1979 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406235608/http://www.cms.int/documents/convtxt/cms_convtxt_english.pdf | archivedate=6 April 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deKlemm"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.fni.no/ybiced/94_05_klemm.pdf | title=The Problem of Migratory Species in International Law | author=de Klemm, Cyrille | journal=Green Globe Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development 1994 | year=1994 | pages=66–77 | editors=Helge Ole Bergesen and Georg Parmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries in which a species occurs only as a [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] or ‘accidental’ visitor outside of its normal range or migration route are not usually considered range states.  

Because governmental conservation policy is often formulated on a national scale, and because in most countries, both governmental and private conservation organisations are also organised at the national level, the range state concept is often used by international conservation organizations in formulating their conservation and campaigning policy.  

An example of one such organization is the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ([[Bonn Convention|CMS]], or the  “[[Bonn Convention]]”).  It is a [[multilateral treaty]] focusing on the conservation of critically endangered and threatened migratory species, their habitats and their migration routes.  Because such habitats and/or migration routes may span national boundaries, conservation efforts are less likely to succeed without the cooperation, participation, and coordination of each of the range states.&lt;ref name="deKlemm" /&gt;

'''Rounding''' a [[numerical value]] means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation; for example, replacing ${{formatnum:23.4476}} with ${{formatnum:23.45}}, or the fraction 312/941 with 1/3, or the expression {{radic|2}} with {{formatnum:1.414}}.

Rounding is often done to obtain a value that is easier to [[report]] and [[communicate]] than the original. Rounding can also be important to avoid [[overprecision|misleadingly precise]] reporting of a computed number, [[measurement]] or [[estimate]]; for example, a quantity that was computed as {{formatnum:123456}} but is known to be [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] only to within a few hundred units is better stated as "about {{formatnum:123500}}".

On the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some [[round-off error]] in the reported result.  Rounding is almost unavoidable when reporting many computations – especially when dividing two numbers in [[integer]] or [[fixed-point arithmetic]]; when computing mathematical functions such as [[square root]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[sine]]s; or when using a [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] representation with a fixed number of [[significant digit]]s.  In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally [[Propagation of uncertainty|accumulate]], and in certain [[ill-conditioned]] cases they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of [[transcendental function|transcendental mathematical functions]] is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "[[#Table-maker's dilemma|the table-maker's dilemma]]".

Rounding has many similarities to the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] that occurs when [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] must be encoded by numbers or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s.

A wavy [[equals sign]] (&lt;big&gt;'''[[≈]]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;!-- unicode U+2248 --&gt;: ''approximately equal to'') is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g., 0.75 ≈ 1. This sign was introduced by [[Alfred George Greenhill]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Lankham, [[Bruno Nachtergaele]], [[Anne Schilling]]: ''Linear Algebra as an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics.'' World Scientific, Singapur 2016, {{ISBN|978-981-4730-35-8}}, S. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideal characteristics of rounding methods include:

# Rounding should be done by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. This way, when the same input is rounded in different instances, the output is unchanged.
# Calculations done with rounding should be close to those done without rounding.
#* As a result of (1) and (2), the output from rounding should be close to its input, often as close as possible by some [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]].
# To be considered rounding, the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] will be a subset of the [[Domain of a function|domain]]. Additionally, the range will have [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 &lt;/math&gt;or less. The classical range is the integers, '''[[Integer|Z]]'''
# Rounding should preserve [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] that already exist between the domain and range. With finite precision (or a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] domain) this translates to removing [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].
# A rounding method should have utility in computer science or human arithmetic where finite precision is used, and speed is a consideration.

But, because it is not usually possible for a method to satisfy all ideal characteristics, many methods exist.

As a general rule, rounding is [[Idempotence|idempotent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulisch|first1=Ulrich|date=July 1977|title=Mathematical foundation of computer arithmetic|url=https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=C-26|pages=610–621|doi=10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., once a number has been rounded, rounding it again will not change its value. In practice, rounding functions are also [[Monotonic function|monotonic]].

== Rounding to integer ==
The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of an abstract single-argument "round()" procedure. These are true functions with the exception of those that are random-based.

=== Directed rounding to an integer ===
These four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number {{var|x}} to the rounded value {{var|y}} are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[Extended real number line|+∞]], or −∞). Directed rounding is used in [[Interval arithmetic]] and is often required in financial calculations.

If {{var|x}} is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero.  If {{var|x}} is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if {{var|x}} is integer, {{var|y}} is just {{var|x}}.

Where many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new [[stock index|index]] set up by the [[Vancouver Stock Exchange]] in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas [[stock price]]s had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms|author=Nicholas J. Higham|page=54|isbn=978-0-89871-521-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the examples below, {{math|sgn(''x'')}} refers to the [[sign function]] applied to the original number, {{math|''x''}}.

==== Rounding down ====
* '''round down''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''):  {{var|y}} is the largest integer that does not exceed {{var|x}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{floor}(x) = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -x \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding up ====
* '''round up''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''',  or '''round towards plus infinity'''):  {{var|y}} is the smallest integer that is not less than {{var|x}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{ceil}(x) = \left\lceil x \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -x \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding towards zero ====
* '''round towards zero''' (or '''[[truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the integer part of {{var|x}}, without its fraction digits.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{truncate}(x) = \sgn(x) \left\lfloor \left| x \right| \right\rfloor = -\sgn(x) \left\lceil -\left| x \right| \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rounding away from zero ====
* '''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is {{var|x}}; else {{var|y}} is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that {{var|x}} is between 0 and {{var|y}}.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lceil \left| x \right| \right\rceil = -\sgn(x) \left\lfloor -\left| x \right| \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rounding to the nearest integer===
Rounding a number {{var|x}} to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when {{var|x}} is exactly half-way between two integers — that is, when the fraction part of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5.

If it were not for the 0.5 fractional parts, the round-off errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down by the same amount.

When rounding a large set of [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] numbers with [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]] fractional parts, the rounding errors by all values, with the omission of those having 0.5 fractional part, would statistically compensate each other. This means that the [[expectation (mathematics)|expected]] (average) value of the rounded numbers is equal to the expected value of the original numbers when we remove numbers with fractional part 0.5 from the set. 

In practice [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] numbers are typically used which have even more computational nuances because they are not equally spaced.

==== Round half up ====
The following tie-breaking rule, called '''round half up''' (or '''round half towards positive infinity'''), is widely used in many disciplines.{{citation needed|reason=This is surprising. A confusion with ''round half away from zero''?|date=June 2017}} That is, half-way values of {{var|x}} are always rounded up.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\lfloor x + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -x - 0.5 \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{\lfloor 2x \rfloor}{2} \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

For example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

However, some programming languages (such as Java, Python) define their ''half up'' as ''[[#Round half away from zero|round half away from zero]]'' here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=java.math.RoundingMode|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html#HALF_UP|publisher=Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=decimal — Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#rounding-modes|publisher=Python Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method only requires checking one digit to determine rounding direction in [[2's complement]] and similar representations.

==== Round half down ====
One may also use '''round half down''' (or '''round half towards negative infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half up''.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\lceil x - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -x + 0.5 \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{\lceil 2x \rceil}{2} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

==== Round half towards zero ====
One may also '''round half towards zero''' (or '''round half away from infinity''') as opposed to the conventional ''round half away from zero''.
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|y}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lceil \left| x \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\sgn(x) \left\lfloor -\left| x \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor &lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias towards zero.

==== Round half away from zero ====
The other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the '''round half away from zero''' (or '''round half towards infinity'''), namely:
* If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.
*:&lt;math&gt;y = \sgn(x) \left\lfloor \left| x \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\sgn(x) \left\lceil -\left| x \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil &lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

This can be more efficient on binary computers because only the first omitted bit needs to be considered to determine if it rounds up (on a 1) or down (on a 0). This is one method used when rounding to [[significant figures]] due to its simplicity.

This method, also known as '''commercial rounding''',  treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias away from zero.

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).

==== Round half to even ====
A tie-breaking rule without positive/negative bias ''and'' without bias toward/away from zero is '''round half to even'''.   By this convention, if the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the even integer nearest to {{var|x}}.  Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, as does +24.5; while −23.5 becomes −24, as does −24.5. This function minimizes the expected error when summing over rounded figures, even when the inputs are mostly positive or mostly negative.

This variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called '''convergent rounding''', '''statistician's rounding''', '''Dutch rounding''', '''Gaussian rounding''', '''odd–even rounding''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150603082624/http://mscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/543web/files/GSFC-X-673-64-1F.pdf Engineering Drafting Standards Manual] (NASA), X-673-64-1F, p90&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bankers' rounding'''.

This is the default rounding mode used in [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] computing functions and operators (see also [[Nearest integer function]]), and the more sophisticated mode used when rounding to significant figures.

By eliminating bias, repeated rounded addition or subtraction of independent numbers will give a result with an error that tends to grow in proportion to the square root of the number of operations rather than linearly. See [[Random walk#One-dimensional random walk|random walk]] for more.

However, this rule distorts the distribution by increasing the probability of evens relative to odds. Typically this is less important than the biases that are eliminated by this method.

==== Round half to odd ====
A similar tie-breaking rule is '''round half to odd'''.  In this approach, if the fraction of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the odd integer nearest to {{var|x}}.  Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +23, as does +22.5; while −23.5 becomes −23, as does −22.5.

This method is also free from positive/negative bias and bias toward/away from zero.

This variant is almost never used in computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid increasing the scale of floating-point numbers, which have a limited exponent range. With ''round half to even'', a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small {{em|denormal}} value would round to a normal non-zero value.  Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for even-based number systems (such as binary and decimal).{{clarify|reason=The ''problem'' would be avoided only for halfway numbers. So, how can this be useful in practice? Any practical example?|post-text=(see [[Talk:Rounding#Round half to odd|talk]])|date=September 2017}}

=== Random-based rounding of an integer ===
==== Alternating tie-breaking ====
One method, more obscure than most, is to alternate direction when rounding a number with 0.5 fractional part. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

* Whenever the fractional part is 0.5, alternate rounding up or down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; and so on. (Alternatively the first 0.5 fractional part rounding can be determined by a [[random seed]].)

If occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts occur significantly more than a restart of the occurrence "counting" then it is effectively bias free. With guaranteed zero bias, it is useful if the numbers are to be summed or averaged.

==== Random tie-breaking ====

* If the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, choose {{var|y}} randomly among {{nowrap|{{var|x}} + 0.5}} and {{nowrap|{{var|x}} − 0.5}}, with equal probability. All others are rounded to the closest integer.

Like round-half-to-even and round-half-to-odd, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd {{var|y}} values. The advantage over alternate tie-breaking is that the last direction of rounding on 0.5 fractional part does not have to be "remembered".
==== Stochastic rounding ====
Rounding as follows to one of the closest straddling integers with a probability dependent on the proximity is called [[stochastic]] rounding and will give an unbiased result on average.&lt;ref name=stochastic&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision|arxiv=1502.02551 |first1=Suyog|last1=Gupta |first2=Ankur|last2=Angrawl |first3=Kailash|last3=Gopalakrishnan |first4=Pritish|last4=Narayanan |page=3 |date=9 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {Round} (x) = \begin{cases}
 \lfloor x \rfloor &amp; \text { with probability } 1 - (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) \\
 \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 &amp; \text { with probability } {x - \lfloor x \rfloor}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 1.6 would be rounded to 1 with probability 0.4 and to 2 with probability 0.6.

Stochastic rounding is accurate in a way that a rounding [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can never be. For example, say you started with 0 and added 0.3 to that one hundred times while rounding the running total between every addition. The result would be 0 with regular rounding, but with stochastic rounding, the expected result would be 30, which is the same value obtained without rounding. This can be useful in [[machine learning]] where the training may use low precision arithmetic iteratively.&lt;ref name=stochastic /&gt; Stochastic rounding is a way to achieve 1-dimensional dithering.

== Rounding to other values ==
=== Rounding to a specified multiple ===
The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment — such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc.

In general, rounding a number {{var|x}} to a multiple of some specified positive value {{var|m}} entails the following steps:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{roundToMultiple}(x, m) = \mathrm{round}(x/m) \times m&lt;/math&gt;

For example, rounding {{var|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing 2.1784/0.01&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;217.84, then rounding that to 218, and finally computing 218&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.18.

When rounding to a predetermined number of [[significant figure|significant digits]], the increment {{var|m}} depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).

The increment {{var|m}} is normally a finite fraction in whatever [[number system]] is used to represent the numbers.  For display to humans, that usually means the [[decimal number|decimal number system]] (that is, {{var|m}} is an integer times a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the [[binary number|binary number system]] ({{var|m}} is an integer times a power of 2).

The abstract single-argument "round()" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the [[#Rounding to integer|rounding to integer]] section. The abstract two-argument "roundToMultiple()" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value {{var|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.

=== Logarithmic rounding ===
==== Rounding to a specified power ====
Rounding to a specified ''power'' is very different from rounding to a specified ''multiple''; for example, it is common in computing to need to round a number to a whole power of 2.  The steps, in general, to round a positive number {{var|x}} to a power of some specified integer {{var|b}} greater than 1, are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{roundToPower}(x, b) = b^{\mathrm{round}(\log_b x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Many of the caveats applicable to rounding to a multiple are applicable to rounding to a power.

==== Scaled rounding ====
This type of rounding, which is also named '''rounding to a logarithmic scale''', is a variant of [[#Rounding to a specified power|rounding to a specified power]]. Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.

For example, resistors are supplied with [[preferred number]]s on a logarithmic scale. For example, for resistors with 10% accuracy they are supplied with nominal values 100,  121,  147,  178,  215 etc. If a calculation indicates a resistor of 165 ohms is required then log(147)=2.167, log(165)=2.217 and log(178)=2.250. The logarithm of 165 is closer to the logarithm of 178 therefore a 178 ohm resistor would be the first choice if there are no other considerations.

Whether a value {{math|''x'' ∈ (''a'', ''b'')}} rounds to {{var|a}} or {{var|b}} depends upon whether the squared value {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is greater than or less than the product {{math|''ab''}}.  The value 165 rounds to 178 in the resistors example because {{math|1=165&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 27225}} is greater than {{math|1=147 × 178 = 26166}}.

=== Floating-point rounding ===
In floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value {{var|x}} into a value {{var|y}} with a specified number of {{em|significant}} digits.  In other words, {{var|y}} should be a multiple of a number {{var|m}} that depends on the magnitude of {{var|x}}.  The number {{var|m}} is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point representation.

Apart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the [[#Scaled rounding|Scaled rounding]] section above, but with a constant scaling factor {{var|s}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and an integer base {{var|b}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

Where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity when "rounding away from zero", or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if {{var|x}} is negative), when "rounding towards zero". The result of an overflow for the usual case of ''round to nearest'' is always the appropriate infinity.

=== Rounding to a simple fraction ===
In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number {{var|x}} to a "neat" fraction — that is, the nearest fraction {{var|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{var|m}}/{{var|n}} whose numerator {{var|m}} and denominator {{var|n}} do not exceed a given maximum.  This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit {{var|m}}.  This problem is related to [[Farey sequence]]s, the [[Stern–Brocot tree]], and [[Continued fraction#Best rational approximations|continued fractions]].

=== Rounding to an available value ===
Finished [[lumber]], writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then "round" to some standard size using phrases such as "round down to nearest standard value", "round up to nearest standard value", or "round to nearest standard value".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/voltage_regulators_zeners.pdf "Zener Diode Voltage Regulators"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/tester-3.html "Build a Mirror Tester"]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a set of [[preferred value]]s is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale, choosing the closest [[preferred value]] to any given value can be seen as a form of [[#Scaled rounding|scaled rounding]]. Such rounded values can be directly calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Trump, Christine Schneider.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rounding in other contexts ==
=== Dithering and error diffusion ===
When digitizing [[continuous signal]]s, such as sound waves, the overall effect of a number of measurements is more important than the accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances, [[dithering]], and a related technique, [[error diffusion]], are normally used. A related technique called [[pulse-width modulation]] is used to achieve analog type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.

Error diffusion tries to ensure the error, on average, is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero, the output would be zero for the first few terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering]] is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitizing images.

As a one-dimensional example, suppose the numbers {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|0.9204}}, {{math|0.7451}}, and {{math|0.3091}} occur in order and each is to be rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}.  In this case the cumulative sums, {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|1=1.8881 = 0.9677 + 0.9204}}, {{math|1=2.6332 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451}}, and {{math|1=2.9423 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451 + 0.3091}}, are each rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1.89}}, {{math|2.63}}, and {{math|2.94}}.  The first of these and the differences of adjacent values give the desired rounded values: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1=0.92 = 1.89 − 0.97}}, {{math|1=0.74 = 2.63 − 1.89}}, and {{math|1=0.31 = 2.94 − 2.63}}.

=== Monte Carlo arithmetic ===
Monte Carlo arithmetic is a technique in [[Monte Carlo method]]s where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding can be used for Monte Carlo arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate how stable the computation is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/mca/CSD-970014.ps.gz|title=Monte Carlo Arithmetic: a framework for the statistical analysis of roundoff errors|last1=Parker|first1=D Stott|last2=Eggert|first2=Paul R.|date=28 March 2000|publisher=IEEE Computation in Science and Engineering|last3=Pierce|first3=Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exact computation with rounded arithmetic ===
It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with integer domain and range.  For example, if we know that an integer {{var|n}} is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting {{var|n}} to a floating-point value {{var|z}}, computing the approximate square root {{var|x}} of {{var|z}} with floating point, and then rounding {{var|x}} to the nearest integer {{var|y}}.  If {{var|n}} is not too big, the floating-point round-off error in {{var|x}} will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value {{var|y}} will be the exact square root of {{var|n}}.  This is essentially why [[Slide rule|slide rules]] could be used for exact arithmetic.
=== Double rounding ===
{{Anchor|Sticky rounding|Rounding to odd}}
Rounding a number twice in succession to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding.&lt;ref&gt;Another case where double rounding always leads to the same value as directly rounding to the final precision is when the radix is odd.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borman|first1=Phil|last2=Chatfield|first2=Marion|title=Avoid the perils of using rounded data|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|date=10 November 2015|volume=115|pages=506–507|doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2015.07.021|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708515300753}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data rounded to one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.

In ''Martinez v. Allstate'' and ''Sendejo v. Farmers'', litigated between 1995 and 1997, the insurance companies argued that double rounding premiums was permissible and in fact required. The US courts ruled against the insurance companies and ordered them to adopt rules to ensure single rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain |author=Deborah R. Hensler |pages=255–293 | isbn=0-8330-2601-1 |publisher=RAND| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computer languages and the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard dictate that in straightforward calculations the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with [[x87]] floating point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a [[strictfp]] qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.

In some algorithms, an intermediate result is computed and rounded and then, after more computation, must be rounded to the final precision. Double rounding error can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding precision for the intermediate computation and/or by using a proven rounding method for intermediate and final rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=J Strother|last2=Lynch|first2=Tom|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Matt|date=1996|title=A mechanically checked proof of the correctness of the kernel of the AMD5K86 floating-point division algorithm|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/divide_paper.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=47|citeseerx=10.1.1.43.3309|doi=10.1109/12.713311|accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00080427v2/document |title=Emulation of a FMA and correctly-rounded sums: proved algorithms using rounding to odd |last1=Boldo |first1=Sylvie |last2=Melquiond |first2=Guillaume |date=2008 |website=HAL - Inria |format=PDF |doi=10.1109/TC.2007.70819 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21718#c25|title=21718 – real.c rounding not perfect|author=|date=|website=gcc.gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Table-maker's dilemma ===
[[William Kahan]] coined the term "The Table-Maker's Dilemma" for the unknown cost of rounding [[transcendental function]]s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute {{var|y&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}} correctly rounded for {{em|every}} two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary [[transcendental function]]s mostly within slightly more than half an [[Unit in the last place|ulp]] and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't {{var|y&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}} be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it {{em|correctly}} to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kahan |first=William |title=A Logarithm Too Clever by Half |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/LOG10HAF.TXT |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[IEEE 754|IEEE floating-point standard]] guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, [[fused multiply–add]], square root, and floating-point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.

Using the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] and [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]] many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return [[transcendental number|transcendental]] results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |id={{isbn|978-0-8176-4705-6}} (online), {{isbn|0-8176-4704-X}} (print) --&gt; |chapter=Chapter 12: Solving the Table Maker's Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programming packages offer correct rounding. The [[MPFR|GNU MPFR]] package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. Some other libraries implement elementary functions with correct rounding in double precision:
* [[IBM]]'s libultim, in rounding to nearest only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libultim.3|title=libultim – ultimate correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sun Microsystems]]'s libmcr, in the 4 rounding modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libmcr.3|title=libmcr – correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CRlibm, written in the old Arénaire team (LIP, [[ENS Lyon]]). It supports the 4 rounding modes and is proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027224938/http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm|archivedate=2016-10-27|title=CRlibm – Correctly Rounded mathematical library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist [[computable number]]s for which a rounded value can never be determined no matter how many digits are calculated. Specific instances cannot be given but this follows from the undecidability of the [[halting problem]]. For instance, if [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true but [[unprovable]], then the result of rounding the following value up to the next integer cannot be determined: 10&lt;sup&gt;−{{var|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; where {{var|n}} is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0 if there is no such number. The result is 1 if such a number exists and 0 if no such number exists. The value before rounding can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.

=== Interaction with string searches ===
Rounding can adversely affect a string search for a number.  For example, {{math|''π''}} rounded to four digits is "3.1416" but a simple search for this string will not discover "3.14159" or any other value of {{math|''π''}} rounded to more than four digits.  In contrast, truncation does not suffer from this problem; for example, a simple string search for "3.1415", which is {{math|''π''}} truncated to four digits, will discover values of {{math|''π''}} truncated to more than four digits.

== History ==
The concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division.  Some ancient [[clay tablet]]s found in [[Mesopotamia]] contain tables with rounded values of [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] and square roots in base 60.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Duncan J. Melville. "YBC 7289 clay tablet". 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rounded approximations to [[pi|π]], the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient—see [[base 60#Examples|base 60 examples]].

The ''round-to-even'' method has served as the [[ASTM]] (E-29) standard since 1940.  The origin of the terms ''unbiased rounding'' and ''statistician's rounding'' are fairly self-explanatory.  In the 1906 fourth edition of ''Probability and Theory of Errors''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=05170001&amp;view=50&amp;frames=0&amp;seq=48|title=Probability and theory of errors|author=|date=|website=historical.library.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Simpson Woodward]] called this "the computer's rule" indicating that it was then in common use by [[human computer]]s who calculated mathematical tables. [[Churchill Eisenhart]] indicated the practice was already "well established" in data analysis by the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Production and Management Engineering|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=187–223|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedtechniqu00colu|author=Churchill Eisenhart|editors=Eisenhart, Hastay and Wallis|accessdate=30 January 2014|chapter=Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the term ''bankers' rounding'' remains more obscure.  If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find.  To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report ''The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts''&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that "half-way" amounts should be rounded up.

Until the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating-point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of [[interval arithmetic]].

Currently, tendency to round around 5 or 2 is used in the number of research. To be more precise [[age heaping]] was used in the number of studies by [[Jörg Baten|Baten]], to evaluate the numeracy level of the ancient populations. He came up with [[ABCC index]], which enables the comparison of the [[numeracy]] among regions possible without any historical sources where the population [[literacy]] was measured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |title=Quantifying Quantitative Literacy: Age Heaping and the History of Human Capita |journal=Journal of Economic History |date=2009 |volume=69 |pages=783-808}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Rounding functions in programming languages ==
Most [[programming language]]s provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways.  The earliest numeric languages, such as [[FORTRAN]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero).  This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an [[integer (computing)|integer]] [[variable (programming)|variable]], or using a fractional number as an index of an [[array data type|array]]. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.

In the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard [[library (computing)|libraries]] of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up, down, to nearest, and towards zero).  The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer.  Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a [[Double precision floating-point format|double precision float]] argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary.  This approach may avoid spurious [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]] since floating-point types have a larger range than integer types.  Some languages, such as [[PHP]], provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300.  In addition, many languages provide a [[printf]] or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the ''precision'').  On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.

On the opposite, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and in their [[Interface description language|IDL]] interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating-point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point values before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard [[JavaScript]] or [[ECMAScript]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|title=ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification|author=|date=|website=ecma-international.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; interface bindings).

== Other rounding standards ==
Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.

===US weather observations===
In a guideline issued in mid-1966,&lt;ref&gt;OFCM, 2005: [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm |date=1999-04-20 }}, Washington, DC., 104 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States|U.S.]] Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the "round half up" tie-breaking rule.  For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1.  Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was "round half away from zero".

=== Negative zero in meteorology ===
{{main|Signed zero#Scientific uses}}

Some [[meteorology|meteorologist]]s may write "&amp;minus;0" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and &amp;minus;0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer.  This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the [[Celsius]] scale, where below zero indicates freezing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== byte values ===
Because digital information is stored in binary format, computer memory is usually produced in sizes which are a power of 2.  So a common size is 1024 bytes (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), and this can be referred to as 1 [[kilobyte]].  Similarly, {{formatnum:1048576}} (2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) can be referred to as 1 [[megabyte]].  This may or may not be considered rounding.  More information on the different representations is on the entry for [[kilobyte]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''sacred–profane dichotomy''' is an idea posited by [[France|French]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]], who considered it to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The elementary forms of Religious Life'', ed. and trans. by Karen E. Fields. (New York: The Free Press, 1995), p. 35.[http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mbaker/cshs503/durkheimreligiouslife.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or ''[[totems]]''. The [[profanum|profane]], on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the sacred–profane dichotomy was not equivalent to [[good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's claim of the universality of this dichotomy for all religions/[[cult]]s has been criticized by scholars such as British [[anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p35161/mobile/ch06s03.html|title=The sacred-profane distinction is not universal|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-10|work=}} quote: "neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja, ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane"&lt;/ref&gt; Goody also noted that "many societies have no words that translate as sacred or profane and that ultimately, just like the distinction between natural and supernatural, it was very much a product of [[European religious thought]] rather than a universally applicable criterion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tomoko Masuzawa explains in ''The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism'', this system of comparative religion privileged Christianity at the expense of non-Christian systems (2005). Any cosmology without a sacred/profane binary was rendered invisible by the field of religious studies, because the binary was supposed to be 'universal'.

'''Shakespeare's editors''' were essential in the development of the modern practice of producing printed books and the evolution of [[textual criticism]].

The 17th-century [[Folio (printing)|folio]] collections of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] did not have editors in the modern sense of the term. In the best understanding of contemporary consensus scholarship, the plays to be included in the [[First Folio]] ([[1623 in literature|1623]]) were gathered together or "compiled" by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], two long-time colleagues of Shakespeare in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]. The play manuscripts may have been [[proofreading|proofread]] and prepared for printing by [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or prompter of the company. The task of [[First Folio#First Folio Technique|proofreading and correcting]] the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the [[First Folio#Compositors|compositors]] and printers in the print-shop, yielding the uneven and often defective text that is the First Folio.

Even less is known about the creation of the [[Second Folio|Second]] ([[1632 in literature|1632]]), Third ([[1663 in literature|1663&amp;ndash;64]]), and Fourth Folios ([[1685 in literature|1685]]) than about the First; see [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)]].

In the 18th century, however, interested individuals made the first concerted efforts to bring order to the tangle of textual difficulties that the Folios of the previous century presented. The list below gives the date of each edition of Shakespeare's plays, the editor, the format of the collection, and pertinent specific information.

*[[1709 in literature|1709]], [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]; [[book size|octavo]], 6 volumes. Rowe was the first person to attempt a clean and fully comprehensible text of the plays; but he depended upon a copy of the Fourth Folio and made generally [[conjectural emendation]]s. He also added full stage directions (he was a playwright himself) and full lists of ''Dramatis personae'', and wrote the first biographical sketch of the poet. 
*[[1725 in literature|1725]], [[Alexander Pope]]; [[book size|quarto]], 6 volumes. Pope was the first to attempt a collation of the quarto texts of the plays, yet he produced what was basically a reprint of Rowe that added little of value.
*[[1733 in literature|1733]], [[Lewis Theobald]]; octavo, 7 volumes. Theobald has been called "the first Shakespeare scholar";&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; he carried forward the task of collating the quartos, and began the study of Shakespeare's sources and the order of the plays' composition. (See [[Chronology of William Shakespeare's plays|Chronology of Shakespeare's plays]].)
*[[1744 in literature|1744]], [[Thomas Hanmer (politician)|Thomas Hanmer]]; quarto, 6 volumes. Hanmer relied on Theobald's text, and made guesswork corrections. His edition was reprinted in [[1770 in literature|1770]].
*[[1747 in literature|1747]], [[William Warburton]]; octavo, 8 volumes. Warburton built upon Pope's edition; indeed, Warburton placed Pope's name before his own on the title pages of his edition. In his preface, Warburton wrote that his friend Pope "was desirous I should give a new Edition of this Poet, as he thought it might contribute to put a stop to a prevailing folly of altering the Text of celebrated Authors without Talents or Judgment. And he was willing that ''his'' Edition should be melted down into ''mine'', as it would, he said, afford him (so great is the modesty of an ingenuous temper) a fit opportunity of confessing his Mistakes." The phrase "without Talents or Judgment" refers to Theobold and Hanmer. However, Warburton did allow, rather begrudgingly, some corrections put forward by Theobold and Hanmer: "For the rest, all the Corrections which these two Editors have made on any ''reasonable'' Foundation, are here admitted into the Text; and carefully assigned to their respective Authors. A piece of Justice which the ''Oxford Editor'' never did; and which the ''Other'' was not always scrupulous in observing towards me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warburton|first1=William|title=The Works of Shakespear|date=1747|publisher=J. &amp; P. Knapton; S. Birt; T. Longman &amp; T. Shewell; and others|location=London|pages=title page, xix, &amp; xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[1748 in literature|1748]] Thomas Edwards published his ''Supplement to Warburton's Edition of Shakespeare'', in later editions called ''The Canons of Criticism'' &amp;mdash; a satirical but spot-on analysis of Warburton's editorial emendations, some of which are truly silly.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Thomas|title=The Canons of Criticism, and Glossary|date=1765|publisher=C. Bathurst|location=London|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Johnson had this to say: "Soon after Edwards's ''Canons of Criticism'' came out, Johnson was dining at Tonson the Bookseller's, with Hayman the Painter and some more company. Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that the conversation having turned upon Edwards's book, the gentlemen praised it much, and Johnson allowed its merit. But when they went farther, and appeared to put that authour upon a level with Warburton, "Nay, (said Johnson,) he has given him some smart hits to be sure; but there is no proportion between the two men; they must not be named together. A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and the other is a horse still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=James|editor1-last=Malone|editor1-first=Edmond|title=The Life of Samuel Johnson|date=1807|publisher=T. Cadell &amp; W. Davies|location=London|page=207, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1765 in literature|1765]], [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare]]''; octavo, 8 volumes. Johnson in turn relied upon Warburton; his edition is noteworthy mainly for its famous Preface.
*[[1768 in literature|1768]], [[Edward Capell]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Appalled by the undisciplined emendations of Hanmer and Warburton, Capell spent three decades collecting and collating the quartos. He was also the first to exploit the [[Stationers' Register]] and [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'', and to explore Shakespeare's use of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'' and Sir [[Thomas North]]'s translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]].''
*[[1773 in literature|1773]], [[George Steevens]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Steevens employed Johnson's text, but continued Capell's trend of adding new material. Steevens revised and re-issued his edition in [[1778 in literature|1778]]; in [[1780 in literature|1780]] Edmond Malone added another 2 volumes that contained Shakespeare's non-dramatic poems and other material. [[Isaac Reed]] revised the Steevens edition again in 1785, and Steevens himself produced one final, 15-volume revision in [[1793 in literature|1793]].
*[[1790 in literature|1790]], [[Edmond Malone]]; octavo, 10 volumes. Malone, often considered the best of the century's editors of Shakespeare, wrote the first general consideration of [[English Renaissance theatre]], utilizing resources like the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] and [[Edward Alleyn]]'s papers at [[Dulwich College]].  He is also noted for his work on the problem of chronology.

The early 19th century saw the first [[Variorum]] editions of Shakespeare's works, editions that collated and synthesized the efforts of the editors of the previous century:

*[[1803 in literature|1803]], the First Variorum edition, edited by [[Isaac Reed]]; 21 volumes.
*[[1813 in literature|1813]], the Second Variorum, a reprint of the First; 21 volumes.
*[[1821 in literature|1821]], the Third Variorum, edited by James Boswell;&lt;ref&gt;Not the famous [[James Boswell|Boswell]], the biographer of Johnson, but rather his third son (1778&amp;ndash;1822): Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells: ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare.'' OUP 2001. pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; 21 volumes.

These massive editions laid the foundation for modern textual scholarship on Shakespeare's works, and by extension on works of literature in general. In the 19th century the text, drawn primarily from Malone and Steevens, was "monumentalized"{{sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}} in the Cambridge edition (1863-6) and its single-volume companion, the Globe edition (1864). It was followed by the New Cambridge edition in 1921, and all modern standard editions inherit primarily from this edition.{{Sfn|de Grazia|1991|p=14}}

As for the personalities involved: some of these men were friends, like Steevens, Reed, and Malone; acquaintances called them the Shakespeare Gang. Others nourished spirits of competitiveness and resentment. Pope made Theobald the first hero of ''[[The Dunciad]].'' Warburton belittled Rowe's "Account of the Life" of Shakespeare &amp;mdash; but he reprinted it in his own edition, without change or improvement. Despite his friendship with Malone and Reed, Steevens was famous for his irascibility; in notes to his 1793 edition of Shakespeare, he concocted obscene interpretations of some passages and attributed those readings to people he didn't like.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 30, 110, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major edition, the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863&amp;ndash;66), moved away from the practice of a single editor following his own sometimes capricious instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by [[William George Clark]] and John Glover, and the subsequent eight volumes by Clark and [[William Aldis Wright]]. Clark and Wright also produced the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts; together, these became the standard for the remainder of the century.

The most radical edition in the twentieth century was the [[Oxford Shakespeare]], prepared under the general editorship of [[Stanley Wells]] and [[Gary Taylor (English literature scholar)|Gary Taylor]]. It aims to present the texts as they were originally performed, which results in numerous controversial choices, including presenting multiple texts of ''[[King Lear]]'', a text of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in which the scenes presumably cut by Shakespeare are relegated to an appendix, and an emphasis on the collaborative nature of several of the plays.

'''Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] Marine Education &amp; Recreation Centre''' (MERC) is a not for profit charity (Registration Number CC29903) based in [[Long Bay, New Zealand|Long Bay]], [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. MERC offers marine-based [[environmental education]] and outdoor recreational experiences to schools, not-for-profit organisations, and business and corporate groups. 

MERC can accommodate up to 85 people at any time for overnight stays and activities, and up to a total of 120 people per day. A day programme consists of 3 activities on the day and instruction is given between 9am and 4pm. There is scope to organise short duration, single day and multi-day courses, and these are specifically developed to meet the needs of each group. MERCs facilities have separate teacher/leader accommodation, multi-purpose hall, wheelchair access and large kitchen &amp; dining facilities.

The Centre's mission statement is ''to provide life-changing marine environmental education and outdoor experiences for young New Zealanders.''

==History==
The Centre has been in operation since 1990. A group of local yachtsmen and teachers (Don St.Clair Brown, Don Burfoot, Laurie Baxter, Ian Sage, Dr. Ross Garrett and John Orams, responded to the vision of fellow yachtsman Dr. David Gray, that a centre be built on the present site which was designated “Conditional Use Reserve” land belonging to Takapuna City Council. In 1980 this site was littered with building debris, scraps of machinery and foundations of early buildings. These basic amenities had serviced the large Long Bay camping population as well as local holiday residents in their numerous beaches. There was a store with petrol pumps – started by Tom Vaughan about 1920 but taken over by Mr and Mrs Aston and demolished about 1950 (?), a butchery owned by Mr Lopes which later became a private beach, a holiday house built above the sea wall (1956) still tenanted in 1989.

'''Soil respiration''' refers to the production of [[carbon dioxide]] when [[soil organism]]s respire. This includes respiration of [[plant root]]s, the [[rhizosphere]], [[microbe]]s and [[fauna]].

Soil respiration is a key [[ecosystem]] process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is acquired from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When [[plant respiration]] occurs below-ground in the roots, it adds to soil respiration. Over time, plant structural components are consumed by [[heterotroph]]s. This heterotrophic consumption releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and when this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered soil respiration.

The amount of soil respiration that occurs in an ecosystem is controlled by several factors. The temperature, moisture, [[soil nutrient|nutrient]] content and level of oxygen in the soil can produce extremely disparate rates of respiration. These rates of respiration can be measured in a variety of methods. Other methods can be used to separate the source components, in this case the type of photosynthetic pathway ([[C3 pathway|C3]]/[[C4 pathway|C4]]), of the respired plant structures.

Soil respiration rates can be largely affected by human activity. This is because humans have the ability to and have been changing the various controlling factors of soil respiration for numerous years. Global [[climate change]] is composed of numerous changing factors including rising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. All of these factors can affect the rate of global soil respiration. Increased [[nitrate|nitrogen]] [[fertilizer|fertilization]] by humans also has the potential to affect rates over the entire Earth.

Soil respiration and its rate across ecosystems is extremely important to understand. This is because soil respiration plays a large role in global [[carbon cycling]] as well as other [[nutrient cycle]]s. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive feedbacks with global climate change. Positive feedbacks are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be affected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.

==Sources of carbon dioxide in soil==
[[File:SRS1000 being used to measure soil respiration in the field..jpg|thumb|A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux]]
All cellular respiration releases energy, water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from organic compounds. Any respiration that occurs below-ground is considered soil respiration. Respiration by plant roots, bacteria, fungi and soil animals all release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soils, as described below.

===Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle===
The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle – or [[citric acid cycle]] – is an important step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be [[oxidized]].&lt;ref name="berg2002"&gt;Berg J, Tymoczko J, Stryer L. (2002). Biochemistry. WH Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; This oxidation produces the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs at its most basic level. Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as aerobic respiration.

===Fermentation===
[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] is another process in which cells gain energy from organic compounds. In this metabolic pathway, energy is derived from the carbon compound without the use of oxygen. The products of this reaction are carbon dioxide and usually either ethyl alcohol or lactic acid.&lt;ref name="klein2005"&gt;Klein D, Prescott L, Harley J. (2005). Microbiology. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of oxygen, this pathway is described as [[anaerobic respiration]]. This is an important source of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soil respiration in waterlogged  ecosystems where oxygen is scarce, as in [[peat bog]]s and [[wetland]]s. However, most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  released from the soil occurs via respiration and one of the most important aspects of belowground respiration occurs in the plant roots.

===Root respiration===
Plants respire some of the carbon compounds which were generated by photosynthesis. When this respiration occurs in roots, it adds to soil respiration. Root respiration usually accounts for approximately half of all soil respiration. However, these values can range from 10–90% depending on the dominate plant types in an ecosystem and conditions under which the plants are subjected. Thus the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced through root respiration is determined by the root biomass and specific root respiration rates.&lt;ref name="shibistova2002"&gt;Shibistova O, Lloyd J, Evgrafova S, Savushkina N, Zrazhevskaya G, Arneth A, Knohl A, Kolle O. (2002) Seasonal and spatial variability in soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; efflux rates for a central Siberian Pinus sylvestris forest. Tellus 54B, 552-567.&lt;/ref&gt; Directly next to the root is the area known as the rhizosphere, which also plays an important role in soil respiration.

===Rhizosphere respiration===
The [[rhizosphere]] is a zone immediately next to the root surface with its neighboring soil. In this zone there is a close interaction between the plant and microorganisms. Roots continuously release substances, or [[exudate]]s, into the soil. These exudates include sugars, amino acids, vitamins, long chain carbohydrates, enzymes and [[lysate]]s which are released when roots cells break. The amount of carbon lost as exudates varies considerably between plant species. It has been demonstrated that up to 20% of carbon acquired by photosynthesis is released into the soil as root exudates.&lt;ref name="hutsch2002"&gt;Hutsch B, Augustin J, Merbach W. (2002) Plant rhizodeposition – an important source for carbon turnover in soils. Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science. 165, 4, 397-407.&lt;/ref&gt; These exudates are [[decomposition|decomposed]] primarily by bacteria. These bacteria will respire the carbon compounds through the TCA cycle; however, fermentation is also present. This is due to the lack of oxygen due to greater oxygen consumption by the root as compared to the bulk soil, soil at a greater distance from the root.&lt;ref name="vance2001"&gt;Vance E, Chapin III F. (2001) Substrate limitations to microbial activity in [[taiga]] forest floors. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 33, 2, 173-188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another important organism in the rhizosphere are root-infecting fungi or [[mycorrhizae]]. These fungi increase the surface area of the plant root and allow the root to encounter and acquire a greater amount of soil nutrients necessary for plant growth. In return for this benefit, the plant will transfer sugars to the fungi. The fungi will respire these sugars for energy thereby increasing soil respiration.&lt;ref name="harrison2005"&gt;Harrison M. (2005) Peace Talks and Trade Deals. Keys to Long-Term Harmony in Legume-Microbe Symbioses. Plant Physiology. 137, 4, 1205-1210.&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi, along with bacteria and soil animals, also play a large role in the decomposition of [[Plant litter|litter]] and soil organic matter.

===Soil animals===
Soil animals graze on populations of bacteria and fungi as well as ingest and break up litter to increase soil respiration. [[Microfauna]] are made up of the smallest soil animals. These include [[nematode]]s and [[mites]]. This group specializes on soil bacteria and fungi. By ingesting these organisms, carbon that was initially in plant organic compounds and  was incorporated into bacterial and fungal structures will now be respired by the soil animal. [[Mesofauna]] are soil animals from {{convert|0.1|to|2|mm|in|sp=us}} in length and will ingest soil litter. The fecal material will hold a greater amount of moisture and have a greater surface area. This will allow for new attack by microorganisms and a greater amount of soil respiration. Macrofauna are organisms from {{convert|2|to|20|mm|in|sp=us}}, such as earthworms and termites. Most macrofauna fragment litter, thereby exposing a greater amount of area to microbial attack. Other macrofauna burrow or ingest litter, reducing soil bulk density, breaking up soil aggregates and increasing soil aeration and the infiltration of water.&lt;ref name="chapin2002"&gt;Chapin III F, Matson P, Mooney H. (2002) Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of soil respiration==
Regulation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  production in soil is due to various abiotic, or non-living, factors. Temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen all contribute to the rate of respiration in soil.

===Temperature===
[[File:Graph showing soil respiration increasing with temperature.jpg|thumb|right|Graph showing soil respiration vs. soil temperature]]
Temperature affects almost all aspects of respiration processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the respiration rate is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius, root respiration begins to shut down completely.&lt;ref name="atkin2000"&gt;Atkin O, Edwards E, Loveys B. (2000) Response of root respiration to changes in temperature and its relevance to global warming. New Phytologist. 147, 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; [[cryophile]]s, [[mesophile]]s and [[thermophile]]s. Cryophiles function optimally at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius and thermophiles function optimally at over 40 degrees Celsius. In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions so respiration may occur over a very broad range.&lt;ref name="mikan2002"&gt;Mikan C, Schimel J, Doyle A. (2002) Temperature controls of microbial respiration in Arctic tundra soils above and below freezing. Soil Biology and Biochemistry. 34, 1785-1795.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature increases lead to greater rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, this is the same pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels.

===Soil moisture===
[[Soil moisture]] is another important factor influencing soil respiration. Soil respiration is low in dry conditions and increases to a maximum  at intermediate moisture levels until it begins to decrease when moisture content excludes oxygen. This allows anaerobic conditions to prevail and depress aerobic microbial activity. Studies have shown that soil moisture only limits respiration at the lowest and highest conditions with a large plateau existing at intermediate soil moisture levels for most ecosystems.&lt;ref name="xu2004"&gt;Xu L, Baldocchi D, Tang J. (2004) How soil moisture, rain pulses, and growth alter the response of ecosystem respiration and temperature. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many microorganisms possess strategies for growth and survival under low soil moisture conditions. Under high soil moisture conditions, many bacteria take in too much water causing their cell membrane to lyse, or break. This can decrease the rate of soil respiration temporarily, but the lysis of bacteria causes for a spike in resources for many other bacteria. This rapid increase in available labile substrates causes short-term enhanced soil respiration. Root respiration will increase with increasing soil moisture, especially in dry ecosystems; however, individual species root respiration response to soil moisture will vary widely from species to species depending on life history traits. Upper levels of soil moisture will depress root respiration with the exception of wetland plants, which have developed specific mechanisms for root aeration.&lt;ref name="lambers1998"&gt;Lambers H, Chapin III F, Pons T. (1998) Plant physiological ecology. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Soil moisture levels regulate root respiration, which is essential for nitrogen uptake.

===Nitrogen===
[[Nitrogen]] directly affects soil respiration in several ways. Nitrogen must be taken in by roots in order to promote plant growth and life. Most available nitrogen is in the form of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which costs 0.4 units of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to enter the root because energy must be used to move it up a concentration gradient. Once inside the root the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; must be reduced to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This step requires more energy, which equals 2 units of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per molecule reduced. In plants with bacterial symbionts, which fix atmospheric nitrogen, the energetic cost to the plant to acquire one molecule of  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  from atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 2.36 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Pate J, Layzell D. (1990) Energetics and biological costs of nitrogen assimilation. The biochemistry of plants. 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that plants uptake nitrogen from the soil or rely on symbionts to fix it from the atmosphere in order to assure growth, [[plant reproduction|reproduction]] and long-term survival.

Another way nitrogen affects soil respiration is through litter [[decomposition]]. High nitrogen litter is considered high quality and is more readily decomposed by microorganisms than low quality litter. Degradation of [[cellulose]], a tough plant structural compound, is also a nitrogen limited process and will increase with the addition of nitrogen to litter.&lt;ref name="sinsabaugh2002"&gt;Sinsabaugh R, Carreiro M, Repert D. (2002) Allocation of extracellular enzymatic activity in relation to litter composition, N deposition, and mass loss. Biogeochemistry. 60, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of measurement==

Different methods exist for the measurement of soil respiration rate and the determination of sources.  The most common methods include: The use of long-term stand alone soil flux systems for measurement at one location at different times; survey soil respiration systems for measurement of different locations and at different times; and the use of stable isotope ratios.

===Long-term stand-alone soil flux systems for measurement at one location over time===
[[File:Automated CO2 Exchange system (ACE from ADC BioScientific Ltd) measuring soil respiration..JPG|thumb|An automated soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange system]]

These systems measure at one location over long periods of time. Since they only measure at one location, it is common to use multiple stations to reduce measuring error caused by soil variability over small distances. Soil variability may be tested with survey soil respiration instruments.

The long-term instruments are designed to expose the measuring site to ambient conditions as much as is possible between measurements.

Types of long-term stand-alone instruments:

*Closed mode systems, by definition, are closed without a vent. When making measurements, closed systems take a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurement of ambient air just after the soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals over the next few minutes until a final CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, it is important that the experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure buildup from being a significant issue.

Both individual assay information and diurnal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respiration measuring information is accessible. It is also common for such systems to also measure soil temperature, soil moisture and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). These variables are normally recorded in the measuring file along with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values.

For determination of soil respiration and the slope of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase, researchers have used linear regression analysis, the Pedersen (2001) algorithm, and exponential regression. There are more published references for linear regression analysis; however, the Pedersen algorithm and exponential regression analysis methods also have their following. Some systems offer a choice of mathematical methods.
&lt;ref name="wayson2006"&gt;Wayson C, Randolph J, Hanson P, Grimmond P, Schmid H. (2006) Comparison of soil respiration methods in a mid-latitude deciduous forest. Biogeochemistry. 80, 173-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using [[linear regression]], multiple data points are graphed and the points can be fitted with a linear regression equation, which will provide a slope. This slope can provide the rate of soil respiration with the equation &lt;math&gt;F=bV/A&lt;/math&gt;, where ''F'' is the rate of soil respiration, ''b'' is the slope, ''V'' is the volume of the chamber and ''A'' is the surface area of the soil covered by the chamber.&lt;ref name="field1989"&gt;Field C, Ball J, Berry J. (1989) Photosynthesis, Principles and field techniques. Plant physiological ecology, field methods and instrumentation. Chapman and Hall, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the measurement is not allowed to run over a longer period of time as the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the chamber will also increase the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the porous top layer of the soil profile. This increase in concentration will cause an underestimation of soil respiration rate due to the additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being stored within the soil.&lt;ref name="conen2000"&gt;Conen F, and Smith K. (2000) An explanation of linear increases in gas concentration under closed chambers used to measure gas exchange between soil and the atmosphere. European Journal of Soil Science. 51, 111-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Open mode systems, are designed to find soil flux rates when measuring chamber equilibrium has been reached. Air flows through the chamber before the chamber is closed and sealed. This purges any non-ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels from the chamber before measurement. After the chamber is closed, fresh air is pumped into the chamber at a controlled and programmable flow rate. This mixes with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the soil, and after a time, equilibrium is reached. The researcher specifies the equilibrium point as the difference in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements between successive readings, in an elapsed time. During the assay, the rate of change slowly reduces until it meets the customer's rate of change criteria, or the maximum selected time for the assay.  Soil flux or rate of change is then determined once equilibrium conditions are reached within the chamber. Chamber flow rates and times are programmable, accurately measured, and used in calculations. These systems have vents that are designed to prevent a possible unacceptable buildup of partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure discussed under closed mode systems. Since the air movement inside the chamber might cause increased chamber pressure, or external winds may produce reduced chamber pressure, a vent is provided that is designed to be as wind proof as possible.
 
Open systems are also not as sensitive to soil structure variation, or to boundary layer resistance issues at the soil surface. Air flow in the chamber at the soil surface, is designed to minimize boundary layer resistance phenomenon.

* A hybrid system also exists. It has a vent that is designed to be as wind proof as possible, and prevent possible unacceptable partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure buildup, but is designed to operate like a closed mode design system in other regards.

===Survey soil respiration systems – for testing the variation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respiration at different locations and at different times.===

[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring spatial variability of soil respiration in the field]]
These are either open or closed mode instruments that are portable or semi-portable. They measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; soil respiration variability at different locations and at different times. With this type of instrument, soil collars that can be connected to the survey measuring instrument are inserted into the ground and the soil is allowed to stabilize for a period of time. The insertion of the soil collar temporarily disturbs the soil, creating measuring artifacts. For this reason, it is common to have several soil collar inserted at different locations. Soil collars are inserted far enough to limit lateral diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  After soil stabilization, the researcher then moves from one collar to another according to experimental design to measure soil respiration.

Survey soil respiration systems can also be used to determine the number of long-term stand-alone temporal instruments that are required to achieve an acceptable level of error. Different locations may require different numbers of long-term stand-alone units due to greater or lesser soil respiration variability.

===Isotope methods===
Plants acquire CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and produce organic compounds with the use of one of three photosynthetic pathways. The two most prevalent pathways are the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; processes. C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants are best adapted to cool and wet conditions while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants do well in hot and dry ecosystems. Due to the different photosynthetic enzymes between the two pathways, different [[carbon isotope]]s are acquired preferentially. [[Isotope]]s are the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, thereby making one isotope heavier than the other. The two stable carbon isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C. The C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; pathway will discriminate against the heavier isotope more than the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pathway. This will make the plant structures produced from C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants more enriched in the heavier isotope and therefore root exudates and litter from these plants will also be more enriched. When the carbon in these structures is respired, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will show a similar ratio of the two isotopes. Researchers will grow a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plant on soil that was previously occupied by a C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant or vice versa. By taking soil respiration measurements and analyzing the isotopic ratios of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it can be determined whether the soil respiration is mostly old versus recently formed carbon. For example, maize, a C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plant, was grown on soil where spring wheat, a C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant, was previously grown. The results showed respiration of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SOM in the first 40 days, with a gradual linear increase in heavy isotope enrichment until day 70. The days after 70 showed a slowing enrichment to a peak at day 100.&lt;ref name="rochette1999"&gt;Rochette P, Flanagan L, Gregorich E. (1999) Separating soil respiration into plant and soil components using analysis of natural abundance of carbon-13. Soil Science Society of America Journal. 63, 1207-1213.&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing stable carbon isotope data it is possible to determine the source components of respired SOM that was produced by different photosynthetic pathways.

==Responses to human disturbance==

Throughout the past 160 years, humans have changed [[land use]] and industrial practices, which have altered the climate and global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s. These changes have affected the rate of soil respiration around the planet.

===Elevated carbon dioxide===
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], humans have been emitting vast amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere. These emissions have increased exponentially over time and have increased global atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels to their highest in over 750,000 years. Soil respiration increases when ecosystems are exposed to elevated levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Numerous free air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) studies have been conducted to test soil respiration under predicted future elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions. Recent FACE studies have shown large increases in soil respiration due to increased root biomass and microbial activity.&lt;ref name="lipson2005"&gt;Lipson D, Wilson R, [[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel W]]. (2005) Effects of Elevated Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Soil Microbial Biomass, Activity, and Diversity in a Chaparral Ecosystem. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 71, 12, 8573–8580&lt;/ref&gt; Soil respiration has been found to increase up to 40.6% in a sweetgum forest in Tennessee and poplar forests in Wisconsin under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions.&lt;ref name="king2004"&gt;King J, Hanson P, Bernhardt E, Deangelis P, Norby R, Pregitzer K. (2004) A multiyear synthesis of soil respiration responses to elevated atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from four forest FACE experiments. Global Change Biology. 10, 1027-1042.&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely likely that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels will exceed those used in these FACE experiments by the middle of this century due to increased human use of fossil fuels and land use practices.

===Climate warming===
Due to the increase in temperature of the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as [[forest clearing]], soil denuding, developments that destroy [[autotrophic]] processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased [[turbidity]] of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover. 
As mentioned earlier, temperature greatly affects the rate of soil respiration. This may have the most drastic influence in the Arctic. Large stores of carbon are locked in the frozen [[permafrost]]. With an increase in temperature, this permafrost is melting and aerobic conditions are beginning to prevail, thereby greatly increasing the rate of respiration in that ecosystem.&lt;ref name="oechel1995"&gt;[[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel W]], Vourlitis G, Hastings S. (1995) Change in Arctic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux over two decades, Effects of climate change at Barrow, Alaska. Ecological Applications. 5, 3, 846-855.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in precipitation===
Due to the shifting patterns of temperature and changing oceanic conditions, precipitation patterns are expected to change in location, frequency and intensity. Larger and more frequent storms are expected when oceans can transfer more energy to the forming storm systems. This may have the greatest impact on [[xeric]], or arid, ecosystems. It has been shown that soil respiration in arid ecosystems shows dynamic changes within a [[raining cycle]]. The rate of respiration in dry soil usually bursts to a very high level after rainfall and then gradually decreases as the soil dries.&lt;ref name="xu2004"/&gt; With an increase in rainfall frequency and intensity over area without previous extensive rainfall, a dramatic increase in soil respiration can be inferred.

===Nitrogen fertilization===
Since the onset of the [[Green Revolution]] in the middle of the last century, vast amounts of nitrogen fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven [[fertilization]]. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass.&lt;ref name="lutze2000"&gt;Lutze J, Gifford R, Adams H. (2000) Litter quality and decomposition in Danthonia richardsonii swards in response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this increase in productivity, an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured.

==Importance==
Soil respiration plays a significant role in the global carbon and nutrient cycles as well as being a driver for changes in climate. These roles are important to our understanding of the natural world and our own well being.

===Global carbon cycling===
Soil respiration plays a critical role in the regulation of [[carbon cycling]] at the ecosystem and global scales. Each year approximately 120 [[petagram]]s (Pg) of carbon are taken up by land plants and a similar amount is released to the atmosphere through ecosystem  respiration. The global soils contain up to 3150 Pg of carbon, of which 450 Pg exist in wetlands and 400 Pg in permanently frozen soils. The soils contain more than four times the carbon as the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="sabine2003"&gt;Sabine C, Hemann M, Artaxo P, Bakker D, Chen C, Field C, Gruber N, Le Quere C, Prinn R, Richey J, Romero-Lankao P, Sathaye J, Valentini R. (2003) Current status and past trends of the carbon cycle. Toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Stabilization: Issues, strategies, and consequences. Island Press. Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have estimated that soil respiration accounts for 77 Pg of carbon released to the atmosphere each year.&lt;ref name="raich1995"&gt;Raich J, and Potter C. (1995) Global patterns of carbon dioxide emissions from soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 9, 23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; This level of release is one order of magnitude greater than the carbon release due to [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] sources (6 Pg per year) such as [[fossil fuel]] burning. Thus, a small change in soil respiration can seriously alter the balance of atmosphere CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration versus soil carbon stores. Much like soil respiration can play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, it can also regulate global nutrient cycling.

===Nutrient cycling===
A major component of soil respiration is from the decomposition of litter which releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the environment while simultaneously immobilizing or [[mineralizing]] nutrients. During decomposition, nutrients, such as nitrogen, are immobilized by microbes for their own growth. As these microbes are ingested or die, nitrogen is added to the soil. Nitrogen is also mineralized from the degradation of proteins and nucleic acids in litter. This mineralized nitrogen is also added to the soil. Due to these processes, the rate of nitrogen added to the soil is coupled with rates of microbial respiration. Studies have shown that rates of soil respiration were associated with rates of microbial turnover and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="vance2001"/&gt; Alterations of the global cycles can further act to change the climate of the planet.

===Climate change===
As stated earlier, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released by soil respiration is a [[greenhouse gas]] that will continue to trap energy and increase the global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This is an example of a positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration.&lt;ref name="friedlingstein2003"&gt;Friedlingstein P, Dufresne J, Cox P. (2003) How positive is the feedback between climate change and the global carbon cycle? Tellus. 55B, 692-700.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of this century.&lt;ref name="cox2000"&gt;Cox P, Betts R, Jones C, Spall S, Totterdell I. (2000) Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model. Nature. 408, 184-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Soil respiration is a key ecosystem process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon is stored in the soil as organic matter and is respired by plants, bacteria, fungi and animals. When this respiration occurs belowground, it is considered soil respiration. Temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen all regulate the rate of this conversion from carbon in soil organic compounds to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Many methods are used to measure soil respiration; however, the closed dynamic chamber and utilization of stable isotope ratios are two of the most prevalent techniques. Humans have altered atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  levels, precipitation patterns and fertilization rates, all of which have had a significant role on soil respiration rates. The changes in these rates can alter the global carbon and nutrient cycles as well as play a significant role in climate change.

A '''suspension bridge''' is a type of [[bridge]] in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension [[Wire rope|cables]] on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo – Architect, Philosopher and Iron Chain Bridge Builder] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf |date=25 May 2014 }} by Manfred Gerner. Thimphu: Center for Bhutan Studies 2007. {{ISBN|99936-14-39-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lhasaanditsmyst00waddgoog#page/n476/mode/2up Lhasa and Its Mysteries] by Lawrence Austine Waddell, 1905, p.313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simple suspension bridge]]s, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.

This type of bridge has cables suspended between [[tower]]s, plus vertical ''suspender cables'' that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other [[suspension bridge types]], this type often is constructed without [[falsework]].

The suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or [[canyon]] edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or may use a truss bridge to make this connection. In the latter case there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.

==History==
 [[File:Manhattan_Bridge_2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manhattan Bridge]], connecting [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] in New York City, opened in 1909 and is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges; its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world.]]
{{For|bridges where the deck follows the suspenders|simple suspension bridge}}
The earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a [[catenary arch|catenary]] shape.

===Precursor===
The [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] saint and bridge-builder [[Thangtong Gyalpo]] originated the use of [[wrought iron|iron]] chains in his version of [[simple suspension bridge]]s. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern [[Bhutan]]. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in [[Duksum]] en route to [[Trashi Yangtse]], which was finally washed away in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Thangtong+Gyalpo+suspension+bridge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-74059-529-2|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyalpo's iron chain bridges did not include a [[suspended deck bridge]] which is the standard on  all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The [[stress (mechanics)|stress points]] that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo|publisher=Centre for Bhutan Studies|page=61|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have also used tightly bound cloth.

===Chain bridges===
The first iron chain suspension bridge in the [[Western world]] was the [[Jacob's Creek Bridge]] (1801) in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], designed by inventor [[James Finley (engineer)|James Finley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Wire of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge|publisher=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430064802/http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finley's bridge was the first to incorporate all of the necessary components of a modern suspension bridge, including a suspended deck which hung by trusses.

An interesting variation is [[Thornewill and Warham]]'s [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge]] in [[Burton-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]] (1889), where the chains are not attached to abutments as is usual, but instead are attached to the main girders, which are thus in compression.  Here, the chains are made from flat wrought iron plates, eight inches (203 mm) wide by an inch and a half (38 mm) thick, rivetted together.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ice.org.uk/disciplines-and-resources/ice-library-and-digital-resources/historical-engineering-works/details?hewID=2746#details {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235610/https://www.ice.org.uk/disciplines-and-resources/ice-library-and-digital-resources/historical-engineering-works/details?hewID=2746 |date=25 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wire-cable===
The first wire-cable suspension bridge was the [[Spider Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill]] (1816), a modest and temporary footbridge built following the collapse of James Finley's nearby [[Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill]] (1808). The footbridge's span was 124 m, although its deck was only 0.45 m wide.

Development of wire-cable suspension bridges dates to the temporary simple suspension bridge at [[Annonay]] built by [[Marc Seguin]] and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m.&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt; The first permanent wire cable suspension bridge was [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]]'s Saint Antoine Bridge in [[Geneva]] of 1823, with two 40 m spans.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book

In the United States, the first major wire-cable suspension bridge was the [[Spring Garden Street Bridge#2nd bridge: Wire Bridge at Fairmount|Wire Bridge at Fairmount]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by [[Charles Ellet, Jr.]] and completed in 1842, it had a span of 109 m. Ellet's [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]] (1847–48) was abandoned before completion. It was used as [[scaffolding]] for [[John A. Roebling]]'s [[Bridge#Double-decker bridge|double decker]] railroad and carriage bridge (1855).

The [[Otto Beit Bridge]] (1938–39) was the first modern suspension bridge outside the United States built with parallel wire cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandbridge.com/Gallery%20Historic.htm Cleveland Bridge Company (UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720172523/http://www.clevelandbridge.com/Gallery%20Historic.htm |date=20 July 2008 }} Web site Retrieved 21 February 2007, includes image of the bridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural behavior==
===Structural analysis=== &lt;!-- Please see the article discussion if you think terms parabola and catenary should be swapped  --&gt;
The main [[force (physics)|force]]s in a suspension bridge of any type are [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] in the cables and [[compression (physical)|compression]] in the pillars. Since almost all the force on the pillars is vertically downwards and they are also stabilized by the main cables, the [[Column|pillars]] can be made quite slender, as on the [[Severn Bridge]], on the Wales-England border.

{{wide image|Severn bridge-panoramic.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|The slender lines of the [[Severn Bridge]]}}

In a suspended deck bridge, cables suspended via towers hold up the road deck. The weight is transferred by the cables to the towers, which in turn transfer the weight to the ground.

[[File:Comparison catenary parabola.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Comparison of a catenary (black dotted curve) and a parabola (red solid curve) with the same span and sag. 
{{hidden top|title=More details}}
The catenary represents the profile of a simple suspension bridge, or the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its deck and hangers have negligible mass compared to its cable. The parabola represents the profile of the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its cable and hangers have negligible mass compared to its deck. The profile of the cable of a real suspension bridge with the same span and sag lies between the two curves.
{{hidden bottom}}
]]

Assuming a negligible weight as compared to the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form a [[parabola]] (very similar to a [[catenary]], the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, this makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a [[cable-stayed bridge]], where the deck is in compression.

===Advantages===
[[File:Suspension bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A suspension bridge can be made out of simple materials such as wood and common wire rope.]]

*Longer main spans are achievable than with any other type of bridge
*Less material may be required than other bridge types, even at spans they can achieve, leading to a reduced construction cost
*Except for installation of the initial temporary cables, little or no access from below is required during construction, for example allowing a waterway to remain open while the bridge is built above
*May be better able to withstand earthquake movements than heavier and more rigid bridges
*Bridge decks can have deck sections replaced in order to widen traffic lanes for larger vehicles or add additions width for separated cycling/pedestrian paths.

===Disadvantages===
*Considerable stiffness or aerodynamic profiling may be required to prevent the bridge deck vibrating under high winds
*The relatively low deck stiffness compared to other (non-suspension) types of bridges makes it more difficult to carry [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] traffic where high concentrated [[Structural load#Types of loads|live loads]] occur
*Some access below may be required during construction, to lift the initial cables or to lift deck units. This access can often be avoided in [[cable-stayed bridge]] construction

==Variations==
===Underspanned===

[[File:Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Yichang Bridge]], a plate deck suspension bridge, over the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]
In an underspanned suspension bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]];&lt;ref name="Peters"/&gt; James Smith's Micklewood Bridge;&lt;ref name="Drewry"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Memoir of Suspension Bridges: Comprising The History Of Their Origin And Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |last=Drewry |first=Charles Stewart |year=1832 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman |location=London |accessdate=13 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213647/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |archivedate=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposal by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] for a bridge over the River Almond near [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Drewry"/&gt;

[[Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct]] (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables.
The timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.

===Suspension cable types===
The main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or [[eyebar]] can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] over the [[Ohio River]].) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.

===Deck structure types===
Most suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]] bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow [[box girders]], first seen on the [[Severn bridge]] built 1961-6. In the picture of the [[Yichang Bridge]], note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.

== Forces ==
Three kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.

===Use other than road and rail===
[[File:Cable-suspended footbridge at DFW terminal D.JPG|left|thumb|Cable-suspended footbridge at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Fort Worth Airport]] Terminal D]]
The principles of suspension used on the large scale may also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the [[Nescio Bridge]] in the Netherlands.

Where such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct special towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a [[tubular bridge]].

Typical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction on the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) up to as long as a decade (the Akashi-Kaikyō Bridge's construction began in May 1986 and was opened in May 1998 – a total of twelve years).
#Where the towers are founded on underwater piers, [[Caisson (engineering)|''caissons'']] are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the [[bedrock]] is too deep to be exposed by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an [[active fault]], and this has been implemented on the foundations of the [[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] [[Rio-Antirio bridge]].) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.
#Where the towers are founded on dry land, deep foundation excavation or pilings are used.
#From the tower foundation, towers of single or multiple columns are erected using high-strength reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction due to the high cost of steel.
#Large devices called ''saddles'', which will carry the main suspension cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, they can also be manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main cables to shift under construction and normal loads.
#''Anchorages'' are constructed, usually in tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually anchored in good quality rock, but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open ''eyebolts'' enclosed within a secure space.
#Temporary suspended walkways, called ''catwalks'', are then erected using a set of guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These catwalks follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a [[catenary]] arc. Typical catwalks are usually between eight and ten feet wide, and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.
#Gantries are placed upon the catwalks, which will support the main cable spinning reels. Then,  cables attached to winches are installed, and in turn, the main cable spinning devices are installed.
#High strength wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge galvanized steel wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed over an open anchor [[eyebar]]. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a "cable strand" is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, the shape of the main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.
#At specific points along the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally in relation to the next) devices called "cable bands" are installed to carry steel wire ropes called ''Suspender cables.'' Each suspender cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the suspender cables may be applied only to the central span. Early suspender cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern suspender cables carry a shackle-type fitting.
#Special lifting hoists attached to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means.  Otherwise, a traveling [[cantilever]] derrick may be used to extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force in the center of the span. Upon completion of the deck the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a [[parabola]], while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended – usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.
#With completion of the primary structure various details such as lighting, handrails, finish painting and paving are installed or completed.

Morris compares the human inhabitants of a city to the animal inhabitants of a [[zoo]], which have their survival needs provided for, but at the cost of living in an unnatural environment. Humans in their cities, and animals in their zoos, both have food and shelter provided for them, and have considerable [[free time]] on their hands. But they have to live in an unnatural environment, and are both likely to have problems in developing healthy [[Interpersonal relationship|social relationships]], both are liable to suffer from [[Solitude|isolation]] and [[boredom]], and both live in a limited amount of physical space. The book explains how the inhabitants of cities and zoos have invented ways to deal with these problems, and the consequences that follow when they fail at dealing with them.

From this point of view, Morris examines why civilized society is the way it is. He offers explanations of the best and the worst features of civilized society. He examines the magnificent achievements of civilized society, the sublime explorations that make up science and the humanities, as well as the horrible behaviors of this same society such as war, [[slavery]], and [[rape]]. This book, and Morris's earlier book ''The Naked Ape'', are two of the early works in the field of [[sociobiology]], which have both contributed much to contemporary understandings of society.

'''Vermicompost''' ('''vermi-compost''', '''vermiculture''') is the product of the [[composting]] process using various species of [[worm]]s, usually [[Eisenia foetida|red wigglers]], [[Enchytraeus buchholzi|white worms]], and other [[earthworm]]s, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast. 

Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm humus, worm manure, or worm feces) is the end-product of the breakdown of [[organic matter]] by earthworms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwoodsforestgardens.blogspot.com/2009/01/paper-on-invasive-european-worms.html |title=Paper on Invasive European Worms |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These castings have been shown to contain reduced levels of contaminants and a higher saturation of nutrients than the organic materials before vermicomposting.&lt;ref name="Effects of stocking density and feeding rate on vermicomposting of biosolids"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ndegwa, P.M. |author2=Thompson, S.A. |author3=Das, K.C. | title = Effects of stocking density and feeding rate on vermicomposting of biosolids | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 5–12 | year = 1998 | pmid = | doi =10.1016/S0960-8524(99)00055-3 | url = http://www.earthworm.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/effect-of-stocking-density-feeding-rate-on-vermicomposting-of-biosolids.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermicompost contains water-soluble nutrients and  is an excellent, nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen. ''The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City.'' Port Townsend: Process Self Reliance Series, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in farming and small scale sustainable, organic farming.

Vermicomposting can also be applied for [[Sewage sludge treatment|treatment of sewage sludge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zularisam|first=A.W.|last2=Zahir|first2=Z.

==Overview==
[[File:African Night Crawler.jpg|thumb|[[Eudrilus eugeniae|African Night Crawler]] (a type of earthworm) as decomposer]]
Vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly. It also generates products that have lower [[salinity]] levels that are therefore more beneficial to plant mediums.&lt;ref name="Lacanzo, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lazcano, Cristina |author2=Gómez-Brandón, María |author3=Domínguez, Jorge | title = Comparison of the effectiveness of composting and vermicomposting for the biological stabilization of cattle manure | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1013–1019 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18511100| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.016| url = http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compost_with_worms.jpg|thumb|right|Food waste with worms]]
The earthworm species (or composting worms) most often used are red wigglers (''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' or ''[[Eisenia andrei]]''), though European nightcrawlers (''[[Eisenia hortensis]]'' or ''[[Eisenia hortensis|Dendrobaena veneta]]'') could also be used. Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including ''dendrobaenas'', ''dendras'', Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers.

Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen. ''The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City.'' Port Townsend: Process Self Reliance Series, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a "living" soil environment for plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=C.A.|title=Earthworm Ecology|date=1998|publisher=CRC Press LLC|isbn=1-884015-74-3|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the [[Drilosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Organic Phosphorus in the Environment, Turner, ''et al.'', Page 91. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations==
===Suitable worm species===
One of the species most often used for composting is the red wiggler or tiger worm (''Eisenia fetida'' or ''Eisenia andrei''); ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'' (a.k.a. red earthworm or dilong (China)) is another breed of worm that can be used, but it does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does ''Eisenia fetida''. European nightcrawlers (''Eisenia hortensis'') may also be used. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, and Belgian nightcrawlers.  African Nightcrawlers (''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'') are another set of popular composters. ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' (a.k.a. Canadian nightcrawlers (US) or common earthworm (UK)) are not recommended, since they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate.&lt;ref name="thf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://herronfarms.webs.com/ | title=Composting with earthworms| publisher=Herron Farms Dawsonville Ga. | accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blueworms (''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'') may be used in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HG-46.pdf |title=Composting Worms for Hawaii |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting [[vegetation]], compost, and [[manure]] piles. They may be an [[invasive species]] in some areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrri.umn.edu/worms/ |title=Great Lakes Worm Watch |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin.

Composting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or [[angling]] shops where they are sold as [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]]. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water.

===Large scale===
Large-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krepublishers4-1-059-08-1636-%20Aalok-A/JHE-24-1-059-08-1636-%20Aalok-A-Tt.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: A Better Option for Organic Solid Waste Management |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leaffin.com/compost-tea/ | title=Compost Tea|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create [[compost tea]], or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting.

There are two main methods of large-scale vermiculture. Some systems use a [[windrow]], which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.

The [[Windrow composting|windrow method]] and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Windrow composting systems can be {{sic|nolink=y|feasable}}, cost effective (Research Brief #20) {{!}} Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems|url = http://www.cias.wisc.edu/windrow-composting-systems-can-be-feasable-cost-effective/|website = www.cias.wisc.edu|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Worm bed wave.svg|thumb|350px|Movement of castings through a worm bed]]

The second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of "worm chow" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed.

Because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.

===Small scale===
[[File:Wormbin.sample.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration home scale worm bin at a community garden site (painted [[plywood]])]]
[[File:Wormbin.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin]]
For vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, [[Styrofoam]], or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.

Some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Worm Compost Bins - What To Look For and What To Avoid|url = http://www.best-organic-fertilizer.com/worm-compost-bins.html|website = www.best-organic-fertilizer.com|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Cedrus|cedars]], [[Yellow cedar]], and [[Coast Redwood|Redwood]] contain resinous oils that may harm worms,&lt;ref name=raising&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/35/34577.pdf |title=Raising Earthworms Successfully |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Western Red Cedar]] has excellent longevity in composting conditions. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampalandscaping.org/red-wiggler-compost-worm-bin.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724023034/http://vermontworms.com/red-wiggler-compost-worm-bin/|date=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or holes in the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Build your own Worm Farm|url = http://andreas-heeschen.co.uk/2016/02/02/build-your-own-worm-farm/|website = Growing Organic|access-date = 2016-02-21|last = Andreasheeschen|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213203115/http://andreas-heeschen.co.uk/2016/02/02/build-your-own-worm-farm/|archive-date = 2016-02-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common materials used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vermiculture|url = http://www.worm-farm.co.za/vermiculture.html|website = www.worm-farm.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced.

Small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality [[soil amendment]]s, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that [[composting|bin composting]] requires.

Composting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler ''Eisenia fetidae'', are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as ''Lumbricus terrestris'' are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Worm Dictionary and Vermiculture Reference Center|url=http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|publisher=Working Worms|accessdate=3 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028160939/http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|archive-date=28 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other soil species that contribute include [[insect]]s, other worms and [[mold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trautmann |first=Nancy |url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/invertebrates.html |title=Invertebrates of the Compost Pile |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and temperature===
There may be differences in vermicomposting methods depending on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/vermicomposting/hot-climate-vermiculture.htm|title=High Heat And Worm Bins – Tips For Vermicomposting When It's Hot|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high [[Heat capacity|heat-retentive]] properties), as the raw materials or [[feedstock]]s used can [[compost]], heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.

The most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (''[[Eisenia foetida]],'' ''[[Eisenia andrei]],'' and ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'') feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25&amp;nbsp;°C (59-77&amp;nbsp;°F). They can survive at 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F). Temperatures above 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F) may harm them.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature range means that indoor vermicomposting with redworms is possible in all but tropical climates. Other worms like [[Perionyx excavatus]] are suitable for warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; If a worm bin is kept outside, it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter.

==Feedstock==
There are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost, although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract [[vermin]]. [[Green waste]] should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin.

===Small-scale or home systems===
Such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste, using "earthworms and other [[microorganisms]]
to digest organic wastes, such as kitchen scraps".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Piper |last=Selden |first2=Michael |last2=DuPonte |first3=Brent |last3=Sipes |first4=Kelly |last4=Dinges |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HG-45.pdf |title=Small-Scale Vermicomposting |format=PDF |journal=Home Garden |volume=45 |publisher=University of Hawai'i |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvesting==
[[File:Worm.bin.jpg|right|thumb|Worms in a bin being harvested]]

Vermicompost is ready for harvest when it contains few-to-no scraps of uneaten food or bedding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are several methods of harvesting from small-scale systems: "dump and hand sort", "let the worms do the sorting", "alternate containers" and "divide and dump."&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, pp. 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; These differ on the amount of time and labor involved and whether the vermicomposter wants to save as many worms as possible from being trapped in the harvested compost.

The pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Harvesting - MMSB - Multi-Materials Stewardship Board|url = http://www.mmsb.nl.ca/composting/vermicomposting/harvesting/|website = MMSB - Multi-Materials Stewardship Board|access-date = 2016-02-21|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151028062058/http://www.mmsb.nl.ca/composting/vermicomposting/harvesting/|archive-date = 2015-10-28|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which the rest of the process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow to the bottom of the pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.

While harvesting, it's also a good idea to try to pick out as many eggs/cocoons as possible and return them to the bin. Cocoons are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen pretty easily with the naked eye and picked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://vermontworms.com/tag/red-wiggler-compost-worm-eggs/ |title=Red-wiggler Compost Worm eggs |access-date=2018-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318163515/https://vermontworms.com/tag/red-wiggler-compost-worm-eggs/ |archive-date=2018-03-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cocoons can hold up to 20 worms (though 2-3 is most common). Cocoons can lay dormant for as long as two years if conditions are not conducive for hatching. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cals.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/archive/redwormbiology.html|title=Red Worm Biology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many [[nutrient]]s than compost produced by other composting methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickerson |first=George W. |url=http://www.cahe.nmsu.edu/pubs/_h/h-164.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: Guide H-164 |publisher=New Mexico State University |format=PDF |date=June 2001 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also outperformed a commercial plant medium with nutrients added, but levels of [[magnesium]] required adjustment, as did pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Rhonda |url=http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/topic/vermicomposting/vermiculture/castings.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117155144/http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/topic/vermicomposting/vermiculture/castings.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-01-17 |title=Earthworm Castings as Plant Growth Media |publisher=Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at NCSU |accessdate=2012-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass, soil microbial activity, and yield of a species of [[ryegrass]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; than municipal compost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazcano|first=Cristina|author2=Gómez-Brandón, María |author3=Domínguez, Jorge |title=Comparison of the effectiveness of composting and vermicomposting for the biological stabilization of cattle manure|journal=Chemosphere|date=July 2008|volume=72|issue=7|pages=1013–1019|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.016 |url=http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=18511100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rich in microbial life which converts nutrients already present in the soil into plant-available forms.

Unlike other compost, worm castings also contain [[mucus|worm mucus]] which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil.&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998).

==Benefits==
'''Soil'''
* Improves soil aeration
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding [[enzymes]] such as [[phosphatase]] and [[cellulase]])
* Microbial activity in worm castings is 10 to 20 times higher than in the soil and organic matter that the worm ingests &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Gene|title=Worldwide progress in vermicomposting|journal=BioCycle|date=October 1994|volume=35|issue=10|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3324953|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil
* Improves water holding capacity&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant growth'''
* Enhances germination, plant growth, and crop yield
* Improves root growth and structure
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding [[plant hormone]]s such as [[auxins]] and [[gibberellic acid]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Economic'''
* Biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to [[landfill]]s
* Elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin (a common problem in communities practicing [[Single-stream recycling]])
* Creates low-skill jobs at local level
* Low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions

'''Environmental'''
* Helps to close the "[[metabolic rift|metabolic gap]]" through recycling waste on-site
* Large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting, however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* Production reduces [[greenhouse gas]] emissions such as [[methane]] and [[nitric oxide]] (produced in landfills or [[incinerator]]s when not composted or through [[methane harvest]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19459535/ |title=Waste Management to tap landfill methane |publisher=MSNBC |date=June 27, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Wormbin.bedding.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-scale worm bin (1&amp;nbsp;m X 2.5&amp;nbsp;m up to 1&amp;nbsp;m deep), freshly refilled with bedding]]

=== Soil conditioner ===
Vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil.

The dark brown waste liquid, or [[leachate]], that drains into the bottom of some vermicomposting systems as water-rich foods break down, is best applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed due to the possibility of [[phytotoxin]] content and organic acids that may be toxic to plants.&lt;ref name=raising/&gt;

The pH, nutrient, and microbial content of these fertilizers varies upon the inputs fed to worms. Pulverized limestone, or calcium carbonate can be added to the system to raise the pH.

==Operation and maintenance==
[[File:Worms and fruit fly eggs.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Worms and fruit fly pupas under the lid of a home worm bin.]]

===Smells===
When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, it should have little smell—if any smell is present, it is earthy.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Worms require gaseous oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen can be provided by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of [[ammonia]].

===Moisture===
Moisture must be maintained above 50%, as lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality. Operating moisture-content range should be between 70-90%, with a suggested content of 70-80% for vermicomposting-oriented vermiculture operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/agriculture/oacc/en/soil/Vermiculture_FarmersManual_gm.pdf|title=Manual of On-Farm Vermicomposting and Vermiculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=14|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If decomposition has become anaerobic, to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying, excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level. To do this, first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second, add fresh, dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin, mixing it in well.&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmtZ91zbxLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Worm+Book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h7KFpfKigc&amp;sig=r_L-YXzDAst_-lmjRkLuXcX3vqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DChsUNS2Oei40gHJvIH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Worm Book: The Complete Guide to Gardening and Composting with Worms''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318062343/https://books.google.com/books?id=rmtZ91zbxLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Worm+Book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h7KFpfKigc&amp;sig=r_L-YXzDAst_-lmjRkLuXcX3vqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DChsUNS2Oei40gHJvIH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=March 18, 2015}} Ten Speed Press. p. 70. {{ISBN|978-0-89815-994-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pest species===
Pests such as rodents and flies are attracted by certain materials and odors, usually from large amounts of kitchen waste, particularly meat. Eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/agriculture/oacc/en/soil/Vermiculture_FarmersManual_gm.pdf|title=Manual of On-Farm Vermicomposting and Vermiculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=8|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory ants can be a problem in African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David Watako, Koslengar Mougabe, and Thomas Heathfirst=|year=April 2016|title=Tiger worm toilets: lessons learned from constructing household vermicomposting toilets in Liberia|url=|journal=Waterlines|volume=35| issue =  2|pages=136–147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In warm weather, fruit and vinegar flies breed in the bins if fruit and vegetable waste is not thoroughly covered with bedding. This problem can be avoided by thoroughly covering the waste by at least {{convert|5|cm|in}} of bedding. Maintaining the correct pH (close to neutral) and water content of the bin (just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops) can help avoid these pests as well.

===Worms escaping===
Worms generally stay in the bin, but may try to leave the bin when first introduced, or often after a rainstorm when outside humidity is high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vermontworms.com/compost-worm-escape/ Compost Worm Escape]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldclimategarden.com/en/can-you-do-vermicomposting-in-an-apartment/ Can you do vermicomposting in an apartment?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005065728/http://www.coldclimategarden.com/en/can-you-do-vermicomposting-in-an-apartment/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient levels===
Commercial vermicomposters test, and may amend their products to produce consistent quality and results. Because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks, the nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent. NPK testing may be helpful before the vermicompost or tea is applied to the garden.

In order to avoid over-fertilization issues, such as [[nitrogen burn]], vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with [[potting soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Tim|last2=Littlejohn|first2=Gail|title=Teaching Green, The Middle Years |year=2004|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, B.C.|isbn=978-0-86571-501-1 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v46QjUMYuxkC&amp;pg=PT114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the mucous layer created by worms which surrounds their castings allows for a "time release" effect, meaning not all nutrients are released at once. This also reduces the risk of burning the plants, as is common with the use and overuse of commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigredworms.com/compost-or-worm-castings/ |title=Compost or Worm Castings? |publisher=Big Red Worms |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application examples==

Vermicomposting (also known as vermiculture) is widely used in North America for on-site institutional processing of food scraps, such as in hospitals, universities, shopping malls, and correctional facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Clive A.|title=Vermiculture Technology|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0987-7|pages=392–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling, such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls. It is selected either as a more environmentally friendly choice than conventional disposal, or to reduce the cost of commercial waste removal.

Researchers from the [[Pondicherry University]] discovered that worm composts can also be used to clean up heavy metals. The researchers found substantial reductions in heavy metals when the worms were released into the garbage and they are effective at removing [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Wistarburg sign.jpg|thumb|Wistarburg Glass Works roadsign]]
The ''' Wistarburg Glass Works ''' (sometimes spelled '''Wistarburgh Glass Works'''; also known as the ''' United Glass Company''') was the first successful glass factory and  [[joint venture|joint-venture]] enterprise in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], referred to as Colonial America. [[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] founded the glass works company in 1739. He began by recruiting experienced glass artisans from Europe, and built homes for the workers along with a mansion for the factory's foreman. Wistar also had a [[company store]] built near the factory.

The village that developed around the factory adopted Wistar's name, and became known as Wistarburg. The village was in [[Salem County, New Jersey]], in the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]]. Wistar's factory produced thousands of glass bottles per year, as well as [[flat glass|window glass]]. Wistar was a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and made glass globes for Franklin's electricity-producing machines used for scientific research. Wistar's son inherited the business and his son, Wistar's grandson, eventually gained control of the company, but owing to his mismanagement it closed.

==Company foundation==
[[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] (1696–1752) emigrated from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palitinate region of Germany]] to Philadelphia in 1717. There he began making brass buttons, which he would take with him on sales visits to [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. On one such trip he noticed that the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]] had an abundant supply of the necessary materials for glass manufacture&amp;nbsp;– white sand, clay, wood, and accessible waterways of the nearby [[Deep Run (Alloway Creek)|Deep Run]] and [[Alloway Creek]] rivers for transporting raw materials in and finished products out. He was thus encouraged to establish a glass factory there.&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |first1=J. Victor |last1=Owen |publisher=Historical American Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pierce|1960|page=97}} Wistar's was not the first to be built in colonial America. Earlier establishments had been setup at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607 and 1621. They were founded to export glass items to England, but ultimately failed, having produced little, if any, glass.&lt;ref name=JamestownGlassmaking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/glassmaking-at-jamestown.htm |title=Glassmaking at Jamestown |work=Historic Jamestowne |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar's button-making business proved to be a success, and together with his gains from speculating in land allowed him to accumulate sufficient capital to fund a new enterprise. He began his glass-making venture in 1737 by buying {{convert|2000|acres}} of land about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Salem, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=CreekLocation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/ |title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 / Factory Operations |date=2015 |website= |publisher=WheatonArts |access-date=July 22, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced construction of his factory&amp;nbsp;– which became the first commercially successful glass factory in America.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=251}}{{sfn|Cantele|Kaplan|2010|page=275}} He arranged in January 1738 to lease {{convert|50|acres|ha}} of land containing {{convert|18000|cord}} of wood from John Ladd, a local landowner.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=155}} Wistar then recruited four experienced glass makers from the Palitinate region of Germany&amp;nbsp;– C. Halter, S. Griessmeyer, J. Wentzel, and J. Halter&amp;nbsp;– to make the factory operational. He organized a joint venture with them, dividing profits in exchange for the art of glass making. The four artisans were to teach this art to the Wistars and nobody else in the colonies.&lt;ref name=Cradle&gt;{{cite news |last=Cunningham |first=John T. |date=July 2, 1964 |title=Cradle of American Glass |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17268234/|work=Bernardsville News |location= Bernardsville, New Jersey |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wistar had arranged for their journey to America, and they arrived in Philadelphia from [[Rotterdam]] on the ship ''Two Sisters'' in September 1738.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=164-167}}{{efn|There are no historical records that tell whether the two Halters were related.&lt;ref name=related&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/|title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 |date=2017 |publisher=Wheaton Arts and cultural center |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wistar had houses built near the factory to rent for the key artisans and other workers that were usually [[Indentured servitude|indentured immigrants]].{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=169}} He also had a mansion constructed for the factory's foreman, which also served as a lodging and office for Wistar while on his visits to the factory from his home in Philadelphia. A [[company store]] was constructed for the workers' needs. Products could be purchased on credit against the glass a worker would make in the future; a bookkeeper was employed to keep track of the store accounts and housing rents. The store also served the people of the village of Alloway, and was the center of community life.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}}

==Joint venture==
Wistar entered into a [[profit sharing|profit-sharing]] arrangement with the four German artisans who had helped to make his new factory operational. To ensure their continuing support he set up a [[joint venture]] between five members, the first cooperative manufacturing joint-venture business in America and the first long-term successful glasshouse. The 1739 company began trading as the United Glass Company, which consisted of three individual joint ventures. Wistar was the general manager and primary share holder, with a two-thirds majority ownership in each of the joint ventures.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=165}} The four Germans held one-third ownership and shared the expenses, assets, and profits of the three individual joint ventures. The first entity under the umbrella enterprise was held between Wistar and Wentzel, the second between Wistar and C. Halter, and the third between Wistar, Griesmeyer and J. Halter. The joint venture arrangement remained in effect until Wistar's death in 1752.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/artwork/bottle-seal-richard-wistar |title=Bottle with the Seal of Richard Wistar |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlassHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peachridgeglass.com/2013/09/the-united-glass-company-located-at-wistarburgh/ |publisher=Peachridge Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |date=September 24, 2013 |first2=Ferdinand, V, |last2=Meyer |first1=Stephen |last1=Atkinson |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HAG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |title= The United Glass Company located at Wistarburgh|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=A History of  Early American made Glass |publisher=Historical American Glass |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Franklin machine globe.jpg|thumb|Glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Benjamin Franklin's electrostatic machines]] were made by Wistarburg Glass Works.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}}]]
Wistar's factory produced about 15,000 glass bottles per year made in the [[Waldglas]] style, which had been a way of making glass in Europe since the Middle Ages. It was an inexpensive traditional method whereby the main materials of wood ash and sand produced a greenish-yellow glass. The factory produced window glass and was the first American supplier for the thirteen colonies.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=94}} The Glass House (as it was often called) also produced rum flasks and tableware.{{sfn|Time Inc|1955|p=58}} Wistar had unlimited access to white [[silica sand]], as well as other necessary materials, and the company's success was further aided by New Jersey's low taxation; Wistar was easily able to obtain more assets for the business.&lt;ref name=lowtaxes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=1 |title=Caspar Wistar established the first successful glass manufacturing business in North America |last1=Kummer|first1=Insa |date=2014 |website=Immigrant Entrepreneurship |publisher=[[German Historical Institute]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar lived in Philadelphia, and was aware that the British did not allow the manufacture of certain items that were in competition with those imported from Britain. He therefore downplayed the profits from his glass business, so as to avoid arousing the suspicions of the British. Wistar ran his business affairs from Philadelphia, spending little time in Alloway. He sold the manufactured glass products through his store in Philadelphia, the Wistarburg company store, and his son Richard's store in New York City.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}}

Wistar was friends with [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Philadelphia and made glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Franklin's electricity producing machines]], used for scientific research into electricity.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}} Franklin built several of his machines, using the Wistarburg glass globes, for [[Cadwallader Colden]] and [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]], for which they paid him between ten and twelve pounds each.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=75}} The Wistarburg Glass Works also made glass tubes for [[David Rittenhouse]] to use in his experiments on electricity.{{sfn|Davis|2012|p=27}}

Wistar died of [[dropsy]] in Philadelphia on March 21, 1752,{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}} and his son Richard took over the glass works. Richard also mostly ran the business from Philadelphia, but worked on increasing sales and expanding the company's product range. Just like his father, he relied on hired artisans to run the glass works factory in Alloway. The glass enterprise continued into the 1770s, but struggled owing to deforestation around Wistarburg. Wood from the trees was needed as fuel to run the glass furnaces, and when supplies began to run short some of the company's key artisans resigned and went to start their own glass company in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]], where there were new uncut forests and plenty of wood. Richard also had personal problems that occupied much of his time, and financial difficulties caused by the Revolutionary War; in an attempt to make ends meet, he sold a major portion of his father's New Jersey real estate.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}} Richard died in 1781, and his son John took over the business. John failed to devote the effort necessary to run the glass works, allowing it to go into serious decline and ultimately it went out of business. The final year of the enterprise is disputed by scholars, but it is known that in 1793 the property that the factory was on was divided up among Richard's heirs and sold in parcels.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=156}}
