The '''1835 New Brunswick, New Jersey, tornado''' of Friday, June 19, 1835, was the deadliest recorded in New Jersey history. It struck what is now part of downtown New Brunswick, along a path that stretched through or near what is now [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]] property, rambled towards the site of Monument Square, and went downhill to the river from there, after wreaking havoc on George Street. The twister then destroyed all but two of the twelve houses in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]].

==Reporting==
On June 20, 1835, the ''[[New York Evening Star]]'' reported: "About 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, a [[tornado]] passed over the town of Piscataway, about two miles from New Brunswick, which destroyed every house but two. The current proceeded towards the City of New Brunswick, and made dreadful havoc in that place, destroying and injuring nearly one hundred and fifty houses in Liberty, Richmond and Schureman streets. The most melancholy part of the accident is the death of several persons.There were 5 deaths, and here are 4 of them. A widow lady by the name of Van Arsdale, a man called Henry Boorsem, formerly a midshipman in the Navy, who was killed in the street, and a boy named Bayard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Dreadful Tornado |url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/new-jersey/6072/piscataway-nj-dreadful-tornado-june-1835 |quote=About 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, a tornado passed over the town of Piscataway, about two miles from New Brunswick, which destroyed every house but two. ... |newspaper=[[New York Evening Star]] |date=June 20, 1835  |accessdate=2011-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Destructive Tornado |url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/new-jersey/6072/piscataway-nj-dreadful-tornado-june-1835 |quote=|newspaper=[[New York Gazette]] |date=June 29, 1835  |accessdate=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casualties and losses ==
[[File:The oil Tank.jpg|thumb|Salvaged oil tanker]]

Seven crew members of the sunken ship managed to swim ashore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India on alert after oil spill in Sundarbans|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/12/us-india-sundarbans-idUSKBN0JQ1BZ20141212|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the captain of the ship, Mokhlesur Rahman, died, and his body was recovered a few kilometers away from the spot where the ship sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Callousness cause for Sundarban environmental disaster|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/17/61220.php|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=observerbd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimated that {{currency|1000000000|BDT}} was lost as a result of the sinking of the oil-tanker.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.clickittefaq.com/more-stories/tk-100-cr-loss-feared-sundarban-oil-spill/|title = TK 100 cr. loss feared from Sundarban oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[The Daily Ittefaq]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of the surrounding area are at a health risk. 
The government of Bangladesh told the local residents to collect the oil and sell it to the [[Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation]]. The local oil collectors faced health risks and various skin diseases, including hair fallout if furnace oil mixed with water contacts a person's face or hair.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Environmental issues ==

[[File:Golpata tree oil covered.jpg|thumb|Oil covered trees]]
Environmentalists warned that the event was an ecological "catastrophe",&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; as the spill occurred at a protected area where rare dolphins were present.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Experts expressed concerns that the oil spill will hamper the well-being of the aquatic organisms in the area. Wildlife near the river are at a risk of death, because the smell of oil makes breathing difficult.&lt;ref name=":722"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil spill in Sundarbans threatens food cycle|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57215/Oil-spill-in-Sundarbans-threatens-food-cycle|accessdate=19 December 2014|work=[[Prothom Alo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some images indicate that the disaster killed some animals.&lt;ref name="Global Voices Online"/&gt;

On 13 December 2014, a dead Irrawaddy dolphin was seen floating on the Harintana-Tembulbunia channel of the Shela River.&lt;ref name=":622"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/14/first-dead-dolphin-spotted|title = First dead dolphin spotted|last = Siddique|first = Abu Bakar|date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not confirmed that the dolphin's death was caused by the oil spill. According to the local residents, few dolphins have been seen in the area since the oil spill.
Oriental small-clawed otter (''Amblonyx cinereus'') aquatic carnivore animal lives in the aquatic ecosystem of Sundarbans.&lt;ref&gt;Bautista H. and Rahman K. M. M. (2016). Review On the Sundarbans Delta Oil Spill: Effects On Wildlife and Habitats. International Research Journal, 1(43), Part 2, pp: 93-96. DOI: 10.18454/IRJ.2016.43.143&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December 2014, two dead [[otter]]s were recovered from the Shela River by forest department workers. An [[autopsy]] of the two otters confirmed that they had died from ingesting oil. The otter is considered to be an [[endangered species]], and has been included in the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] endangered list.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57260/Two-otters-dead-in-oil-spill|title = Two otters dead in oil spill|last = Mahmud|first = Iftekhar|date = |work = [[Prothom Alo]]|accessdate = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of forest department workers saw [[crocodile]]s, [[monitor lizard]]s and many other animals smeared with oil at the Chandpai range of the Sundarbans.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The oil spill is also posing a major threat to the forest's food cycle. Reports from various sources showed that the microorganisms, the primary level of the food cycle, are dying.&lt;ref name=":722"/&gt; The [[United Nations]] expressed deep concern over the oil spill, urging the government of Bangladesh to impose a "complete ban" on commercial vessels moving through the forest.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/un-sends-team-to-clean-up-sunderbans-oil-spill-in-bangladesh|title = UN sends team to clean up Sunderbans oil spill in Bangladesh|last = |first = |date = 18 December 2014|work = [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate = 19 December 2014|publisher = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shajahan Khan]], the shipping minister of Bangladesh, told [[Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha]] that he has talked with environmental experts, and they said that there will likely be no major damage as a result of the oil spill.&lt;ref name=":622"/&gt; Researchers said that Khan's claim was "unscientific and misleading".&lt;ref name=":722"/&gt;

Ten species that are at risk as a result of the spill have been listed by [[National Geographic Traveller|The National Geographic Traveler]]. These species are the [[Irrawady dolphin]]s, [[Bengal tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[great egret]]s, [[rhesus macaque]]s, [[northern river terrapin]]s, [[black-capped kingfisher]]s, [[chital]]s, [[saltwater crocodile]]s, and [[horseshoe crab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/20/bnp-probe-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = BNP to probe Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of White Rumped Vulture (''Gyps bengalensis'') over the Sundarbans sky also indicated the large scale death of wild fauna. The secondary
effect of oil spill is always much greater than the primary effects.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman K. M. M. &amp; Rakhimov I. I. (2015). Ecological Effects of Oil Spill on Bangladesh Sundarbans Biodiversity. International Scientific and Practical Conference "Complex Problems of Technosphere Safety";Voronezh: Voronezh State Technical University, Russia;Part.VI.258p:Pp:16-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil collection==
[[File:Oil collection by local residents of Sundarbans.jpg|thumb|Local residents collecting oil]]

After the spill, primarily [[Bangladeshi]] fishermen began to clean up the oil using sponges and sacks.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; [[Padma Oil Company]], a government-owned corporation, bought the oil at a price of 30 takas per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/12/12/suranjit-peeved-over-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = Suranjit peeved over Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[Bdnews24.com]]|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladeshi navy initially sent four ships to deal with the spill, and planned to use chemicals to disperse the oil,&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; but the plan was canceled, as there were concerns that dispersing the oil would further damage the ecology and biodiversity of the mangrove forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/13/dilly-dallying-delays-clean-sundarbans-spill|title = Dilly dallying delays clean-up of Sundarbans spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Bangladesh closed the Shela River to all vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/river-route-closed-after-sundarbans-oil-spill/article6683452.ece|title = River route closed after Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[The Hindu]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the sunken oil tanker, MS Harun &amp; Co., began salvage efforts, assisted by three private rescue vessels. The Bangladesh Forest Department filed a 1 billion taka lawsuit against the owners of the two cargo ships involved in the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/12/10/govt-files-tk-1-billion-compensation-suit-for-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = Govt files Tk 1 billion compensation suit for Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 12 January 2015, the government, with the help of local residents, the Bangladesh Navy, and the owner of the oil tanker, had collected {{convert|70000|l|impgal usgal}} of oil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Bangladesh government said that they do not have the capacity to manage oil spills.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{cite news |title=No capacity to tackle oil spills |url=http://www.hawker.com.bd/news_details.php?news_id=389549 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/14/india-alert-after-sunderbans-oil-spill|title = India on alert after Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Relations Division of the Bangladesh government sent a letter to the United Nation's Bangladesh office on 15 December 2014, asking for help in the oil collection efforts. The United Nations accepted the request, and a team from the [[UNEP]] and [[OCHA]] went to the site of the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN agrees to help govt contain oil spread|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57157/Govt-seeks-UN-help-for-Sundarbans|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Prothom Alo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from the [[United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination]] arrived in the [[Dhaka]] to support the cleanup efforts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''3-Hydroxyoctanoic acid''' is a [[beta-hydroxy acid]] that is [[natural product|naturally produced]] in humans, other animals, and plants.  

3-Hydroxyoctanoic acid is the primary [[endogenous]] [[agonist]] of [[hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3]] (HCA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] protein which is encoded by the human gene ''HCAR3''.&lt;ref name="IUPHAR's comprehensive 2011 review on HCARs"&gt;{{cite journal | title = International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.

'''Abductin''' is a natural elastic [[protein]] that is found in the [[ligament (bivalve)|hinge ligament]] of [[bivalvia|bivalve]] [[mollusks]].  It is unique as it is the only protein in nature with compressible elasticity. It is similar to [[elastin]] and [[resilin]], but [[amino acid]] analysis reveals that it has high concentrations of [[glycine]] and [[methionine]].  

Abductin is made up of three prominent [[amino acids]], [[glycine]], [[methionine]], and [[phenylalanine]], which are arranged in a [[Pentapeptide repeat|repeating pentapeptide]] sequence throughout the [[molecule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly RE, Rice RV | title = Abductin: a rubber-like protein from the internal triangular hinge ligament of pecten | journal = Science | volume = 155 | issue = 3759 | pages = 208–10 | date = January 1967 | pmid = 6015528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 19: Abductin | title = Biological Materials Of Marine Origin, Biologically-Inspired Systems | year = 2010 | first = Hermann | last= Ehrlich | name-list-format = vanc | volume = 1 | pages = 319-322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural gas]] burns cleanly as a fuel, making it useful in many vehicles and applications such as cooking, heating or running generators. It contains mostly [[methane]] and [[ethane]]. These light gases have very high vapor pressure at ambient temperatures, and their storage requires either high-pressure compression, adsorbent systems or an extreme reduction of temperature.

Recently, a process has been introduced to store natural gas called '''[[adsorption|adsorbed]] natural gas''' ('''ANG'''). In this process, natural gas adsorbs to a porous [[adsorbent]] at relatively low pressure (100 to 900 psi) and ambient temperature, solving both the high-pressure and low-temperature problems. If a suitable adsorbent is used, it is possible to store more gas in an adsorbent-filled vessel than in an empty vessel at the same pressure. The amount of adsorbed gas depends on pressure, temperature and adsorbent type. Since this adsorption process is [[exothermic]], an increase or decrease of pressure or an increase or decrease of temperature enhances the efficiency of the adsorption and desorption process.  [[Activated carbon]] is an adsorbent with high surface area that can be used in ANG storage tanks. Currently, researchers are developing new adsorbents with higher adsorption ratio to optimize this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peyman J |url=http://scopewe.com/adsorbed-natural-gas-ang |title=Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) - scopeWe - a Virtual Engineer |publisher=scopeWe |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANG technology companies, such as Cenergy Solutions, Inc. (www.cenergysolutions.com), Adsorbed Natural Gas Products (ANGP) (www.angpinc.com), Ingevity Corporation (NYSE: NGVT) (www.ingevity.com), has deployed commercially viable ANG tank technology in the USA for CNG vehicles and bio-methane facility storage.  Cenergy Solutions received a US patent on July 10, 2018 that helps the adsorption, desorption and filtering of the adsorbents so they do not escape from the cylinder or tank. Cenergy Solutions was also awarded the Clean Cities, Clean Air Champion Award for 2017 and ANGP was awarded the 2016 Frost &amp; Sullivan New Product Innovation Award for Gas Storage for Natural Gas Vehicles for their work in commercializing ANG technology.  In March 2016, ANGP's Generation 1 ANG storage system proved to be the first NGV2 compliant ANG storage system available to the market.  The system has been demonstrated on a 2014 Ford F150, with an engine system capable of low-pressure natural gas operation.  Cenergy Solutions introduced the first conformable ANG tank on a 2016 Ford F150 in May 2016 with their low pressure EPA approved bi-fuel conversion system. Validation ANG tank prototypes have been operational on an 8.1-liter Chevrolet Suburban; and the first ANG system to be used commercially was delivered in December 2015 on an OEM dedicated Dodge Ram 2500 with a 5.3-liter engine and has been in commercial operation since.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngv.com/cenergy-solutions-delivers-adsorb-technology-to-fleet/&lt;/ref&gt;

ANG technology is a significant step toward solving the “chicken and egg” challenge for broad and rapid adoption of CNG.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natsoshow.org/2012/12/operators-weigh-costs-and-benefits-of-natural-gas-infrastructure-investments/&lt;/ref&gt;  The ANG system creates the low pressure, conformable CNG storage solution for full-scale, affordable NGV-hybrid deployment in the US.  Moreover, the lower compression pressures required to “fill” ANG tanks also allows for the more rapid growth of a ubiquitous CNG refueling network. Cenergy Solutions, Inc. introduced the first low pressure ANG compressor that is CSA and UL certified to be used as a natural gas appliance. This compressor will solve the natural gas fueling infrastructure problem.  Due to the significantly lower capital investment associated with lower compression requirements, CNG infrastructure will be more easily and cost-effectively added to the network of gas stations and truck stop.

ANG technology also creates a market for compact, affordable, low-pressure CNG Home Refueling Appliances (HRA’s) that will allow consumers to fill their vehicles at home connecting directly to their utility gas line. Cenergy Solutions has introduced this home and business compressor to the US, Canadian and Mexican market. 
 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324556304578117352568150798&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford Motor Company’s Fleet Sustainability and Technology Manager is quoted as saying, “The highest cost of a CNG filling station is the compressor, because compressing to 3,600 psi takes a tremendous amount of energy. By reducing that compression to 1,000 psi, or even further to the “Holy Grail” of 500 psi, this is game-changing technology because it enables home refueling, and you have 53 million potential fill points at every residence in the country that has natural gas running into it.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.truckinginfo.com/blog/auto-focus/print/story/2014/05/seeking-the-cng-holy-grail.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

ANG is also being tested for other methane storage applications, including CNG fueling station storage, virtual pipelines, and fugitive/ wellhead methane capture systems.  Other significant opportunities for ANG include home heating and cooking applications in developing countries and in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/china-biogas.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">In [[electrical engineering]], the '''alpha-beta''' (&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) '''transformation'''  (also known as the '''Clarke transformation''') is a mathematical [[Transform (mathematics)|transformation]] employed to simplify the analysis of [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase circuits]]. Conceptually it is similar to the [[dq0 transformation]]. One very useful application of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transformation is the generation of the reference signal used for space vector modulation control of three-phase [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]].

==Definition==

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform applied to three-phase currents, as used by [[Edith Clarke]], is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=W. C. Duesterhoeft |author2=Max W. Schulz |author3=Edith Clarke | journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers| title=Determination of Instantaneous Currents and Voltages by Means of Alpha, Beta, and Zero Components|date=July 1951|volume=70|issue=2|
pages=1248–1255|ISSN=0096-3860|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1951.5060554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\ 
0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 
\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\i_b(t)\\i_c(t)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i_{abc}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a generic three-phase current sequence and &lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding current sequence given by the transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
The inverse transform is:

:&lt;math&gt;i_{abc}(t) = T^{-1}i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; 1\\
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}i_\alpha(t)\\i_\beta(t)\\i_\gamma(t)\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above Clarke's transformation preserves the amplitude of the electrical variables which it is applied to. Indeed, consider a three-phase symmetric, direct, current sequence
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
i_a(t)=&amp;\sqrt{2}I\cos\theta(t),\\
i_b(t)=&amp;\sqrt{2}I\cos\left(\theta(t)-\frac23\pi\right),\\
i_c(t)=&amp;\sqrt{2}I\cos\left(\theta(t)+\frac23\pi\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] of &lt;math&gt;i_a(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_b(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the generic time-varying angle that can also be set to &lt;math&gt;\omega t&lt;/math&gt; without loss of generality. Then, by applying &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to the current sequence, it results
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
i_{\alpha}=&amp;\sqrt2 I\cos\theta(t),\\
i_{\beta}=&amp;\sqrt2 I\sin\theta(t),\\
i_{\gamma}=&amp;0,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equation holds since we have considered balanced currents. As it is shown in the above, the amplitudes of the currents in the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; reference frame are the same of that in the natural reference frame.

=== Power invariant transformation ===
The active and reactive powers computed in the Clark's domain with the transformation shown above are not the same of those computed in the standard reference frame. This happens because &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is not [[unitary matrix|unitary]]. In order to preserve the active and reactive powers one has, instead, to consider
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\ 
0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\i_b(t)\\i_c(t)\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
which is a unitary matrix and the inverse coincides with its transpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Area Based Approach for Three Phase Power Quality Assessment in Clarke Plane|author1=S. CHATTOPADHYAY|author2=M. MITRA|author3=S. SENGUPTA|journal=Journal of Electrical Systems|year=2008|volume=04|issue=01|pages=62|url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=fulltext&amp;passMe=http://journal.esrgroups.org/jes/papers/4_1_5.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-26}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this case the amplitudes of the transformed currents are not the same of those in the standard reference frame, that is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
i_{\alpha}=&amp;\sqrt3 I\cos\theta(t),\\
i_{\beta}=&amp;\sqrt3 I\sin\theta(t),\\
i_{\gamma}=&amp;0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, the inverse transformation in this case is
:&lt;math&gt;
i_{abc}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_\alpha(t)\\i_\beta(t)\\i_\gamma(t)\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Simplified transformation ===
Since in a balanced system &lt;math&gt;i_a(t)+i_b(t)+i_c(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;i_\gamma(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; one can also consider the simplified transform&lt;ref name="Tahri"&gt;F. Tahri, A.Tahri, Eid A. AlRadadi and A. Draou Senior,  "Analysis and Control of Advanced Static VAR compensator Based on the Theory of the Instantaneous Reactive Power," presented at ACEMP, Bodrum, Turkey, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta}(t) = \frac23 \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -\frac12 &amp; -\frac12\\ 
0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\i_b(t)\\i_c(t)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the original Clarke's transformation with the 3rd equation thrown away, and

:&lt;math&gt;i_{abc}(t) = \frac32\begin{bmatrix} \frac23 &amp; 0 \\
-\frac{1}{3} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
-\frac{1}{3} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}i_\alpha(t)\\i_\beta(t)\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric Interpretation==

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transformation can be thought of as the projection of the three phase quantities (voltages or currents) onto two stationary axes, the alpha axis and the beta axis.

[[Image:AlphaBeta geometric interpretation.gif|center|frame|Shown above is the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform as applied to three symmetrical currents flowing through three windings separated by 120 physical degrees. The three phase currents lag their corresponding phase voltages by &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; axis is shown with the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; axis aligned with phase 'A'. The current vector &lt;math&gt;I_{\alpha\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; rotates with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. There is no &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; component since the currents are balanced.]]

===&lt;math&gt;dq0&lt;/math&gt; transform===
{{Main|dq0 transformation}}

The [[dq0 transformation|&lt;math&gt;dq0&lt;/math&gt; transform]] is conceptually similar to the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform. Whereas the &lt;math&gt;dq0&lt;/math&gt; transform is the projection of the phase quantities onto a rotating two-axis reference frame, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform can be thought of as the projection of the phase quantities onto a stationary two-axis reference frame.

The primary stated mission of CAISO is to "operate the grid reliably and efficiently, provide fair and open transmission access, promote environmental stewardship, and facilitate effective markets and promote infrastructure development." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caiso.com/about/Pages/OurCommitment/default.aspx |title=Our commitment |publisher=CAISO |date=2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAISO is one of the largest ISOs in the world, delivering 300 million megawatt-hours of electricity each year and managing about 80% of California's electric flow.

The California legislature created the CAISO in 1998 as part of the state restructuring of electricity markets.  The legislature was responding to [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) recommendations following the passage of the federal [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]], which removed barriers to competition in the wholesale generation of the electricity business. [[FERC]] regulates CAISO because interstate transmission lines fall under the jurisdiction of federal commerce laws. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CompanyInformation_Facts.pdf |title=CAISO: Company Information and Facts |publisher=CAISO |date=2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CAISO is governed by a five member governing board appointed by the Governor of California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37225">Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) are fabricated from [[thin film]]s of [[organic semiconductor]]s, such as [[polymers]] and small-molecule compounds, and are typically on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] thick. Because polymer based OPVs can be made using a coating process such as spin coating or inkjet printing, they are an attractive option for inexpensively covering large areas as well as flexible plastic surfaces. A promising low cost alternative to conventional [[solar cells]] made of [[crystalline silicon]], there is a large amount of research being dedicated throughout industry and academia towards developing OPVs and increasing their power conversion [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref name=t5&gt;{{Cite journal|first = B.

== Single wall carbon nanotubes as light harvesting media ==

Single wall [[carbon nanotube]]s possess a wide range of direct bandgaps matching the [[solar spectrum]], strong photoabsorption, from [[infrared]] to [[ultraviolet]], and high carrier mobility and reduced carrier transport scattering, which make themselves ideal [[photovoltaic]] material. [[Photovoltaic effect]] can be achieved in ideal single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) [[diode]]s.  Individual SWNTs can form ideal p-n junction diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1063/1.2010598 |first = Ji Ung |last = Lee|year=2003|title = Photovoltaic effect in ideal carbon nanotube diodes|journal = Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume = 87|issue = 3|pages = 073101 |bibcode = 2005ApPhL..87g3101L }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal behavior is the theoretical limit of performance for any diode, a highly sought after goal in all electronic materials development. Under illumination, SWNT diodes show significant power conversion efficiencies owing to enhanced properties of an ideal diode.

Recently, SWNTs were directly configured as energy conversion materials to fabricate thin-film solar cells, with nanotubes serving as both photogeneration sites and a charge carriers collecting/transport layer.  The solar cells consist of a semitransparent thin film of nanotubes conformally coated on a n-type crystalline silicon substrate to create high-density p-n heterojunctions between nanotubes and n-Si to favor charge separation and extract electrons (through n-Si) and holes (through nanotubes). Initial tests have shown a power conversion efficiency of &gt;1%, proving that CNTs-on-Si is a potentially suitable configuration for making solar cells. For the first time, Zhongrui Li demonstrated that SOCl2 treatment of SWNT boosts the power conversion efficiency of SWNT/n-Si heterojunction solar cells by more than 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1063/1.3050465  |first = Zhongrui|last = Li|author2=Vasyl P. Kunets|year=2009|title = SOCl2 enhanced photovoltaic conversion of single wall carbon nanotube/n-silicon heterojunctions|journal = Appl. Phys.

Even higher efficiency can be achieved if acid liquid is kept inside the void space of nanotube network. Acid infiltration of nanotube networks significantly boosts the cell efficiency to 13.8%,as reported by Yi Jia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1021/nl2002632 |first = Yi |last = Jia|year=2011|title = Achieving High Efficiency Silicon-Carbon Nanotube Heterojunction Solar Cells by Acid Doping|journal = Nano Lett.|volume = 11|issue = 5|pages = 1901–1905 |url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl2002632|bibcode = 2011NanoL..11.1901J }}&lt;/ref&gt;  by reducing the internal resistance that improves fill factor, and by forming photoelectrochemical units that enhance charge separation and transport. 
The wet acid induced problems can be avoided by using aligned CNT film. In aligned CNT film, the transport distance is shortened, and the exciton quenching rate is also reduced. Additionally aligned nanotube film has much smaller void space, and better contact with substrate. So, plus strong acid doping, using aligned single wall carbon nanotube film can further improve power conversion efficiency (a record-high power-conversion-efficiency of &gt;11% was achieved by Yeonwoong Jung).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1021/nl3035652 |first = Yeonwoong |last = Jung|year=2013|title = Record High Efficiency Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube/Silicon p–n Junction Solar Cells|journal = Nano Lett.|volume = 13|issue = 1|pages = 95–99 |url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl3035652K |bibcode = 2013NanoL..13...95J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhongrui Li also made the first n-SWNT/p-Si photovoltaic device by tuning SWNTs from p-type to n-type through polyethylene imine functionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1063/1.3284657 |first = Zhongrui|last = Li|author2=Viney Saini|year=2010|title = Polymer functionalized n-type single wall carbon nanotube photovoltaic devices|journal = Appl.

== Carbon nanotube composites in the photoactive layer ==

Combining the physical and chemical characteristics of [[conjugated polymers]] with the high conductivity along the tube axis of [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs) provides a great deal of incentive to disperse CNTs into the photoactive layer in order to obtain more efficient OPV devices. The interpenetrating bulk donor–acceptor heterojunction in these devices can achieve charge separation and collection because of the existence of a bicontinuous network. Along this network, electrons and holes can travel toward their respective contacts through the electron acceptor and the polymer hole donor. Photovoltaic efficiency enhancement is proposed to be due to the introduction of internal polymer/nanotube junctions within the polymer matrix. The high electric field at these junctions can split up the excitons, while the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) can act as a pathway for the electrons.&lt;ref name=t6&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1063/1.1535231|first = E.|last = Kymakis |author2=Alexandrou, I. |author3=Amaratunga, G.A.J.|year=2003|title = High open-circuit voltage photovoltaic devices from carbon-nanotube-polymer composites|journal = Journal of Applied Physics|volume = 93|issue = 3|pages = 1764–1768|bibcode = 2003JAP....93.1764K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispersion of CNTs in a solution of an electron donating conjugated polymer is perhaps the most common strategy to implement CNT materials into OPVs. Generally [[polythiophene|poly(3-hexylthiophene)]] (P3HT) or poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) are used for this purpose. These blends are then spin coated onto a transparent conductive electrode with thicknesses that vary from 60 to 120&amp;nbsp;nm. These conductive electrodes are usually glass covered with [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO) and a 40&amp;nbsp;nm sublayer of [[poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)]] (PEDOT) and [[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate|poly(styrenesulfonate)]] (PSS). PEDOT and PSS help to smooth the ITO surface, decreasing the density of pinholes and stifling current leakage that occurs along shunting paths. Through thermal evaporation or sputter coating, a 20 to 70&amp;nbsp;nm thick layer of aluminum and sometimes an intermediate layer of lithium fluoride are then applied onto the photoactive material. Multiple research investigations with both multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) integrated into the photoactive material have been completed.&lt;ref name=t8&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Hiroki|last = Ago |author2=Petritsch, Klaus |author3=Shaffer, Milo S.P. |author4=Windle, Alan H. |author5=Friend, Richard H. |year=1999|title = Composites of carbon nanotubes and conjugated polymers for photovoltaic devices|journal = Advanced Materials|volume = 11|issue = 15|pages = 1281–1285|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4095(199910)11:15&lt;1281::AID-ADMA1281&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t5/&gt;&lt;ref name=t6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = A.

Enhancements of more than two orders of magnitude have been observed in the photocurrent from adding SWCNTs to the P3OT matrix.&lt;ref name=t6/&gt; Improvements were speculated to be due to charge separation at polymer–SWCNT connections and more efficient electron transport through the SWCNTs. However, a rather low power conversion efficiency of 0.04% under 100&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; white illumination was observed for the device suggesting incomplete exciton dissociation at low CNT concentrations of 1.0% wt. Because the lengths of the SWCNTs were similar to the thickness of photovoltaic films, doping a higher percentage of SWCNTs into the polymer matrix was believed to cause short circuits. To supply additional dissociation sites, other researchers have physically blended functionalized MWCNTs into P3HT polymer to create a P3HT-MWCNT with fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; double-layered device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Basudev|last = Pradhan |author2=Batabyal, Sudip K. |author3=Pal, Amlan J.|year=2006|title = Functionalized carbon nanotubes in donor/acceptor-type photovoltaic devices|journal = Applied Physics Letters|volume = 88|issue = 9|pages = 093106|doi = 10.1063/1.2179372|bibcode = 2006ApPhL..88i3106P }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the power efficiency was still relatively low at 0.01% under 100&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; white illumination. Weak exciton diffusion toward the donor–acceptor interface in the bilayer structure may have been the cause in addition to the fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; layer possibly experiencing poor electron transport.

More recently, a polymer photovoltaic device from C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-modified SWCNTs and P3HT has been fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Cheng|last = Li|author2=Chen, Yuhong |author3=Wang, Yubing |author4=Iqbal, Zafar |author5=Chhowalla, Manish |author6= Mitra, Somenath |year=2007|title = A fullerene-single wall carbon nanotube complex for polymer bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells|journal =Journal of Materials Chemistry|volume = 17|issue = 23|pages = 2406–2411|doi = 10.1039/b618518e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microwave irradiating a mixture of aqueous SWCNT solution and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; solution in [[toluene]] was the first step in making these polymer-SWCNT composites. Conjugated polymer P3HT was then added resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 0.57% under simulated solar irradiation (95&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It was concluded that improved short circuit current density was a direct result of the addition of SWCNTs into the composite causing faster electron transport via the network of SWCNTs. It was also concluded that the morphology change led to an improved fill factor. Overall, the main result was improved power conversion efficiency with the addition of SWCNTs, compared to cells without SWCNTs; however, further optimization was thought to be possible.

Additionally, it has been found that heating to the point beyond the glass transition temperature of either P3HT or P3OT after construction can be beneficial for manipulating the phase separation of the blend. This heating also affects the ordering of the polymeric chains because the polymers are microcrystalline systems and it improves [[Charge transfer complex|charge transfer]], charge transport, and charge collection throughout the OPV device. The hole mobility and power efficiency of the polymer-CNT device also increased significantly as a result of this ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = D.|last = Chirvase |author2=Parisi, J. |author3=Hummelen, J.C. |author4=Dyakonov, V.|year=2004|title = Influence of nanomorphology on the photovoltaic action of polymer-fullerene composites|journal = Nanotechnology|volume = 15|issue = 9|pages = 1317–1323|doi = 10.1088/0957-4484/15/9/035|bibcode = 2004Nanot..15.1317C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging as another valuable approach for deposition, the use of [[tetraoctylammonium bromide]] in [[tetrahydrofuran]] has also been the subject of investigation to assist in suspension by exposing SWCNTs to an electrophoretic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Said|last = Barazzouk |author2=Hotchandani, Surat |author3=Vinodgopal, K. |author4=Kamat, Prashant V. |year=2004|title = Single-wall carbon nanotube films for photocurrent generation.

Among the best power conversions achieved to date using CNTs were obtained by depositing a SWCNT layer between the ITO and the PEDOT : PSS or between the PEDOT : PSS and the photoactive blend in a modified ITO/PEDOT : PSS/ P3HT : (6,6)-phenyl-C&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Al solar cell. By dip-coating from a [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] suspension, SWCNT were deposited after an initially exposing the surface to an argon plasma to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 4.9%, compared to 4% without CNTs.&lt;ref name="Hierarchical placement and associated optoelectronic impact of carbon nanotubes in polymer-fullerene solar cells"&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Sumit|last = Chaudhary |author2=Lu, Haiwei |author3=Muller, Astrid M. |author4=Bardeen, Christopher J. |author5=Ozkan, Mihrimah |year=2007|title = Hierarchical placement and associated optoelectronic impact of carbon nanotubes in polymer-fullerene solar cells|journal = Nano Letters|volume = 7|issue = 7|pages = 1973–1979|doi = 10.1021/nl070717l|pmid = 17570731|bibcode = 2007NanoL...7.1973C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though CNTs have shown potential in the photoactive layer, they have not resulted in a solar cell with a power conversion efficiency greater than the best tandem organic cells (6.5% efficiency).&lt;ref name="Efficient tandem polymer solar cells fabricated by all-solution processing"&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Young Kim|last = Jin|author2=Lee, Kwanghee |author3=Coates, Nelson E. |author4=Moses, Daniel |author5=Nguyen, Thuc-Quyen |author6=Dante, Mark |author7= Heeger, Alan J., | year=2007|title = Efficient tandem polymer solar cells fabricated by all-solution processing|journal = Science|volume = 317|issue = 5835|pages = 222–225|pmid = 17626879|doi = 10.1126/science.1141711|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..222K}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, it has been shown in most of the previous investigations that the control over a uniform blending of the electron donating conjugated polymer and the electron accepting CNT is one of the most difficult as well as crucial aspects in creating efficient photocurrent collection in CNT-based OPV devices. Therefore, using CNTs in the photoactive layer of OPV devices is still in the initial research stages and there is still room for novel methods to better take advantage of the beneficial properties of CNTs.

One issue with utilizing SWCNTs for the photoactive layer of PV devices is the mixed purity when synthesized (about 1/3 metallic and 2/3 semiconducting).

To maximize light absorption, the inverted device structure was used with a zinc oxide nanowire layer penetrating the active layer to minimize collection length. Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) was utilized as a high work function hole transport layer to maximize voltage.&lt;ref name="Gong, M. 2014"/&gt;

Cells fabricated with this architecture have achieved record power conversion efficiencies of 3.1%, higher than any other solar cell materials that utilize CNTs in the active layer. This design also has exceptional stability, with the PCE remaining at around 90% over a period of 30 days.&lt;ref name="Gong, M. 2014"/&gt; The exceptional chemical stability of carbon nanomaterials enables excellent environmental stability compared to most organic photovoltaics that must be encapsulated to reduce degradation.

Relative to the best of polymer-fullerene heterojunction solar cells that have PCEs of about 10%,&lt;ref name="Zhu, R. 2012"&gt;Li, G.; Zhu, R.; Yang, Y., Polymer solar cells. Nat Photon 2012, 6 (3), 153-161.&lt;/ref&gt; polychiral nanotube and fullerene solar cells are still a far ways off. Nevertheless, these findings push the achievable limits of CNT technology in solar cells. The ability for polychiral nanotubes to absorb in the NIR regime is a technology that can be utilized to improve the efficiencies of future of multi-junction tandem solar cells along with increasing the lifetime and durability of future noncrystalline solar cells.

== Carbon nanotubes as a transparent electrode ==

ITO is currently the most popular material used for the transparent electrodes in OPV devices; however, it has a number of deficiencies. For one, it is not very compatible with polymeric substrates due to its high deposition temperature of around 600&amp;nbsp;°C. Traditional ITO also has unfavorable mechanical properties such as being relatively fragile. In addition, the combination of costly layer deposition in vacuum and a limited supply of indium results in high quality ITO transparent electrodes being very expensive. Therefore, developing and commercializing a replacement for ITO is a major focus of OPV research and development.

Conductive CNT coatings have recently become a prospective substitute based on wide range of methods including [[Aerosol spray|spraying]], [[spin coating]], casting, layer-by-layer, and [[Langmuir–Blodgett film|Langmuir–Blodgett]] deposition.&lt;ref name=t8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Miguel|last = Contreras |author2=Barnes, Teresa |author3=Van De Lagemaat, Jao |author4=Rumbles, Garry |author5=Coutts, Timothy J. |author6=Weeks, Chris |author7=Glatkowski, Paul |author8=Levitsky, Igor |author9=Peltola, Jorma |author10=Britz, David A. | year=2007|title = Replacement of transparent conductive oxides by single-wall carbon nanotubes in Cu(In,Ga)Se2-based solar cells|journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume = 111|issue = 38|pages = 14045–14048|doi = 10.1021/jp075507b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Single-wall carbon nanotube films"&gt;{{Cite journal|first = T.

== CNTs in dye-sensitized solar cells ==

Due to the simple fabrication process, low production cost, and high efficiency, there is significant interest in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs). Thus, improving DSSC efficiency has been the subject of a variety of research investigations because it has the potential to be manufactured economically enough to compete with other solar cell technologies. [[Titanium dioxide]] [[nanoparticle]]s have been widely used as a [[working electrode]] for DSSCs because they provide a high efficiency, more than any other metal oxide semiconductor investigated.&lt;ref name="TiO2-coated nanoporous SnO2 electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells"&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Shlomit|last = Chappel |author2=Chen, Si-Guang |author3=Zaban, Arie|year=2002|title = TiO2-coated nanoporous SnO2 electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells|journal = Langmuir|volume = 18|issue = 8|pages = 3336–3342|doi = 10.1021/la015536s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the highest conversion efficiency under air mass (AM) 1.5 (100&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) irradiation reported for this device to date is about 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Zhang|last = Zhipan |author2=Ito, S. |author3=O'Regan, B. |author4=Daibin Kuang |author5=Zakeeruddin, S.M. |author6=Liska, P. |author7=Charvet, R. |author8=Comte, P. |author9=Nazeeruddin, M.K. |author10=Pechy, P. |author11=Humphry-Baker, R. |author12=Koyanagi, T. |author13=Mizuno, T. |author14=Gratzel, M. |year=2007|title = The electronic role of the TiO2 light-scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells|journal = Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie|volume = 221|issue = 3|pages = 319–327|doi = 10.1524/zpch.2007.221.3.319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this initial success, the effort to further enhance efficiency has not produced any major results.&lt;ref name=t3&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Tae Young|last = Lee |author2=Alegaonkar, P.S. |author3=Yoo, Ji-Beom|year=2007|title = Fabrication of dye sensitized solar cell using TiO2 coated carbon nanotubes|journal = Thin Solid Films|volume = 515|issue = 12|pages = 5131–5135|doi = 10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.056|bibcode = 2007TSF...515.5131L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transport of electrons across the particle network has been a key problem in achieving higher photoconversion efficiency in nanostructured electrodes.

Promoting electron transfer through film electrodes and blocking interface states lying below the edge of the conduction band are some of the non-CNT based strategies to enhance efficiency that have been employed.&lt;ref name=t3/&gt;

With recent progress in CNT development and fabrication, there is promise to use various CNT based nanocomposites and nanostructures to direct the flow of photogenerated electrons and assist in charge injection and extraction. To assist the electron transport to the collecting electrode surface in a DSSC, a popular concept is to utilize CNT networks as support to anchor light harvesting semiconductor particles. Research efforts along these lines include organizing CdS quantum dots on SWCNTs.&lt;ref name=t10/&gt; Charge injection from excited CdS into SWCNTs was documented upon excitation of CdS nanoparticles. Other varieties of semiconductor particles including [[cadmium selenide|CdSe]] and [[cadmium telluride|CdTe]] can induce charge-transfer processes under visible light irradiation when attached to CNTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = M.|last = Olek|author2=Busgen, T. |author3=Hilgendorff, M. |author4= Giersig, M., |year=2006|title = Quantum dot modified multiwall carbon nanotubes|journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry B|volume = 110|issue = 26|pages = 12901–12904|doi = 10.1021/jp061453e|pmid = 16805589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including porphyrin and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene, organization of photoactive donor polymer and acceptor fullerene on electrode surfaces has also been shown to offer considerable improvement in the photoconversion efficiency of solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = Taku|last = Hasobe |author2=Fukuzumi, Shunichi |author3=Kamat, Prashant V.|year=2006|title = Organized assemblies of single wall carbon nanotubes and porphyrin for photochemical solar cells: Charge injection from excited porphyrin into single-walled carbon nanotubes|journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry B|volume = 110|issue = 50|pages = 25477–25484|doi = 10.1021/jp064845u|pmid = 17165996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is an opportunity to facilitate electron transport and increase the photoconversion efficiency of DSSCs utilizing the electron-accepting ability of semiconducting SWCNTs.

Other researchers fabricated DSSCs using the sol-gel method to obtain titanium dioxide coated MWCNTs for use as an electrode.&lt;ref name=t3/&gt; Because pristine MWCNTs have a [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surface and poor dispersion stability, pretreatment was necessary for this application. A relatively low-destruction method for removing impurities, [[Hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] treatment was used to generate [[carboxylic acid]] groups by oxidation of MWCNTs. Another positive aspect was the fact that the reaction gases including {{co2}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O were non-toxic and could be released safely during the oxidation process. As a result of treatment, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposed MWCNTs have a hydrophilic surface and the carboxylic acid groups on the surface have polar covalent bonding. Also, the negatively charged surface of the MWCNTs improved the stability of dispersion. By then entirely surrounding the MWCNTs with titanium dioxide nanoparticles using the sol-gel method, an increase in the conversion efficiency of about 50% compared to a conventional titanium dioxide cell was achieved. The enhanced interconnectivity between the titanium dioxide particles and the MWCNTs in the porous titanium dioxide film was concluded to be the cause of the improvement in short circuit current density. Here again, the addition of MWCNTs was thought to provide more efficient electron transfer through film in the DSSC.

One issue with utilizing SWCNTs for the photoactive layer of PV devices is the mixed purity when synthesized (about 1/3 metallic and 2/3 semiconducting). Metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs) can cause exciton recombination between the electron and hole pairs, and the junction between metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs) form Schottky barriers that reduce the hole transmission probability.&lt;ref name="Fuhrer, M.

'''Community Choice Aggregation''', abbreviated '''CCA''', also known as '''Community Choice Energy''' ('''CCE'''), '''municipal aggregation''', '''governmental aggregation''', '''electricity aggregation''', and '''community aggregation''', is an alternative to the investor owned utility energy supply system in which local entities in the United States aggregate the buying power of individual customers within a defined jurisdiction in order to secure alternative energy supply contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/community-choice-aggregation.aspx|title=Community Choice Aggregation Policies|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCA chooses the power generation source on behalf of the consumers. By aggregating purchasing power, they are able to create large contracts with generators, something individual buyers may be unable to do. The main goals of CCAs have been to either lower costs for consumers or to allow consumers greater control of their energy mix, mainly by offering "greener" generation portfolios than local utilities. Currently CCAS are possible in the United States states of [[Massachusetts]], [[Ohio]], [[California]], [[Illinois]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Rhode Island]], and served nearly 5% of Americans in over 1300 municipalities as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localpower.com/CommunityChoiceAggregation.html|title=Community Choice Aggregation - Definition by CCA Inventor Local Power Inc.|work=localpower.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How CCAs Function in Electricity Distribution ==
[[File:CCA_HowItWorks.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CCA_HowItWorks.svg|thumb|452x452px|Figure 1: How CCAs interact with utilities and consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sepapower.org/knowledge/community-choice-aggregation/|title=Community choice aggregation: How far can it push energy sector transformation? {{!}} SEPA|date=2017-06-08|work=SEPA|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
CCAs are local, not-for-profit, public agencies that take on the decision-making role about sources of energy for electricity generation. Once established, CCAs become the default service provider for the ''power mix'' delivered to customers. In a CCA service territory, the incumbent utility continues to own and maintain the transmission and distribution infrastructure, metering, and billing. In some states, CCAs may be considered ''de facto'' [[public utilities]] of a new form that aggregate regional energy demand and negotiate with competitive suppliers and developers, rather than the traditional utility business model based on monopolizing energy supply.

==Significance==
CCAs have set a number of national green power and climate protection records while reducing power bills, a rare combination that has won [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) and [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) recognition for achieving significantly higher [[renewable energy]] portfolios while maintaining rates that are competitive with conventional fossil and nuclear-based utility power. Several major U.S. population centers under CCA have switched to energy portfolios that are an order of magnitude greener than local utilities or other direct access providers, but charge no premium above utility or direct access rates. CCAs are therefore already conspicuous leaders in green power innovation, receiving U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “green power leadership awards” for achievements in renewable energy (MCE Clean Energy; Oak Park, IL, Cincinnati, OH). Newer CCAs in California like Sonoma Clean Power and San Francisco's [[CleanPowerSF]] are increasingly focused on using the policy as a platform for financing and integrating a transition to local renewable energy sources rather than grid power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://financere.nrel.gov/finance/content/newer-kids-block-community-choice-aggregators|title=The New(er) Kids on the Block: Community Choice Aggregators - Renewable Energy Project Finance|work=nrel.gov|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy Basis for CCAs ==
In the US, CCAs are permitted in seven states: Massachusetts, Ohio, California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.powermag.com/should-investor-owned-utilities-be-worried-about-community-choice-aggregation/?pagenum=1|title=Should Investor-Owned Utilities Be Worried About Community Choice Aggregation?|date=2017-05-01|work=POWER Magazine|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; but are only present in the first six.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; States must first pass legislation allowing for the formation of CCAs before an aggregate can form. Currently, only states with [[Deregulation#Energy|electric deregulation]] have passed such legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is a natural progression as electricity deregulation separates the functions of electricity generation from transmission and distribution allowing consumers to choose their electricity generator. This separation then allows for CCAs to choose the electricity generation mix on behalf of consumers without having to establish the infrastructure to move electricity. However, only 17 states and the District of Columbia have deregulated markets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.electricchoice.com/map-deregulated-energy-markets/|title=Map of Deregulated Energy States (Updated 2017) – Electric Choice|work=Electric Choice|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 33 states are considered regulated, where utilities retain a monopoly on generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early days==
In Massachusetts, where the nation's first CCA bill (Senate 447, Montigny) was first drafted by Massachusetts senate energy committee director [[Paul Douglas Fenn]] in 1995&lt;ref&gt;http://www.local.org/masscomp.html Electric Power Alert, Volume V. No.1 - January 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and enacted in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/128/power-play.html|title=Power Play|date=1 September 2008|work=fastcompany.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the locales of [[Cape Cod]] and [[Martha's Vineyard]] formed the [[Cape Light Compact]] and successfully lobbied for passage of the seminal CCA legislation. Two of the Cape Light Compact founders, [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]] [[Selectman]] Matthew Patrick and [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]] Commissioner Rob O'Leary, were subsequently elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate respectively.  Between 1995 and 2000, Fenn formed the American Local Power Project and worked with Patrick to draft and pass similar laws in Ohio, New Jersey, and other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/news/2010/04/21/power-by-the-people/|title=Power by the People|date=21 April 2010|work=bates.edu|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell has called Community Choice Aggregations “the only great exceptions to the failure of electric deregulation in the U.S.” With every CCA yet formed still in operation and charging ratepayers less per kilowatt hour than their Investor-Owned-Utilities, CCAs have proven to be reliable and capable of delivering greener power at competitive prices. Ohio’s Office of the Consumer’s Council has said that CCA is “the greatest success story” in Ohio’s competitive market, and new legislation to re-regulate utility rates in Ohio will preserve CCA even if other forms of competition are eliminated. In Massachusetts, the success of the Cape Light Compact has led to the formation of new CCAs used in towns such as [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]].

==Massachusetts==
The nation's first CCA, the Cape Light Compact, currently serves 200,000 customers, running aggressive and transparent energy efficiency programs and installing solar installations on Cape Cod schools, fire stations and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capelightcompact.org/about/|title=About Us|date=2014-03-23|work=Cape Light Compact|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other towns and cities have now formed CCAs or are working to complete the initial process.

==Ohio==
In Ohio, the nation's largest CCA was formed shortly after 1999 when the state legislature adopted a CCA law - the [[Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council]] (NOPEC), made up of approximately 500,000 customers in 138 cities and towns across eight counties, procured a power supply contract that switched electric generation fuel supply from a mix of coal and nuclear power to a mix of natural gas and a small percentage of renewably powered electricity, announcing a 70% air pollution reduction in the region's power mix.  The contract also included solar photovoltaic demonstration projects in each of the eight counties.  NOPEC's contracting process was led by Scott Ridley, an energy consultant who had worked with Fenn to develop Community Choice Aggregation in Massachusetts and was a consultant for the Cape Light Compact.

==California==
===Overview===
In 2002, California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 117, enabling CCA.&lt;ref name="ca.gov"&gt;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/asm/ab_0101-0150/ab_117_bill_20020924_chaptered.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill allowed CCAs, and mandated that customers be automatically enrolled in their local CCA, with an option to opt out. The law also makes the clarification that, in California, CCAs are by legal definition not utilities, and are legally defined in California law as electric service providers.[[Community Choice Aggregation#cite note-ca.gov-2|[2]]]

In the early days of the [[California energy crisis]], Paul Fenn, the Massachusetts Senate Energy Committee director who conducted the legal research and drafting of the original CCA legislation, formed Local Power Inc. and drafted new CCA legislation for California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.good.is/posts/giving-power-to-the-people |title=Giving Power to the People|date=20 July 2009|work=good.is|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a campaign organized by Local Power, the City and County of San Francisco led Oakland, Berkeley, Marin County, and a group of Los Angeles municipalities in adopting resolutions asking for a state CCA law in response to the failure of California's deregulated electricity market. Fenn's bill was sponsored by then Assembly Member Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) in 2001, and the bill became law (AB117) in September, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/01/07/07greenwire-community-bids-to-bypass-utilities-facing-hurdl-1763.html |title=Community Bids to Bypass Utilities Facing Hurdles in Calif.|first=Debra Kahn Of|last=Greenwire|date=7 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCA formation in California was delayed by initial political opposition by the state's investor-owned utilities. In June 2010, [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] sponsored a proposition, [[California Proposition 16 (2010)|Proposition 16]], to make it more difficult for local entities to form either municipal utilities or CCAs by requiring a two-thirds vote of the electorate rather than a simple majority, for a public agency to enter the retail [[Electrical power industry|power]] business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/13/BUND1BHQ7S.DTL&amp;type=business |title=PG&amp;E initiative on power suppliers on ballot|work=sfgate.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[PG&amp;E]] contributed over $46 million in an effort to pass the [[initiative]] (Prop 16's opponents, led by Local Power Inc. and The Utility Reform Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noprop16.org/|title=Vote No on Prop 16|date=27 June 2010|work=archive.org|accessdate=26 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627085045/http://noprop16.org/|archivedate=27 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had access to less than $100,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_c=ycw4x46esj5qqj&amp;xid=ycvk844cuw9uxh&amp;done=.ycw4x46esjoqqj|title=''Capitol Weekly'', "Initiative backers submit paperwork promising a busy 2010 cycle", October 22, 2009|work=capitolweekly.net|accessdate=26 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531024500/http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_c=ycw4x46esj5qqj&amp;xid=ycvk844cuw9uxh&amp;done=.ycw4x46esjoqqj|archivedate=31 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14759178?nclick_check=1 |title=''Santa Cruz Sentinel'', "Prop 16 is June's priciest ballot initiative, with PG&amp;E coughing up big money", March 25, 2010|work=mercurynews.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 16 was defeated.

San Francisco adopted a CCA Ordinance drafted by Fenn (86-04, Tom Ammiano) in 2004, creating a CCA program to build 360 Megawatts (MW) of solar, green distributed generation, wind generation, and energy efficiency and [[demand response]] to serve San Francisco ratepayers using [[solar bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-01-14/news/green-scheme/&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the ordinance combined the power purchasing authority of CCA with a revenue bond authority also developed by Fenn to expand the power of CCA, known as the H Bond Authority (San Francisco Charter Section 9.107.8, Ammiano), to allow the CCA to finance new green power infrastructure, worth approximately $1 Billion. In 2007 the City adopted a detailed CCA Plan also written primarily by Fenn (Ordinance 447-07, Ammiano and Mirkarimi), which established a 51% Renewable Portfolio Standard by 2017 for San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/03/financing-green-projects-51766 |title=Financing Green Projects|work=renewableenergyworld.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following decade, Sonoma and San Francisco worked with Fenn's company, Local Power Inc. on program designs focused on achieving energy localization through renewables and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/11.23.11/news-1147.html |title=The Bottom Line - Green and cheap energy: Can Sonoma County have both?|work=metroactive.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Climate Protection efforts, CCA has spread to cities throughout the Bay Area and the state. In 2007, 40 California local governments were in the process of exploring CCA, virtually all of them seeking to double, triple or quadruple the green power levels (Renewable Portfolio Standard, or "RPS) of the state's three Investor-Owned Utilities.

In April, 2014, Assemblymember Steve Bradford (D-Gardena) introduced legislation (AB 2145) that would sharply limit the ability of CCAs to enroll customers. CCA advocates and a broad coalition of local governments, business, and environmental organization rose up in opposition and defeated AB 2145.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://cleantechnica.com/2014/05/06/californias-ab-2145-threatens-community-choice-aggregates/ |title=California’s AB 2145 Threatens Community Choice Aggregates|work=cleantechnica.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AB 2145 passed in the California Assembly but died in the Senate on August 30, 2014 when the Senate's legislative session was ended without it coming up for a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no2145.org/ |title=Romantic Getaway|work=no2145.org |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators hold a hearing in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-utilities-are-losing-customers-in-droves |title=As California Mulls Retail Electricity Choice, Utilities Are Losing Customers in Droves|publisher= |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/uploadedFiles/CPUC_Public_Website/Content/News_Room/News_and_Updates/Retail%20Choice%20White%20Paper%205%208%2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marin Clean Energy ===
[[Marin County, California|Marin County]] launched California's first CCA program, Marin Clean Energy, on May 7, 2010, offering 50%-100% renewable energy at competitive prices. Marin Clean Energy (MCE) now serves approximately 255,000 customers in Marin County, Napa County and the cities of Benicia, El Cerrito, Lafayette, San Pablo, Richmond, American Canyon, Calistoga, Lafayette, Napa, St. Helena, Walnut Creek, Yountville, Concord, Danville, Martinez, Moraga, Oakley, Pinole, Pittsburg, and San Ramon.

As California's first CCA program, MCE is charting the course for a new, highly innovative approach to electricity service in the Bay Area. The organization's mission is to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by expanding access to affordable, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs while creating local economic and workforce benefits.

=== Sonoma Clean Power ===
The [[Sonoma County]]-based Center for Climate Protection formally introduced the idea of pursuing CCA in Sonoma County in the 2008 Community Climate Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://coolplan.org/ccap-report/source-material/1%20Energy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Sonoma County Water Agency]] funded the production of a [[feasibility study]] to study the question. The feasibility study was favorable and after much public review and the formation of a Joint Powers Authority to administer the agency, Sonoma Clean Power launched service on May 1, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/91826/sonoma-clean-power-flips-switch-for-first-customers/ |title=Sonoma Clean Power flips switch for first customers|date=1 May 2014|work=northbaybusinessjournal.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering power that is both greener and more locally sourced, at a lower cost than incumbent utility PG&amp;E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/New-Sonoma-utility-promises-cleaner-cheaper-power-5122295.php |title=New Sonoma utility promises cleaner, cheaper power|work=sfgate.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20130421/COMMUNITY/130429958/1033/news?p=1&amp;tc=pg]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The County and all eight eligible cities in the county eventually joined. This includes Cloverdale, Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma, and Windsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://sonomacleanpower.org/about-scp/history/ |title=History - Sonoma Clean Power|work=sonomacleanpower.org |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Mendocino County voted to join Sonoma Clean Power and the Sonoma Clean Power governing board voted to accept Mendocino County and the cities of Fort Bragg, Willits, and Point Arena into the Joint Powers Authority.

=== Silicon Valley Clean Energy ===

Silicon Valley Clean Energy (SVCE) launched its operation on April 3, 2017 by providing 100% GHG free electricity to 12 Silicon Valley communities, including Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill, Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and unincorporated County of Santa Clara. https://www.svcleanenergy.org/about-us

=== Lancaster Choice Energy ===
Lancaster Choice Energy (LCE) began providing renewable power to municipal accounts in May 2015 with broad public enrollment beginning in October. So far{{when|date=April 2017}} the city of [[Lancaster, California]] has offset almost 70% of its peak load (147 Megawatts) with renewable sources of energy. Lancaster aims to become the first net-zero city in the U.S., Lancaster is determined to generate more clean energy than it consumes, along with several private-sector partners. The City has established new rules for building more efficient, sustainable structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.energyglobe.info/awards/project/awdid/6345/#.WE88uLLavct |title=Energy Globe Award – The World Award For Sustainability|work=energyglobe.info |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of its first full year of operations in 2016 Lancaster Choice Energy had 55,000 accounts in the City of Lancaster. LCE customers receive a minimum of 36% renewable energy through the standard Clear Choice product, with many opting up to 100% renewable Smart Choice.  In addition, LCE’s first [[solar energy]] plant is now live.  Built by sPower, the plant provides 10 MW of power produced in Lancaster directly for Lancaster residents and is enough to power approximately 1,800 homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sfvbj.com/news/2016/dec/16/lancaster-solar-plant-surges-life/ |title=Lancaster Solar Plant Surges to Life - San Fernando Valley Business Journal|work=sfvbj.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Peninsula Clean Energy&lt;/big&gt;'''

Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE) (https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/) was formed in February 2016 by unanimous votes of the County of San Mateo and all 20 incorporated cities and towns in the County.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/opinions/2017-04-18/op-ed-peninsula-clean-energy-now-serving-entire-county/1776425178923.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It began supplying power to customers in the Fall of 2016 and is currently the largest community choice energy program in California.&lt;ref&gt;http://cleanpowerexchange.org/peninsula-clean-energy-now-serving-all-of-san-mateo-county-with-lower-cost-cleaner-electricity/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2017 it was offering its customers a baseline product that is both cleaner (at least 50% renewable and 75% greenhouse gas free) and at a lower cost than the incumbent utility, PG&amp;E.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/02/san-mateo-county-ditches-pge-starts-buying-cheaper-greener-energy/&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017 it was also offering its customers a 100% renewable product that was significantly less expensive than PG&amp;E’s 100% renewable product.

=== East Bay Community Energy ===
East Bay Community Energy, also abbreviated EBCE, [https://ebce.org/ ebce.org], was formed in October 2016 by Alameda County and the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro, and Union City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hayward-ca.gov/sites/default/files/ACCE%20Draft%20JPA%20agreement%20June%207%202016%20CLEAN.pdf|title=Joint Powers Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Bay Community Energy plans to begin providing electricity in June 2018 for commercial and municipal customers and November 2018 for residential customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofberkeley.info/EBCE/|title=East Bay Community Energy - City of Berkeley, CA|website=www.cityofberkeley.info|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of April 2018, EBCE plans to offer customers two energy services. Their Bright Choice service intends to use approximately the same amount of clean energy sources as [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) but it costs less. Their Brilliant 100 option service is greener and uses more renewable energy than PG&amp;E electricity at the same price. A third service is planned to be launched in November 2018 and hopes to use 100&amp; renewable energy and offered at a cost just above the PG&amp;E rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2018/04/17/east-bay-community-energy-replace-pge-berkeleys-main-electricity-provider/|title=East Bay Community Energy to be Berkeley’s electricity provider|date=2018-04-17|work=The Daily Californian|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== California Community Choice Association ===

In 2016 the six existing Community Choice agencies: MCE Clean Energy, Sonoma Clean Power, Lancaster Choice Energy, CleanPowerSF, Peninsula Clean Energy, and Silicon Valley Clean Energy formed a [[501(c)(6)]] non-profit [[trade association]], the California Community Choice Association, Cal-CCA. Cal-CCA held its first meeting in San Francisco on October 20, 2016.

According to the Clean Power Exchange, a project of the Center for Climate Protection that tracks Community Choice expansion in California, by the close of 2016, 26 of the 58 counties in California either had operating CCAs, were on schedule to launch service, or were at some earlier stage of evaluation. Over 300 cities are similarly engaged in operational or emerging CCAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cleanpowerexchange.org/california-community-choice/ |title=California Community Choice|work=cleanpowerexchange.org |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Jose Clean Energy===
On May 16, 2017 San Jose City council approved the creation of San Jose Clean Energy, making San Jose the largest city in California to adopt a CCA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/location/california/bay-area/south-bay/santa-clara-county/san-jose/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monterey Bay Community Power===
Monterey Bay Community Power (MBCP) procures carbon-free electricity for Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz Counties, including all cities except Del Rey Oaks and King City which chose not to participate. MBCP began serving commercial customers in March 2018, with residential service beginning July 2018. MBCP matches PG&amp;E rates and by default offers a 3% rebate on generation charges. MBCP is the only multi-county CCA in California, and it is geographically the largest. https://www.mbcommunitypower.org/

===Emerging CCAs in California===
Multiple cities across the state of California are considering the implementation of Community Choice aggregation programs across their districts, and many will begin to launch their program in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leanenergyus.org/cca-by-state/california/&lt;/ref&gt; California has many cities who are anticipated to launch CCAs in 2018, this includes [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[Placer County, California|Placer County]], and [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]. There are also other cities who are exploring and in the process of implementing CCA, this includes [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]], and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]].

==Illinois==
The state of Illinois adopted a CCA law in 2009, which has led to an increase of communities providing electricity services to over 2/3 of the state's population as of 2014, including the city of [[Chicago]], whose mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] is focusing the program on reducing coal power production and increasing renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midwestenergynews.com/2012/11/15/how-chicagos-municipal-aggregation-could-be-a-boon-for-renewable-energy/|title=How Chicago’s municipal aggregation could be a boon for renewable energy|first=Kari|last=Lydersen|work=midwestenergynews.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2013, 671 Illinois cities and towns (representing 80% of the state's residential electricity market) have utilized CCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==New Jersey==
New Jersey adopted a CCA law in 2003, but did not see active formation of aggregations until 2013, when [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]], and fifteen other cities and counties started CCA programs, focused on both lowering electric bills and in some cases greening their power supply, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/opinions/241598211_Herald_News__Aggregation_could_help_reduce_utility_bills.html|title=Herald News: Aggregation could help reduce utility bills|work=northjersey.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York==
The [[New York State Public Service Commission]] (PSC) has identified CCA as consistent with the stated goals of the regulatory reform "Reforming the Energy Vision” (REV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/26BE8A93967E604785257CC40066B91A?OpenDocument|title=14-M-0101: Reforming the Energy Vision (REV)|work=ny.gov|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated that local energy planning helps municipalities benefit from distributed energy resources enabled by REV.&lt;ref&gt;http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId={BDB4EB41-3E10-4BD0-AC6D-97EB40F7798D}&lt;/ref&gt; CCA legislation had been filed in the [[New York State Assembly]] in February 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://localpower.com/A08883_Summary_&amp;_bill_text_Local_Power_Inc_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s order directing the PSC to implement CCA directly under its own authority in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2015/06/03/community-choice-programs-empower-electricity-customers-in-new-york-and-beyond/|title=Community Choice Programs Empower Electricity Customers in New York and Beyond|first=Guest|last=Author|date=3 June 2015|work=edf.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, non-profit organization Sustainable Westchester submitted a petition to the PSC on behalf of its member municipalities to implement a CCA demonstration program in [[Westchester County]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sustainablewestchester.org/images/toolkits/CCA/CCA_Sustainable_Westchester_petition.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PSC granted the Order on February 26, 2015 authorizing Sustainable Westchester to put out an RFP and award contracts for both electric and natural gas supply for residents and small businesses within municipalities in the county that pass a resolution to join the CCA: "The Sustainable Westchester pilot is expected to provide valuable experience on CCA design and outcomes that, in addition to the many comments in that proceeding, will assist the Commission in making a determination on statewide implementation of CCA."&lt;ref&gt;http://sustainablewestchester.org/images/toolkits/CCA/CCA_PSC_approval_pressrelease.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program launched in 2015, becoming the first operational CCA in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sustainablewestchester.org/community-toolkits/cca |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024213027/http://sustainablewestchester.org/community-toolkits/cca |archivedate=2016-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar local CCA organizing efforts are underway in [[Ulster County]], [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]], [[Hudson Highlands]], and other communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-clean-energy-aggregation-empowers-neighborhoods|title=How clean energy aggregation empowers neighborhoods|first=Lea|last=Lupkin|date=19 October 2015|work=greenbiz.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhode Island ==
The Utility Restructuring Act of 1996 deregulated the utility market within Rhode Island, allowing consumers to choose their electricity generation supplier and CCAs to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ripuc.org/utilityinfo/electric/ura1996summ.html|title=RIPUC - Summary of Major Provisions of the RI Utility Restructuring Act|website=www.ripuc.org|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this act allowed for the creation of CCAs, there are currently no residential or small business CCAs available for private consumers to join. The only CCA option is for municipal facilities.

Rhode Island Energy Aggregation Program (REAP)

The Reap program “is operated by the Rhode Island League of Cities &amp; Towns and serves 36 of Rhode Island’s 39 municipalities and four school districts”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leanenergyus.org/cca-by-state/rhode-island/|title=Lean Energy U.S.   –  Rhode Island|website=www.leanenergyus.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reap program facilitated the purchase of electricity by the municipal entity by submitting requests for proposals, reviewing bids from approved electricity generators, and selecting companies that they believe will be the ideal provider for each municipality. The program reported in 2012 it had achieved cost savings of 20-30% over the standard offer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Advantages and Disadvantages == 
There are advantages and disadvantages associated with the implementation of  Community Choice Aggregation across different localities. CCA provides benefits like providing a customer choice, reduced energy costs, renewable energy, and environmental benefits. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Community Choice Aggregation Pilot Program|date=September 2009|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2009publications/CEC-500-2009-003/CEC-500-2009-003.PDF|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By providing customer choice, customers have the ability to be enrolled in CCA or maintain their current utility provider. Customers are automatically enrolled in the program but they can choose to opt out of it. CCAs reduce energy costs, lowering rates for customers. This also increases the use of affordable renewable energy, provided through wind, solar, and geothermal steam. This provides environmental benefits for communities because it reduces natural gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Community Choice Aggregation Pilot Program|date=September 2009|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2009publications/CEC-500-2009-003/CEC-500-2009-003.PDF|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also disadvantages associated with the implementation of CCAs. Potential issues associated with the implementation include political and financial obstacles. CCAs can encounter groups lobbying against its implementation, setbacks from [[Investor-owned utility|IOUs]], exit fees, and even disadvantages associated with the opt out choices. 

On the political level, local government can be opposed by groups and organizations. An example of this is when the IOU [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] opposed the creation of CCA by supporting [[California Proposition 16 (2010)|California Proposition 16 ]] in 2010, which would make it difficult for California to implement CCAs across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Community Choice Aggregation in California|date=2010|url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/classes/es196/projects/2010final/FaulknerK_2010.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another utility provider who took action was [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]] who attempted to stop local government from implementing Community choice aggregation programs. SDG&amp;E created a separate entity, that would allow them to lobby against CCAs in San Diego County. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Community choice' could provide cheaper, greener electricity for San Diego, report says|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-me-san-diego-caa-20170712-story.html|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=The San Diego Union Tribune|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other issues that can arise from the development of community choice aggregation include the development of exit fees, specifically in the state of California. This is an issue for CCAs in the state of California because it allows  [[Investor-owned utility|Investor-owned utility (IOU)]] to raise prices through a Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California PUC Allows State's Largest Utility to Charge Customers More for Joining CCAs|url=http://www.govtech.com/fs/California-PC-Allows-States-Largest-Utility-to-Charge-Customers-More-for-Joining-CCAs.html|website=Govtech.org|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Community Choice Customer Perspective on the PCIA, The Utility Power Charge Indifference Adjustment|date=April 2016|url=http://cleanpowerexchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCIA-Policy-Points-CCA-Perspective-CPX-Version-v2.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it more expensive for customers to join CCA programs because there will be a fee to customers when they choose to stop using bundled services provided by their utility provider and start using a CCA program. The main issues revolving PCIA is the transparency of the program, accountability of the agencies, and proper valuation of costs associated with the exit fees. Exit fees are put on CCA users to compensate for the cost that would be put on those remaining with IOU services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Promises and Challenges of Community Choice Aggregation in California|date=July 2017|url=http://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/The%20Promises%20and%20Challenges%20of%20Community%20Choice%20Aggregation%20in%20CA.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costs such as the exit fees and increased rates can be a disadvantage as CCAs can raise prices for customers. Rate setters and local officials can set CCA prices which can be a disadvantage if local government acts on their own self-interest or if local government lacks the knowledge to make decisions about CCA and prices in their localities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Growth and Impacts of California Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) Programs|date=28 April 2017|url=https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/14194/Xia_MPvF.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The choice to opt out can be a benefit for customer choice but it can also be a risk for CCA programs because if there are many customers choosing to opt out of the services, this can result in financial instability among the CCA. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peninsula Clean Energy CCA Technical Study|date=16 October 2016|url=https://www.peninsulacleanenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FINAL-Peninsula-Clean-Energy-CCA-Technical-Study.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''DC-to-DC converter''' is an [[electronic circuit]] or electromechanical device that converts a source of [[direct current]] (DC) from one [[voltage]] level to another. It is a type of [[Electric power conversion|electric power converter]]. Power levels range from very low (small batteries) to very high (high-voltage power transmission).

==History==
{{See also|Antique radio#Car radios}}
Before the development of power semiconductors and allied technologies, one way to convert the voltage of a DC supply to a higher voltage, for low-power applications, was to convert it to AC by using a [[vibrator (electronic)|vibrator]], followed by a step-up [[transformer]] and [[rectifier]].&lt;ref name=vib&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioremembered.org/vpwrsup.htm |title=Vibrator Power Supplies |newspaper=Radioremembered.org |date=  |accessdate= 18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brorein2012"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For higher power an electric motor was used to drive a generator of the desired voltage (sometimes combined into a single "dynamotor" unit, a motor and generator combined into one unit, with one winding driving the motor and the other generating the output voltage). These were relatively inefficient and expensive procedures used only when there was no alternative, as to power a car radio (which then used thermionic valves/tubes requiring much higher voltages than available from a 6 or 12&amp;nbsp;V car battery).&lt;ref name=vib/&gt; The introduction of power semiconductors and integrated circuits made it economically viable to use techniques as described below, for example to convert the DC power supply to high-frequency AC, use a transformer—small, light, and cheap due to the high frequency—to change the voltage, and rectify back to DC.&lt;ref&gt;There is at least one example of a very large (three refrigerator-sized cabinets) and complex pre-transistor switching regulator using thyratron gas-filled tubes, although they appear to be used as regulators rather than for DC-to-DC conversion as such. This was the 1958 power supply for the IBM&amp;nbsp;704 computer, using 90&amp;nbsp;kW of power.[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/223-6818_704_CE_Manual/736_741_746_PwrSupply_CE_Oct58.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Although by 1976 transistor car radio receivers did not require high voltages, some [[amateur radio]] operators continued to use vibrator supplies and dynamotors for mobile [[transceiver]]s requiring high voltages, although transistorised power supplies were available.&lt;ref name=arrl1976&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RadioAmateurHandbook1976 Radio Amateur's Handbook 1976, pub. [[ARRL]], p331-332]&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was possible to derive a ''lower'' voltage from a higher with a linear electronic circuit, or even a resistor, these methods dissipated the excess as heat; energy-efficient conversion only became possible with solid-state switch-mode circuits.

== Uses ==
{{See also|High-voltage direct current}}
DC to DC converters are used in portable electronic devices such as [[cellular phone]]s and [[laptop computer]]s, which are supplied with power from [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] primarily. Such electronic devices often contain several sub-[[Electrical network|circuits]], each with its own voltage level requirement different from that supplied by the battery or an external supply (sometimes higher or lower than the supply voltage).  Additionally, the battery voltage declines as its stored energy is drained.  Switched DC to DC converters offer a method to increase voltage from a partially lowered battery voltage thereby saving space instead of using multiple batteries to accomplish the same thing.

Most DC to DC converter circuits also regulate the output voltage. Some exceptions include high-efficiency [[LED power sources]], which are a kind of DC to DC converter that regulates the current through the LEDs, and simple [[charge pump]]s which double or triple the output voltage.

DC to DC converters developed to maximize the energy harvest for [[photovoltaic systems]] and for [[wind turbine]]s are called [[power optimizer]]s.

Transformers used for voltage conversion at mains frequencies of 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz must be large and heavy for powers exceeding a few watts. This makes them expensive, and they are subject to energy losses in their windings and due to eddy currents in their cores. DC-to-DC techniques that use transformers or inductors work at much higher frequencies, requiring only much smaller, lighter, and cheaper wound components. Consequently these techniques are used even where a mains transformer could be used; for example, for domestic electronic appliances it is preferable to rectify mains voltage to DC, use switch-mode techniques to convert it to high-frequency AC at the desired voltage, then, usually, rectify to DC. The entire complex circuit is cheaper and more efficient than a simple mains transformer circuit of the same output.

== Electronic conversion ==
Practical electronic converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC voltage level to another, which may be higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging.&lt;ref name="Howard2015"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due to the use of power [[Field-effect transistor|FETs]], which are able to switch more efficiently with lower switching losses at higher frequencies than power [[bipolar transistors]], and use less complex drive circuitry.
Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the [[Flyback_diode|flywheel diode]] by [[synchronous rectification]]&lt;ref name="Sangwine2007"&gt;{{cite book

|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a power FET, whose "on resistance" is much lower, reducing switching losses. Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or semiconductor rectifier, or synchronous rectifier contacts on the vibrator.

Most DC-to-DC converters are designed to move power in only one direction, from dedicated input to output. However, all switching regulator topologies can be made bidirectional and able to move power in either direction by replacing all diodes with independently controlled [[active rectification]]. A bidirectional converter is useful, for example, in applications requiring [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] of vehicles, where power is supplied ''to'' the wheels while driving, but supplied ''by'' the wheels when braking.

Although they require few components, switching converters are electronically complex. Like all high-frequency circuits, their components must be carefully specified and physically arranged to achieve stable operation and to keep switching noise ([[Radio frequency interference|EMI / RFI]]) at acceptable levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279232 |title=Understand and reduce DC/DC switching-converter ground noise |newspaper=Eetimes.com |date=21 November 2011 |author=Jeff Barrow of Integrated Device Technology, Inc.|accessdate= 18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their cost is higher than linear regulators in voltage-dropping applications, but their cost has been decreasing with advances in chip design.

DC-to-DC converters are available as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) requiring few additional components. Converters are also available as complete [[hybrid circuit]] modules, ready for use within an electronic assembly.

[[Linear regulator]]s which are used to output a stable DC independent of input voltage and output load from a higher but less stable input by [[Joule heating|dissipating excess volt-amperes as heat]], could be described literally as DC-to-DC converters, but this is not usual usage. (The same could be said of a simple [[voltage drop]]per resistor, whether or not stabilised by a following [[voltage regulator]] or [[Zener diode]].)

There are also simple [[#Capacitive|capacitive]] [[voltage doubler]] and [[Dickson multiplier]] circuits using diodes and capacitors to multiply a DC voltage by an integer value, typically delivering only a small current.

=== Magnetic===

In these DC-to-DC converters, energy is periodically stored within and released from a [[magnetic field]] in an [[inductor]] or a [[transformer]], typically within a frequency range of 300&amp;nbsp;kHz to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. By adjusting the [[duty cycle]] of the charging voltage (that is, the ratio of the on/off times), the amount of power transferred to a load can be more easily controlled, though this control can also be applied to the input current, the output current, or to maintain constant power. Transformer-based converters may provide isolation between input and output.  In general, the term ''DC-to-DC converter'' refers to one of these switching converters. These circuits are the heart of a [[switched-mode power supply]]. Many topologies exist. This table shows the most common ones.

In addition, each topology may be:
; Hard switched: Transistors switch quickly while exposed to both full voltage and full current
; Resonant: An [[LC circuit]] shapes the voltage across the transistor and current through it so that the transistor switches when either the voltage or the current is zero

Magnetic DC-to-DC converters may be operated in two modes, according to the current in its main magnetic component (inductor or transformer):
; Continuous: The current fluctuates but never goes down to zero
; Discontinuous: The current fluctuates during the cycle, going down to zero at or before the end of each cycle
A converter may be designed to operate in continuous mode at high power, and in discontinuous mode at low power.

The [[H-Bridge|half bridge]] and [[flyback converter|flyback]] topologies are similar in that energy stored in the magnetic core needs to be dissipated so that the core does not saturate. Power transmission in a flyback circuit is limited by the amount of energy that can be stored in the core, while forward circuits are usually limited by the I/V characteristics of the switches.

Although MOSFET switches can tolerate simultaneous full current and voltage (although thermal stress and [[electromigration]] can shorten the [[MTBF]]), bipolar switches generally can't so require the use of a [[snubber]] (or two).

High-current systems often use multiphase converters, also called interleaved converters.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Capacitive ===

{{main|Charge pump}}
Switched capacitor converters rely on alternately connecting capacitors to the input and output in differing topologies.  For example, a switched-capacitor reducing converter might charge two capacitors in series and then discharge them in parallel.  This would produce the same output power (less that lost to efficiency of under 100%) at, ideally, half the input voltage and twice the current.  Because they operate on discrete quantities of charge, these are also sometimes referred to as [[charge pump]] converters. They are typically used in applications requiring relatively small currents, as at higher currents the increased efficiency and smaller size of switch-mode converters makes them a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Control of Parallel Converters for Load Sharing with Seamless Transfer between Grid Connected and Islanded Modes|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/14216/|website = eprints.qut.edu.au|date = 2008|access-date = 2016-01-19|first = Ritwik|last = Majumder|first2 = Arindam|last2 = Ghosh|first3 = Gerard F.|last3 = Ledwich|first4 = Firuz|last4 = Zare}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also used at extremely high voltages, as magnetics would break down at such voltages.

==Electromechanical conversion==
{{Main|Motor-generator}}
[[File:Rotierender Umformer.jpg|thumb|right|A motor generator with separate motor and generator.]]
A motor-generator set, mainly of historical interest, consists of an [[electric motor]] and generator coupled together. A ''[[dynamotor]]'' combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both  the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets.&lt;ref name=arrl1976/&gt; Typically the motor coils are driven from a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] on one end of the shaft, when the generator coils output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller in size than a pair of machines, and may not have any exposed drive shafts.

Motor-generators can convert between any combination of DC and AC voltage and phase standards. Large motor-generator sets were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller units were used to convert battery power (6, 12 or 24 V DC) to a high DC voltage, which was required to operate [[vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve) equipment.

For lower-power requirements at voltages higher than supplied by a vehicle battery, vibrator or "buzzer" power supplies were used. The vibrator oscillated mechanically, with contacts that switched the polarity of the battery many times per second, effectively converting DC to [[square wave]] AC, which could then be fed to a transformer of the required output voltage(s).&lt;ref name=vib/&gt; It made a characteristic buzzing noise.

== Electrochemical conversion==
A further means of DC to DC conversion in the kilowatts to megawatts range is presented by using [[Flow battery|redox flow batteries]] such as the [[vanadium redox battery]].

== Chaotic behavior ==
DC-to-DC converters are subject to different types of [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] dynamics such as [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last= Tse|first= Chi K.|author2= Bernardo, Mario Di |title= Complex behavior in switching power converters| publisher=  Proceedings of the IEEE |year=2002| pages=768–781}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crisis (dynamical systems)|crisis]], and [[intermittency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Study of bifurcation and chaos in dc-dc boost converter using discrete-time map |last= Iqbal|first= Sajid| year= 2014| doi=10.1109/ICMC.2014.7231874|publisher=  IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Control (ICMC'2014) 2014.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Fossas|first= , Enric|author2= Olivar, Gerard|title= Study of chaos in the buck converter | publisher=  Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications, IEEE Transactions on |year=1996|pages=13–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
;Step-down
:A converter where output voltage is lower than the input voltage (such as a [[buck converter]]).
;Step-up
:A converter that outputs a voltage higher than the input voltage (such as a [[boost converter]]).
;Continuous current mode
:Current and thus the magnetic field in the inductive energy storage never reach zero.
;Discontinuous current mode
:Current and thus the magnetic field in the inductive energy storage may reach or cross zero.
;Noise
:Unwanted electrical and electromagnetic [[signal noise]], typically switching artifacts.
;RF noise
:Switching converters inherently emit [[radio waves]] at the switching frequency and its harmonics. Switching converters that produce triangular switching current, such as the [[Split-Pi]], [[forward converter]], or [[Ćuk converter]] in continuous current mode, produce less harmonic noise than other switching converters.&lt;ref name="hoskins" /&gt; RF noise causes [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). Acceptable levels depend upon requirements, e.g. proximity to RF circuitry needs more suppression than simply meeting regulations.
;Input noise
:The input voltage may have non-negligible noise. Additionally, if the converter loads the input with sharp load edges, the converter can emit RF noise from the supplying power lines. This should be prevented with proper filtering in the input stage of the converter.
;Output noise
:The output of an ideal DC-to-DC converter is a flat, constant output voltage. However, real converters produce a DC output upon which is superimposed some level of electrical noise. Switching converters produce switching noise at the switching frequency and its harmonics. Additionally, all electronic circuits have some [[thermal noise]]. Some sensitive radio-frequency and analog circuits require a power supply with so little noise that it can only be provided by a linear regulator.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some analog circuits which require a power supply with relatively low noise can tolerate some of the less-noisy switching converters, e.g. using continuous triangular waveforms rather than square waves.&lt;ref name="hoskins"&gt;[http://www.linear.com/docs/4173 Making -5V 14-bit Quiet, section of Linear Technology Application Note 84, Kevin Hoskins, 1997, pp 57-59]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fails verification|date=January 2016|reason=application note is about the excellent PSRR of a particular ADC}}

An '''electric unicycle''' is a self-balancing [[personal transporter]] with a [[unicycle|single wheel]]. The rider controls the speed by leaning forwards or backwards, and steers by twisting the unit using their feet.  The self-balancing mechanism uses [[gyroscope]]s, [[accelerometer]]s in a similar way to that used by the [[Segway PT]].

;Theory of operation
Most commercial units are self-balancing in the direction of travel only (single axis) with lateral stability being provided by the rider; more complex fully self-balancing dual-axis devices also need to self-balance from side to side. The control mechanisms of both use [[control moment gyroscope]]s, [[reaction wheel]]s and/or auxiliary pendulums and can be considered to be [[inverted pendulum]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Early experimentation===
:''See also [[Monowheel]]
A hand-power [[monowheel]] was patented in 1869 by Richard C. Hemming&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|92528|Improvement in velocipede, 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a pedal-power unit patented in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|325548|US Patent 325,548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various motorized monowheels were developed and demonstrated during the 1930s without commercial success&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/monowheels/|title=One-wheeled motorcycles: As cool as they are wildly dangerous|work=Wired|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles F.

'''Flight dynamics''' is the study of the performance, stability, and control of vehicles [[flight|flying]] through the air or in [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stengel | first = Robert F. | author-link = | title = Aircraft Flight Dynamics (MAE 331) course summary | date = | year = 2010 | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/MAE331.html | accessdate = November 16, 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with how forces acting on the vehicle influence its speed and attitude with respect to time.

In fixed-wing aircraft, the changing orientation of the vehicle with respect to the local air flow is represented by two critical parameters, angle of attack ("alpha") and angle of sideslip ("beta"). These angles describe the vector direction of airspeed, important because they are the principal source of modulations in the aerodynamic forces and moments applied to the aircraft.

Spacecraft flight dynamics involve three forces: propulsive (rocket engine), gravitational, and lift and drag (when traveling through the earth's or any other atmosphere).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent.&lt;/ref&gt; Because aerodynamic forces involved with spacecraft flight are very small, this leaves gravity as the dominant force.

Aircraft and spacecraft share a critical interest in their orientation with respect to the earth horizon and heading, and this is represented by another set of angles,&lt;ref name="answersforpilots.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answersforpilots.com/116/how-aeroplane-change-their-direction|title=Answersforpilots.com|author=|date=|website=answersforpilots.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aircraft principal axes|"yaw", "pitch", and "roll"]], which angles match their colloquial meaning, but also have formal definition as an Euler sequence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orientation (geometry)#Mathematical representations]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}} These angles are the product of the rotational equations of motion, where orientation responds to torque, just as the velocity of a vehicle responds to forces. For all flight vehicles, these two sets of dynamics, rotational and translational, operate simultaneously and in a coupled fashion to evolve the vehicle's state (orientation and velocity) trajectory.

==Aircraft==
[[Image:Yaw_Axis_Corrected.svg|thumb|right|Axes to control the attitude of a plane]]
{{main|Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)}}
{{hatnote|This section focuses on fixed-wing aircraft. For other kinds see [[aircraft]].}}
Flight dynamics is the science of air-vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] with respect to the three [[aircraft principal axes|aircraft's principal axes]] about its [[center of mass]], known as ''roll'', ''pitch'' and ''yaw''&lt;ref name="answersforpilots.com"/&gt;

Aircraft engineers develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation ([[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the center of gravity of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw. For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the center of gravity of the [[aircraft]], causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

Roll, pitch and yaw refer, in this context, to rotations about the [[Aircraft principal axes|respective axes]] starting from a defined equilibrium state. The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] angle on a ship. Yaw is known as "heading".

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [[angle of attack]] (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" for example a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] in a fixed-wing aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Spacecraft and satellites==
{{main|Flight dynamics (spacecraft)}}
[[Image:rollpitchyaw.jpg|thumb|right|Axes to control the attitude of a satellite]]
The forces acting on spacecraft are of three types: [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); [[gravitation]]al force exerted by the Earth and other celestial bodies; and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic lift and drag]] (when flying in the atmosphere of the Earth or another body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, solar power generation, communications, or astronomical observation).

The flight dynamics of spacecraft differ from those of aircraft in that the aerodynamic forces are of very small, or vanishingly small effect for most of the vehicle's flight, and cannot be used for attitude control during that time. Also, most of a spacecraft's flight time is usually unpowered, leaving gravity as the dominant force.

'''Formosa Airlines Flight 7601''' was an aviation accident that killed 16 people on 10 August 1997 in [[Beigan, Lienchiang|Beigan]], [[Matsu Islands]], [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]], Republic of China.

==Accident==

Formosa Airlines Flight 7601, a [[Dornier Do 228]] took off from [[Taipei Sungshan Airport]] at 07:37 local time with 14 passengers and two pilots on board for a flight to [[Matsu Beigan Airport]]. Rain and high winds caused the plane to miss its first approach to Matsu Beigan Airport.  During its go around, the pilot turned right instead of left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planecrashinfo.com/1997/1997-40.htm Formosa Airlines Flight 7601 at planecrashinfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft crashed and caught fire after it struck a military [[water tower]] approximately one kilometer from the airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19970810-0 Formosa Airlines Flight 7601 at Aviation Safety Network]&lt;/ref&gt; All 16 passengers and crew on board were killed.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pZxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HBUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6503,1619706&amp;dq=fujian+china+plane+crash&amp;hl=en 16 killed as Taiwan plane crashes into hill]."

'''''Halichoeres maculipinna''''' (common name '''clown wrasse''') is a species of tropical fish that lives throughout the [[Caribbean Sea]] and adjacent parts of the western [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is a carnivorous, multi-colored [[wrasse]] that is common throughout its range.

==Description==
''Halichoeres maculipinna'' is generally less than {{convert|120|mm|in}} long. The fish is slightly elongated with a nearly [[symmetrical]] upper and lower body. It has a pointed snout and rows of small teeth in its upper and lower jaws with two sets of canines in each (at the front and corners of its mouth). Its pectoral fin has fourteen rays, its dorsal fin has eleven rays and nine spines, and its anal fin has eleven rays and three spines.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

Its dorsal side is yellow and is separated from its white ventral side by a black band. It has three red lines across the top of its head, and it may have a dark spot on its dorsal fin.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

==Habitat==
The fish lives in the northwestern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Its range extends from the state of [[North Carolina]] in the [[United States]], to the island of [[Bermuda]] and as far south as [[Colombia]]. It is also endemic to Caribbean islands such as [[Cuba]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] as well as Central American countries such as [[Belize]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The fish was once believed to live in [[Brazil]], but a study conducted in 2004 demonstrated that these fish belonged to a different species.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Rocha, L. | author2 = Craig, M. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Halichoeres maculipinna'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2010 | page = e.T187549A8565334 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2010 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/187549/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2010-4.RLTS.T187549A8565334.en | access-date = 5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Halichoeres maculipinna'' lives on the tops of [[coral reef]]s and in rocky areas. The fish is generally found {{convert|1|to|30|m|ft|sigfig=1}} beneath the surface. It has also been reported to live within Venezuelan ''[[Sargassum]]'' beds.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Behavior==

===Diet===
The fish is a [[carnivore]]. It primarily consumes [[invertebrates]] and ray-finned fish.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last1=McEachran|first1=John|last2=Fechelm|first2=Janice|title=Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico, Volume 2|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=518|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-e3gHMy57QEC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=Halichoeres+maculipinna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=npbIU8WYA8WayAT6kYHgBQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Halichoeres%20maculipinna&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Like many other wrasses, the fish is a [[sequential hermaphroditism|sequential hermaphrodite]]. It can change its sex from male to female. It mates through [[lek mating]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; During this process, males are noted to be particularly territorial.  Reproduction occurs through [[spawning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=D.R.|title=The Social and Mating System of Two Labrid Fishes, Halichoeres maculipinna and H. garnotti, off the Coast of Panama|publisher=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
While a quantitative assessment of the population of ''Halichoeres maculipinna'' has not been performed, it is widespread and fairly common throughout its range. The species faces no major threats beyond occasional collection for the aquarium trade.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

'''The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company''' was a [[logging]] operation located in the [[Sequoia National Forest]] .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Battle against Rough fire intensifies as blaze bears down on Hume Lake|url = http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article31640498.html|website = fresnobee|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1878, Congress passed the [[Timber and Stone Act]] to encourage private ownership of timber land and facilitate logging.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver"&gt;Lary M. Dilsaver &amp; William C. Tweed, ''Challenge of the Big Trees''. Sequoia Natural History Association, Inc. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time in American history, resources such as timber were largely viewed as unlimited resources that could best be used for commercial gain and economic growth.  Despite a growing human presence in other regions of California, the Sierra Nevada was still a relatively uncharted and virgin land up until the late 1860s due to its formidable and rugged terrain.  The Timber and Stone Act facilitated commercial exploitation of these mountain areas, requiring a modest fee and filing in order to transfer complete and unrestrained ownership of federal land to any individual.  Tracts were sold in {{convert|160|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcels to applicants, who at most times were illegally recruited and paid by corporate interests to file claims then transfer their ownership to lumber companies.  As a result of this practice, large tracts of [[old growth]] forest passed from the federal government to lumber companies in relatively short order during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dilsaver"/&gt;

=== Kings River Lumber Company ===
In 1888 Hiram T. Smith and Austin D. Moore purchased 30,000 acres of land in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]] and founded the Kings River Lumber Company. A terminus was needed and the town of Sanger offered the company 65 acres adjacent to railroad access. On August 29, 1889 the company agreed to the purchase and started construction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Smith originally planned to build a railroad to transport lumber down the mountains but instead built a log flume. It was constructed by between the years of 1889 and 1890. On September 3, 1890, 2500 people attended "Flumeopolis", a celebration and barbecue to mark the completion of the flume.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Out West, Volume 29|last = Lummis|first = Charles|publisher = F. A. Pattee &amp; Company|year = 1908|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[log flume]] was 62 miles (100&amp;nbsp;km) in length, as tall as 300 feet. The flume transported lumber from three mills in the Sierra Nevada Mountains parallel to the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] to a lumber yard in [[Sanger, California]]. Along the route 11 "flume houses" were built where people known as "flume herders" kept the flume clear of blockages and reported any damage to the flume.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanger|last = Haugland|first = Scott|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 41–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the mills were at the headwaters of the Kings River and one was in Millwood, in the upper Kings River region. The three mills operated ten hours a day employing 300 men and had a capacity of 3 million feet of lumber per month. An additional 200 men worked for the company in Sanger at a box factory, door and sash factory, planing mill and drying yard. The company operated rail lines for transporting lumber as well as oxen known as "Heart Bulls". Their first locomotive, Shay No. 1 named "Sequoia", was a narrow gauge locomotive built by Lima Locomotive &amp; Machine Works in 1891.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Shaver, Huntington, and Hume Lakes|last = Harrison|first = Steven|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|date = March 24, 2014|isbn = 1467131431|location = 7, 17, 25, 26, 27|pages = |first2 = Michael|last2 = Semas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company operated until going bankrupt during the Depression of 1892.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Fresno County, California: With Biographical Sketches|last = Vandor|first = Paul|publisher = Historic Record Company|year = 1919|isbn = |location = Los Angeles, CA|pages = 100, 101, 160, 430, 449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sanger Lumber Company ===
Moore and Smith reopened after two years of loan negotiations as the Sanger Lumber Company. In 1894 Moore &amp; Smith founded The Sanger Lumber Company with 24,000 shares of stock totaling $600,000. Their creditors exchanged their liens for stock in the Sanger Lumber Company. For a sum of $100,000 The Moore &amp; Smith Lumber Company mortgaged their Port Discovery mill, lumber lands in Washington State, three $56,250 notes of the Kings River Lumber Company, one $1,490 note of the Pacific Pine Lumber Company and a loan of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Federal Reporter: With Key-number Annotations ..., Volume 106|last = |first = |publisher = West Publishing Company|year = 1901|isbn = |location = |pages = 574–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = California Trails High Sierra Region|last = Massey|first = Peter|publisher = Adler Publishing|date = October 1, 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = |first2 = Jeanne|last2 = Wilson|first3 = Angela|last3 = Titus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to continuing financial struggles in 1895 creditors foreclosed on the company and in 1896 moved operations to the Converse Basin named for Charles P. Converse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this period destructive lumbering techniques were practiced and an estimated 191 Million board feet of [[giant sequoia]] trees were cut while only using an estimated 20%.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hume-Bennett Lumber Company ===
The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company was formed in 1905 when Thomas Hume and Ira B. Bennett purchased the Sanger Lumber Company.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of the Flume : Sanger Depot Museum|url = http://www.sangerdepotmuseum.com/history-of-the-flume/|website = www.sangerdepotmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = PacifcNG.org|url = http://www.pacificng.com/template.php?page=roads/ca/sanger/index.htm|website = www.pacificng.com|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase included 22,240 acres ranging in elevation from 5,000 to 6200 feet. While 16,960 acres had been cut 5,280 acres of timber remained.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biennial Report of the State Forester of the State of California|last = |first = |publisher = State Board of Forestry, Office of State Forester|year = 1912|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also purchased two additional standard gauge Shay locomotives.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A fire destroyed the Converse basin sawmill in November 1905. Sparks from rail lines often caused fi so teams of two to six men patrolled during fire season.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The mill was replaced and operated for two years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By 1908 logging of giant sequoia ranging from ten to twenty feet in diameter was common,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but logging in the Converse Basin eventually became uneconomical.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The base of operations was moved from Millwood to hume and the flume was extended 17.5 miles at a cost of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hiking Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks: A Guide to the Parks' Greatest Hiking Adventures|last = Scheidt|first = Laurel|publisher = Globe Pequot|year = 2011|isbn = 0762761040|location = |pages = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began communication with [[John Samuel Eastwood]] regarding building a dam at Hume Lake. Eastwood saw the project as an opportunity to perpetuate his work with the logging industry as well as advance his work on hydro electric dams. Eastwood pushed for a multiple arch design. Hume had reservations about the proposal but eventually agreed. Final location surveys were carried out by Eastwood on June 20, 1908 and a few weeks later on June 26, 1908 construction started on a 61-foot concrete dam.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Building the Ultimate Dam: John S.

The Recession of 1913–1914 forced the company to return to logging the more profitable giant sequoia.

==== Injuries and Deaths ====

On June 13, 1914 C. M. Mooney was injured by debris from an explosion intended uproot a tree. The company was ordered to pay disability of $104.67.

On October 20, 1914 Orlando V. Carter a night watchman fell to his death through an opening in a machine room. The company was ordered to pay a death benefit to the widow of $2,490.

=== National Forest Service ===
In 1926 a forest fire destroyed 7 miles of the log flume&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in 1927 George Hume sold some of the company's assets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On April 8, 1935 he sold the holdings of the company, including the dam and 20,000 acres of land, to the [[U.S. National Forest Service]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[U.S. National Forest Service]] has incorporated the land into the [[Sequoia National Forest]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hume Lake Christian Camps ===
On January 9, 1946, 320 acres of land adjacent to Hume Lake was sold for $140,000 to Walter Warkentin and partners. The sale included the Hume Lake Hotel, store, service station, post office, 22 cottages, 22 boats, a saloon and a brothel. The land was converted into [[Hume Lake Christian Camps]] and serves as a summer camp and conference center for worship and religious studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = America's National Parks - 美国国家公园: Sequoia and Kings Canyon - Hume Lake|url = http://americabestidea.blogspot.com/2011/07/sequoia-and-kings-canyon-hume-lake.html|website = America's National Parks - 美国国家公园|date = 2011-07-24|accessdate = 2015-10-17|first = Christine|last = Ye}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Reedley Exponent &gt; Archives &gt; News &gt; Warkentin turns 100 |url=http://www.reedleyexponent.com/news/warkentin-turns/article_a94b5730-c0e6-55ca-a804-273c1a7c2367.html |website=www.reedleyexponent.com |accessdate=2017-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functional form ==
Interatomic potentials can be written as a series expansion of
functional terms that depend on the position of one, two, three, etc.
atoms at a time. Then the total energy of the system V can
be written as &lt;ref name=Lesar /&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
	V_{TOT} = \sum_{i}^N V_1(\vec r_i) + \sum_{i,j}^N V_2(\vec r_i,\vec r_j) + \sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(\vec r_i,\vec r_j,\vec r_k) + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V_1&lt;/math&gt; is the one-body term, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V_2&lt;/math&gt; the two-body term, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V_3&lt;/math&gt; the
three body term, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle N  &lt;/math&gt; the number of atoms in the system,
&lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; the position of atom i, etc. i, j and k are indices
that loop over atom positions.

Note that in case the pair potential is given per atom pair, in the two-body
term the potential should be multiplied by 1/2 as otherwise each bond is counted
twice, and similarly the three-body term by 1/6.&lt;ref name=Lesar /&gt; Alternatively,
the summation of the pair term can be restricted to cases &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;j &lt;/math&gt;
and similarly for the three-body term &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i&lt;j&lt;k &lt;/math&gt;, if
the potential form is such that it is symmetric with respect to exchange
of the j and k indices (this may not be the case for potentials
for multielemental systems).

The one-body term is only meaningful if the atoms are in an external
field (e.g. an electric field). In the absence of external fields,
the potential V should not depend on the absolute position of
atoms, but only on the relative positions. This means
that the functional form can be rewritten as a function
of interatomic distances &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r_{ij} = |\vec r_i-\vec r_j|&lt;/math&gt;
and angles between the bonds
(vectors to neighbours) &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \theta_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, in the absence of external forces, the general
form becomes

::&lt;math&gt;
	V_{TOT} =  \sum_{i,j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) + \sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(r_{ij},r_{ik},\theta_{ijk}) + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
In the three-body term &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V_3&lt;/math&gt; the
interatomic distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is not needed
since the three terms &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r_{ij},r_{ik},\theta_{ijk} &lt;/math&gt;
are sufficient to give the relative positions of three atoms
i,j,k in three-dimensional space. Any terms of order higher than
2 are also called ''many-body potentials''.
In some interatomic potentials the manybody interactions are 
embedded into the terms of a pair potential (see discussion on
EAM-like and bond order potentials below).

In principle the sums in the expressions run over all N atoms.
However, if the range of the interatomic potential is finite,
i.e. the potentials &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V(r) \equiv 0 &lt;/math&gt; above
some cutoff distance &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r_{cut}&lt;/math&gt;,
the summing can be restricted to atoms within the cutoff
distance of each other. By also using a cellular method
for finding the neighbours,&lt;ref name=AllenTildesley/&gt; the MD algorithm can be
an [[Big O notation|O(N)]] algorithm. Potentials with an infinite
range can be summed up efficiently by [[Ewald summation]]
and its further developments.

== Force calculation ==

The forces acting between atoms can be obtained by differentiation of
the total energy with respect to atom positions. That is,
to get the force on atom i one should take the three-dimensional
derivative (gradient) with respect to the position of atom i:

::&lt;math&gt;
	\vec{F}_i = -\nabla_{\vec {r}_i} V_{TOT}
&lt;/math&gt;
  
For two-body potentials this gradient reduces, thanks to the
symmetry with respect to ij in the potential form, to straightforward
differentiation with respect to the interatomic distances
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. However, for many-body
potentials (three-body, four-body, etc.) the differentiation
becomes considerably more complex 
&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Beardmore and N. Gr/onbech-Jensen.  Direct simulation of ion beam induced stressing and amorphization of silicon. Phys. Rev. B, 60:12610, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;K. Albe, J. Nord, and K. Nordlund. Dynamic charge-transfer bond-order potential for gallium nitride. Phil. Mag. A, 89:3477--3497, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;
since the potential may not be any longer symmetric with respect to ij exchange.
In other words, also the energy
of atoms k that are not direct neighbours of i can depend on the position &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \vec{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
because of angular and other many-body terms, and hence contribute to the gradient
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \nabla_{\vec{r}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Classes of interatomic potentials ==
Interatomic potentials come in many different varieties, with
different physical motivations. Even for single well-known elements such as silicon, 
a wide variety of potentials quite different in functional form and motivation have been developed.&lt;ref name=Bal92&gt;H. Balamane, T. Halicioglu, and W. A. Tiller. Comparative study of 
silicon empirical interatomic potentials. Phys. Rev. B, 46(4):2250, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
The true interatomic interactions
are [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] in nature, and there is no known
way in which the true interactions described by
the [[Schrödinger equation]] or [[Dirac equation]] for
all electrons and nuclei could be cast into an analytical
functional form. Hence all analytical interatomic
potentials are by necessity [[approximation]]s.

=== Pair potentials ===
The arguably simplest widely used interatomic interaction model is the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lennard-Jones |first=J. E. |year=1924 |title=On the Determination of Molecular Fields |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A |volume=106 |issue=738 |pages=463–477 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1924.0082 |bibcode = 1924RSPSA.106..463J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
V_{LJ} = 4\varepsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right] 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the [[potential well]]
and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the distance at which the potential crosses zero.
The term proportional to &lt;math&gt; \textstyle 1/r^6 &lt;/math&gt;in the potential can be motivated from a classical or quantum mechanical
description of the interaction between induced [[electric dipole]]s.&lt;ref name=Kittel/&gt;  This
potential seems to be quite accurate for noble gases, and is widely
used for systems where dipole interactions are significant, including 
in [[force field (chemistry)|chemistry force fields]] to describe intermolecular interactions.

Another simple and widely used pair potential is the
[[Morse potential]], which consists simply of a sum of two exponentials.
::&lt;math&gt;V(r) = D_e ( e^{-2a(r-r_e)}-2e^{-a(r-r_e)} )&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt; \textstyle D_e&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium bond energy and
&lt;math&gt; \textstyle r_e&lt;/math&gt; the bond distance. The Morse
potential has been applied to studies of molecular vibrations and solids 
,&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Girifalco and V. G. Weizer. Application of the Morse potential function to cubic metals. Phys. Rev., 114(3):687, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and although rarely used anymore, inspired the functional form
of more modern potentials such as the bond-order potentials.

Ionic materials are often described by a sum of a 
short-range repulsive term, such as the
[[Buckingham potential|Buckingham pair potential]], and a long-range [[Coulomb potential]]
giving the ionic interactions between the ions forming the material. The short-range
term for ionic materials can also be of many-body character
.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Feuston and S. H. Garofalini. Empirical three-body potential 
for vitreous silica. J. Chem. Phys., 89(9):5818, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pair potentials have some inherent limitations, like the inability
to describe all 3 [[elasticity (physics)|elastic constants]] of
cubic metals.&lt;ref name=Daw93/&gt; Hence modern [[molecular dynamics]] simulations 
are to a large extent carried out with different kinds of many-body potentials.

=== Many-body potentials ===
The Stilinger-Weber potential&lt;ref&gt;F. H. Stillinger and T. A. Weber. Computer simulation of local order in condensed phases of silicon. Phys. Rev. B, 31:5262, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; is a potential that has a 
two-body and three-body terms of the standard form 
::&lt;math&gt;
	V_{TOT} =  \sum_{i,j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) + \sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(r_{ij},r_{ik},\theta_{ijk})
&lt;/math&gt;
where the three-body term describes how the potential energy changes with bond bending.
It was originally developed for pure Si, but has been extended to many other
elements and compounds

and also formed the basis for other Si potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazant|first1=M. Z.|last2=Kaxiras|first2=E.|last3=Justo|first3=J.

Metals are very commonly described with what can be called
"EAM-like" potentials, i.e. potentials that share
the same functional form as the [[embedded atom model]].
In these potentials, the total potential energy is written

::&lt;math&gt;V_{TOT} = \sum_i^N F_i \left(\sum_{j} \rho (r_{ij}) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i, j}^N V_2(r_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle F_i&lt;/math&gt; is a so-called embedding function
(not to be confused with the force &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \vec F_i&lt;/math&gt;) that is a function of the sum of the so-called electron density
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho (r_{ij}) &lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle V_2 &lt;/math&gt;
is a pair potential that usually is purely repulsive. In the original
formulation &lt;ref&gt;S. M. Foiles, M. I. Baskes, and
M. S. Daw. Embedded-atom-method functions for the fcc metals cu, ag,
au, ni, pd, pt, and their alloys. Phys. Rev. B, 33(12):7983,
1986. Erratum: ibid, Phys. Rev. B 37, 10378 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; the electron
density function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho (r_{ij}) &lt;/math&gt; was obtained
from true atomic electron densities, and the embedding function
was motivated from [[density-functional theory]] as the energy needed
to 'embed' an atom into the electron density.

However, many other potentials used for metals share the same functional
form but motivate the terms differently, e.g. based
on [[Tight-binding model|tight-binding theory]]

EAM-like potentials are usually implemented as numerical tables.
A collection of tables is available at the interatomic
potential repository at NIST [http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/]

Covalently bonded materials are often described by 
[[bond order potential]]s, sometimes also called
Tersoff-like or Brenner-like potentials.

These have in general a form that resembles a pair potential:

::&lt;math&gt;
V_{ij}(r_{ij}) = V_{repulsive}(r_{ij}) + b_{ijk} V_{attractive}(r_{ij}) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where the repulsive and attractive part are simple exponential
functions similar to those in the Morse potential.
However, the [[bond strength|strength]] is modified by the environment of the atom &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; via the &lt;math&gt;b_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt;term. If implemented without
an explicit angular dependence,  these potentials
can be shown to be mathematically equivalent to 
some varieties of EAM-like potentials

=== Repulsive potentials for short-range interactions ===

For very short interatomic separations, important in [[radiation material science]],
the interactions can be described quite accurately with screened [[Coulomb potential]]s which have the general form
: &lt;math&gt; V(r_{ij}) = { 1 \over 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} {Z_1Z_2 e^2 \over r_{ij}} \varphi(r/a)&lt;/math&gt;
here φ(r) → 1 when r → 0. Here &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; are the charges of the interacting nuclei, and ''a'' is the so-called screening parameter.
A widely used popular screening function is the "Universal ZBL" one.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and U. Littmark. The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter. Pergamon, New York, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
and more accurate ones can be obtained from all-electron quantum chemistry calculations
&lt;ref&gt;K. Nordlund, N. Runeberg, and D. Sundholm. Repulsive interatomic potentials calculated using hartree-fock and density-functional theory methods. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. B, 132:45--54, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[binary collision approximation]] simulations this kind of potential can be used
to describe the [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|nuclear stopping power]].

== Potential fitting ==
Since the interatomic potentials are approximations, they by necessity all involve
parameters that need to be adjusted to some reference values. In simple
potentials such as the Lennard-Jones and Morse ones, the parameters can be
set directly to match e.g. the equilibrium bond length and bond strength
of a dimer molecule or the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive energy]] of a solid
.&lt;ref name=Kittel/&gt; However, many-body
potentials often contain tens or even hundreds of adjustable parameters.
These can be fit into a larger set of experimental data, or materials
properties derived from more fundamental simulation models such as
[[density-functional theory]]. For solids, a well-constructed many-body potential
can often describe at least the equilibrium crystal structure [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] and 
[[lattice constant]], [[Elasticity (physics)|linear elastic constants]], and
basic [[point defect]] properties of all the elements and stable compounds well.

The aim of most potential construction and fitting is to make the potential
''transferable'', i.e. that it can describe materials properties that are clearly
different from those it was fitted to (for examples of potentials explicitly aiming for this,
see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Varghese Swamy and Julian D. Gale, Transferable variable-charge interatomic potential for atomistic simulation of titanium oxides, Phys. Rev. B 62 (2000) 5406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Andrés Aguado, Leonardo Bernasconi, Paul A. Madden, A transferable interatomic potential for MgO from ab initio molecular dynamics, Chem. Phys. Lett. 356 (2002) 437&lt;/ref&gt;). As an example of demonstrated
partial transferability, a review of interatomic potentials
of Si found that for instance the Stillinger-Weber and Tersoff III potentials for Si
are indeed able to describe several (but certainly not all) materials properties they were not fitted to
.&lt;ref name=Bal92 /&gt;

The NIST interatomic potential repository provides
a collection of fitted interatomic potentials, either as fitted parameter values or numerical
tables of the potential functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/|title=Interatomic Potentials Repository Project|first=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and|last=Technology|website=www.ctcms.nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability of interatomic potentials ==
Classical interatomic potentials cannot reproduce all phenomena. Sometimes quantum description is necessary. [[Density functional theory]] is used to overcome this limitation.

The '''International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers''' ('''IBEW''') is a [[trade union|labor union]] that represents nearly 750,000 workers and retirees&lt;ref name="IBEW-WhoWeAre" /&gt; in the [[electricity|electrical]] industry in the [[United States]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref name="ibewcanada.ca"/&gt; [[Panama]],&lt;ref name="IBEW-EW0609" /&gt; [[Guam]],&lt;ref name="IBEW-EW1203" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBEW-0210" /&gt; and several [[Caribbean]] island nations; particularly [[electrician]]s, or inside wiremen, in the construction industry and [[lineman (technician)|linemen]] and other employees of public utilities. The union also represents some workers in the [[computer]], [[telecommunications]], [[broadcasting]], and other fields related to electrical work.

==Overview==
It was founded in 1891, two years before George Westinghouse won the electric current wars by lighting up the Chicago worlds fair with AC current, and before homes and businesses in the United States began receiving electricity. It is an international organization, based on the principle of collective bargaining. Its international president is Lonnie R. Stephenson, and is affiliated with the [[AFL-CIO]].

The beginnings of the IBEW were in the [[Electrical Wiremen and Linemen's Union]] No. 5221, founded in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=palladino&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palladino|first1=Grace|title=Dreams of Dignity, Workers of Vision|date=1991|publisher=International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElectricalHazards"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hazards of the Electrical Occupation|journal=Electrical Review and Western Electrician|volume=54|issue=3|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1891, after sufficient interest was shown in a national union, a convention was held on November 21, 1891 in St. Louis.  At the convention, the IBEW, then known as the National Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (NBEW), was officially formed. The [[American Federation of Labor]] gave the NBEW a charter as an AFL affiliate on December 7, 1891.  The union's official journal, ''The Electrical Worker'', was first published on January 15, 1893, and has been published ever since. At the 1899 convention in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], the union's name was officially changed to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The union went through lean times in its early years, then struggled through six years of schism during the 1910s, when two rival groups each claimed to be the duly elected leaders of the union. In 1919, as many employers were trying to drive unions out of the workplace through a national [[open shop]] campaign, the union agreed to form the Council on Industrial Relations, a bipartite body made up of equal numbers of management and union representatives with the power to resolve any collective bargaining disputes. That body still functions today, and has largely resolved strikes in the IBEW's jurisdiction in the construction industry.

In September 1941, the National Apprenticeship Standards for the Electrical Construction Industry, a joint effort among the IBEW, the [[National Electrical Contractors Association]], and the [[Federal Committee on Apprenticeship]], were established. The IBEW added additional training programs and courses as needed to keep up with new technologies, including an industrial [[electronics]] course in 1959 and an industrial [[nuclear power]] course in 1966.

Today, the IBEW conducts [[apprenticeship]] programs for electricians, linemen, and VDV (voice, data, and video) installers (who install low-voltage wiring such as computer networks), in conjunction with the [[National Electrical Contractors Association]], under the auspices of the [[National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee]] (NJATC), which allows apprentices to "earn while you learn." In Canadian jurisdictions, the IBEW does not deliver apprenticeship training, but does conduct supplemental training for government trained apprentices and journeypersons, often at little or no cost to its members. The IBEW local 353 Toronto requires all apprentices to be registered with the JAC (Joint Apprenticeship Council) for a number of safety courses, pre-apprenticeship training, pre-trade school courses, supplementary training, and pre-exam courses.

The IBEW's membership peaked in 1972 at approximately 1 million members. The membership numbers were in a slow decline throughout the rest of the 1970s and the 1980s, but have since stabilized.  One major loss of membership for the IBEW came about because of the court-ordered breakup at the end of 1982 of [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]], where the IBEW was heavily organized among both telephone workers and in AT&amp;T's manufacturing facilities.  Membership as of 2013 stands at about 750,000, according to their official website.

'''Ixtoc I''' was an exploratory oil well  being drilled by the [[semi-submersible]] [[drilling rig]] ''[[Sedco 135]]'' in the [[Bay of Campeche]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Ciudad del Carmen]], [[Campeche]] in waters {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name=Sedco&gt;{{cite web | author=John Charles Milne | title=Sedco 135 Series | url=http://www.oilcity.co.uk/home/article.asp?pageid=645 | work=OilCity | date=2 Nov 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220231335/http://www.oilcity.co.uk/home/article.asp?pageid=645 | archivedate=20 December 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 1979, the well suffered a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] resulting in one of the [[oil spill#Largest oil spills|largest oil spills]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Elena Egawhary| title=How big is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8664684.stm | work=BBC News | date=7 May 2010 |quote=oil spilled ... first Iraq War, 1991. ...

==Accident==
Mexico's state-owned oil company [[Pemex]] (Petróleos Mexicanos) was drilling a {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} deep [[oil well]] when the [[drilling rig]] ''Sedco 135'' lost [[drilling mud]] circulation.

In modern rotary drilling, mud is circulated down the [[drill pipe]] and back up the well bore to the surface. The goal is to equalize the pressure through the shaft and to monitor the returning mud for gas. Without the counter-pressure provided by the circulating mud, the pressure in the formation allowed oil to fill the well column, blowing out the well. The oil caught fire, and ''Sedco 135'' burned and collapsed into the sea.&lt;ref name=Sedco/&gt;

At the time of the accident ''Sedco 135'' was drilling at a depth of about {{convert|3600|m}} below the [[seafloor]].&lt;ref name=garmon/&gt; The day before Ixtoc suffered the blowout and resulting fire that caused her to sink, the drill bit hit a region of soft [[strata (geology)|strata]]. Subsequently, the circulation of drilling mud was lost resulting in a loss of [[hydrostatic pressure]].&lt;ref name=EIS&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/PI/PDFImages/ESPIS/3/3930.pdf | title=Ixtoc 1 Oil Spill Economic Impact Study |accessdate=2010-05-06 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] | pages=4–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than returning to the surface, the drilling mud was escaping into [[Fracture (geology)|fractures]] that had formed in the rock at the bottom of the hole. Pemex officials decided to remove the bit, run the drill pipe back into the hole and pump materials down this open-ended drill pipe in an effort to seal off the fractures that were causing the loss of circulation.

During the removal of the pipe on ''Sedco 135'', the drilling mud suddenly began to flow up towards the surface; by removing the drill-string the well was swabbed (an effect observed when mud must flow down the annulus to replace displaced drill pipe volume below the bit) leading to a [[Blowout (well drilling)#Formation kick|kick]]. Normally, this flow can be stopped by activating shear rams contained in the [[blowout preventer]] (BOP). These rams are designed to sever and seal off the well on the ocean floor; however in this case the drill collars had been brought in line with the BOP and the BOP rams were not able to sever the thick steel walls of the drill collars leading to a catastrophic blowout.

The drilling mud was followed by a large quantity of oil and gas at an increasing flow rate. The oil and gas fumes exploded on contact with the operating pump motors, starting a fire which led to the collapse of the ''Sedco 135'' [[drilling tower]]. The collapse caused damage to underlying well structures. The damage to the well structures led to the release of significant quantities of oil into the Gulf.&lt;ref name=garmon&gt;{{cite news | author=Linda Garmon| title=Autopsy of an Oil Spill | url= | work=Science News | date=25 October 1980 | volume=118 | issue=17 | pages=267–270 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume and extent of spill==
[[File:Line5134 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Spill {{circa}} September 1979]]
In the initial stages of the spill, an estimated {{convert|30,000|oilbbl|m3|sigfig=1}} of oil per day were flowing from the well.  In July 1979, the pumping of mud into the well reduced the flow to {{convert|20,000|oilbbl|m3|sigfig=1}} per day, and early in August the pumping of nearly 100,000 steel, iron, and lead balls into the well reduced the flow to {{convert|10,000|oilbbl|m3|sigfig=1}} per day. Pemex claimed that half of the released oil burned when it reached the surface, a third of it evaporated, and the rest was contained or dispersed.&lt;ref name=incident-main&gt;{{cite web | author=Emergency Response Division, Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service | title=Ixtoc I | url=http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/6250 | work=IncidentNews | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce | accessdate=30 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66rv6ZDxm?url=http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/6250 | archivedate=12 April 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican authorities also drilled two relief wells into the main well to lower the pressure of the blowout, however the oil continued to flow for three months following the completion of the first relief well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Robert Campbell | title=BP's Gulf battle echoes monster '79 Mexico oil spill | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64N57U20100524 | work=Reuters | date=May 24, 2010 | accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pemex contracted Conair Aviation to spray the chemical dispersant [[Corexit]] 9527 on the oil. A total of 493 aerial missions were flown, treating {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of oil slick. Dispersants were not used in the U.S. area of the spill because of the dispersant's inability to treat weathered oil. Eventually the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|on-scene coordinator]] (OSC) requested that Mexico stop using dispersants north of 25°N.&lt;ref name=incident-main/&gt;

In Texas, an emphasis was placed on coastal countermeasures protecting the bays and lagoons formed by the [[barrier islands]]. Impacts of oil to the barrier island beaches were ranked as second in importance to protecting inlets to the bays and lagoons. This was done with the placement of skimmers and booms. Efforts were concentrated on the Brazos-Santiago Pass, Port Mansfield Channel, Aransas Pass, and Cedar Bayou which during the course of the spill was sealed with sand. Economically and environmentally sensitive barrier island beaches were cleaned daily. Laborers used rakes and shovels to clean beaches rather than heavier equipment which removed too much sand. Ultimately, {{convert|71500|oilbbl|m3|sigfig=2}} of oil impacted {{convert|162|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of U.S. beaches, and over {{convert|10000|cuyd|m3|sigfig=1}} of oiled material were removed.&lt;ref name=incident-main/&gt;

==Containment==
In the next nine months, experts and divers including [[Red Adair]] were brought in to contain and cap the oil well.&lt;ref name=incident-main/&gt; An average of approximately {{convert|10,000|to|30000|oilbbl|m3|sigfig=1}} per day were discharged into the Gulf until it was finally capped on 23 March 1980, nearly 10 months later.&lt;ref name=incident&gt;{{cite web | author=Emergency Response Division, Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service | title=Ixtoc I: Countermeasures / Mitigation | url=http://www.incidentnews.gov/entry/508790 | work=IncidentNews | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce | accessdate=30 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510080322/http://www.incidentnews.gov/entry/508790 | archivedate=10 May 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In similarity to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] 31 years later, the list of methods attempted to remediate the leak included lowering a cap over the well, plugging the leak with mud and "junk", use of dispersants, and spending months attempting to drill relief wells.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=catastrophic-thinking Catastrophic Thinking: How to Ensure Oil Spill Disasters Do Not Happen Again]", ''[[Scientific American]]'', July 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-lost-legacy-Ixtoc-oil The lost legacy of the last great oil spill]", ''[[Scientific American]]'', July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Prevailing currents carried the oil towards the Texas coastline. The US government had two months to prepare booms to protect major inlets. Pemex spent $100 million to clean up the spill and avoided most compensation claims by asserting [[sovereign immunity]] as a state-run company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BP's Gulf battle echoes monster '79 Mexico oil spill|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64N57U20100524|publisher=Reuters|date=2010-05-24|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil slick surrounded [[Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas|Rancho Nuevo]], in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Tamaulipas]], which is one of the few nesting sites for [[Kemp's Ridley]] [[sea turtle]]s. Thousands of baby sea turtles were airlifted to a clean portion of the Gulf of Mexico to help save the rare species.

==Long-term effects==
{{cite check|date=July 2010|talk=NPOV problem with Long-term effects section}}
The oil that was lost during the blow-out polluted a considerable part of the offshore region in the Gulf of Mexico as well as much of the coastal zone, which consists primarily of sandy beaches and barrier islands often enclosing extensive shallow lagoons.

The oil on Mexican beaches that the authors observed in early September was calculated to be about 6000 metric tons. Based on reports from various groups and individuals, five times that figure is thought to represent a fair estimate of what had landed on Mexican beaches. Investigations along the Texas coast show that approximately 4000 metric tons of oil or less than 1 percent was deposited there. The rest of the oil, about 120,000 metric tons or 25 percent, sank to the bottom of the Gulf.&lt;ref name=jernelov&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jernelöv | first=Arne |author2=Lindén, Olof | title=The Caribbean: Ixtoc I: A Case Study of the World's Largest Oil Spill | journal=Ambio | volume=10 | issue=6 | pages=299–306 | publisher=Allen Press for the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | year=1981 | jstor=4312725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil had a severe impact on the littoral crab and mollusk fauna of the beaches which were contaminated. The populations of crabs, e.g. the ghost crab Ocypode quadrata, were almost totally eliminated over a wide area. The crab populations on coral islands along the coast were also reduced to only a few percent of normal about nine months after the spill.&lt;ref name=jernelov/&gt;

One study found that the most persistent issues were pollution of estuaries and coastal lagoons lining the bay, and especially the effects on breeding and growth of several food fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ixtoc Disaster Holds Clues to Evolution of an Oil Spill | author=Berger, Matthew O., Godoy, Emilio Godoy | url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51843 | work=Inter Press Service News Agency | date=2010-06-27 | accessdate=2010-05-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210259/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51843 | archivedate=2010-06-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil washed ashore, 30 cm (1 ft.) deep in some places, as it was pushed north by prevailing winds and currents until it crossed the Texas border two months later and eventually coated almost {{convert|170|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of US beaches. The beach that caused most international concern in Mexico was Rancho Nuevo, a key nesting ground for critically endangered Kemp's Ridley sea turtles which had already moved inland in their hundreds to lay eggs. By the time the eggs hatched, the oil had reached the shore.

Fishing was banned or restricted by Mexican authorities in contaminated areas north and south of the well. Fish and octopus catches dropped by 50 to 70% from the 1978 levels.&lt;ref name=jernelov/&gt; Some larger species with longer life spans took years to recover from the Ixtoc spill. It wasn't until the late-1980s that the population of Kemp's Ridley turtles, which lay a couple of hundred eggs a year, as opposed to the millions produced by shrimp, started recovering. The immediate losses from an oil spill continue to affect larger species for generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Glenn Garvin | title=After big 1979 spill, a stunning recovery | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/13/530250/after-big-1979-spill-a-stunning.html | work=The News Observer | date=2010-06-27 | accessdate=14 July 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724063119/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/13/530250/after-big-1979-spill-a-stunning.html | archivedate=24 July 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much less information on the impact of the Ixtoc I spill on benthic species (bottom dwellers). The best studies were on the Texas coast over 1000&amp;nbsp;km from the spill. Massive kills can occur when oil reaches the benthos in sufficient quantity. The only indication of a massive kill may be the remains of the dead organisms, but if they lack hard parts there will be little evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Teal | first=John M. |author2=Howarth, Robert W. | title= Oil spill studies: A review of ecological effects  | journal=Environmental Management | volume=8  | issue=1 | pages=27–43 | doi=10.1007/BF01867871 |date=January 1984 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n683727416671102/ | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report prepared for the US [[Bureau of Land Management]] concluded with respect to the spill's effect on US waters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In spite of a massive intrusion of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from the Ixtoc I event into the study region of the South Texas Outer Continental Shelf during 1979-1980, no definitive damage can be associated with this or other known spillage events (e .g ., Burmah Agate ) on either the epibenthic commercial shrimp population (based on chemical evidence) or the benthic infaunal community. Such conclusions have no bearing on intertidal or littoral communities, which were not the subject of this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author=ERCO/Energy Resources Co .

'''Joseph Henry'''  (December 17, 1797&amp;nbsp;– May 13, 1878) was an American scientist who served as the first Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He was the secretary for the [[National Institute for the Promotion of Science]], a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/baird/bairdb.htm |title=Planning a National Museum |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives |accessdate=2 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803084613/http://siarchives.si.edu//history/exhibits/baird/bairdb.htm |archivedate=3 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was highly regarded during his lifetime.

Henry's work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical [[electrical telegraph]], invented by [[Samuel Morse|Samuel F. B. Morse]] and [[Charles Wheatstone|Sir Charles Wheatstone]], separately.

==Biography==
Henry was born in [[Albany, New York]], to Scottish immigrants Ann Alexander Henry and William Henry. His parents were poor, and Henry's father died while he was still young. For the rest of his childhood, Henry lived with his grandmother in [[Galway (village), New York|Galway, New York]]. He attended a school which would later be named the "Joseph Henry Elementary School" in his honor. After school, he worked at a general store, and at the age of thirteen became an apprentice [[watchmaker]] and [[silversmith]]. Joseph's first love was theater and he came close to becoming a professional actor. His interest in science was sparked at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled ''Popular Lectures on Experimental Philosophy''. In 1819 he entered [[The Albany Academy]], where he was given free tuition. Even with free tuition he was so poor that he had to support himself with teaching and private tutoring positions. He intended to go into medicine, but in 1824 he was appointed an assistant engineer for the [[Surveying|survey]] of the State road being constructed between the [[Hudson River]] and [[Lake Erie]]. From then on, he was inspired to a career in either [[civil engineering|civil]] or [[mechanical engineering]].

[[File:Birthplace Of Modern Electricity.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Historical marker in Academy Park (Albany, New York) commemorating Henry's work with electricity.]]Henry excelled at his studies (so much so, that he would often help his teachers teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at [[The Albany Academy]] by Principal [[T. Romeyn Beck]]. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about [[terrestrial magnetism]] led him to experiment with [[magnetism]] in general. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful [[electromagnet]], improving on [[William Sturgeon]]'s electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for [[Yale University|Yale]]. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two [[electrode]]s attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, Second Edition, p. 107 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9kKHPlcNm2kC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=marion+4.7+classical+electromagnetic+radiation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pkOrqBIQS7&amp;sig=XqV_NtcKrDLB4eeBzNShPiLH340&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBGoVChMIpNOG-bHyxwIVBAjbCh0npg39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his newly developed electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern [[Electric motor|DC motor]]. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, rocking back and forth. The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.

This apparatus allowed Henry to recognize the property of [[Inductance|self inductance]]. British scientist [[Michael Faraday]] also recognized this property around the same time. Since Faraday published his results first, he became the officially recognized discoverer of the phenomenon.

From 1832 to 1846, Henry served as the first Chair of Natural History at the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slavery.princeton.edu/stories/joseph-henry-and-sam-parker|title=Joseph Henry and Sam Parker|last=Grummitt|first=Julia|date=November 6, 2017|website=The Princeton &amp; Slavery Project|access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/article/princeton-and-slavery-scientists-assistant|title=Princeton and Slavery: The Scientist's Assistant|last=Grummitt|first=Julia|date=November 8, 2017|website=Princeton Alumni Weekly|access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Princeton, he taught a wide range of courses including [[natural history]], chemistry, and architecture, and ran a laboratory on campus. Decades later, Henry wrote that he made "several thousand original investigations on electricity, magnetism, and electro-magnetism" while on the Princeton faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Memorial of Joseph Henry, Published by Order of Congress|last=|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=1880|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=143|chapter=Discourse Memorial by Samuel Bayard Dod}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry relied heavily on an African American research assistant, Sam Parker, in his laboratory and experiments. Parker was a free black man hired by the Princeton trustees to assist Henry. In an 1841 letter to mathematician [[Elias Loomis]], Henry wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Trustees have however furnished me with an article which I now find indispensible namely with a coloured servant whom I have taught to manage my batteries and who now relieves me from all the dirty work of the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Papers of Joseph Henry, Volume 5|last=|first=|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1981|isbn=|editor-last=Reingold|editor-first=Nathan|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=29|editor-last2=Rothberg|editor-first2=Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his letters, Henry described Parker providing materials for experiments, fixing technical issues with Henry's equipment, and at times being used as a test subject in electrical experiments in which Henry and his students would shock Parker in classroom demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1842, when Parker fell ill, Henry's experiments stopped completely until he recovered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Henry was appointed the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846, and served in this capacity until 1878. In 1848, while Secretary, Henry worked in conjunction with [[Stephen Alexander (astronomer)|Professor Stephen Alexander]] to determine the relative temperatures for different parts of the solar disk. They used a [[thermopile]] to determine that [[sunspot]]s were cooler than the surrounding regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Henry | first=Joseph  | title=On the Relative Radiation of Heat by the Solar Spots | journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=4 | pages=173–176 | publisher= | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Magie | first=W.

In late 1861 and early 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], Henry oversaw a series of lectures by prominent [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]] at the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/devastating-fire-nearly-consumed-smithsonian-castle-150-years-ago-month-180954002/?no-ist|title=The Devastating Fire That Nearly Consumed the Smithsonian Castle 150 Years Ago This Month|last=Kurin|first=Richard|date=|website=|access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included white clergymen, politicians, and activists such as [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Horace Greeley]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Famous orator and former fugitive slave [[Frederick Douglass]] was scheduled as the final speaker; Henry, however, refused to allow him to attend, stating: "I would not let the lecture of the coloured man be given in the rooms of the Smithsonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the fall of 2014 history author Jeremy T.K. Farley released "The Civil War Out My Window: Diary of Mary Henry."  The 262-page book featured the diary of Henry's daughter Mary, from the years of 1855 to 1878. Throughout the diary, Henry is repeatedly mentioned by his daughter, who showed a keen affection to her father.&lt;ref&gt;Wytheville Enterprise [http://www.swvatoday.com/entertainment_life/local/article_c204e85e-7fe6-11e4-ad8f-831b0ce0890d.html Farley compiles Civil War diary].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences in aeronautics===
Prof. Henry was introduced to [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe|Prof. Thaddeus Lowe]], a balloonist from New Hampshire who had taken interest in the phenomenon of lighter-than-air gases, and exploits into meteorology, in particular, the high winds which we call the [[Jet stream]] today. It was Lowe's intent to make a transatlantic crossing by utilizing an enormous gas-inflated aerostat. Henry took a great interest in Lowe's endeavors, promoting him among some of the more prominent scientists and institutions of the day.

In June 1860, Lowe had made a successful test flight with his gigantic balloon, first named the ''City of New York'' and later renamed ''The Great Western'', flying from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to [[Medford, New York]]. Lowe would not be able to attempt a transatlantic flight until late Spring of the 1861, so Henry convinced him to take his balloon to a point more West and fly the balloon back to the eastern seaboard, an exercise that would keep his investors interested.

Lowe took several smaller balloons to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in March 1861. On 19 April, he launched on a fateful flight that landed him in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South Carolina]]. With the Southern States seceding from the Union, during that winter and spring of 1861, and the onset of [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Lowe abandoned further attempts at a trans-Atlantic crossing and, with Henry's endorsement, went to [[Washington, D.C.]] to offer his services as an aeronaut to the Federal government. Henry submitted a letter to [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] at the time [[Simon Cameron]] of Pennsylvania which carried Henry's endorsement:

{{quote|Hon. SIMON CAMERON

DEAR SIR: In accordance with your request made to me orally on the morning of the 6th of June, I have examined the apparatus and witnessed the balloon experiments of Mr. Lowe, and have come to the following conclusions

1st. The balloon prepared by Mr. Lowe, inflated with ordinary street gas, will retain its charge for several days.''

2d. In an inflated condition it can be towed by a few men along an ordinary road, or over fields, in ordinarily calm weather, from the places where it is galled [i.e. swelled or inflated] to another, twenty or more miles distant.

3d. It can be let up into the air by means of a rope in a calm day to a height sufficient to observe the country for twenty miles around and more, according to the degree of clearness of the atmosphere. The ascent may also be made at night and the camp lights of the enemy observed.

4th. From experiments made here for the first time it is conclusively proved that telegrams can be sent with ease and certainty between the balloon and the quarters of the commanding officer.

5th. I feel assured, although I have not witnessed the experiment, that when the surface wind is from the east, as it was for several days last week, an observer in the balloon can be made to float nearly to the enemy's camp (as it is now situated to the west of us), or even to float over it, and then return eastward by rising to a higher elevation. This assumption is based on the fact that the upper strata of wind in this latitude is always flowing eastward. Mr. Lowe informs me, and I do not doubt his statement, that he will on any day which is favorable make an excursion of the kind above mentioned.

6th. From all the facts I have observed and the information I have gathered I am sure that important information may be obtained in regard to the topography of the country and to the position and movements of an enemy by means of the balloon now, and that Mr. Lowe is well qualified to render service in this way by the balloon now in his possession.

7th. The balloon which Mr. Lowe now has in Washington can only be inflated in a city where street gas is to be obtained. If an exploration is required at a point too distant for the transportation of the inflated balloon, an additional apparatus for the generation of hydrogen gas will be required. The necessity of generating the gas renders the use of the balloon more expensive, but this, where important results are required, is of comparatively small importance.

For these preliminary experiments, as you may recollect, a sum not to exceed $200 or $250 was to be appropriated, and in accordance with this Mr. Lowe has presented me with the in closed statement of items, which I think are reasonable, since nothing is charged for labor and time of the aeronautic.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

:JOSEPH HENRY,

:Secretary Smithsonian Institution.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}}}

On Henry's recommendation Lowe went on to form the [[Union Army Balloon Corps|United States Army/"Union Army" Balloon Corps]] and served two years with the [[Army of the Potomac]] as a Civil War "Aeronaut".

===Later years===
[[File:Henry Joseph grave.jpg|upright|thumb|Henry's grave, [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]], Washington, D.C.]]
As a famous scientist and director of the Smithsonian Institution, Henry received visits from other scientists and inventors who sought his advice. Henry was patient, kindly, self-controlled, and gently humorous.&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude'', Robert V. Bruce, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; One such visitor was [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who on 1 March 1875 carried a letter of introduction to Henry. Henry showed an interest in seeing Bell's experimental apparatus, and Bell returned the following day. After the demonstration, Bell mentioned his untested theory on how to transmit human speech electrically by means of a "harp apparatus" which would have several steel reeds tuned to different frequencies to cover the voice spectrum. Henry said Bell had "the germ of a great invention". Henry advised Bell not to publish his ideas until he had perfected the invention. When Bell objected that he lacked the necessary knowledge, Henry firmly advised: "Get it!"

On 25 June 1876, Bell's experimental telephone (using a different design) was demonstrated at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia where Henry was one of the judges for electrical exhibits. On 13 January 1877, Bell demonstrated his instruments to Henry at the Smithsonian Institution and Henry invited Bell to demonstrate them again that night at the [[Washington Philosophical Society]]. Henry praised "the value and astonishing character of Mr. Bell's discovery and invention."&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude'', Robert V. Bruce, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry died on 13 May 1878, and was buried in [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] section of northwest Washington, D.C. [[John Phillips Sousa]] wrote the [[Transit of Venus March]] for the unveiling of the Joseph Henry statue in front of the [[Smithsonian Castle]].

==Legacy==
Henry was a member of the [[United States Lighthouse Board]] from 1852 until his death. He was appointed chairman in 1871 and served in that position the remainder of his life. He was the only civilian to serve as chairman. The [[United States Coast Guard]] honored Henry for his work on lighthouses and fog signal acoustics by naming a cutter after him. The ''Joseph Henry'', usually referred to as the ''Joe Henry'', was launched in 1880 and was active until 1904.&lt;ref name="USCG"&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Joseph_Henry_1880.pdf US Coast Guard Cutter Joseph Henry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 Henry was inducted into the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] in the [[Bronx, New York]].

Bronze statues of Henry and [[Isaac Newton]] represent science on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] They are two of the 16 historical figures depicted in the reading room, each pair representing one of the 8 pillars of civilization.

In 1872 [[John Wesley Powell]] named a mountain range in southeastern Utah after Henry. The [[Henry Mountains]] were the last mountain range to be added to the map of the 48 contiguous U.S. states.

At [[Princeton University|Princeton]], the Joseph Henry Laboratories and the [[Joseph Henry House]] are named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/physics/about-us/history/memorable-members/joseph-henry/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428174213/http://www.princeton.edu/physics/about-us/history/memorable-members/joseph-henry/ |archivedate=2011-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Albany Academy]] moved out of its downtown building in the early 1930s, its old building in Academy Park was renamed [[Joseph Henry Memorial]], with a statue of him out front. It is now the main offices of the [[Albany City School District]]. In 1971 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; later it was included as a [[contributing property]] when the [[Lafayette Park Historic District|Lafayette Park]] [[Historic district (United States)|Historic District]] was listed on the Register.

''' Larry Paul Kelley ''', also known as '''Larry P. Kelley''', is an American inventor and [[gemologist]] who developed proprietary methods for manufacturing man-made gemstones. He also invented a method for making high efficient crystalline silicon material for solar cells.&lt;ref name=MiLines&gt;{{Citation |last=Tableman  |first=Jan |year=2011 |title=Jewel of West Michigan / Shelby Gem Factory |publisher=Michigan Electric Cooperative Association |publication-place=Okemos, Michigan |page=1,3, 10,11 |url=  http://www.countrylines.com/~country1/images/PDF/2011/June-11/HomeWorks_June-11.pdf|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley received degrees at the [[University of Michigan]] in science, chemistry and physics.{{r|express}}

== Biography ==
[[File:Perpetual Motion by Norman Rockwell.jpg|thumb|right|100px| Magazine]]
Born in 1944 and raised in [[Hart, Michigan]], Kelly was influenced by his father, Laurence, who worked on repairing auto bodies. His father had a set of [[Popular Science]] magazines which he read through often with much interest as a boy. As a 12-year-old boy Kelley did an experiment one day based on one of these magazine articles. He understood that ruby was a chemical mixture of [[aluminum oxide]] and [[Chromium(III) oxide|chromium oxide]]. He observed that some sandpaper that his father used had [[aluminum oxide]] dust. Kelley took some of this dust and placed onto a firebrick. He put a chip of chrome with  the aluminum oxide sandpaper dust, melted them with high heat, and [[Serendipity|serendipitously]] created his first ruby, albeit of poor quality.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northernexpress.com/michigan/article-5988-a-flaming-success-at-the-shelby-gem-factory.html |title=A Flaming Success at the Shelby Gem Factory |last1= Kates|first1=Kristi |last2= |first2= |date= 2012|website= |publisher=Northern Express newspaper |access-date=September 3, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teen, Kelley fostered his interest in science and experimentation. As a thirteen year old he shot homemade rockets over the local lake. He got into trouble with local police authorities when permission was denied to shoot these rockets so close to a heavily populated area.&lt;ref name=HartRocketeers&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Hart Leery of Being Juvenile Cape Canaveral |url= |newspaper= Shelby Herald (page 2)|location= Shelby, Michigan |date= July 7, 1957|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelley and his brother Arthur made some small wooden workshops in 1961 to do experiments with chemicals. In 1962 when they blew up these workshops after mixing sulfur [[potassium chlorate]] with [[aluminum oxide]] dust the boys were seriously injured but survived.&lt;ref name=HartChemists&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Blast Victims' Chemicals are Destroyed |url= |newspaper= Shelby Herald (front page)|location= Shelby, Michigan |date= June 25, 1962|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Faceting machine.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Faceting machine located at the Shelby Gem Factory to shape gems]]
Kelley enrolled at the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. There he took up the study of science, chemistry, and physics. One of his studies was working as an assistant chemist at [[Dow Chemical]]. At Dow he worked with high-temperature furnaces and processing of materials using heat. At that time there was a high demand for ruby for [[solid-state laser]]s. After graduating from U of M he went into the business of making equipment to produce ruby laser rods.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

Kelley later learned how to cut the ruby laser rods into little chunks and then shape them into "gems" using a [[faceting machine]]. He then sold these synthetic artificial man-made gems for just under a hundred dollars each. He progressed from making rubies to manufacturing other man-made gems including an imitation diamond. Kelley turned this into a business of making man-made artificial gems for all the traditional [[birthstone]]s of each of the twelve months.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

== Shelby Gem Factory ==
[[File:Simulator of growing crystals.JPG|thumb|Factory simulator of growing crystals]]
{{main|Shelby Gem Factory}}

Kelley experimented with several formulas and processes for making synthetic artificial gems.  One method involved using temperature difference techniques to create crystals in a way water [[icicle]]s are formed. One of these man-made gemstones made this way was a transparent clear crystal resembling glass. It looked to the naked eye like a real diamond when faceted correctly and no glass was involved in its manufacture.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

A second technique involves small pieces ("seeds") of mined gems put into a heated up chemical liquid. The liquid then is slowly cooled, and recrystallized to form larger pieces of the gemstone. Man-made gemstones grow from these "seeds." Kelley's technical success in growing crystals led to the founding of the Shelby Gem Factory in 1970.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

In 1978 Kelley invented a unique method to create thin semiconductor films, especially useful in solar cells. Semiconductors have an absorptive graphite substrate and a layer of silicon grid-work is plated onto it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7607">In [[chemistry]], the '''mass concentration''' {{mvar|ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} (or {{mvar|γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is defined as the [[mass]] of a constituent {{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} divided by the [[volume]] of the mixture {{mvar|V}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = M03713 | title = mass concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \frac {m_i}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a pure chemical the mass concentration equals its [[density]] (mass divided by volume); thus the mass concentration of a component in a mixture can be called the density of a component in a mixture. This explains the usage of {{mvar|ρ}} (the lower case Greek letter [[rho]]), the symbol most often used for density.

== Definition and properties ==
The volume {{mvar|V}} in the definition refers to the volume of the solution, ''not'' the volume of the [[solvent]]. One liter of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 liter of solvent because the process of dissolution causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease. Sometimes the mass concentration is called [[titer]].

===Notation===

The notation common with mass density underlines the connection between the two quantities (the mass concentration being the mass density of a component in the solution), but it can be a source of confusion especially when they appear in the same formula undifferentiated by an additional symbol (like a star superscript, a bolded symbol or varrho).

===Dependence on volume===

Mass concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion. On small intervals of temperature the dependence is :
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \frac {\rho_{i,T_0}}{(1 + \alpha \Delta T)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the mass concentration at a reference temperature, {{mvar|α}} is the thermal expansion coefficient of the mixture.

===Sum of mass concentrations - normalizing relation===

The sum of the mass concentrations of all components (including the solvent) gives the [[density]] {{mvar|ρ}} of the solution:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \sum_i \rho_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for pure component the mass concentration equals the density of the pure component.

===Sum of products mass concentrations - partial specific volumes===
The sum of products between these quantities equals one.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \rho_i \cdot \bar{v_i} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

== Units ==

The [[International System of Units|SI-unit]] for mass concentration is kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[kilogram]]/[[cubic metre]]). 
This is the same as mg/mL and g/L. Another commonly used unit is g/(100&amp;nbsp;mL), which is identical to g/dL ([[gram]]/[[decilitre]]).

=== Usage in biology ===

In [[biology]], the "[[percent|%]]" symbol is sometimes incorrectly used to denote mass concentration, also called "mass/volume percentage." A solution with 1&amp;nbsp;g of solute dissolved in a final volume of 100&amp;nbsp;mL of [[solution]] would be labeled as "1%" or "1%&amp;nbsp;m/v" (mass/volume). The notation is mathematically flawed because the unit "[[percent|%]]" can only be used for dimensionless quantities. "Percent solution" or "percentage solution" are thus terms best reserved for "mass percent solutions" (m/m = m% = mass solute/mass total solution after mixing), or "volume percent solutions" (v/v = v% = volume solute per volume of total solution after mixing). The very ambiguous terms "percent solution" and "percentage solutions" with no other qualifiers, continue to occasionally be encountered.  

This common usage of % to mean m/v in biology is because of many biological solutions being dilute and water-based or an [[aqueous solution]].  Liquid water has a density of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1&amp;nbsp;g/mL) ([[Water_(data_page)#Liquid_physical_properties|water density]]).  Thus 100&amp;nbsp;mL of water is equal to approximately 100&amp;nbsp;g.  Therefore, a solution with 1&amp;nbsp;g of solute dissolved in final volume of 100&amp;nbsp;mL aqueous solution may also be considered 1%&amp;nbsp;m/m (1&amp;nbsp;g solute in 99&amp;nbsp;g water). This approximation breaks down as the solute concentration is increased.  For an example, refer to the densities of water–[[NaCl]] mixtures ([[Water (data page)#Water_with_dissolved_NaCl|density of water with dissolved NaCl]]). High solute concentrations are often not physiologically relevant, but are occasionally encountered in pharmacology, where the mass per volume notation is still sometimes encountered. An extreme example is saturated solution of [[potassium iodide]] (SSKI) which attains 100 "%" m/v potassium iodide mass concentration (1&amp;nbsp;gram KI per 1&amp;nbsp;mL solution) only because the solubility of the dense salt KI is extremely high in water, and the resulting solution is very dense (1.72 times as dense as water).  

Although there are examples to the contrary, it should be stressed that the commonly used "units" of %&amp;nbsp;w/v are grams/milliliters (g/mL).  1%&amp;nbsp; m/v solutions are sometimes thought of as being gram/100&amp;nbsp;mL but this detracts from the fact that %&amp;nbsp;m/v is g/mL; 1 g of water has a volume of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;mL (at standard temperature and pressure) and the mass concentration is said to be 100%.  To make 10&amp;nbsp;mL of an aqueous 1% [[cholate]] solution, 0.1&amp;nbsp;grams of cholate are dissolved in 10 mL of water.  [[Volumetric flask]]s are the most appropriate piece of glassware for this procedure as deviations from ideal solution behavior can occur with high solute concentrations.

In solutions, mass concentration is commonly encountered as the ratio of mass/[volume solution], or m/v. In water solutions containing relatively small quantities of dissolved solute (as in biology), such figures may be "percentivized" by multiplying by 100 a ratio of grams solute per mL solution. The result is given as "mass/volume percentage". Such a convention expresses mass concentration of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of solute in 100&amp;nbsp;mL of solution, as "1&amp;nbsp;m/v&amp;nbsp;%."

== Related quantities ==

=== Density of pure component===
The relation between mass concentration and density of a pure component (mass concentration of single component mixtures) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i = \rho_i^* \frac{V_i}{V}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ρ''{{su|p=∗|b=''i''}}}} is the density of the pure component, {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} the volume of the pure component before mixing.

=== Specific volume (or mass-specific volume) ===
Specific volume is the inverse of mass concentration only in the case of pure substances, for which mass concentration is the same as the density of the pure-substance:

: &lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{V}{m}\ = \frac{1}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Molar concentration ===

The conversion to [[molar concentration]] {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \frac{\rho_i}{M_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[molar mass]] of constituent {{mvar|i}}.

===Mass fraction===

The conversion to [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] {{mvar|w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mole fraction===

The conversion to [[mole fraction]] {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho} \cdot \frac{M}{M_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|M}} is the average molar mass of the mixture.

===Molality===

For binary mixtures, the conversion to [[molality]] {{mvar|b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;b_i = \frac{\rho_i}{M_i (\rho - \rho_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Spatial variation and gradient==
The values of (mass and molar) concentration different in space triggers the phenomenon of [[diffusion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6738">{{inline|date=June 2017}}This article describes several characteristic '''architectural elements''' typical of European '''[[megalith]]ic''' ([[Stone Age]]) structures.

==Forecourt==
In [[archaeology]], a forecourt is the name given to the area in front of certain types of [[chamber tomb]]. Forecourts were probably the venue for [[ritualism|ritual]] practices connected with the burial and commemoration of the dead in the past societies that built these types of [[tomb]]s.

In European [[megalithic]] architecture, forecourts are curved in plan with the entrance to the tomb at the apex of the open semicircle enclosure that the forecourt creates. The sides were built up by either large upright stones or walls of smaller stones laid atop one another.

Some also had paved floors and some had blocking stones erected in front of them to seal the tomb such as at [[West Kennet Long Barrow]]. Their shape, which suggests an attempt to focus attention on the tomb itself may mean that they were used ceremonially as a kind of open air auditorium during ceremonies. Excavation within some forecourts has recovered animal [[bone]], [[pottery]] and evidence of burning suggesting that they served as locations for [[votive]] offerings or feasting dedicated to the [[dead]].

{{anchor|kerb}}

==Kerb or peristalith==
:''See [[curb (road)]] for the [[road]]side edge.''
[[Image:coldrumeast.jpg|thumb|400px|Although the barrow mound is now almost gone, the surrounding peristalith at [[Coldrum Stones]] in [[Kent]] still survives (foreground). The stone burial chamber can be seen in the background.]]
In [[archaeology]], kerb or peristalith is the name for a stone ring built to enclose and sometimes [[revetting|revet]] the [[cairn]] or [[tumulus|barrow]] built over a [[chamber tomb]].

European [[dolmen]]s especially [[hunebed]] and [[dyss]] burials often provide examples of the use of kerbs in [[megalith]]ic architecture but they were also added to other kinds of [[chamber tomb]]. Kerbs may be built in a [[dry stone wall]] method employing small blocks or more commonly using larger stones set in the ground. When larger stones are employed, peristalith is the term more properly used. Often, when the earth barrow has been weathered away, the surviving kerb can give the impression of being a [[stone circle]] although these monuments date from considerably later. 
Excavation of barrows without stone rings such as Fussell's Lodge in [[Wiltshire]] suggests that, in these examples, timber or turf was used to define a kerb instead.

In the [[British Isles]], the enclosing nature of kerbs has been suggested to be analogous to later [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] stone and [[timber circle]]s and [[henge]]s which also demonstrate an attempt to demarcate a distinct, [[circle|round]] area for [[ritual]] or [[funeral|funerary]] purposes. Famous sites with kerbs include [[Newgrange]] where many of the stones are etched with [[megalithic art]]. An example of the dry stone wall type of kerb can be seen at [[Parc le Breos]] in [[Wales]].

==Orthostat==
An '''orthostat''' is a large stone with a more or less slab-like shape that has been artificially set upright (so a cube-shaped block is not an orthostat). [[Menhir]]s and other [[standing stone]]s are technically orthostats although the term is used by [[archaeologist]]s only to describe individual prehistoric stones that constitute part of larger structures. Common examples include the walls of [[chamber tomb]]s and other [[megalith]]ic monuments and the vertical elements of the trilithons at [[Stonehenge]].  Especially later, orthostats may be carved with decoration in [[relief]], a common feature of [[Hittite architecture]] and [[Assyrian sculpture]] among other styles. In the latter case, orthostats are large thin slabs of [[gypsum]] neatly and carefully formed, for use as a wall-facing secured by metal fixings and carrying reliefs, which were then painted.  

Many orthostats were a focus for [[megalithic art]], as at [[Knowth]] in Ireland.

==Port-hole slab==
In [[megalith]]ic [[archaeology]] a port-hole slab is the name of an orthostat with a hole in it sometimes found forming the entrance to a [[chamber tomb]]. The hole is usually circular but square examples or those made from two adjoining slabs each with a notch cut in it are known. They are common in the [[gallery grave]]s of the [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]].

==Portal stones==
Portal stones are a pair of Megalithic orthostats, usually flanking the entrance to a [[chamber tomb]]. They are commonly found in [[dolmens]]. Examples may be seen at [[Bohonagh]] and [[Knocknakilla]].

==Trilithon==
{{See also|Trilithon}}
[[Image:Trilithon at Stonehenge.jpg|thumb|A trilithon at Stonehenge]]A trilithon (or trilith) is a structure consisting of two large vertical stones supporting a third stone set horizontally across the top. Commonly used in the context of [[megalithic]] monuments, the most famous trilithons are those at [[Stonehenge]] and those found in the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta]].

The word ''trilithon'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] 'having three stones' ('''Tri''' - ''three'', '''lithos''' - ''stone'') and was first used by [[William Stukeley]]. The term also describes the groups of three stones in the Hunebed tombs of the [[Netherlands]] and the three massive stones forming part of the wall of the Roman Temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] at [[Baalbek]], Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A '''nanocrystalline''' ('''NC''') material is a [[polycrystalline]] material with a [[crystallite]] size of only a few [[nanometer]]s. These materials fill the gap between [[amorphous]] materials without any [[long range order]] and conventional coarse-grained materials. Definitions vary, but nanocrystalline material is commonly defined as a [[crystallite]] (grain) size below 100 nm. Grain sizes from 100–500 nm are typically considered "ultrafine" grains.  

The grain size of a NC sample can be estimated using [[x-ray diffraction]]. In materials with very small grain sizes, the diffraction peaks will be broadened. This broadening can be related to a crystallite size using the [[Scherrer equation]] (applicable up to ~50 nm), a [[Powder_diffraction#Size_and_strain_broadening|Williamson-Hall plot]], or more sophisticated methods such as the Warren-Averbach method or computer modeling of the diffraction pattern. The crystallite size can be measured directly using [[transmission electron microscopy]].

== Synthesis ==
Nanocrystalline materials can be prepared in several ways. Methods are typically categorized based on the [[State of matter|phase of matter]] the material transitions through before forming the nanocrystalline final product.

=== Solid-state processing ===
Solid-state processes do not involve melting or evaporating the material and are typically done at relatively low temperatures. Examples of solid state processes include [[mechanical alloying]] using a high-energy ball mill and certain types of [[severe plastic deformation]] processes. 

=== Liquid processing ===
Nanocrystalline metals can be produced by rapid [[solidification]] from the liquid using a process such as [[melt spinning]]. This often produces an amorphous metal, which can be transformed into an nanocrystalline metal by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] above the [[crystallization temperature]].

=== Vapor-phase processing ===
[[Thin film]]s of nanocrystalline materials can be produced using [[vapor deposition]] processes such as [[MOCVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Jie|author2=Zhu, Liping |author3=Wu, Yazhen |author4=Zeng, Yujia |author5=He, Haiping |author6=Lin, Junming |author7= Ye, Zhizhen |title=Effects of phosphorus doping in ZnO nanocrystals by metal organic chemical vapor deposition|journal=Materials Letters|date=February 2012|volume=68|pages=258–260|doi=10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Solution processing ===
Some metals, particularly [[nickel]] and [[nickel alloys]], can be made into nanocrystalline foils using [[Electroplating|electrodeposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giallonardo|first=J.D.|author2=Erb, U. |author3=Aust, K.T. |author4= Palumbo, G. |title=The influence of grain size and texture on the Young's modulus of nanocrystalline nickel and nickel–iron alloys|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=21 December 2011|volume=91|issue=36|pages=4594–4605|doi=10.1080/14786435.2011.615350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The productive capacity of electrical generators operated by utility companies is often measured in MW.  Few things can sustain the transfer or consumption of energy on this scale; some of these events or entities include: lightning strikes, naval craft (such as [[aircraft carrier]]s and [[submarine]]s), engineering hardware, and some scientific research equipment (such as [[Large Hadron Collider|supercolliders]] and large [[laser]]s)&lt;!-- black holes, the surface of stars, empty space, the ocean, etc. I don't think the phrase "few things" is meaningful without some qualifier. --&gt;.

For reference, about 10,000 100-watt lightbulbs or 5,000 computer systems would be needed to draw 1&amp;nbsp;MW.  Also, 1 MW is approximately 1360 [[horsepower]]. Modern high-power [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s typically have a peak power of 3–5 MW, while a typical modern [[nuclear power plant]] produces on the order of 500–2000 MW peak output.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to solar energy:

'''[[Solar energy]]'''&amp;nbsp;– radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]]. It has been harnessed by humans since [[ancient history|ancient times]] using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal electricity]] and [[solar architecture]], which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces.
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Overview ==
Solar energy can be described as all of the following:
* [[Energy]]&amp;nbsp;– an indirectly observed quantity, often understood as the ability a physical system has to do work on other physical systems.
** [[Renewable energy]]&amp;nbsp;– energy which comes from natural resources which are naturally replenished.
* [[Natural resource]]&amp;nbsp;– materials and components (something that can be used) that can be found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of natural resources (at its fundamental level). A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as fresh water, and air, as well as a living organism such as a fish, or it may exist in an alternate form which must be processed to obtain the resource such as metal ores, oil, and most forms of energy.
** [[Renewable resource]]&amp;nbsp;– natural resource with the ability to reproduce through biological or natural processes and are replenished with the passage of time.

=== Sunlight ===
* [[Sun]]&amp;nbsp;– the star at the center of the Solar System&lt;!-- Please don't change "the" to "our" - there is only one "Solar System", and thus "the" is correct. --&gt;
* [[Sunlight]]&amp;nbsp;– in the broad sense, is the total frequency spectrum of electromagnetic radiation given off by the Sun, particularly infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light.

== History of solar energy ==
* [[Growth of photovoltaics]]&amp;nbsp;–
* [[Timeline of solar cells]]&amp;nbsp;– begins in the 19th century when it is observed that the presence of sunlight is capable of generating usable electrical energy.
* [[Timeline of solar energy]]&amp;nbsp;–

== Conversion of solar energy ==
[[Solar power]]&amp;nbsp;– the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).
* [[Active solar]]&amp;nbsp;– technologies are employed to convert solar energy into another more useful form of energy (for example, to heat or electrical energy).
* [[Heliostat]]&amp;nbsp;– a device that includes a mirror, usually a plane mirror, which turns so as to keep reflecting sunlight toward a predetermined target, compensating for the sun's apparent motions in the sky.
* [[Solar tracker]]&amp;nbsp;– devices that orient various payloads toward the sun.
* [[Copper in renewable energy|Role of copper]] in generating and transmitting energy with maximum efficiency in solar photovoltaic power generation, concentrating solar thermal power, and solar water heaters.
* [[Solar cell efficiency]] – 
* [[Solar cell]] – made from a monocrystalline silicon wafer
* [[Solar chemical]] – a number of possible processes that harness solar energy by absorbing sunlight in a chemical reaction in a way similar to photosynthesis in plants but without using living organisms.
* [[Solar constant]] – a measure of flux density, is the amount of incoming solar electromagnetic radiation per unit area that would be incident on a plane perpendicular to the rays, at a distance of one astronomical unit|astronomical unit (AU) (roughly the mean distance from the Sun to the Earth).
* [[Solar inverter]] – or PV inverter, converts the variable direct current output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network.
* [[Solar photovoltaics]] –
*

=== Solar thermal energy ===
[[Solar thermal energy]] (STE)&amp;nbsp;– technology for harnessing solar energy for thermal energy (heat).
* Solar district heating and solar district cooling. See: [[Seasonal thermal energy storage]].
* [[Solar water heating]] (SWH)&amp;nbsp;– or solar hot water (SHW) systems comprise several innovations and many mature renewable energy technologies that have been well established for many years.
* [[Solar air conditioning]]&amp;nbsp;– any air conditioning (cooling) system that uses solar power.
* [[Thermal mass]]&amp;nbsp;– a concept in building design regarding how the mass of the building provides "inertia" against temperature fluctuations, sometimes known as the thermal flywheel effect.
* [[Solar pond]]&amp;nbsp;– a pool of saltwater which acts as a large-scale solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage for supplying thermal energy.
* [[Solar chimney]]&amp;nbsp;– solar chimney&amp;nbsp;– often referred to as a thermal chimney&amp;nbsp;– is a way of improving the natural ventilation of buildings by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy.

=== Concentrated solar power ===
[[Concentrated solar power]]&amp;nbsp;– a system that uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area. Electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator.
* [[Parabolic trough]]&amp;nbsp;– a type of solar thermal energy collector.

=== Photovoltaics ===
[[Photovoltaics]]&amp;nbsp;–
* [[Photoelectric effect]]&amp;nbsp;– electrons are emitted from matter (metals and non-metallic solids, liquids or gases) as a consequence of their absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation of very short wavelength, such as visible or ultraviolet radiation.
* [[Photovoltaics]] (PV)&amp;nbsp;– is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect.
* [[Growth of photovoltaics]]&amp;nbsp;– showing the history of installed photovoltaics.
* [[Timeline of solar cells]]&amp;nbsp;– begins in the 19th century when it is observed that the presence of sunlight is capable of generating usable electrical energy.
* [[Solar insolation]]&amp;nbsp;– a measure of solar radiation energy received on a given surface area and recorded during a given time. It is also called solar irradiation. Not to be confused with insulation.
* [[Solar constant]]&amp;nbsp;– a measure of flux density, is the amount of incoming solar electromagnetic radiation per unit area that would be incident on a plane perpendicular to the rays, at a distance of one astronomical unit|astronomical unit (AU) (roughly the mean distance from the Sun to the Earth).
* [[Solar cell efficiency]]&amp;nbsp;– the percentage of the solar energy to which the cell is exposed that is converted into electrical energy. Also referred to as "energy conversion efficiency".
* [[Third generation photovoltaic cell]]&amp;nbsp;– are solar cells that are potentially able to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit of 31-41% power efficiency for single bandgap solar cells.
* [[Solar cell research]]&amp;nbsp;– in universities and research institutions around the world.
* [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell]]&amp;nbsp;–
* [[Cadmium telluride]]&amp;nbsp;– a crystalline compound formed from cadmium and tellurium, used as an infrared optical window and a solar cell material.
* [[Thermophotovoltaic]] (TPV)&amp;nbsp;– energy conversion is a direct conversion process from heat differentials to electricity via photons.
* [[Polycrystalline silicon photovoltaics]]&amp;nbsp;– are a type of solar cell.
* [[Thermodynamic efficiency limit]]&amp;nbsp;– the absolute maximum theoretically possible conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2695">A '''photovoltaic keyboard''' is a [[Keyboard (computing)#Connection types|wireless computer keyboard]] that charges its batteries from a light source such as the sun or interior lighting, addressing a major drawback of wireless computer peripherals that otherwise require regular replacement of discharged batteries.

==Logitech K750==
The [[Logitech]] K750 has a set of [[photovoltaic cell]]s on the top edge, charges in [[sunlight]] or under a standard [[lightbulb|bulb]], can work up to three months in total darkness, and includes software to display battery charging status. It is a fullsized keyboard, including the usual movement keys and NumPad section on the right side, with low-profile keys much like a laptop.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} There are two models, compatible with [[Windows]] or [[Macintosh]] operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/logitech-k750-is-the-first-solar-keyboard/ |title=Logitech K750 Is The World's First Solar Keyboard |first=Jogn |last=Biggs |work=techcrunch.com |year=2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macnn.com/reviews/logitech-wireless-solar-keyboard-k750.html |title=Review - Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 Review |first=Roger |last=Fingas |work=macnn.com |year=2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/blog/green/green-gadget-of-the-week-logitech-solar-keyboard-for-mac/18495 |title=Green Gadget of the Week: Logitech solar keyboard for Mac |first=Heather |last=Clancy |work=zdnet.com |year=2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the keyboard is not officially supported in [[Linux]], a third party application named Solaar provides functionality akin to the original Logitech software, such as battery and connection status indications, and allows device pairing/unpairing.&lt;ref&gt;https://pwr.github.io/Solaar/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tastatur-test-24.de/wireless-keyboards-vergleich/|title=Photovoltaic Wireless Keyboard Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2018-06-29|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/12/logitech-unifying-receiver-linux-solaar&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16878">In [[particle physics]], '''quarkonium''' (from [[quark]] and -[[onium]], pl. '''quarkonia''') designates a flavorless [[meson]] whose constituents are a heavy [[quark]] and its own antiquark, making it a neutral particle and the antiparticle of themselves.

==Background==

===Light quarks===
{{main|Phi meson}}

Light quarks ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]]) are much less massive than the heavier quarks, and so the physical states actually seen in experiments ([[Eta meson|η]], [[Eta meson|η′]], and [[Pion|π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] mesons) are quantum mechanical mixtures of the light quark states. The much larger mass differences between the [[charm quark|charm]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks and the lighter [[quark]]s results in states that are well defined in terms of a quark–antiquark pair of a given flavor.

==Heavy quarks==
Examples of quarkonia are the [[J/Psi meson|J/&amp;psi; meson]] (the ground state of '''charmonium''', {{SubatomicParticle|Charm quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Charm antiquark|link=yes}}) and the [[Upsilon particle|{{SubatomicParticle|Upsilon}} meson]] ('''bottomonium''',  {{SubatomicParticle|Bottom quark|link=yes}}{{SubatomicParticle|Bottom antiquark|link=yes}}). Because of the high mass of the [[top quark]], '''toponium''' does  not exist, since the top quark decays through the [[electroweak interaction]] before a bound state can form (a rare example of a [[Strong interaction|weak process]] proceeding more quickly than a [[color force|strong process]]). Usually, the word "quarkonium" refers only to charmonium and bottomonium, and not to any of the lighter quark–antiquark states.

==Charmonium==
{{See also|J/ψ meson}}
[[File:Quark structure charmonium.svg|thumb|Charmonium]]
In the following table, the same particle can be named with the [[spectroscopic notation]] or with its mass. In some cases excitation series are used: Ψ' is the first excitation of Ψ (for historical reasons, this one is called ''J/ψ'' particle); Ψ" is a second excitation, and so on. That is, names in the same cell are synonymous.

Some of the states are predicted, but have not been identified; others are unconfirmed. The quantum numbers of the [[X(3872)]] particle have been measured recently by the LHCb experiment at CERN&lt;ref&gt;

. This measurement shed some light on its identity, excluding the third option among the three envised, which are :
* a charmonium hybrid state;
* a &lt;math&gt;D^0\bar D^{*0}&lt;/math&gt; molecule.
* a candidate for the 1&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; state;

In 2005, the [[BaBar experiment]] announced the discovery of a new state: [[Y(4260)]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CLEO (particle detector)|CLEO]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] have since corroborated these observations. At first, Y(4260) was thought to be a charmonium state, but the evidence suggests more exotic explanations, such as a D "molecule", a 4-quark construct, or a hybrid [[meson]].

:&lt;small&gt;&lt;span id="1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Preliminary results. Confirmation needed.&lt;/small&gt;

The Υ(1S) state was discovered by the [[E288 experiment]] team, headed by [[Leon Lederman]], at [[Fermilab]] in 1977, and was the first particle containing a bottom quark to be discovered. The χ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; (3P) state was the first particle discovered in the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. The article about this discovery was first submitted to [[arXiv]] on 21 December 2011.&lt;ref name="arxivchib3p"&gt;

==Toponium==
{{main|Theta meson}}

The [[theta meson]] is not expected to be physically observable, as top quarks decay too fast to form mesons. 

{{expand section|date=April 2017}}

==QCD and quarkonia==
The computation of the properties of [[meson]]s in [[Quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) is a fully non-perturbative one. As a result, the only general method available is a direct computation using [[lattice QCD]] (LQCD) techniques. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}  However, other techniques are effective for heavy quarkonia as well.

The light quarks in a meson move at [[special relativity|relativistic]] speeds, since the mass of the bound state is much larger than the mass of the quark. However, the speed of the charm and the bottom quarks in their respective quarkonia is sufficiently smaller, so that relativistic effects affect these states much less. It is estimated that the speed, '''v''', is roughly 0.3 times the speed of light for charmonia and roughly 0.1 times the speed of light for bottomonia. The computation can then be approximated by an expansion in powers of '''v/c''' and '''v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''. This technique is called [[non-relativistic QCD]] (NRQCD).

[[Non-relativistic QCD|NRQCD]] has also been quantized as a [[lattice gauge theory]], which provides another technique for LQCD calculations to use. Good agreement with the bottomonium masses has been found, and this provides one of the best non-perturbative tests of LQCD. For charmonium masses the agreement is not as good, but the LQCD community is actively working on improving their techniques.  Work is also being done on calculations of such properties as widths of quarkonia states and transition rates between the states.

An early, but still effective, technique uses models of the ''effective'' potential to calculate masses of quarkonia states.  In this technique, one uses the fact that the motion of the quarks that comprise the quarkonium state is non-relativistic to assume that they move in a static potential, much like non-relativistic models of the hydrogen atom.  One of the most popular potential models is the so-called ''Cornell'' (or ''funnel'') ''potential''

:&lt;math&gt;V(r) = -\frac{a}{r} + br&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Hee Sok Chung | author2=Jungil Lee | author3=Daekyoung Kang | title=Cornell Potential Parameters for S-wave Heavy Quarkonia | doi=10.3938/jkps.52.1151 | year=2008 | journal=Journal of the Korean Physical Society | volume=52 | issue=4 | pages=1151 | arxiv=0803.3116 |bibcode = 2008JKPS...52.1151C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the effective radius of the quarkonium state, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are parameters.  This potential has two parts.  The first part, &lt;math&gt;a/r&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the potential induced by one-gluon exchange between the quark and its anti-quark, and is known as the ''Coulombic'' part of the potential, since its &lt;math&gt;1/r&lt;/math&gt; form is identical to the well-known Coulombic potential induced by the electromagnetic force.  The second part, &lt;math&gt;br&lt;/math&gt;, is known as the ''confinement'' part of the potential, and parameterizes the poorly understood non-perturbative effects of QCD.  Generally, when using this approach, a convenient form for the wave function of the quarks is taken, and then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are determined by fitting the results of the calculations to the masses of well-measured quarkonium states.  Relativistic and other effects can be incorporated into this approach by adding extra terms to the potential, much in the same way that they are for the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This form has been derived from QCD up to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{3}_{\text{QCD}}r^2)&lt;/math&gt; by Y. Sumino in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Y. Sumino | title=QCD potential as a "Coulomb-plus-linear" potential | doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2003.05.010 | year=2003 | journal=Physics Letters B | volume=571 | pages=173–183 | arxiv=hep-ph/0303120|bibcode = 2003PhLB..571..173S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular because it allows for accurate predictions of quarkonia parameters without a lengthy lattice computation, and provides a separation between the short-distance ''Coulombic'' effects and the long-distance ''confinement'' effects that can be useful in understanding the quark/anti-quark force generated by QCD.

Quarkonia have been suggested as a diagnostic tool of the formation of the [[quark–gluon plasma]]: both disappearance and enhancement of their formation depending on the yield of heavy quarks in plasma can occur.

'''Regasification''' is a process of converting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) at −162 °C (−260 °F) temperature back to natural gas at atmospheric temperature. LNG gasification plants can be located on land as well as on floating barges. Floating barge mounted plants have the advantage that they can be towed to new offshore locations for better usage in response to changes in the business environment. In a conventional [[:ru:Регазификационный терминал сжиженного природного газа|regasification plant]]&lt;sup&gt;RU&lt;/sup&gt;, LNG is heated by sea water to convert it to natural gas / [[methane]] gas.

==Byproducts==
In addition to regasification, many valuable industrial byproducts can be produced using cold energy of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thailand-energy-academy.org/admin/uploads/20120808085933.pdf LNG Cold Energy Utilization at LNG Receiving Terminals]&lt;/ref&gt; Cold energy of LNG utilisation for extracting liquid [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] gas from air, makes LNG-regasification plants more viable when they are located near [[Steel mill|integrated steel plants]] and/or [[Ammonia production|urea plants]]. Cold energy of LNG usage in lieu of massive and energy intensive cryogenic refrigeration units in [[natural-gas processing]] plants is also more viable economically. The natural gas processed with cold energy of LNG and the imported LNG can be readily injected into a conventional natural gas distribution system to reach the ultimate consumers.

The cold energy of LNG can be used for cooling the exhaust fluid of the [[gas turbine]] which is working in closed [[joule cycle]] with [[Argon]] gas as fluid. Thus near 100% conversion efficiency to electricity is achieved for the LNG/natural gas consumed by the gas turbine as its exhaust heat is fully used/absorbed for the gasification of LNG.

However, the abundant availability of natural gas, and the mature technology and its acceptability in using the LNG directly (without regasification) in road and rail vehicles would lead to lesser demand for LNG regasification plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gastechnology.org/Training/Documents/LNG17-proceedings/Transport-13-Jim-Harger-Presentation.pdf The On-Road LNG Transportation Market in the US]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], a '''salt''' is an [[ionic compound]] that can be formed by the [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] reaction of an [[acid]] and a [[Base (chemistry)|base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salts are composed of related numbers of [[cation]]s (positively [[electric charge|charged]] ions) and [[anion]]s (negative ions) so that the product is electrically [[electric charge|neutral]] (without a net charge). These component ions can be [[inorganic compound|inorganic]], such as chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), or [[organic chemistry|organic]], such as [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|CO|2|−}}); and can be [[monatomic ion|monatomic]], such as fluoride (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), or [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic]], such as [[sulphate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}).

==Types of salts==
Salts can be classified in a variety of ways. Salts that produce [[hydroxide]] ions when dissolved in [[water]] are called [[alkali salt]]s.  Salts that produce [[acidic]] solutions are ''acidic salts''. ''Neutral salts'' are those salts that are neither acidic nor basic. [[Zwitterion]]s contain an anionic and a cationic centres in the same [[molecule]], but are not considered to be salts. Examples of zwitterions include [[amino acid]]s, many [[metabolite]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref = Voet |author1 = Voet, D. |author2 = Voet, J, G. |lastauthoramp = yes |year = 2005 |title = Biochemistry |edition = 3rd |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. |location = Hoboken, NJ |url = http://www.chem.upenn.edu/chem/research/faculty.php?browse=V |isbn = 9780471193500 |doi =  |pages = 68 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911065858/http://www.chem.upenn.edu/chem/research/faculty.php?browse=V |archivedate = 2007-09-11 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[[File:ILfromOS.svg|thumb|[[BMIM-PF6|BMIM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], an [[ionic liquid]]]]

=== Color ===
Solid salts tend to be [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] as illustrated by [[sodium chloride]]. In many cases, the apparent [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] or [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]] are only related to the difference in size of the individual [[monocrystal]]s. Since light reflects from the [[Crystallite|grain boundaries]] (boundaries between crystallites), larger [[crystal]]s tend to be transparent, while the [[polycrystalline]] aggregates look like white powders.

Salts exist in many different [[color]]s, which arise either from the anions or cations.  For example:
*[[sodium chromate]] is yellow by virtue of the [[chromate]] ion  
*[[potassium dichromate]] is orange by virtue of the [[dichromate]] ion
*[[cobalt nitrate]] is red owing to the chromophore of hydrated cobalt(II) ([Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).
*[[copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] is blue because of the copper(II) chromophore
*[[potassium permanganate]] has the violet color of [[permanganate]] anion.
*[[nickel(II) chloride|nickel chloride]] is typically green of [NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]
*[[sodium chloride]], [[Magnesium sulfate|magnesium sulfate heptahydrate]] are colorless or white because the constituent cations and anions do not absorb in the visible part of the spectrum

Few [[minerals]] are salts because they would be solubilized by water. Similarly inorganic [[pigment]]s tend not to be salts, because insolubility is required for fastness.  Some organic [[dye]]s are salts, but they are virtually insoluble in water.

=== Taste ===
Different salts can elicit all five [[basic taste]]s, e.g., salty ([[sodium chloride]]), sweet ([[lead diacetate]], which will cause [[lead poisoning]] if ingested), sour ([[potassium bitartrate]]), [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] ([[magnesium sulfate]]), and [[umami]] or savory ([[monosodium glutamate]]).

=== Odor ===
Salts of strong acids and strong bases ("[[strong salts]]") are non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and often odorless, whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases ("[[weak salts]]") may smell like the [[conjugate acid]] (e.g., acetates like acetic acid ([[vinegar]]) and cyanides like [[hydrogen cyanide]] ([[almond]]s)) or the conjugate base (e.g., ammonium salts like [[ammonia]]) of the component ions. That slow, partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water, since [[hydrolysis]] is the other half of the [[reversible reaction]] equation of formation of [[weak salts]].

=== Solubility ===
{{see also|Solubility#Solubility of ionic compounds in water}}
Many ionic compounds exhibit significant [[Dissolution (chemistry)|solubility]] in water or other polar solvents. Unlike molecular compounds, salts dissociate in solution into anionic and cationic components.  
The [[lattice energy]], the cohesive forces between these ions within a solid, determines the solubility. The solubility is dependent on how well each ion interacts with the solvent, so certain patterns become apparent. For example, salts of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and ammonium are usually soluble in water.  Notable exceptions include [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]] and [[potassium cobaltinitrite]].  Most [[nitrates]] and many [[sulfate]]s are water-soluble. Exceptions include [[barium sulfate]], [[calcium sulfate]] (sparingly soluble), and [[lead(II) sulfate]], where the 2+/2− pairing leads to high lattice energies.  For similar reasons, most alkali metal [[carbonate]]s are not soluble in water. Some soluble carbonate salts are: [[sodium carbonate]], [[potassium carbonate]] and [[ammonium carbonate]].

=== Conductivity ===
Salts are characteristically [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. Molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity.  For this reason, liquified (molten) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called [[electrolyte]]s.

[[File:SegStackEdgeOnHMTFCQ.jpg|thumb|Edge-on view of portion of crystal structure of  hexamethylene[[Tetrathiafulvene|TTF]]/[[TCNQ]] charge transfer salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. Chasseau|author2=G. Comberton|author3=J. Gaultier|author4=C. Hauw|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|title=Réexamen de la structure du complexe hexaméthylène-tétrathiafulvalène-tétracyanoquinodiméthane|year=1978| volume=34|page=689|doi=10.1107/S0567740878003830}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Melting point===
Salts characteristically have high melting points.  For example, [[sodium chloride]] melts at 801&amp;nbsp;°C.  Some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature.  These include [[molten salt]]s, which are usually mixtures of salts, and [[ionic liquid]]s, which usually contain organic cations.  These liquids exhibit unusual properties as solvents.

== Nomenclature ==

The name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium'' or ''ammonium'') followed by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride'' or ''acetate''). Salts are often referred to only by the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium salt'' or ''ammonium salt'') or by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride salt'' or ''acetate salt'').

Common salt-forming cations include:

* [[Ammonium]] {{chem|NH|4|+}}
* [[Calcium]] {{chem|Ca|2+}}
* [[Iron]] {{chem|Fe|2+}} and {{chem|Fe|3+}}
* [[Magnesium]] {{chem|Mg|2+}}
* [[Potassium]] {{chem|K|+}}
* [[Pyridinium]] {{chem|C|5|H|5|NH|+}}
* [[Quaternary ammonium cation|Quaternary ammonium]] {{chem|NR|4|+}}, R being an [[alkyl]] group or an [[aryl]] group
* [[Sodium]] {{chem|Na|+}}
* [[Copper]] {{chem|Cu|2+}}

Common salt-forming anions (parent acids in parentheses where available) include:

* [[Acetate]] {{chem|CH|3|COO|−}} ([[acetic acid]])
* [[Carbonate]] {{chem|CO|3|2−}} ([[carbonic acid]])
* [[Chloride]] {{chem|Cl|−}} ([[hydrochloric acid]])
* [[Citrate]] {{chem|HOC(COO|−|)(CH|2|COO|−|)|2}} ([[citric acid]])
* [[Cyanide]] {{chem|C≡N|−}} ([[hydrocyanic acid]])
* [[Fluoride]] {{chem|F|−}} ([[hydrofluoric acid]])
* [[Nitrate]] {{chem|NO|3|−}} ([[nitric acid]])
* [[Nitrite]] {{chem|NO|2|−}} ([[nitrous acid]])
* [[Oxide]] {{chem|O|2−}}
* [[Phosphate]] {{chem|PO|4|3−}} ([[phosphoric acid]])
* [[Sulfate]] {{chem|SO|4|2−}} ([[sulfuric acid]])

Salts with varying number of hydrogen atoms, with respect to the parent acid, replaced by cations can be referred to as ''monobasic'', ''dibasic'' or ''tribasic'' salts (''polybasic'' salts refer to those with more than one hydrogen atom replaced):

* [[Monosodium phosphate|Sodium phosphate monobasic]] (NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Disodium phosphate|Sodium phosphate dibasic]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Trisodium phosphate|Sodium phosphate tribasic]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)

== Formation ==
[[Image:Lead(II) sulfate.jpg|thumb|Solid lead(II) sulfate (PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
Salts are formed by a [[chemical reaction]] between:

* A [[base (chemistry)|base]] and an [[acid]], e.g., [[ammonia|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] → [[ammonium chloride|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]]
* A [[metal]] and an [[acid]], e.g., [[magnesium|Mg]] + [[sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[magnesium sulfate|MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* A metal and a non-metal, e.g., [[calcium|Ca]] + [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* A [[base (chemistry)|base]] and an [[acid anhydride]], e.g., 2&amp;nbsp;[[Sodium Hydroxide|NaOH]] + [[Dichlorine monoxide|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] → 2&amp;nbsp;[[Sodium hypochlorite|NaClO]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]
* An [[acid]] and a [[base anhydride]], e.g., 2&amp;nbsp;[[nitric acid|HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Sodium oxide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] → 2&amp;nbsp;[[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]
* Salts can also form if solutions of different salts are mixed, their ions recombine, and the new salt is insoluble and precipitates (see: [[solubility equilibrium]]), for example:
*: Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2&amp;nbsp;NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Strong salt==
Strong salts or strong [[electrolyte]] salts are chemical salts composed of strong electrolytes. These [[ionic compound]]s dissociate completely in [[water]]. They are generally odourless and [[Volatility (chemistry)|nonvolatile]].

Strong salts start with Na__, K__, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;__, or they end with __NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, __ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or __CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO. Most group 1 and 2 metals form strong salts. Strong salts are especially useful when creating conductive compounds as their constituent ions allow for greater conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Ionization_Constants/Acid_and_Base_Strength |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213034814/http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Ionization_Constants/Acid_and_Base_Strength |archivedate=2016-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weak salts==
Weak salts or "weak electrolyte salts" are, as the name suggests, composed of weak [[electrolyte]]s.  They are generally more [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] than [[strong salt]]s.  They may be similar in [[odor]] to the [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]] they are derived from.  For example, [[sodium acetate]], NaCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO, smells similar to [[acetic acid]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.

&lt;!-- It has been established that this article will be written in ''American English'', with official names such as "aluminium" from the IUPAC spelled accordingly. --&gt;
'''Sapphire''' is a precious [[gemstone]], a variety of the mineral [[corundum]], consisting of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{nobreak|α-[[aluminium|Al]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}) with trace amounts of elements such as [[iron]], [[titanium]], [[chromium]], [[copper]], or [[magnesium]]. It is typically blue, but natural "fancy" sapphires also occur in yellow, purple, orange, and green colors; "parti sapphires" show two or more colors. The only color that sapphire cannot be is red – as red colored corundum is called [[ruby]],&lt;ref name=RefA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gia.edu/sapphire|title=Sapphire|last=|first=|date=|work= GIA | publisher = Gemological Institute of America Inc. |access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; another corundum variety. Pink colored corundum may be either classified as ruby or sapphire depending on locale. 
Commonly, natural sapphires are cut and polished into gemstones and worn in [[jewellery|jewelry]]. They also may be created synthetically in laboratories for industrial or decorative purposes in large [[boule (crystal)|crystal boules]]. Because of the remarkable [[hardness]] of sapphires – 9 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]] (the third hardest mineral, after [[diamond]] at 10 and [[moissanite]] at 9.5) –  sapphires are also used in some non-ornamental applications, such as [[infrared]] [[optics|optical]] components, high-durability [[window]]s, [[watch|wristwatch]] crystals and movement bearings, and very thin [[wafer (electronics)|electronic wafer]]s, which are used as the [[insulator (electrical)|insulating]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s of very special-purpose [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state electronics]] (especially integrated circuits and GaN-based LEDs).

Sapphire is the [[birthstone]] for September and the gem of the 45th [[anniversary gift|anniversary]]. A [[sapphire jubilee]] occurs after 65 years.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite new | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38872538 | work = BBC News | title = Queen's Sapphire Jubilee: Gun salutes mark 65 years on the throne | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]) | date = 6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural sapphires==
[[File:LgYellowSapphire.jpg|thumb|left|An uncut, rough yellow sapphire found at the Spokane Sapphire Mine near Helena, Montana]]

Sapphire is one of the two gem-varieties of [[corundum]], the other being [[ruby]] (defined as corundum in a shade of red). Although blue is the best-known sapphire color, they occur in other colors, including gray and black, and they can be colorless. A pinkish orange variety of sapphire is called [[Sapphire#Padparadscha|padparadscha]].

Significant sapphire deposits are found in [[Eastern Australia]], [[Thailand]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]] ([[Shandong]]), [[Madagascar]], [[East Africa]], and in [[North America]] in a few locations, mostly in [[Montana]].&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite book | author = Wise, Richard W. | title = Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones | year=2004 | publisher = Brunswick House Press | isbn = 0-9728223-8-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164–166}} Sapphire and rubies are often found in the same geological setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Wenk, Hans-Rudolf |author2=Bulakh, A. G. |title=Minerals: their constitution and origin|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0-521-52958-1|pages=539–541 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0GAvKQJ2JuwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every sapphire mine produces a wide range of quality, and origin is not a guarantee of quality. For sapphire, [[Kashmir]] receives the highest premium, although Burma, Sri Lanka, and Madagascar also produce large quantities of  fine quality gems.&lt;ref name=RefA/&gt;

The cost of natural sapphires varies depending on their color, clarity, size, cut, and overall quality. For gems of exceptional quality, an independent determination from a respected laboratory such as the [[Gemological Institute of America|GIA]], [[American Gemological Society|AGL]] or Gubelin of origin often adds to value.

===Blue sapphire===
[[File:Geschliffener blauer Saphir.jpg|thumb|upright|Teardrop-shaped blue sapphire]]

Gemstone color can be described in terms of [[hue]], [[Colorfulness|saturation]], and [[Lightness (color)|tone]]. Hue is commonly understood as the "[[color]]" of the gemstone. Saturation refers to the vividness or brightness of the hue, and tone is the lightness to darkness of the hue.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;{{rp|18–22}} Blue sapphire exists in various mixtures of its primary (blue) and secondary hues, various tonal levels (shades) and at various levels of saturation (vividness).

Blue sapphires are evaluated based upon the purity of their primary hue. [[Purple]], [[violet (color)|violet]], and [[green]] are the most common secondary hues found in blue sapphires.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;{{rp|163–169}} Violet and purple can contribute to the overall beauty of the color, while green is considered to be distinctly negative. Blue sapphires with up to 15% violet or purple are generally said to be of fine quality.  Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in blue sapphires. Gray reduces the saturation or brightness of the hue, and therefore has a distinctly negative effect.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;{{rp|163–169}}

The color of fine blue sapphires may be described as a vivid medium dark violet to purplish blue where the primary blue hue is at least 85% and the secondary hue no more than 15%, without the least admixture of a green secondary hue or a gray mask.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;{{rp|18–22}}

The {{convert|423|carat|adj=on}} [[Logan sapphire]] in the [[National Museum of Natural History]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], is one of the largest [[facet]]ed gem-quality blue sapphires in existence.[[File:Sapphire III cropped flash.jpg|thumb|left|Dark blue sapphire, probably of Australian origin, showing the brilliant surface luster typical of faceted corundum gemstones.]]

===Sapphires of other colors===
Sapphires in colors other than blue are called "fancy" or "parti colored" sapphires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BvyAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA605&amp;dq=Sapphires+in+colors+other+than+blue+called+fancy+or+parti+colored&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpxO3A0ITXAhUrxFQKHXeqDswQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Sapphires%20in%20colors%20other%20than%20blue%20called%20fancy%20or%20parti%20colored&amp;f=false|title=The Mineral Industry|date=1921|publisher=Scientific Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fancy sapphires are often found in yellow, orange, green, brown, purple and violet hues.&lt;ref name=GIA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gia.edu/sapphire-description|title=Sapphire Description|last=|first=|date=|website= GIA |publisher= Gemological Institute of America Inc. |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particolored sapphires are those stones which exhibit two or more colors within a single stone.&lt;ref name=GIA/&gt; Australia is the largest source of particolored sapphires; they are not commonly used in mainstream jewelry and remain relatively unknown. Particolored sapphires cannot be created synthetically and only occur naturally.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Colorless sapphires have historically been used as diamond substitutes in jewelry.&lt;ref name=GIA/&gt;

====Pink sapphires====
[[File:Pink sapphire ring.jpg|thumb|Pink sapphire (American terminology, may be classified as [[ruby]] outside of the United States)]]
Pink sapphires occur in shades from light to dark pink, and  deepen in color as the quantity of [[chromium]] increases. The deeper the pink color, the higher their monetary value. In the United States, a minimum color saturation must be met to be called a ruby, otherwise the stone is referred to as a ''pink sapphire''.&lt;ref name="matlins"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UANp6MCTSQC|title=Colored Gemstones|last=Matlins|first=Antoinette Leonard|publisher=Gemstone Press|year=2010|isbn=0-943763-72-X|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Padparadscha===
[[File:padpasmall.jpg|thumb|Faceted padparadscha]]

''Padparadscha'' is a delicate, light to medium toned, pink-orange to orange-pink hued [[corundum]], originally found in [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lazarosoho.com/Properties-of-Sapphire-Jewelry_b_55.html | title=Properties of Sapphire | publisher=Lazaro SoHo | accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also found in deposits in [[Vietnam]] and parts of [[East Africa]]. Padparadscha sapphires are rare; the rarest of all is the totally natural variety, with no sign of artificial treatment.&lt;ref name=hughes97&gt;{{cite book| first=Richard W.| last=Hughes| date=December 1997| title=Ruby &amp; Sapphire| location=Boulder, CO| publisher=RWH Publishing| isbn=978-0-9645097-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is derived from the Sanskrit "padma ranga" (padma = lotus; ranga = color), a color akin to the lotus flower (''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'').&lt;ref name=crowningshield1&gt;{{cite journal| title=Padparadscha: What's in a Name?| url=http://www.gia.edu/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=GIA%2FPage%2FGGArticleDetail&amp;pagename=GST%2FDispatcher&amp;cid=1355958490878| last=Crowningshield| first=Robert| work=[[Gems &amp; Gemology]]| date=Spring 2010| volume=19| issue=1| publisher=[[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA)| journal=| access-date=12 February 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628024944/https://www.gia.edu/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=GIA%2FPage%2FGGArticleDetail&amp;pagename=GST%2FDispatcher&amp;cid=1355958490878| archive-date=28 June 2017| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural padparadscha  sapphires often draw higher prices than many of even the finest blue sapphires. Recently, more sapphires of this color have appeared on the market as a result of a new artificial treatment method called "lattice diffusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MPZK8ILOSR0C&amp;pg=PA226|title=Gemstones: properties, identification and use|publisher=New Holland Publishers|year=2008|isbn=1-84537-602-1|page=226|author=Arthur Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Star sapphire===
[[File:Star-Saphire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Star sapphire]]
A ''star sapphire'' is a type of sapphire that exhibits a star-like phenomenon known as [[asterism (gemology)|asterism]]; red stones are known as "star rubies". Star sapphires contain intersecting needle-like [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] following the underlying [[crystal structure]] that causes the appearance of a six-rayed "star"-shaped pattern when viewed with a single overhead light source. The inclusion is often the mineral [[rutile]], a mineral composed primarily of [[titanium dioxide]].&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks451-3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5|pages=451–53 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones are cut ''[[en cabochon]]'', typically with the center of the star near the top of the dome. Occasionally, twelve-rayed stars are found, typically because two different sets of inclusions are found within the same stone, such as a combination of fine needles of rutile with small platelets of [[hematite]]; the first results in a whitish star and the second results in a golden-colored star. During crystallisation, the two types of inclusions become preferentially oriented in different directions within the crystal, thereby forming two six-rayed stars that are superimposed upon each other to form a twelve-rayed star.&lt;ref name=dutoit&gt;{{cite web| title=Twelve-Rayed Star Sapphire of Interest| url=http://www.giathai.net/pdf/12rays_purple_star_sapphire.pdf| last=DuToit| first=Garry| publisher=GIA Laboratory, Bangkok| accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misshapen stars or 12-rayed stars may also form as a result of [[Crystal twinning|twinning]].
The inclusions can alternatively produce a "[[Chatoyancy|cat's eye]]" effect&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;{{cite book| last=Morgan| first=Diane| title=Fire and blood: rubies in myth, magic, and history| year=2008| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKYPZGm37hMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn=978-0-275-99304-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the 'face-up' direction of the cabochon's dome is oriented perpendicular to the crystal's c-axis rather than parallel to it. If the dome is oriented in between these two directions, an 'off-center' star will be visible, offset away from the high point of the dome.&lt;ref name=hughes97/&gt;

[[The Star of Adam]] is the largest blue star sapphire which weighs 1404.49 carats. The gem was mined in the city of Ratnapura, southern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Sivaramakrishnan"&gt;{{cite news | title=World's largest blue star sapphire 'found in Sri Lanka' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35226276| first = P | last = Sivaramakrishnan | date = 4 January 2016 | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black Star of Queensland]], the second largest gem-quality star sapphire in the world, weighs 733 [[carat (unit)|carat]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-blacksapphire5-2010jan05,0,872801.story| title=For some, a sapphire has not been their best friend| accessdate=5 January 2010| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| first=Victoria| last=Kim| date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Star of India (gem)|Star of India]] mined in Sri Lanka and weighing 563.4 carats is thought to be the third-largest star sapphire, and is currently on display at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]]. The 182-carat [[Star of Bombay]], mined in Sri Lanka and located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], is another example of a large blue star sapphire. The value of a star sapphire depends not only on the weight of the stone, but also the body color, visibility, and intensity of the asterism.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Color change sapphire===
A rare variety of natural sapphire, known as color-change sapphire, exhibits different colors in different light. Color change sapphires are blue in outdoor light and purple under [[incandescent]] indoor light, or green to gray-green in daylight and pink to reddish-violet in incandescent light. Color change sapphires come from a variety of locations, including [[Thailand]] and [[Tanzania]]. The color-change effect is caused by the interaction of the sapphire, which absorbs specific wavelengths of light, and the light-source, whose spectral output varies depending upon the illuminant. Transition-metal impurities in the sapphire, such as chromium and vanadium, are responsible for the color change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=New Chromium- and Vanadium-Bearing Garnets from Tranoroa, Madagascar| url=http://www.gia.edu/Summer-2002-A2-Chromium-Vanadium-Bearing-Garnets-Madagascar-Schmetzer| date=Summer 2002| first1=Karl| last1=Schmetzer| first2=Thomas| last2=Hainschwang| first3=Heinz-Jürgen| last3=Bernhardt| first4=Lore| last4=Kiefert| volume=38| issue=1| work=Gems &amp; Gemology| publisher=Gemological Institute of America Inc.| journal=| access-date=14 August 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924041601/http://www.gia.edu/Summer-2002-A2-Chromium-Vanadium-Bearing-Garnets-Madagascar-Schmetzer| archive-date=24 September 2014| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain synthetic color-change sapphires have a similar color change to the natural gemstone [[alexandrite]] and they are sometimes marketed as "alexandrium" or "synthetic alexandrite". However, the latter term is a misnomer: synthetic color-change sapphires are, technically, not synthetic alexandrites but rather alexandrite ''simulants''. This is because genuine alexandrite is a variety of [[chrysoberyl]]: not sapphire, but an entirely different mineral.&lt;ref name=weldon&gt;{{cite web| title=An Introduction to Synthetic Gem Materials| url=http://www.gia.edu/gem-synthetic| last=Weldon| first=Robert| work = GIA | publisher= Gemological Institute of America Inc. | accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of color===
[[File:Corundum.png|thumb|Crystal structure of sapphire]]
[[File:Sapphire ring.jpg|thumb|Sapphire ring made circa 1940]]
[[Rubies]] are [[corundum]] which contain [[chromium]] impurities that absorb yellow-green light and result in deeper [[Ruby (color)|ruby red]] color with increasing content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html| title=Red Rubies | work = Causes of Color | accessdate=2014-08-14| publisher=[[WebExhibits]] online museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple sapphires contain trace amounts of [[vanadium]] and come in a variety of shades. Corundum that contains ~0.01% of [[titanium]] is colorless. If trace amounts of [[iron]] are present, a very pale yellow to green color may be seen. However, if both titanium and iron impurities are present together, and in the correct [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] states, the result is a deep-blue color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/8.html| title=Blue Sapphire | work = Causes of Color | accessdate=2014-08-14| publisher=[[WebExhibits]] online museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike localized ("intra-atomic") absorption of light which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence charge transfer, which is the transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the [[conduction band|conduction]] or [[valence band]]. The iron can take the form Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, while titanium generally takes the form Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. If Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are substituted for Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, localized areas of charge imbalance are created. An electron transfer from Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; can cause a change in the [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] state of both. Because of the valence change there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and [[electromagnetic energy]] is absorbed. The [[wavelength]] of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light. When this light is subtracted from incident white light, the complementary color blue results. Sometimes when atomic spacing is different in different directions there is resulting blue-green [[dichroism]].

Intervalence charge transfer is a process that produces a strong colored appearance at a low percentage of impurity. While at least 1% chromium must be present in corundum before the deep red ruby color is seen, sapphire blue is apparent with the presence of only 0.01% of titanium and iron.

===Treatments===
Sapphires can be treated by several methods to enhance and improve their clarity and color.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;{{rp|169}} It is common practice to heat natural sapphires to improve or enhance color. This is done by heating the sapphires in furnaces to temperatures between {{convert|500|and|1800|C}} for several hours, or by heating in a nitrogen-deficient atmosphere oven for seven days or more. Upon heating, the stone becomes more blue in color, but loses some of the rutile inclusions (silk). When high temperatures are used, the stone loses all silk (inclusions) and it becomes clear under magnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gaaj-zenhokyo.co.jp/researchroom/corundum/heat-treatment_01en.html | title = Identification of heated / unheated status on ruby and sapphire | accessdate = 21 March 2010 | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100309151251/http://www.gaaj-zenhokyo.co.jp/researchroom/corundum/heat-treatment_01en.html | archive-date = 9 March 2010 | date = 2007 | author = Research Laboratory | publisher = Gemmological Association of All Japan Co., Ltd. | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusions in natural stones are easily seen with a [[jeweler's loupe]]. Evidence of sapphire and other gemstones being subjected to heating goes back at least to Roman times.&lt;ref name=nassau&gt;{{Cite book| last=Nassau| first=Kurt| title=Gemstone Enhancement| year=1984| publisher=Butterworths| page=95| isbn=0-408-01447-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Un-heated natural stones are somewhat rare and will often be sold accompanied by a certificate from an independent gemological laboratory attesting to "no evidence of heat treatment".

[[File:Yogo2783 Close crop.JPG|thumb|[[Yogo sapphire]]]]
[[Yogo sapphire]]s sometimes do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep, they are generally free of the characteristic [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]], and they have high uniform clarity.&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kane|first=Robert E.|date=January–February 2003|volume=22|issue=1|title=The Sapphires of Montana – A Rainbow of Colors|journal=Gem Market News|pages=1–8|ref=harv}} Revised January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When Intergem Limited began marketing the Yogo in the 1980s as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire, heat treatment was not commonly disclosed; by 1982 the heat treatment became a major issue.&lt;ref name=voynickyogo&gt;{{cite book| last=Voynick| first=Stephen M. |title=Yogo, The Great American Sapphire| publisher=Mountain Press Publishing| year=1985| edition=March 1995 printing, 1987| place=Missoula, MT| isbn=0-87842-217-X| pages=151–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, 95% of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color.&lt;ref name=voynickheat&gt;{{harvnb|Voynick|1985|pp=165–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. This issue appeared as a front-page story in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on 29 August 1984 in an article by Bill Richards, ''Carats and Schticks: Sapphire Marketer Upsets The Gem Industry''.&lt;ref name=voynickheat/&gt;

Diffusion treatments are used to add impurities to the sapphire to enhance color. Typically [[beryllium]] is diffused into a sapphire under very high heat, just below the melting point of the sapphire. Initially (''c.'' 2000) orange sapphires were created, although now the process has been advanced and many colors of sapphire are often treated with beryllium. The colored layer can be removed when stones chip or are repolished or refaceted, depending on the depth of the impurity layer. Treated padparadschas may be very difficult to detect, and many stones are certified by gemological labs (''e.g.'', Gubelin, [[SSEF]], AGTA).

According to United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] guidelines, disclosure is required of any mode of enhancement that has a significant effect on the gem's value.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter I of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 23, Guides for Jewelry and Precious Metals and Pewter Industries&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways of treating sapphire. Heat-treatment in a reducing or oxidising atmosphere (but without the use of any other added impurities) is commonly used to improve the color of sapphires, and this process is sometimes known as "heating only" in the gem trade. In contrast, however, heat treatment combined with the deliberate addition of certain specific impurities (e.g. beryllium, titanium, iron, chromium or nickel, which are absorbed into the crystal structure of the sapphire) is also commonly performed, and this process can be known as "diffusion" in the gem trade. However, despite what the terms "heating only" and "diffusion" might suggest, both of these categories of treatment actually involve diffusion processes.&lt;ref name=nassauheat&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.gia.edu/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=GIA%2FPage%2FGGArticleDetail&amp;pagename=GST%2FDispatcher&amp;cid=1355958494312| first=Kurt| last=Nassau| title=Heat Treating Ruby and Sapphire: Technical Aspects| work=Gems &amp; Gemology| date=Fall 1981| volume=17| issue=3| journal=| access-date=2 January 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627184546/https://www.gia.edu/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=GIA%2FPage%2FGGArticleDetail&amp;pagename=GST%2FDispatcher&amp;cid=1355958494312| archive-date=27 June 2017| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining==
[[File:1szafir Madagaskar.jpg|left|thumb|Sapphire from Madagascar]]
Sapphires are mined from [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits or from primary underground workings. Commercial [[mining]] locations for sapphire and ruby include (but are not limited to) the following countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Australia]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Laos]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Thailand]], United States, and [[Vietnam]]. Sapphires from different geographic locations may have different appearances or chemical-impurity concentrations, and tend to contain different types of microscopic inclusions. Because of this, sapphires can be divided into three broad categories: classic metamorphic, non-classic metamorphic or magmatic, and classic magmatic.&lt;ref name=reports&gt;{{cite web| title=Your Ruby and Sapphire Reports| url=http://www.giathai.net/pdf/GIA_Corundum_7499_050307.pdf| publisher= Gemological Institute of America Inc. | work = GIA| date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Logan sapphire]], the [[Star of India (gem)|Star of India]], and the [[Star of Bombay]] originate from Sri Lankan mines. Madagascar is the world leader in sapphire production (as of 2007) specifically its deposits in and around the town of [[Ilakaka]].&lt;ref name=minedat&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mindat.org/loc-27802.html| title=Ilakaka Commune, Ranohira District, Horombe Region, Fianarantsoa Province, Madagascar| work=[[Mindat.org]] | publisher = Hudson Institute of Mineralogy | accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the opening of the Ilakaka mines, Australia was the largest producer of sapphires (such as in 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=auXS_gLKFjUC&amp;pg=PA102| page=102| title=Use with care: managing Australia's natural resources in the twenty-first century| first=Doug | last = Cocks| publisher=University of New South Wales Press| | location = Sydney, Australia | year=1992| isbn=0-86840-308-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a new source of sapphires was discovered in Andranondambo, southern Madagascar.

In [[North America]], sapphires have been mined mostly from deposits in [[Montana]]: fancies along the [[Missouri River]] near [[Helena, Montana]], Dry Cottonwood Creek near [[Deer Lodge, Montana]], and Rock Creek near [[Philipsburg, Montana]]. Fine blue [[Yogo sapphire]]s are found at Yogo Gulch west of [[Lewistown, Montana]].&lt;ref name=voynickyogo /&gt; A few gem-grade sapphires and rubies have also been found in the area of [[Franklin, NC|Franklin, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gem Mining in Franklin, NC|url=http://www.franklin-chamber.com/whattodo/gemmining.php|publisher=Franklin, North Carolina Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Sotheby’s Hong Kong achieved consecutive per-carat price records for Kashmir sapphires - first with the 12.00 carat Cartier sapphire ring at US$193,975 per carat, then with a 17.16 carat sapphire at US$236,404, and again in June 2015 when the per-carat auction record was set at US$240,205.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At present, the world record price-per-carat for sapphire at auction is held by a sapphire from Kashmir in a ring, which sold in October 2015 for approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]242,000 per carat ([[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]52,280,000 in total, including buyer's premium, or more than US$6.74 million).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/magnificent-jewels-and-jadeite-hk0590/lot.1860.html | title = 1860: THE JEWEL OF KASHMIR, Exceptional Sapphire and Diamond Ring | work = Magnificent Jewels &amp; Jadeite | publisher = Sotheby's | date = | access-date = 12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic sapphire== &lt;!--Synthetic sapphire redirects here--&gt;
[[File:SaphirSynthetique.jpg|thumb|Synthetic sapphire]]
[[File:Labstarsapphirering.JPG|thumb|Synthetic star sapphire]]

In 1902, the French chemist [[Auguste Verneuil]] developed a process for producing synthetic sapphire crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = M.A. | last = Verneuil | date = September 1904 | title = Mémoire sur la reproduction artificielle du rubis par fusion | trans-title = Memoire on the artificial reproduction of rubies by fusion | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 3 | issue = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Verneuil process]], named after him, fine [[alumina]] powder is added to an [[oxyhydrogen flame]], and this is directed downward against a mantle.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, Neal; ''The production and identification of artificial precious stones'' in {{cite book|title = Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, 1911

Chemical [[dopant]]s can be added to create artificial versions of the ruby, and all the other natural colors of sapphire, and in addition, other colors never seen in [[geological]] samples. Artificial sapphire material is identical to natural sapphire, except it can be made without the flaws that are found in natural stones. The disadvantage of Verneuil process is that the grown crystals have high internal strains. Many methods of manufacturing sapphire today are variations of the [[Czochralski process]], which was invented in 1916 by Polish chemist [[Jan Czochralski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Czochralski_process | title = Czochralski process | work = articleworld.org | publisher = ArticleWorld | access-date = 18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, a tiny sapphire seed crystal is dipped into a crucible made of the precious metal [[iridium]] or [[molybdenum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1962.tb11037.x|title=Application of Czochralski Crystal-Pulling Technique to High-Melting Oxides|year=1962|last1=Nassau|first1=K.|last2=Broyer|first2=A.

The alumina crystallizes on the end, creating long carrot-shaped boules of large size up to 200&amp;nbsp;kg in mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new | url = http://www.ledinside.com/news/2009/4/Rubicon_Technology_Grows_Super_boule_of_200kg_Weight_20090421 | title = Rubicon Technology Grows 200kg “Super Boule” | work = LED Inside | date = 21 April 2009 | first = Judy | last = Huang | publisher = TrendForce Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic sapphire is also produced industrially from agglomerated aluminium oxide, sintered and fused (such as by [[hot isostatic pressing]]) in an inert atmosphere, yielding a transparent but slightly [[porous]] [[polycrystalline]] product.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2003, the world's production of synthetic sapphire was 250 tons (1.25 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; carats), mostly by the United States and Russia.&lt;ref name=scheel&gt;{{Cite book|author=Scheel, Hans Jr̲g; Fukuda, Tsuguo|title=Crystal growth technology|year=2003|publisher=J.

Lytvynov |author3=Valerian Pishchik |publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=0-387-85694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of cheap synthetic sapphire unlocked many industrial uses for this unique material.

The first [[laser]] was made with a rod of synthetic ruby. [[Ti-sapphire laser|Titanium-sapphire laser]]s are popular due to their relatively rare capacity to be tuned to various wavelengths in the red and near-[[infrared]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. They can also be easily [[mode-locking|mode-locked]]. In these lasers a synthetically produced sapphire [[crystal]] with chromium or [[titanium]] impurities is irradiated with intense light from a special lamp, or another laser, to create [[stimulated emission]].

===Common applications===
====Windows====
[[File:cermax.jpg|thumb|Cermax xenon arc lamp with synthetic sapphire output window]]
Synthetic sapphire—sometimes referred to as ''sapphire glass''—is commonly used as a window material, because it is both highly transparent to wavelengths of light between 150&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|UV]]) and 5500&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Infra-red|IR]]) (the visible spectrum extends about 380&amp;nbsp;nm to 750&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Biology: Concepts and Applications|author = Cecie Starr|publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole|year = 2005|isbn = 0-534-46226-X|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&amp;pg=PA94|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and extraordinarily scratch-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.corning.com/news_center/features/gorillaglasssuccess.aspx | dead-url = yes | title = Corning® Gorilla® Glass Now Found On More Than 1.5 Billion Devices: Continuing innovation to fuel future versions, Sapphire not seen as major threat | date = May 2013 | location = Corning, N.Y. |publisher=Corning Incorporated | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130607071047/http://www.corning.com/news_center/features/gorillaglasssuccess.aspx | archive-date = 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/267068/everything-wanted-know-sapphire-glass-afraid-ask-qa/|title=Everything You Wanted To Know About Sapphire Glass, But Were Afraid To Ask [Q&amp;A] | first = Luke | last = Dormehl | date = 19 February 2014 | work = Cult of Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key benefits of sapphire windows are:
* Very wide optical transmission band from [[UV]] to [[near-infrared]], (0.15–5.5&amp;nbsp;µm)
* Significantly stronger than other optical materials or standard glass windows
* Highly resistant to scratching and abrasion (9 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] scale, the 3rd hardest natural substance next to [[moissanite]] and diamonds)&lt;ref name=IGS-Sapphire /&gt;
* Extremely high melting temperature (2030&amp;nbsp;°C)
[[File:Sapphire boule, Kyropoulos method.jpg|thumb|Single crystal sapphire boule grown by the [[Kyropoulos process|Kyropoulos method]]. Approximately 200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and approximately 30&amp;nbsp;kg. (A second boule is visible in the background.)]]

Some sapphire-glass windows are made from pure sapphire boules that have been grown in a specific crystal orientation, typically along the optical axis, the c-axis, for minimum [[birefringence]] for the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobrovinskaya|first1=Elena R.|last2=Lytvynov|first2=Leonid A.|last3=Pishchik|first3=Valerian|title=Properties of Sapphire|journal=Micro- and Opto-Electronic Materials, Structures, and Systems|date=2009|pages=82|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-85695-7_2|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-85695-7_2}} (direct link: [https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9780387856940-c1.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystals - Introduction|url=http://www.quartzpage.de/crs_intro.html|website=The Quartz Page|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010190156/http://www.quartzpage.de/crs_intro.html|archivedate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boules are sliced up into the desired window thickness and finally polished to the desired surface finish. Sapphire optical windows can be polished to a wide range of surface finishes due to its crystal structure and its hardness. The surface finishes of optical windows are normally called out by the scratch-dig specifications in accordance with the globally adopted MIL-O-13830 specification.{{clarification needed|date=October 2017}}

The sapphire windows are used in both high pressure and vacuum chambers for [[spectroscopy]], crystals in various [[watch]]es, and windows in grocery store [[barcode scanner]]s since the material's exceptional hardness and toughness makes it very resistant to scratching.&lt;ref name=scheel/&gt;

It is used for end windows on some high-powered laser tubes as its wide-band transparency and thermal conductivity allow it to handle very high power densities in the infra-red or UV spectrum without degrading due to heating.

Along with [[Zirconium dioxide|zirconia]] and [[aluminium oxynitride]], synthetic sapphire is used for shatter resistant windows in armored vehicles and various military [[body armor]] suits, in association with composites.

One type of [[xenon arc lamp]] – originally called the "Cermax" and now known generically as the "ceramic body xenon lamp" – uses sapphire crystal output windows. This product tolerates higher thermal loads and thus higher output powers when compared with conventional Xe lamps with pure silica window.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.perkinelmer.com/cmsresources/Images/44-6529bro_cermaxproductsandspecifications.pdf|title=Cermax® Products and Specifications | format = PDF | publisher = PerkinElmer Optoelectronics | location = Freemont, California, USA | date = | access-date = 12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.excelitas.com/Downloads/Cermax_Eng_Guide.pdf | title = Cermax® Xenon Lamp Engineering Guide | publisher = Excelitas Technologies | date = | access-date = 12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use as substrate for semiconducting circuits====
{{main article|silicon on sapphire}}

Thin sapphire wafers were the first successful use of an insulating [[substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]] upon which to deposit silicon to make the [[integrated circuit]]s known as [[silicon on sapphire]] or "SOS"; now other substrates can also be used for the class of circuits known more generally as [[silicon on insulator]]. Besides its excellent electrical insulating properties, sapphire has high [[thermal conductivity]]. [[CMOS]] chips on sapphire are especially useful for high-power radio-frequency (RF) applications such as those found in [[cellular telephones]], [[police radio|public-safety band]] radios, and [[satellite communication]] systems. "SOS" also allows for the monolithic integration of both [[digital electronics|digital]] and [[analog electronics|analog]] circuitry all on one IC chip, and the construction of extremely low power circuits.

In one process, after single crystal sapphire boules are grown, they are core-drilled into cylindrical rods, and wafers are then sliced from these cores.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Wafers of single-crystal sapphire are also used in the [[semiconductor]] industry as [[substrate (semiconductor)|substrates]] for the growth of devices based on [[gallium nitride]] (GaN). The use of sapphire significantly reduces the cost, because it has about one-seventh the cost of germanium. Gallium nitride on sapphire is commonly used in blue [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs).&lt;ref&gt;"Gallium nitride collector grid solar cell" (2002) {{US patent|6447938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use for endoprostheses====
Monocrystalline sapphire is fairly biocompatible and the exceptionally low wear of sapphire–metal pairs has led to the introduction (in Ukraine) of sapphire monocrystals for hip  
joint endoprostheses.&lt;ref name="sapphire"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamalis|first1=AG|last2=Ramsden|first2=JJ|last3=Grabchenko|first3=AI|last4=Lytvynov|first4=LA|last5=Filipenko|first5=VA|last6=Lavrynenko|first6=SN|title=A novel concept for the manufacture of individual sapphire-metallic hip  joint endoprostheses|journal=Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry|date=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=113–117|doi=10.4024/30601.jbpc.06.03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and cultural references==
* Etymologically, the English word "sapphire" derives from Latin ''sapphirus'', ''sappirus'' from Greek σαπφειρος (''sappheiros'') from Hebrew סַפִּיר (''sappir'').

[[File:Magnetite.jpg|thumb|Magnified crystals of  [[iron(II,III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the end-product of the ''Schikorr reaction'' along with [[hydrogen]] gas.]]
The '''Schikorr reaction''' formally describes the conversion of the [[iron(II) hydroxide]] (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into [[iron(II,III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

The basis of this transformation reaction was first studied by [[Gerhard Schikorr]], a German specialist of [[iron]] [[corrosion]], in his early works (~1928-1933) on [[iron hydroxide|iron(II) and iron(III) hydroxides]]. The global reaction that Schikorr proposed to explain his observations onto the iron hydroxides conversion, and which later received his name, can be written as follows:

:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{ferrous\ hydroxide}{3Fe(OH)2} -&gt; \underset{magnetite}{Fe3O4} + \underset{hydrogen}{H2} + \underset{water}{2H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;

== Reaction mechanism ==
The ''Schikorr reaction'' involves two distinct processes:

* the [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[oxidation]] of two Fe(II) (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) into Fe(III) (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) by the protons of water. The [[redox|reduction]] of two water [[proton]]s is accompanied by the production of molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and;
* the loss of two water molecules from the iron(II) and iron(III) hydroxides giving rise to its dehydration and to the formation of a [[thermodynamic]]ally more stable phase iron(II,III) oxide.

The global reaction can thus be decomposed in half [[redox reaction]]s as follows:

:2 (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) (oxidation of 2 iron(II) ions)

:2 (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → ½ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) (reduction of 2 water protons)

to give:

:2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Adding to this reaction one intact iron(II) ion for each two oxidized iron(II) ions leads to:

:3 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Electroneutrality requires the iron cations on both sides of the equation to be counterbalanced by 6 hydroxyl anions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;):

:3 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

For completing the main reaction, two companion reactions have still to be taken into account:

The autoprotolysis of the hydroxyl anions; a [[proton]] exchange between two OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, like in a classical [[acid-base reaction]]:

:OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:acid 1 + base 2 → base 1 + acid 2, or also,
:2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

it is then possible to reorganize the global reaction as:

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) + (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → FeO + Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → FeO + Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Considering then the formation reaction of iron(II,III) oxide:

:Fe(II)O + Fe(III)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

it is possible to write the balanced global reaction:

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (FeO·Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

in its final form, known as the ''Schikorr reaction'':

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== Occurrences ==
The Schikorr reaction can occur in the process of anaerobic corrosion of [[iron]] and [[carbon steel]] in various conditions.

Anaerobic corrosion of metallic iron to give iron(II) hydroxide and hydrogen:

:3 (Fe + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

followed by the Schikorr reaction:

:3 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

give the following global reaction:

:3 Fe + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 Fe + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

At low temperature, the anaerobic corrosion of iron can give rise to the formation of "green rust" ([[fougerite]]) an unstable [[layered double hydroxide]] (LDH). In function of the geochemical conditions prevailing in the environment of the corroding steel, iron(II) hydroxide and green rust can progressively transform in iron(II,III) oxide, or if [[bicarbonate]] ions are present in solution, they can also evolve towards more stable [[carbonate]] phases such as [[iron carbonate]] (FeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), or [[iron(II) hydroxycarbonate]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chukanovite]]) isomorphic to [[copper(II) hydroxycarbonate]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[malachite]]) in the [[copper]] system.

== Application fields ==
[[Wikt:anaerobic|Anaerobic]] oxidation of [[iron]] and [[steel]] commonly finds place in [[anoxic waters|oxygen-depleted]] environments, such as in permanently water-saturated [[soil]]s, [[peat bog]]s or [[wetland]]s in which [[archaeology|archaeological]] iron artefacts are often found.

Anaerobic oxidation of [[carbon steel]] of [[:wikt:canister|canister]]s and overpacks is also expected to occur in deep geological formations in which [[High level waste|high-level radioactive waste]] and [[spent fuel]]s should be ultimately disposed. Nowadays, in the frame of the [[corrosion]] studies related to HLW disposal, anaerobic corrosion of [[steel]] is receiving a renewed and continued attention. Indeed, it is essential to understand this process to guarantee the total [[containment]] of HLW waste in an engineered barrier during the first centuries or millennia when the radiotoxicity of the waste is high and when it emits a significant quantity of [[heat]].

The question is also relevant for the corrosion of the [[reinforcement bar]]s ([[rebar]]s) in [[concrete]] (Aligizaki ''et al.'', 2000). This deals then with the [[service life]] of concrete structures, amongst others the near-surface [[vault (waste disposal)|vaults]] intended for hosting [[low-level radioactive waste]].

== Hydrogen evolution ==
The slow but continuous production of hydrogen in deep low-permeability argillaceous formations could represent a problem for the long-term disposal of radioactive waste (Ortiz ''et al.'', 2001; Nagra, 2008; recent Nagra NTB reports). Indeed, a gas pressure build-up could occur if the rate of hydrogen production by the anaerobic corrosion of carbon-steel and by the subsequent transformation of green rust into magnetite should exceed the rate of diffusion of dissolved H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the pore water of the formation. The question is presently the object of many studies (King, 2008; King and Kolar, 2009; Nagra Technical Reports 2000–2009) in the countries (Belgium, Switzerland, France, Canada) envisaging the option of disposal in clay formation.

== Hydrogen embrittlement of steel alloys ==
When [[nascent hydrogen]] is produced by anaerobic corrosion of iron by the protons of water, the [[atomic hydrogen]] can diffuse into the metal [[crystal lattice]] because of the existing concentration gradient. After [[diffusion]], hydrogen atoms can recombine into [[molecular hydrogen]] giving rise to the formation of high-pressure micro-bubbles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the metallic lattice. The trends to expansion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubbles and the resulting [[tensile stress]] can generate cracks in the metallic [[alloy]]s sensitive to this effect also known as [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. Several recent studies (Turnbull, 2009; King, 2008; King and Kolar, 2009) address this question in the frame of the radioactive waste disposal in Switzerland and Canada.

According to Inoue (2003): "In modern scholarship, the term is often used with reference to kami worship and related theologies, rituals and practices. In these contexts, 'Shinto' takes on the meaning of 'Japan's traditional religion', as opposed to foreign religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;Inoue Nobutaka, ''Shinto, a Short History'' (2003) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinto religious expressions have been distinguished by scholars into a series of categories:&lt;ref&gt;Nobutaka Inoue. ''Shinto: A Short History''. Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0415319137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Nihongo|[[Shrine Shinto]]|[[:ja:神社神道|神社神道]]|Jinja-Shintō}}, the main tradition of Shinto, has always been a part of Japan's history. It consists of taking part in worship practices and events at local shrines. Before the [[Meiji Restoration]], shrines were disorganized institutions usually attached to [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]]; in the Meiji Restoration, they were made independent systematized institutions. The current successor to the imperial organization system, the [[Association of Shinto Shrines]], oversees about 80,000 shrines nationwide.
* {{Nihongo|[[Imperial Household Shinto]]|皇室神道|Kōshitsu-Shintō}} are the religious rites performed exclusively by the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial family]] at the [[Three Palace Sanctuaries|three shrines]] on the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|imperial grounds]], including the Ancestral Spirits Sanctuary (Kōrei-den) and the Sanctuary of the Kami (Shin-den).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Shinto: The Kami Way |publisher=Charles E Tuttle Co |location=[[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, VT]] |first=Ono |last=Sokyo |edition=1st |year=1962 |page=13 |isbn=0-8048-1960-2 |oclc=40672426}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Nihongo|[[Folk Shinto]]|民俗神道|Minzoku-Shintō}} includes the numerous folk beliefs in deities and spirits. Practices include [[divination]], [[spirit possession]], and [[Shamanism|shaman]]ic healing. Some of their practices come from [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] or [[Confucianism]], but most come from ancient local traditions.
* {{Nihongo|[[Sect Shinto]]|教派神道|Kyōha-Shintō}} is a legal designation originally created in the 1890s to separate government-owned shrines from local organised religious communities. These communities originated especially in the [[Edo period]]. The basic difference between Shrine Shinto and Sect Shinto is that sects are a later development and grew self-consciously.  They can identify a founder, a formal set of teachings and even sacred scriptures. Sect Shinto groups are thirteen, and usually classified under five headings: pure Shinto sects (''Shinto Taikyo'', ''Shinrikyo'' and ''Izumo Oyashirokyo''), [[Confucianism|Confucian]] sects (''Shinto Shusei-ha'' and ''Taiseikyo/体制教 ),''mountain worship sects (''Jikkokyo'', ''Fusokyo'' and ''Mitakekyo'' or ''Ontakekyo''), purification sects (''Shinshukyo'' and ''Misogikyo''), and faith-healing sects (''Kurozumikyo／黒住教,'' ''[[Konkokyo]]/今故郷 and'' its branching ''[[Omotokyo]]/お元教師'' and ''[[Tenrikyo]]／天理教''.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart D. B. Picken, 1994. pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Nihongo|[[Koshintō]]|古神道|Ko-shintō}}, literally 'Old Shinto', is a reconstructed "Shinto from before the time of Buddhism", today based on [[Ainu religion]] and [[Ryukyuan religion|Ryukyuan practices]]. It continues the restoration movement begun by [[Hirata Atsutane]].

Many other [[Shinto sects and schools|sects and schools]] can be distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/sects-glossary-shintoism.html Glossary A to Z – Shintō Schools &amp; Sects]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Nihongo|Faction Shinto|宗派神道|Shūha-Shintō}} is a grouping of [[Japanese new religions]] developed since the second half of the 20th century that have significantly departed from traditional Shinto and are not always regarded as part of it.

==Theology and cosmology==

===''Kami''===
{{Main|Kami}}
''Kami'', ''shin'', or, archaically, ''jin'' (神) is defined in English as "god", "spirit", or "spiritual essence", all these terms meaning "the energy generating a thing".&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B. Picken, 1994. p. xxii"/&gt; Since the [[Japanese language]] does not distinguish between singular and plural, ''kami'' refers to the [[divinity]], or [[sacred]] essence, that manifests in multiple forms. Rocks, trees, rivers, animals, places, and even people can be said to possess the nature of ''kami''.&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B. Picken, 1994. p. xxii"/&gt; Kami and people exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

Early anthropologists called Shinto "[[animistic]]" in which animate and inanimate things have spirits or souls that are worshipped. The concept of animism in Shinto is no longer current, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Williams|title=Shinto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hmFOZe7m4MC&amp;pg=PA151|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=151 note 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shinto gods are collectively called {{Nihongo|''yaoyorozu no kami''|八百万の神}}, an expression literally meaning "eight million kami", but interpreted as meaning "[[myriad]]", although it can be translated as "many kami". There is a phonetic variation, ''kamu'', and a similar word in the [[Ainu language]], ''[[kamui]]''. An analogous word is ''mi-koto''.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20100314x1.html In the land of the ''kami''], ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kami'' refers particularly to the power of phenomena that inspire a sense of wonder and awe in the beholder (the [[sacred]]), testifying to the divinity of such a phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B. Picken, 1994. p. xxii"/&gt; It is comparable to what [[Rudolf Otto]] described as the ''mysterium tremendum et fascinans'', which translates as "fearful and fascinating mystery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adler|first1=Joseph|title=Rudolf Otto's Concept of the "Numinous"|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln101/Otto.htm|website=Kenyon College Department of Religion|publisher=Kenyon College|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kami'' reside in all things, but certain objects and places are designated for the interface of people and kami: ''[[yorishiro]]'', ''[[shintai]]'', [[Shinto shrine|shrines]], and ''[[kamidana]]''. There are natural places considered to have an unusually sacred spirit about them and are objects of worship. They are frequently mountains, trees, unusual rocks, rivers, waterfalls, and other natural things. In most cases they are on or near a shrine grounds. The shrine is a building in which the kami is enshrined (housed). It is a [[temple|sacred space]], creating a separation from the "ordinary" world. The ''kamidana'' is a household shrine that acts as a substitute for a large shrine on a daily basis. In each case the object of worship is considered a sacred space inside which the kami spirit actually dwells, being treated with the utmost respect.

===''Kannagara''===
In Shinto, ''kannagara'' (惟神 or 随神), meaning "way [path] of [expression] of the ''kami''", refers to the law of the [[cosmos|natural order]].&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B 1994"&gt;Stuart D. B. Picken, 1994. p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sense of the terms ''michi'' or ''to'', "way", in the terms "kami-no-michi" or "Shinto".&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B 1994"/&gt; Those who understand ''kannagara'' know the divine, the human, and how people should live.&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B 1994"/&gt; From this knowledge stems the [[ethics|ethical]] dimension of Shinto, focusing on sincerity (''makoto''), honesty (''tadashii'') and purity.&lt;ref name="Stuart D. B 1994"/&gt;

===''Amenominakanushi''===
{{Main|Amenominakanushi}}
According to the ''[[Kojiki]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29, note 92&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amenominakanushi'' (天御中主 "[[Tian|All-Father]] of the Originating Hub", or 天之御中主神 "Heavenly Ancestral God of the Originating Heart of the Universe") is the first ''kami'', and the concept of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|source of the universe]] according to theologies.&lt;ref name="Amenominakanushi"&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=38 Amenominakanushi]. Encyclopedia of Shinto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29"&gt;Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japanese mythology|mythology]] he is described as a "god who came into being alone" (''[[hitorigami]]''), the first of the ''zōka sanshin''("three ''kami'' of creation"), and one of the five ''[[kotoamatsukami]]'' ("distinguished heavenly gods").&lt;ref name="Amenominakanushi"/&gt;

Amenominakanushi had been considered a concept developed under the influence of [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese thought]],&lt;ref name="Amenominakanushi"/&gt; but now most scholars believe otherwise.&lt;ref name="izumo"&gt;匝瑤 葵「宇宙を構成する古事記の別天神―出雲大社の天空神」 『アジア遊学』No.121, pp.94-101, 勉誠出版, 2009年&lt;/ref&gt; With the flourishing of ''[[kokugaku]]'' the concept was studied by scholars.&lt;ref name="Amenominakanushi"/&gt; The theologian [[Hirata Atsutane]] identified Amenominakanushi as the spirit of the [[North Star]], master of the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]].&lt;ref name="Amenominakanushi"/&gt; The god was emphasised by the ''Daikyōin'' in the [[Meiji period]], and worshiped by some Shinto sects.&lt;ref name="Amenominakanushi"/&gt;

The god manifests in a duality, a male and a female function, respectively ''Takamimusubi'' (高御産巣日神) and ''Kamimusubi'' (神産巣日神).&lt;ref name="Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29"/&gt; In other mythical accounts the originating ''kami'' is called ''Umashiashikabihikoji'' (宇摩志阿斯訶備比古遅神 "God of the ''Ashi'' [Reed]") or ''Kuninotokotachi'' (国之常立神 in Kojiki, 国常立尊 in Nihonshoki; ''Kunitokotachi-no-Kami'' or ''Kuninotokotachi-no-Kami''; the "God Founder of the Nation"), the latter used in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa, 1987. pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of Japan===
{{Main|Japanese creation myth}}
[[File:Kobayashi Izanami and Izanagi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Izanami-no-Mikoto and Izanagi-no-Mikoto, by Kobayashi Eitaku, late 19th century.]]
The generation of the [[Japanese archipelago]] is expressed mythologically as the action of two gods: [[Izanagi]] ("He-who-invites") and [[Izanami]] ("She-who-is-invited").&lt;ref name="Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29"/&gt; The interaction of these two principles begets the islands of Japan and a further group of ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29"/&gt;

The events are described in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' as follows:
* Izanagi-no-Mikoto (male) and Izanami-no-Mikoto (female) were called by all the myriad gods and asked to help each other to create a new land which was to become Japan.
* They were given a spear with which they stirred the water, and when removed water dripped from the end, an island was created in the great nothingness.
* They lived on this island, and created a palace. Within the palace was a large pole.
* When they wished to bear offspring, they performed a ritual each rounding a pole, male to the left and female to the right, the female greeting the male first.
* They had two children (islands) which turned out badly and they cast them out. They decided that the ritual had been done incorrectly the first time.
* They repeated the ritual but according to the correct laws of nature, the male spoke first.
* They then gave birth to the eight perfect islands of the Japanese archipelago.
* After the islands, they gave birth to the other Kami. Izanami-no-Mikoto died in childbirth, however, and Izanagi-no-Mikoto tried to revive her.
* His attempts to deny the laws of life and death have bad consequences.

In the myth, the birth of the god of fire (''[[Kagu-Tsuchi]]'') causes the death of Izanami, who descends into ''[[Yomi|Yomi-no-kuni]]'', the netherworld. Izanagi chases her there, but runs away when he finds the dead figure of his spouse.&lt;ref name="Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29"/&gt; As he returns to the land of the living, [[Amaterasu]] (the sun goddess) is born from his left eye, [[Tsukiyomi]] (the moon deity) from his right eye, and [[Susanoo]] (the storm deity) is born from Izanagi's nose.&lt;ref name="Kitagawa, 1987. p. 29"/&gt;

[[File:Karasuzumo purification ritual.jpg|thumb|Shinto purification rite after a ceremonial children's [[sumo]] tournament at the [[Kamigamo Jinja]] in [[Kyoto]].]]

===Impurity===
Shinto teaches that certain deeds create a kind of [[Ritual purification|ritual impurity]] that one should want cleansed for one's own peace of mind and good fortune rather than because impurity is wrong. Wrong deeds are called {{nihongo|"impurity"|穢れ|[[kegare]]}}, which is opposed to {{Nihongo|"purity"|清め|kiyome}}. Normal days are called "day" (''ke''), and festive days are called "sunny" or, simply, "good" (''hare'').&lt;ref name="Sugimoto1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Japanese Society |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge (town), New York|Cambridge, NY]] |first=Yoshio |last=Sugimoto |year=1997 |pages=230–231 |isbn=0-521-41692-2 |oclc=35008178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are killed without being shown gratitude for their sacrifice will hold a {{Nihongo|grudge|怨み|urami}} (grudge) and become powerful and evil ''kami'' who seek revenge (''aragami'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jref.com/articles/shinto.27/ Religion: Shinto] ''jref.com'', accessed 30 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if anyone is injured on the grounds of a shrine, the area must be ritually purified.
[[File:NikkoPaperOffering5174.jpg|[[Haraegushi]] (祓串) for purification|thumb|upright=0.8]]

===Purification===
[[File:Jichinsai-himorogi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Jichinsai groundbreaking ceremony]]
[[Ritual purification|Purification]] rites called [[Harae]] are a vital part of Shinto. They are done on a daily, weekly, seasonal, lunar, and annual basis. These rituals are the lifeblood of the practice of Shinto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/purification-core-ancient-shinto-faith-003108?nopaging=1 Riley Winters 28 August 2018 Purification as the Core of the Ancient Shinto Faith] ''ancient-origins.net'', accessed 30 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2018}} Such ceremonies have also been adapted to modern life. New buildings made in Japan are frequently [[blessing|blessed]] by a Shinto priest called {{nihongo||神主|[[kannushi]]}} during the groundbreaking ceremony (Jichinsai 地鎮祭), and many cars made in Japan have been blessed as part of the assembly process. Moreover, many Japanese businesses built outside Japan have a Shinto priest perform ceremonies. On occasion priests visit annually to re-purify.

==Afterlife==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shinto as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.

Unlike many religions, one does not need to publicly profess belief in Shinto to be a believer. Whenever a child is born in Japan, a local [[Shinto shrine]] adds the child's name to a list kept at the shrine and declares him or her a {{Nihongo|"family child"|氏子|ujiko}}. After death an ''ujiko'' becomes a {{Nihongo|"family spirit", or "family ''kami''"|氏神|ujigami}}. One may choose to have one's name added to another list when moving and then be listed at both places. Names can be added to the list without consent and regardless of the beliefs of the person added to the list. This is not considered an imposition of belief, but a sign of being welcomed by the local ''kami'', with the promise of addition to the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of ''kami'' after death.

=== Shinto funeral ===
Shinto funerals were established during the Tokugawa period and focused on two themes: concern for the fate of the corpse and maintenance of the relationship between the living and the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30233666|title=Shinto Funerals in the Edo Period|last=Kenney|first=Elizabeth|date=2000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least twenty steps involved in burying the dead. Mourners wear solid black in a day of mourning called Kichu-fuda and a Shinto priest will perform various rituals. People will give monetary gifts to the deceased's family called Koden, and Kotsuge is the gathering of the deceased's ashes. Some of the ashes are taken by family members to put in their home shrines at the step known as Bunkotsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/shinto-funeral-beliefs-rituals-5894.html|title=Shinto Funeral Beliefs and Rituals|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal worship of ''kami'' is done at public shrines or worship at small home shrines called ''[[kamidana]]'' (神棚, lit. "god-shelf"). The public shrine is a building or place that functions as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for ''kami''. A fewer number of shrines are also natural places called ''mori''. The most common of the ''mori'' are sacred groves of trees, or mountains, or waterfalls. All shrines are open to the public at some times or throughout the year.

While many of the public shrines are elaborate structures, all are characteristic Japanese architectural styles of different periods depending on their age. Shrines are fronted by a distinctive Japanese gate (鳥居, ''[[torii]]'') made of two uprights and two crossbars denoting the separation between common space and sacred space. The ''torii'' have 20 styles and matching buildings based on the enshrined kami and lineage.

There are a number of symbolic and real barriers that exist between the normal world and the shrine grounds including: statues of protection, gates, fences, ropes, and other delineations of ordinary to sacred space. Usually there will be only one or sometimes two approaches to the Shrine for the public and all will have the ''torii'' over the way. In shrine compounds, there are a ''[[haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'' (拝殿) or public hall of worship, ''[[heiden (Shinto)|heiden]]'' (幣殿) or hall of offerings and the ''[[honden]]'' (本殿) or the main hall. The innermost precinct of the grounds is the ''honden'' or worship hall, which is entered only by the high priest, or worshippers on certain occasions. The ''honden'' houses the symbol of the enshrined ''kami''.

The heart of the shrine is periodic rituals, spiritual events in parishioners' lives, and festivals. All of this is organized by priests who are both [[Conduit (spiritualism)|spiritual conduits]] and administrators. Shrines are private institutions, and are supported financially by the congregation and visitors. Some shrines may have festivals that attract hundreds of thousands, especially in the New Year season.

===''Omairi''===
[[File:ItsukushimaBasin7406.jpg|thumb|left|''Temizu Basin—Itsukushima Jinja'']]{{More citations needed|date=July 2017}}
Any person may visit a shrine and one need not be Shinto to do this. Doing so is called ''Omairi''.
Typically there are a few basic steps to visiting a shrine.
* At any entrance gate, bow respectfully before passing through.
* If there is a hand washing basin provided, perform Temizu: take the dipper in your right hand and scoop up water. Pour some onto your left hand, then transfer the dipper to your left hand and pour some onto your right hand. Transfer the dipper to your right hand again, cup your left palm, and pour water into it, from which you will take the water into your mouth (never drink directly from the dipper), silently swish it around in your mouth (do not drink), then quietly spit it out into your cupped left hand (not into the reservoir). Then, holding the handle of the dipper in both hands, turn it vertically so that the remaining water washes over the handle. Then replace it where you found it.
* Approach the shrine; if there is a bell, you may ring the bell first (or after depositing a donation); if there is a box for donations, leave a modest one in relation to your means; then bow twice, clap twice, and hold the second clap with your hands held together in front of your heart for a closing bow after your prayers.
* There is variation in how this basic visitation may go, and depending on the time of year and holidays there may also be other rituals attached to visitations.
* Be sincere and respectful to the staff and other visitors, and if at all possible, be quiet. Do be aware that there are places one should not go on the shrine grounds. Do not wear shoes inside any buildings.

===''Harae''===
{{Main|Harae}}

The rite of ritual purification, usually done daily at a shrine, is a ceremony of offerings and prayers of several forms. Shinsen (food offerings of fruit, fish, and vegetables), tamagushi ([[sakaki]] tree branches), shio (salt), gohan (rice), mochi (rice cake), and [[sake]] (rice wine) are all typical offerings. On holidays and other special occasions the inner shrine doors may be opened and special offerings made.

===''Misogi''===
{{Main|Misogi}}
Misogi means purification. Misogi harai or Misogi Shūhō (禊修法) is the term for water purification.

The practice of purification by ritual use of water while reciting prayers is typically done daily by regular practitioners, and when possible by lay practitioners. There is a defined set of prayers and physical activities that precede and occur during the ritual. This will usually be performed at a shrine, in a natural setting, but can be done anywhere there is clean running water.&lt;ref name="Sokyo1962" /&gt;

The basic performance of this is the hand and mouth washing (Temizu 手水) done at the entrance to a shrine. The more dedicated believer may perform misogi by standing beneath a waterfall or performing the ritual [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] in a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=James W. (James Waldemar)|last2=Williams|first2=Ron G.|title=Japanese Shinto: An Interpretation of a Priestly Perspective|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=2005|volume=55|issue=1|pages=33–63|doi=10.1353/pew.2004.0039|postscript={{subscription needed}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice comes from Shinto history, when the kami Izanagi-no-Mikoto first performed misogi after returning from the land of Yomi, where he was made impure by Izanami-no-Mikoto after her death.

===''Imi''===
Another form of ritual cleanliness is avoidance, which means that a [[taboo]] is placed upon certain persons or acts. To illustrate, one would not visit a shrine if a close relative in the household had died recently. Killing is generally unclean and is to be avoided. When one is performing acts that harm the land or other living things, prayers and rituals are performed to placate the Kami of the area. This type of cleanliness is usually performed to prevent ill outcomes.

===Amulets and talismans===
[[File:KasugaTaisha2.jpg|thumb|A woman tying her fortune written on a white piece of paper (''omikuji'') to a frame at [[Kasuga Shrine]]]]
{{Main|Ema (Shinto)}}
[[Ema (Shinto)|Ema]] are small wooden plaques that wishes or desires are written upon and left at a place in the shrine grounds so that one may get a wish or desire fulfilled. They have a picture on them and are frequently associated with the larger Shrines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title= Handy Bilingual Reference For Kami and Jinja |work= Study Group of Shinto Culture |year=2006 |publisher=International Cultural Workshop Inc. |location=Tokyo |pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ofuda]]'' are talismans—made of paper, wood, or metal—that are issued at shrines. They are inscribed with the names of [[kami]] and are used for protection in the home. They are typically placed in the home at a [[kamidana]]. Ofuda may be kept anywhere, as long as they are in their protective pouches, but there are several rules about the proper placement of kamidana. They are also renewed annually.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''[[Omamori]]'' are personal-protection amulets that are sold by shrines. They are frequently used to ward off bad luck and to gain better health. More recently, there are also amulets to promote good driving, good business, and success at school. Their history lies with Buddhist practice of selling amulets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They are generally replaced once a year, and old omamori are brought to a shrine so they can be properly disposed of through burning by a priest.

''[[Omikuji]]'' are paper lots upon which personal fortunes are written.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The fortunes can range from ''daikichi'' (大吉), meaning "great good luck," to ''daikyou'' (大凶), meaning "great bad luck."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ueoka|first=Ryoko|last2=Kamiyama|first2=Naoto|date=2015-08-02|title=Fortune Air: An Interactive Fortune Telling System Using Vortex Air Cannon|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20618-9_63|journal=Human Interface and the Management of Information.

A ''[[Daruma doll|daruma]]'' is a round, paper doll of the Indian monk, [[Bodhidharma]]. The recipient makes a wish and paints one eye; when the goal is accomplished, the recipient paints the other eye. While this is a Buddhist practice, darumas can be found at shrines, as well. These dolls are very common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Other protective items include ''dorei'', which are earthenware bells that are used to pray for good fortune. These bells are usually in the shapes of the zodiacal animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''hamaya'', which are symbolic arrows for the fight against evil and bad luck;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and ''Inuhariko'', which are paper dogs that are used to induce and to bless good births.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===''Kagura''===
[[File:Niiname-sai,traditional Japanese dance,katori-jingu-shrine,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|left|''Kagura traditional dance, Katori Jingu, Katori City'']]
''[[Kagura]]'' is the ancient Shinto ritual dance of [[shamanic]] origin. The word "kagura" is thought to be a contracted form of ''kami no kura'' or "seat of the kami" or the "site where the kami is received."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazushige Kobayashi|Kobayashi, Kazushige]]; [[Peter Knecht (academic)|Knecht, Peter]], "On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura", ''Asian Folklore Studies'' 40 (1): 1, 1981, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[mythology|mythological]] tale of how ''kagura'' dance came into existence. The sun goddess [[Amaterasu]] became very upset at her brother so she hid in a cave. All of the other gods and goddesses were concerned and wanted her to come outside. Ame-no-uzeme began to dance and create a noisy commotion in order to entice Amaterasu to come out. The kami (gods) tricked Amaterasu by telling her there was a better sun goddess in the heavens. Amaterasu came out and light returned to the universe.&lt;ref name="Sokyo1962" /&gt;

Music plays a very important role in the ''kagura'' performance. Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the gods and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities. There is also vocal accompaniment called ''kami uta'' in which the drummer sings sacred songs to the gods. Often the vocal accompaniment is overshadowed by the drumming and instruments, reinforcing that the vocal aspect of the music is more for [[incantation]] rather than [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Averbuch]], [[Irit]], ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', [[Ithaca]], NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, pp.83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both ancient Japanese collections, the [[Nihongi]] and [[Kojiki]], Ame-no-uzeme’s dance is described as ''asobi'', which in old Japanese language means a ceremony that is designed to appease the spirits of the departed, and which was conducted at funeral ceremonies. Therefore, ''kagura'' is a rite of ''tama shizume'', of pacifying the spirits of the departed. In the Heian period (8th–12th centuries) this was one of the important rites at the Imperial Court and had found its fixed place in the ''tama shizume'' festival in the eleventh month. At this festival people sing as accompaniment to the dance: "Depart! Depart! Be cleansed and go! Be purified and leave!"&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Kazushige; Knecht, Peter, "On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura", ''Asian Folklore Studies'' 40 (1): 1, 1981, pp.4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
This rite of purification is also known as ''chinkon''. It was used for securing and strengthening the soul of a dying person. It was closely related to the ritual of ''tama furi'' (shaking the spirit), to call back the departed soul of the dead or to energize a weakened spirit. Spirit pacification and rejuvenation were usually achieved by songs and dances, also called ''asobi''. The ritual of ''chinkon'' continued to be performed on the emperors of Japan, thought to be descendents of Amaterasu. It is possible that this ritual is connected with the ritual to revive the sun goddess during the low point of the winter solstice.&lt;ref&gt;Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a division between the ''kagura'' that is performed at the Imperial palace and the shrines related to it, and the ''kagura'' that is performed in the countryside. Folk ''kagura'', or ''kagura'' from the countryside is divided according to region. The following descriptions relate to ''sato kagura'', ''kagura'' that is from the countryside. The main types are: ''miko kagura'', ''Ise kagura'', ''Izumo kagura'', and ''shishi kagura''.

[[File:Head miko in Inari shrine, Tanabe 179738668 4dc16b0c21 o.jpg|thumb|A [[miko]] (woman consecrated to a Shinto deity) at Inari Shrine.]]
''Miko kagura'' is the oldest type of ''kagura'' and is danced by women in Shinto shrines and during folk festivals. The ancient [[miko]] were shamanesses, but are now considered priestesses in the service of the Shinto Shrines. ''Miko kagura'' originally was a shamanic trance dance, but later, it became an art and was interpreted as a prayer dance. It is performed in many of the larger Shinto shrines and is characterized by slow, elegant, circular movements, by emphasis on the four directions and by the central use of torimono (objects dancers carry in their hands), especially the fan and bells.&lt;ref&gt;Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ise kagura'' is a collective name for rituals that are based upon the ''yudate'' (boiling water rites of [[Shugendō]] origin) ritual. It includes ''miko'' dances as well as dancing of the ''torimono'' type. The ''kami'' are believed to be present in the pot of boiling water, so the dancers dip their ''torimono'' in the water and sprinkle it in the four directions and on the observers for purification and blessing.&lt;ref name="Averbuch, Irit 1995, p. 16"&gt;Averbuch, Irit, ''The Gods Come Dancing: A Study of the Japanese Ritual Dance of Yamabushi Kagura'', Ithaca, NY: East Asia Program, Cornell University, 1995, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Izumo kagura'' is centered in the Sada shrine of Izumo, Shimane prefecture. It has two types: ''torimono ma'', unmasked dances that include held objects, and ''shinno'' (sacred No), dramatic masked dances based on myths. ''Izumo kagura'' appears to be the most popular type of ''kagura''.&lt;ref name="Averbuch, Irit 1995, p. 16" /&gt;

''Shishi kagura'' also known as the Shugen-No tradition, uses the dance of a ''shishi'' (lion or mountain animal) mask as the image and presence of the deity. It includes the ''Ise daikagura'' group and the ''yamabushi kagura'' and ''bangaku'' groups of the Tohoku area (Northeastern Japan). ''Ise daikagura'' employs a large red Chinese type of lion head which can move its ears. The lion head of the ''yamabushi kagura'' schools is black and can click its teeth. Unlike other ''kagura'' types in which the ''kami'' appear only temporarily, during the ''shishi kagura'' the ''kami'' is constantly present in the shishi head mask. During the Edo period, the lion dances became showy and acrobatic losing its touch with spirituality. However, the ''yamabushi kagura'' tradition has retained its ritualistic and religious nature.&lt;ref name="Averbuch, Irit 1995, p. 16" /&gt;

Originally, the practice of ''kagura'' involved authentic possession by the ''kami'' invoked. In modern-day Japan it appears to be difficult to find authentic ritual possession, called ''kamigakari'', in ''kagura'' dance. However, it is common to see choreographed possession in the dances. Actual possession is not taking place but elements of possession such as losing control and high jumps are applied in the dance.

==History==

===Historical records===
There is no core sacred text in Shinto, as the [[Bible]] is in [[Christianity]] or [[Qu'ran]] is in [[Islam]]. Instead there are books of [[folklore|lore]] and [[history]] which provide stories and background to many Shinto beliefs.&lt;ref name="Sokyo1962" /&gt;
* The [[Kojiki]] (Record of Ancient Matters) The oldest book of Japanese history, it describes the origin myths of Japan and the Imperial Family beginning from 628.&lt;ref name="Sokyo1962" /&gt;
* The [[Shoku Nihongi]] and its [[Nihon Shoki]] (Continuing Chronicles of Japan) describes events up to 697. Some of the stories in the Nihongi are more detailed, but contradictory, to the stories of the Kojiki.
* The [[Rikkokushi]] (Six National Histories) includes the Shoku Nihongi and Nihon Shoki.
* The [[Engishiki]] contains a section describing Shinto rituals in thorough detail&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellwood|first=Robert S.|date=1971|editor-last=Bock|editor-first=Felicia Gresset|title=A Translation of the Engi-Shiki|jstor=1062014|journal=History of Religions|volume=10|issue=3|pages=267–270|doi=10.2307/1062014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
{{further|Koshinto}}
Shinto has very ancient roots in the Japanese islands. The recorded history dates to the [[Kojiki]] (712) and [[Nihon Shoki]] (720), but archeological records date back significantly further. Both are compilations of prior oral traditions. The Kojiki establishes the [[Japanese imperial family]] as the foundation of Japanese culture, being the descendants of Amaterasu Omikami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=de Bary,|editor1-first=Wm. Theodore|editor2-last=Keene|editor2-first=Donald|editor3-last=Tanabe|editor3-first=George|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Varley|editor4-first=Paul|title=Sources of Japanese Tradition vol. 1, From Earliest Times to 1600|isbn=978-0-231-12139-2|pages=22–23|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[creation myth]] and a [[genealogy]] of the gods. The Nihonshoki was more interested in creating a structural system of government, foreign policy, religious hierarchy, and domestic social order.

There is an internal system of historical Shinto development that configures the relationships between Shinto and other religious practices over its long history; the inside and outside Kami (spirits). The inside or ''ujigami'' (''uji'' meaning clan) Kami roles that supports cohesion and continuation of established roles and patterns; and the ''hitogami'' or outside Kami, bringing innovation, new beliefs, new messages, and some instability.

[[Jōmon]] peoples of Japan used natural housing, predated rice farming, and frequently were hunter-gatherers; the physical evidence for ritual practices are difficult to document. There are many locations of stone ritual structures, refined burial practices and early [[Torii]] that lend to the continuity of primal Shinto. The Jōmon had a clan-based tribal system developed similar to much of the world's indigenous people. In the context of this clan based system, local beliefs developed naturally and when assimilation between clans occurred, they also took on some beliefs of the neighboring tribes. At some point there was a recognition that the ancestors created the current generations and the reverence of ancestors (''tama'') took shape. There was some trade amongst the indigenous peoples within Japanese islands and the mainland, as well as some varying migrations. The trade and interchange of people helped the growth and complexity of the peoples spirituality by exposure to new beliefs. The natural spirituality of the people appeared to be based on the worship of nature forces or ''mono'', and the natural elements to which they all depended.

The gradual introduction of methodical religious and government organizations from mainland Asia starting around 300 BCE seeded the reactive changes in primal Shinto over the next 700 years to a more formalized system. These changes were directed internally by the various clans frequently as a syncratic cultural event to outside influences. Eventually as the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] gained power a formalization process began. The genesis of the Imperial household and subsequent creation of the Kojiki helped facilitate the continuity needed for this long term development through modern history. There is today a balance between outside influences of [[Buddhist]], [[Confucian]], [[Taoism in Japan|Taoist]], [[Abrahamic]], [[Hindu]] and [[secular]] beliefs. In more modern times Shinto has developed new branches and forms on a regular basis, including leaving Japan.

===Jōmon Period===
By the end of the [[Jōmon period]], a dramatic shift had taken place according to archaeological studies. New arrivals from the continent seem to have invaded Japan from the West, bringing with them new technologies such as rice farming and metallurgy. The settlements of the new arrivals seem to have coexisted with those of the Jōmon for some time. Under these influences, the incipient cultivation of the Jōmon evolved into sophisticated rice-paddy farming and government control. Many other elements of Japanese culture also may date from this period and reflect a mingled migration from the northern Asian continent and the southern Pacific areas. Among these elements are Shinto mythology, marriage customs, architectural styles, and technological developments such as lacquerware, textiles, laminated bows, metalworking, and glass making. The Jōmon is succeeded by the Yayoi period.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

===Yayoi Period===
Japanese culture begins to develop in no small part due to influences from mainland trade and immigration from China. During this time in the pre-writing historical period, objects from the mainland start appearing in large amounts, specifically mirrors, swords, and jewels. All three of these have a direct connection to the imperial divine status as they are the symbols of imperial divinity and are Shinto honorary objects. Also the rice culture begins to blossom throughout Japan and this leads to the settlement of society, and seasonal reliance of crops. Both of these changes are highly influential on the Japanese people's relationship to the natural world, and likely development of a more complex system of religion. This is also the period that is referenced as the beginning of the divine imperial family. The [[Yayoi]] culture was a clan based culture that lived in compounds with a defined leader who was the chief and head priest. They were responsible for the relationship with their "gods" Kami and if one clan conquered another, their "god" would be assimilated. The earliest records of Japanese culture were written by Chinese traders who described this land as "Wa". This time period led to the creation of the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] culture and development of formal Shinto practices.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

The development of ''niiname'' or the (now) Shinto harvest festival is attributed to this period as offerings for good harvests of similar format (typically rice) become common.

===Kofun Period===
The great bells and drums, [[Kofun]] burial mounds, and the founding of the imperial family are important to this period. This is the period of the development of the feudal state, and the Yamato and Izumo cultures. Both of these dominant cultures have a large and central shrine which still exists today, [[Ise Shrine]] in the North East and [[Izumo Taisha]] in the South West. This time period is defined by the increase of central power in Naniwa, now [[Osaka]], of the feudal lord system. Also there was an increasing influence of Chinese culture which profoundly changed the practices of government structure, social structure, burial practices, and warfare. The Japanese also held close alliance and trade with the [[Gaya confederacy]] which was in the south of the peninsula. The [[Paekche]] in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] had political alliances with Yamato, and in the 5th century imported the Chinese writing system to record Japanese names and events for trade and political records. In 513 they sent a Confucian scholar to the court to assist in the teachings of Confucian thought. In 552 or 538 a [[Buddhism|Buddha]] image was given to the Yamato leader which profoundly changed the course of Japanese religious history, especially in relation to the undeveloped native religious conglomeration that was Shinto. In the latter 6th century, there was a breakdown of the alliances between Japan and Paekche but the influence led to the codification of Shinto as the native religion in opposition to the extreme outside influences of the mainland. Up to this time Shinto had been largely a clan ('uji') based religious practice, exclusive to each clan.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

===Asuka Period===
[[Yin and Yang|The Theory of Five Elements in Yin and Yang philosophy]] of [[Taoism]] and the [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] had a profound impact on the development of a unified system of Shinto beliefs. In the early [[Nara period]], the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'' were written by compiling existing myths and legends into a unified account of [[Japanese mythology]]. These accounts were written with two purposes in mind: the introduction of [[Taoist]], [[Confucian]], and Buddhist themes into Japanese religion; and garnering support for the legitimacy of the Imperial house, based on its lineage from the sun goddess, Amaterasu. Much of modern Japan was under only fragmentary control by the Imperial family, and rival ethnic groups. The mythological anthologies, along with other poetry anthologies like the ''Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves'' (''[[Man'yōshū]]'') and others, were intended to impress others with the worthiness of the Imperial family and their divine mandate to rule.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

In particular the Asuka rulers of 552–645 saw disputes between the more major families of the clan Shinto families. There were disputes about who would ascend to power and support the imperial family between the Soga and Mononobe/Nakatomi Shinto families. The Soga family eventually prevailed and supported [[Empress Suiko]] and Prince Shōtoku, who helped impress Buddhist faith into Japan. However, it was not until the [[Hakuhō period|Hakuho ruling period]] of 645–710 that Shinto was installed as the imperial faith along with the Fujiwara Clan and reforms that followed.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

===Hakuho Period===
Beginning with [[Emperor Tenmu]] (672–686), continuing through [[Empress Jitō]] (686–697) and [[Emperor Monmu]] (697–707) Court Shinto rites are strengthened and made parallel to Buddhist beliefs in court life. Prior to this time clan Shinto had dominated and a codification of "Imperial Shinto" did not exist as such. The Nakatomi family are made the chief court Shinto chaplains and chief priests at Ise Daijingū which held until 1892. Also the practice of sending imperial princesses to the Ise shrine begins.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt; This marks the rise of Ise Daijingū as the main imperial shrine historically. Due to increasing influence from Buddhism and mainland Asian thought, codification of the "Japanese" way of religion and laws begins in earnest. This culminates in three major outcomes: [[Taihō Code]] (701 but started earlier), the ''Kojiki'' (712), and the ''Nihon Shoki'' (720).&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

The Taiho Code also called [[Ritsuryō]] (律令) was an attempt to create a bulwark to dynamic external influences and stabilize the society through imperial power. It was a liturgy of rules and codifications, primarily focused on regulation of religion, government structure, land codes, criminal and civil law. All priests, monks, and nuns were required to be registered, as were temples. The Shinto rites of the imperial line were codified, especially seasonal cycles, lunar calendar rituals, harvest festivals, and purification rites. The creation of the imperial [[Jingi-kan]] or Shinto Shrine office was completed.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

===Nara Period===
This period hosted many changes to the country, government, and religion. The capital is moved again to [[Heijō-kyō]], or [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], in AD 710 by [[Empress Genmei]] due to the death of the Emperor. This practice was necessary due to the Shinto belief in the impurity of death and the need to avoid this pollution. However, this practice of moving the capital due to "death impurity" is then abolished by the [[Taihō Code]] and rise in Buddhist influence.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt; The establishment of the imperial city in partnership with Taihō Code is important to Shinto as the office of the Shinto rites becomes more powerful in assimilating local clan shrines into the imperial fold. New shrines are built and assimilated each time the city is moved. All of the grand shrines are regulated under [[Taihō Code|Taihō]] and are required to account for incomes, priests, and practices due to their national contributions.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

During this time, Buddhism becomes structurally established within Japan by [[Emperor Shōmu]] (reign 724–749), and several large building projects are undertaken. The Emperor lays out plans for the Buddha Dainichi (Great Sun Buddha), at Tōdai-ji assisted by the Priest Gyogi (or Gyoki) Bosatsu. The priest Gyogi went to Ise Daijingu Shrine for blessings to build the Buddha Dainichi. They identified the statue of Viarocana with Amaterasu (the sun goddess) as the manifestation of the supreme expression of universality.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt;

The priest Gyogi is known for his belief in assimilation of Shinto Kami and Buddhas. Shinto kami are commonly being seen by Buddhist clergy as guardians of manifestation, guardians, or pupils of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="JapaneseReligion1985"/&gt; The priest Gyogi conferred boddhisattva precepts on the Emperor in 749 effectively making the Imperial line the head of state and divine to Shinto while beholden to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ShapersofBuddhism"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shapers Of Japanese Buddhism |publisher=Kosei Publishing Co.|location=Tokyo, Japan|first=Kashiwahara|last=Yusen|edition=1st|year=1994|isbn=4-333-01630-4|pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretism with Buddhism===
{{main|Shinbutsu-shūgō}}
With the introduction of Buddhism and its rapid adoption by the court in the 6th century, it was necessary to explain the apparent differences between native Japanese beliefs and Buddhist teachings. One Buddhist explanation saw the ''kami'' as supernatural beings still caught in the cycle of birth and rebirth ([[reincarnation]]). The ''kami'' are born, live, die, and are reborn like all other beings in the [[karmic]] cycle. However, the ''kami'' played a special role in protecting Buddhism and allowing its teachings of compassion to flourish.

This explanation was later challenged by [[Kūkai]] (空海, 774–835), who saw the ''kami'' as different embodiments of the [[Buddhas]] themselves (''[[honji suijaku]]'' theory). For example, he linked [[Amaterasu]] (the sun goddess and ancestor of the Imperial family) with [[Vairocana|Dainichi Nyorai]], a central manifestation of the Buddhists, whose name means literally "Great Sun Buddha". In his view, the ''kami'' were just Buddhas by another name.

Buddhism and Shinto coexisted and were amalgamated in the ''[[shinbutsu shūgō]]'' and Kūkai's [[Syncretism|syncretic]] view held wide sway up until the end of the [[Edo period]]. There was no theological study that could be called "Shinto" during medieval and early modern Japanese history, and a mixture of Buddhist and popular beliefs proliferated. At that time, there was a renewed interest in "Japanese studies" (''[[kokugaku]]''), perhaps as a result of the [[Sakoku|closed country policy]].

In the 18th century, various Japanese scholars, in particular [[Motoori Norinaga]] (本居 宣長, 1730–1801), tried to tear apart the "real" Shinto from various foreign influences. The attempt was largely unsuccessful, since as early as the ''Nihon Shoki'' parts of the mythology were explicitly borrowed from Taoism doctrines. For example, the co-creator deities [[Izanami]] and [[Izanagi]] are explicitly compared to [[yin and yang]]. However, the attempt did set the stage for the arrival of [[state Shinto]], following the [[Meiji Restoration]] (c.1868), when Shinto and Buddhism were separated (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'').

===State Shinto===
{{Main|State Shinto}}
[[File:Chosen Jingu.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chōsen Jingū]] in [[Seoul]]]]
Fridell argues that scholars call the period 1868–1945 the "State Shinto period" because, "during these decades, Shinto elements came under a great deal of overt state influence and control as the Japanese government systematically utilized shrine worship as a major force for mobilizing imperial loyalties on behalf of modern nation-building."&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur M. Fridell, "A Fresh Look at State Shintō", ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 44.3 (1976), 547–561 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1462824 in JSTOR]; quote p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government had already been treating shrines as an extension of government before Meiji; see for example the [[Tenpō Reforms]]. Moreover, according to the scholar Jason Ānanda Josephson, It is inaccurate to describe shrines as constituting a "state religion" or a "theocracy" during this period since they had neither organization, nor doctrine, and were uninterested in conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Jason Ānanda (2012). ''The Invention of Religion in Japan''. University of Chicago Press. p. 133. {{ISBN|0226412342}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meiji Restoration]] reasserted the importance of the emperor and the ancient chronicles to establish the [[Empire of Japan]], and in 1868 the government attempted to recreate the ancient imperial Shinto by separating shrines from the temples that housed them. During this period, numerous scholars of ''kokugaku'' believed that this national Shinto could be the unifying agent of the country around the Emperor while the process of modernization was undertaken with all possible speed. The psychological shock of the Western "[[Black Ships]]" and the subsequent collapse of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] convinced many that the nation needed to unify in order to resist being colonized by outside forces.

In 1871, a [[Jingi-kan|Ministry of Rites]] (''jingi-kan)'' was formed and Shinto shrines were divided into twelve levels with the [[Ise Shrine]] (dedicated to Amaterasu, and thus symbolic of the legitimacy of the Imperial family) at the peak and small sanctuaries of humble towns at the base. The following year, the ministry was replaced with a new Ministry of Religion, charged with leading instruction in "''shushin''" (moral courses). [[Kannushi|Priests]] were officially nominated and organized by the state, and they instructed the youth in a form of Shinto theology based on the official [[dogma]] of the divinity of Japan's national origins and its Emperor. However, this propaganda did not take, and the unpopular Ministry of Rites was dissolved in the mid-1870s.

Although the government sponsorship of shrines declined, [[Japanese nationalism]] remained closely linked to the legends of foundation and emperors, as developed by the ''kokugaku'' scholars. In 1890, the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]] was issued, and students were required to ritually recite its oath to "offer yourselves courageously to the State" as well as to protect the Imperial family. Such processes continued to deepen throughout the early [[Shōwa period]], coming to an abrupt end in August 1945 when Japan lost [[World War II|the war in the Pacific]]. On 1 January 1946, [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] issued the [[Ningen-sengen]], in which he quoted the [[Charter Oath|Five Charter Oath]] of [[Emperor Meiji]] and declared that he was not an ''[[Ningen-sengen|akitsumikami]]'' (a deity in human form).

===Post-war===
The imperial era came to an abrupt close with the end of [[World War II]], when Americans declared that Japanese nationalism had been informed by something called "State Shinto", which they attempted to define with the [[Shinto Directive]]. The meaning of "State Shinto" has been a matter of debate ever since.

In the post-war period, numerous "[[Japanese new religions|New Religions]]" cropped up, many of them ostensibly based on Shinto, but on the whole, Japanese [[religiosity]] may have decreased. However, the concept of [[religion in Japan]] is a complex one. A survey conducted in the mid-1970s indicated that of those participants who claimed not to believe in religion, one-third had a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] or Shinto altar in their home, and about one quarter carried an ''[[omamori]]'' (an [[amulet]] to gain protection by ''kami'') on their person. Following the war, Shinto shrines tended to focus on helping ordinary people gain better fortunes for themselves through maintaining good relations with their ancestors and other ''kami''. The number of Japanese citizens identifying their religious beliefs as Shinto has declined a great deal, yet the general practice of Shinto rituals has not decreased in proportion, and many practices have persisted as general cultural beliefs (such as [[ancestor worship]]), and community festivals (''[[Japanese festivals#Local festivals (matsuri)|matsuri]]'')—focusing more on religious practices. The explanation generally given for this anomaly is that, following the demise of State Shinto, modern Shinto has reverted to its more traditional position as a traditional religion which is culturally ingrained, rather than enforced. In any case, Shinto and its values continue to be a fundamental component of the Japanese cultural mindset.

Shinto has also spread abroad to a limited extent, and a few non-Japanese Shinto priests have been ordained. A relatively small number of people practice Shinto in America. There are several [[List of Shinto shrines in the United States|Shinto shrines in America]]. Shrines were also established in [[List of Shinto shrines in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and Korea during the period of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese imperial rule]], but following the war, they were either destroyed or converted into some other use.

===Sect Shinto===
{{See also|Shinto sects and schools}}
Within Shinto, there are a variety of sects which are not a part of [[Shrine Shinto]] and the officially defunct [[State Shinto]]. [[Sect Shinto]], like [[Izumo Taishakyo Mission of Hawaii]] and [[Konkokyo]], have unique practices which originated alongside older Shinto practices before the classification and separation of Shinto practices of the [[Meiji era]] in 1868.

'''Siemens Wind Power''', (formerly '''Danregn Vindkraft A/S''' and '''Bonus Energy A/S''') is a [[wind turbine]] manufacturer established in 1980 as Danregn Vindkraft. Bonus Energy was acquired by [[Siemens]] of [[Germany]] in 2004. The organisation became a separate division of Siemens in 2011, with headquarters established in [[Hamburg]], Germany.

In 2015 Siemens Wind had a combined market share of 63% of European offshore wind turbines&lt;ref name=reut2016-03-28/&gt; (nearly 75% in 2009 by capacity and number).&lt;ref name="ewea09"&gt;{{citation| last = Wilkes| first =  Justin| url =http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/images/publications/stats/offshore_stats_2009_june.pdf|title =  The European offshore wind industry – key trends and statistics 2009| publisher = [[EWEA]]| date =  January 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Siemens Wind Power had 6.3% share of the world wind turbine market,&lt;ref name="ihs2012"&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.rechargenews.com/energy/wind/article306897.ece | first=Ben|last = Backwell| title =  Gamesa back in wind top-five as GE drops out – analysts|newspaper = Recharge | publisher = NHST Media Group| date = 7 March 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409190608/http://www.rechargenews.com/energy/wind/article306897.ece|archivedate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the second largest in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Badstue Pedersen|author2= Maria Berg|url=http://www.energy-supply.dk/article/view/200141/btm_vestas_stadig_nummer_et|title= BTM: Vestas stadig nummer et|work=Energy Supply|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Danregn / Bonus AS (1980–2004)===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9807">'''Solar chemical''' refers to a number of possible processes that harness [[solar energy]] by absorbing sunlight in a [[Photoelectrochemical cell|chemical reaction]]. The idea is conceptually similar to [[photosynthesis]] in plants, which converts solar energy into the chemical bonds of glucose molecules, but without using living organisms, which is why it is also called [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Magnuson | first1 = A | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Biomimetic and Microbial Approaches to Solar Fuel Generation | url = | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 42 | issue = 12| pages = 1899–1908 | doi=10.1021/ar900127h | pmid=19757805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A promising approach is to use focused sunlight to provide the energy needed to split water into its constituent [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the presence of a metallic catalyst such as [[zinc]]. This is normally done in a two-step process so that hydrogen and oxygen are not produced in the same chamber, which creates an explosion hazard.  Another approach involves taking the hydrogen created in this process and combining it with carbon dioxide to create methane. The benefit of this approach is that there is an established infrastructure for transporting and burning methane for power generation, which is not true for hydrogen. One main drawback to both of these approaches is common to most methods of energy storage: adding an extra step between energy collection and electricity production drastically decreases the efficiency of the overall process.

It is also possible to use solar light to directly drive industrial chemical reactions and applications, eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels for energy.

== Background ==
As early as 1909, the dimerization of [[anthracene]] into dianthracene was investigated as a means of storing solar energy, as well as the photodimerization of the naphthalene series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Solar Power and Fuels|author=Bolton, James|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|year=1977|isbn=978-0-12-112350-5}}, p. 235-237&lt;/ref&gt; In the 70’s and 80’s a fuel had been made from another reversible chemical, the norbornadiene to quadricyclane transformation cycle, but this failed because the reversal process had a low potential. Ruthenium-based molecules were also attempted, but this was dismissed because ruthenium is both rare and too heavy of a material.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolpak|first=Alexie|author2=Jeffrey Grossman|year=2011|title=Azobenzene-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes As High-Energy Density Solar Thermal Fuels|journal=Nano Letters|volume=11|issue=8|pages=3156–3162|doi=10.1021/nl201357n|pmid=21688811}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past decade, a new hybrid nanostructure was theorized as a new approach to this previously known concept of solar energy storage.

== Chemical storage ==
Photodimerization is the light induced formation of&amp;nbsp;[[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] and [[Photoisomerization]] is the light induced formation of&amp;nbsp;[[isomer]]s. While photodimerization stores the energy from sunlight in new chemical bonds,&amp;nbsp;[[Photoisomerization]] stores solar energy by reorienting existing chemical bonds into a higher energy configuration.

:[[File:Anthracene Photodimerisation.svg|thumb|left|320px|Anthracene dimerization]]{{clear left}}

In order for an isomer to store energy then, it must be metastable as shown above. This results in a trade-off between the stability of the fuel isomer and how much energy must be put in to reverse the reaction when it is time to use the fuel. The isomer stores energy as strain energy in its bonds. The more strained the bonds are the more energy they can store, but the less stable the molecule is. The activation energy, Ea, is used to characterize how easy or hard it is for the reaction to proceed. If the activation energy is too small the fuel will tend to spontaneously move to the more stable state, providing limited usefulness as a storage medium. However, if the activation energy is very large, the energy expended to extract the energy from the fuel will effectively reduce the amount of energy that the fuel can store. Finding a useful molecule for a [[solar fuel]] requires finding the proper balance between the yield, the light absorption of the molecule, the stability of the molecule in the metastable state, and how many times the molecule can be cycled without degrading.

Various ketones, azepines and&amp;nbsp;[[norbornadiene]]s&amp;nbsp;among other compounds, such as&amp;nbsp;[[azobenzene]]&amp;nbsp;and its derivates, have been investigated as potential energy storing isomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Solar Power and Fuels|author=Bolton, James|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|year=1977|isbn=978-0-12-112350-5}}, p. 238-240&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;[[norbornadiene]]-[[quadricyclane]]&amp;nbsp;couple and its derivates have been extensively investigated for solar energy storage processes. Norbornadiene is converted to quadricyclane using energy extracted from sunlight, and the controlled release of the strain energy stored in quadricyclane (about 110 k&amp;nbsp;[[Joule per mole|J/mole]]) as it relaxes back to norbornadiene allows the energy to be extracted again for use later.
:[[File:Norbornadiene-quadricyclane couple.png|thumb|left|320px|Norbornadiene - Quadricyclane couple is of potential interest for solar energy storage]]{{clear left}}

Research into both the azobenzene and norbonadiene-quadricyclane systems was abandoned in the 1980s as unpractical due to problems with degradation, instability, low energy density, and cost.&lt;ref name="Durgan 854–860"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durgan|first=E.|author2=Jeffrey Grossman|date=4 March 2013|title=Photoswitchable molecular rings for solar-thermal energy storage|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|volume=4|issue=4|pages=854–860|doi=10.1021/jz301877n|pmid=26291346|citeseerx=10.1.1.707.1787}}&lt;/ref&gt; With recent advances in computing power though, there has been renewed interest in finding materials for solar thermal fuels. In 2011, researchers at MIT used time-dependent density functional theory, which models systems at an atomic level, to design a system composed of azobenzene molecules bonded to [[carbon nanotube]] (CNT) templates. The CNT substrates will allow customizable interactions between neighboring molecules which greatly helps in fine tuning the properties of the fuel, for example an increase in the amount of energy stored.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through experimental procedures, researchers were able to get the first proof of principle that the hybrid nanostructure works as a functional thermal fuel. Azobenzenes have the advantage of absorbing wavelengths that are very abundant in sunlight, when this happens the molecule transforms from a trans-isomer to a cis-isomer which has a higher energy state of about 0.6 eV.&lt;ref name="Durgan 854–860"/&gt; To bring the molecule back down to its original state, i.e. release the energy it had collected, there are a few options. The first is to apply heat but that is associated with a cost which, relative to the amount of heat that will be produced from the release, is not cost efficient. The second, more effective option is to use a catalyst that lowers the thermal barrier and allows the heat to be released, almost like a switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mpc-www.mit.edu/mpc/item/137-advancing-solar-thermal-fuels#&amp;ts=undefined|title=Materials Processing Center|work=Materials Processing Center|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition back from cis to trans can also be triggered by blue visible light.

This system provides an [[energy density]] comparable to lithium-ion batteries, while simultaneously increasing the stability of the activated fuel from several minutes to more than a year and allowing for large numbers of cycles without significant degradation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Further research is being done in search of even more improvement by examining different possible combinations of substrates and photoactive molecules.

== Applications ==
There are a wide variety of both potential and current applications for solar chemical fuels. One of the major pros of this technology is its scalability. Since the energy can be stored and then later converted to heat when needed, it is ideal for smaller on the go units. These range from portable stoves or small personal heaters that can be charged in the sun to providing medical sanitation in off-grid areas, and plans are even in the works to use the system developed at MIT as a window de-icing system in automobiles. It also has the ability to be scaled up and heat larger homes or buildings or even heat bodies of water. A solar thermal fuel would ideally be able to cycle indefinitely without degradation, making it ideal for larger scale implementations that generally would need more replacements of other forms of storage.

A '''steam bus''' is a [[bus]] powered by a [[steam engine]]. Early steam-powered vehicles designed for carrying passengers were more usually known as '''steam carriages''', although this term was sometimes used to describe other early experimental vehicles too.

==History==
{{main|History of steam road vehicles}}
[[File:Obeissante.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amédée Bollée]]'s ''L'Obéissante'' (1875)]]

===1830-1895===
Regular intercity bus services by steam-powered buses were pioneered in [[England]] in the 1830s by [[Walter Hancock]] and by associates of [[Goldsworthy Gurney|Sir Goldsworthy Gurney]] among others, running reliable services over road conditions which were too hazardous for horse-drawn transportation. Steam carriages were much less likely to overturn, and did not "run away with" the customer as horses sometimes did. They travelled faster than horse-drawn carriages (24&amp;nbsp;mph over four miles and an average of 12&amp;nbsp;mph over longer distances). They could run at a half to a third of the cost of horse-drawn carriages. Their brakes did not lock and drag like horse-drawn transport (a phenomenon that increased damage to roads). According to engineers, steam carriages caused one-third the damage to the road surface as that caused by the action of horses' feet. Indeed, the wide tires of the steam carriages (designed for better traction) caused virtually no damage to the streets, whereas the narrow wheels of the horse-drawn carriages (designed to reduce the effort required of horses) tended to cause rutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Rise and Fall of Non-Government Roads in the United Kingdom|pages=263–264|title=Street Smart: Competition, Entrepreneurship and the Future of Roads|author=Benson, Bruce L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the heavy road [[Toll road|tolls]] imposed by the [[Turnpike trusts|Turnpike Act]]s discouraged steam road vehicles and left the way clear for the horse bus companies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petergould.co.uk/local_transport_history/generalhistories/general/steambus.htm The Steam Bus(1833-1923)] -  Some idea of the excessive nature of the tolls can be illustrated by the toll of 48 shillings demanded for steam carriages operating between Liverpool and Prescott, whilst that for horse coaches was just 4 shillings.&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1861 onwards, harsh legislation virtually eliminated mechanically propelled vehicles altogether from the roads of Great Britain for 30 years, the [[Locomotive Act]] of that year imposing restrictive speed limits on "road locomotives" of 5&amp;nbsp;mph in towns and cities, and 10&amp;nbsp;mph in the country.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=RMgDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA388&amp;vq=locomotives+on+turnpike&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 Locomotives Act, 1861] Pratt's ''Law of Highways'' Edition 10, Shaw &amp; Sons (1865) p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 the Locomotives Act of that year (the famous [[Red Flag Act]]) further reduced the speed limits to 4&amp;nbsp;mph in the country and just 2&amp;nbsp;mph in towns and cities, additionally requiring a man bearing a red flag to precede every vehicle. At the same time, the act gave local authorities the power to specify the hours during which any such vehicle might use the roads. The sole exceptions were street [[tram]]s which from 1879 onwards were authorised under licence from the [[Board of Trade]].

In 1881, the engineer [[John Inshaw]] built a steam carriage for use in [[Aston]], Birmingham, UK. Capable of carrying ten people at speeds of up to 12&amp;nbsp;mph, Inshaw discontinued his experiments due to the legislation then in force.&lt;ref name="aston_carriage"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Jill|title=The Inshaw Steam Carriage|url=http://www.astonbrook-through-astonmanor.co.uk/inshawtransport|publisher=Aston Brook through Aston Manor|accessdate=17 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909121730/http://www.astonbrook-through-astonmanor.co.uk/inshawtransport|archivedate=9 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1896-1923===
The Red Flag Act was repealed in 1896, and experimental steam buses again operated in various places in England and around the empire.

Liquid Fuel Engineering Co. ('''Lifu''') of [[Cowes]] built steam buses from 1897 to 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Liquid_Fuel_Engineering_Co Grace's Guide to British Industrial History with photos]&lt;/ref&gt; Lifu buses ran at [[Mansfield]] from 1 July 1898,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/6th-july-1905/5/the-motor-omnibus-boom Commercial Motor 6 July 1905 - The Motor Omnibus Boom]&lt;/ref&gt; between Dover and Deal in 1899,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.petergould.co.uk/local_transport_history/generalhistories/general/steambus.htm|title=General History: The Steam Bus 1833-1923|website=www.petergould.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairford and Cirencester for the [[Midland and South Western Junction Railway]] in 1898 and 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ampneycrucis.org.uk/steam_road_train_and_bus.php|title=Steam Road Train through Ampney Crucis|website=ampneycrucis.org.uk|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 a 24-seat (14 on top) bus of '''E. Gillett &amp; Co''' ([[Hounslow]]) was licensed, but ran no regular service.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Straker-Squire#Bus manufacturing|'''Straker''']] buses were run by [[Potteries Electric Traction Company|Potteries Electric Traction]] from 1901.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

London Road Car Co ran a [[Hammersmith]]-Shepherd's Bush-[[Oxford Circus]] route with a '''[[Thornycroft]]''' 36-seater (12 inside) in 1902.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thomas Clarkson produced steam buses at Moulsham Works, '''Chelmsford''' and exhibited at 1903 and 1905 Motor Shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Clarkson_(of_Chelmsford)|title=Clarkson (of Chelmsford)|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Torquay]] had steam buses from 1903 to 1923. In May 1903 a Chelmsford steam bus demonstration resulted in the formation of the ''Torquay &amp; District Motor Omnibus Co Ltd'' on 23 July 1903. The company's prospectus said, "The Chelmsford motor omnibuses are steam propelled, and, what is of importance in a town of the character of Torquay, are entirely free from smell, noise, and vibration."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/6th-july-1905/5/the-motor-omnibus-boom|title=The Motor Omnibus Boom. {{!}} 6th July 1905 {{!}} The Commercial Motor Archive|website=archive.commercialmotor.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 single-deck 14-seat (12 inside and 2 with the driver) Chelmsford steam buses were ordered in May, built in August, but got stuck in mud between Salisbury and Exeter and didn't start a Strand to Chelston service until 2 November.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROBBINS|first=G.

They had two-cylinder horizontal engines, with tubular boilers, and a working pressure of 150 to 250psi. They averaged a gallon of paraffin for 3.8 miles. 1904 costs were under 8½d per mile, made up of lubricants 0.2d., wages and fuel 5d. and repairs, establishment, and other charges 3.3d. Fares were 1d. to 4d., with 15 minute frequencies on two routes, and half-hourly on the others. The company declared a 7½% dividend in its first year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All the Torquay buses were sold to [[West Yorkshire Road Car Company#West Yorkshire|''Harrogate Road Car Company'']] just before ''[[Torquay Tramways]]'' opened in April 1907, but the ''Torquay Road Car Co'' took over the garage and bought 6 Chelmsfords, 3 from ''Vale of [[Llangollen]]'', 2 from [[Eastbourne]] Corporation and 1 from [[GWR road motor services#Vehicles|''Great Western Railway'']].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The new company was liquidated on 24 December 1908 and 3 buses sold to [[Islwyn Borough Transport#History|''Bargoed Motor Service Company'']] in 1909. The Torquay-Chelston Steam Car Company Ltd was formed on 28 March 1911 and took over the 3 unsold Chelmsfords and a new 25-seater Clarkson type IV steam bus from August 1911. The steam buses were replaced by petrol in 1923, when [[Devon General]] started to compete on the Chelston route.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[File:Chelmsford_steam_omnibus_built_by_Clarkson_Ltd,_Chelmsford.jpg|thumb|Torquay &amp; District Motor Omnibus Co Ltd service to Chelston from 1903 with 14-seat Chelmsford bus]]
In [[London]] Chelmsfords had mixed fortunes.

[[Darracq and Company London#Steam buses|'''Darracq-Serpollet''']] steam buses were run by the ''Metropolitan Steam Omnibus Co Ltd'' from 5 October 1907 to 16 October 1912. When ''London General'' took over its main rivals on 1 July 1908 it had 1066 motor buses, 35 of them steam.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Motor Bus: Charles E Lee, London Transport Executive 1974 page 21&lt;/ref&gt; A year later ''London General'' had abandoned steam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Steam power for road transportation saw a modest revival in the 1920s. It was economical to use, with prices of fuel oil (such as [[kerosene]]) being about one-third that of gasoline, with comparable fuel consumption to contemporary gasoline-engined vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310709.2.177.1|title=MAKING STEAM BUSES.

'''Tunnel injection''' is a [[field electron emission]] effect; specifically a quantum process called [[Fowler–Nordheim tunneling]], whereby [[charge carrier]]s are injected to an electric conductor through a thin layer of an electric insulator.

It is used to program NAND [[flash memory]]. The process used for erasing is called '''tunnel release'''.

An alternative to tunnel injection is the [[spin injection]].

A '''turbulator''' is a device that turns a [[laminar flow]] into a [[turbulence|turbulent flow]]. Turbulent flow can be desired on parts of the surface of an aircraft wing (airfoil) or in industrial applications such as [[heat exchanger]]s and the mixing of fluids. The term “turbulator” is applied to a variety of applications and is used as a derivative of the word turbulent. However, the word has no commonly accepted technical or scientific meaning. As such, it has been approved as a trademark in the U.S. and other countries in conjunction with machine parts used within rotating drums, sterilizers, heat transfer ovens, mixing and pelletizing machines, and air destratification fans for horticultural and agricultural uses, among others.

In [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] the turbulator is often a thin zig-zag strip that is placed on the lower side of the wing and sometimes on the [[vertical stabilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maughmer |first1=Mark D. |last2=Swan |first2=Timothy S. |last3=Willits |first3=Steven M. |title=Design and Testing of a Winglet Airfoil for Low-Speed Aircraft |journal=Journal of Aircraft |date=July 2002 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=654–661 |doi=10.2514/2.2978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Çocuktepe Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] under construction on the [[Güzeldere River]] (a tributary of the [[Great Zab]]) in [[Çukurca]] district of [[Hakkâri Province]], southeast [[Turkey]]. Under contract from Turkey's [[State Hydraulic Works]], İnelsan İnşaat began construction on the dam in 2008 and a completion date has not been announced.&lt;ref name=DSIII/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works - Hakkari-Çocuktepe and Gölgeliyamaç Dams Construction - Concrete Construction of Dam Body|url=http://www.inelsan.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28:hakkari-cocuktepe-ve-golgeliyamac-barajlari-insaati&amp;catid=8&amp;Itemid=16&amp;lang=tr|publisher=Inelsan|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the Gölgeliyamaç Dam immediately upstream began in 2008 as well but was cancelled due to poor geology.&lt;ref name=CNNTURK/&gt;

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a [[hydroelectric]] power station in the future.&lt;ref name=DSIII&gt;{{cite web|title=DSI 10 REGIONAL OFFICE - Van|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi17/hakkari.htm|publisher=State Hydraulic Works|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of PKK militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in [[Şırnak Province]] and four in Hakkâri Province were implemented for this purpose. In Hakkâri are the Gölgeliyamaç (since cancelled) and Çocuktepe Dams on the Güzeldere River and the [[Aslandağ Dam|Aslandağ]] and [[Beyyurdu Dam]]s on the Bembo River. In Şırnak there is the [[Silopi Dam]] on the [[Hezil River]] and the [[Şırnak Dam|Şırnak]], [[Uludere Dam|Uludere]], [[Balli Dam|Balli]], [[Kavşaktepe Dam|Kavşaktepe]], [[Musatepe Dam|Musatepe]] and [[Çetintepe Dam]]s on the Ortasu River.&lt;ref name=CNNTURK&gt;{{cite web|title=Water retention dams began operation against PKK|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/turkiye/08/23/pkkya.karsi.yapilan.barajlarda.su.tutma.islemi.basladi/674002.0/index.html|publisher=CNNTurk|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terror Down|url=http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Teror-bogulacak.htm?ArticleID=136637|publisher=Posta|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned to be completed in the second dam on the border against the PKK|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19088520.asp|publisher=Hurriyet|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dams Prevent Smuggling at the Border|url=http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|publisher=Aktif Haber|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
