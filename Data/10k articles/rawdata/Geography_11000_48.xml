'''4263 Abashiri''', provisional designation {{mp|1989 RL|2}}, is a stony Flora [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 8 kilometers in diameter.

The asteroid was discovered on 7 September 1989, by Japanese astronomers [[Masayuki Yanai]] and [[Kazuro Watanabe]] at [[Kitami Observatory]] in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan.&lt;ref name="MPC-Abashiri" /&gt; It was named for the Japanese city of [[Abashiri, Hokkaido|Abashiri]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Abashiri'' is a member of the [[Flora family]], one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|inner]] main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.5&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 4 months (1,220 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.14 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 6[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Due to a [[precovery]] obtained at [[Palomar Observatory]] in 1951, the asteroid's [[observation arc]] could be extended by 38 years prior to its discovery.&lt;ref name="MPC-Abashiri" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

''Abashiri'' has been characterized as a stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

Between 2008 and 2016, three rotational [[lightcurve]]s of ''Abashiri'' were obtained by Czech astronomer [[Petr Pravec]] at [[Ondřejov Observatory]]. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined [[rotation period]] of between 4.8817 and 4.88230 hours with a corresponding brightness variation between 0.11 and 0.42 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3/3]]}}).{{efn|name=lcdb-Pravec-2012}}{{efn|name=lcdb-Pravec-2008}}{{efn|name=lcdb-Pravec-2016}}

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Abashiri'' measures 9.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.20,&lt;ref name="Masiero-2012" /&gt; while the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes an albedo of 0.24, derived from [[8&amp;nbsp;Flora]], the Flora family's largest member and namesake, and calculates a somewhat smaller diameter of 7.2 kilometers.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named for the Japanese city of [[Abashiri, Hokkaido|Abashiri]], known for its fishing industry. It is located at the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], about 50 kilometers east of Kitami, in the eastern part of the island of Hokkaidō. The minor planets, [[3720&amp;nbsp;Hokkaido]] and [[3785&amp;nbsp;Kitami]] are named after the island and city, respectively.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 21 November 1991 {{small|([[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 19336)}}.&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''Amsterdam Ordnance Datum''' or '''''{{lang|nl|Normaal Amsterdams Peil}}''''' ('''NAP''') is a vertical [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] in use in large parts of [[Western Europe]]. Originally created for use in the [[Netherlands]], its height was used by [[Prussia]] in 1879 for defining ''{{lang|de|[[Normalnull]]}}'', and in 1955 by other European countries. In the 1990s, it was used as the reference level for the United European leveling Network (UELN) which in turn led to the [[European Vertical Reference System]] (EVRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkg.bund.de/evrs |title=European Vertical Reference System |work=bund.de |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor [[Johannes Hudde]] of [[Amsterdam]] in a way came up with the idea after he expanded the sea [[Levee|dike]] after a [[flood]] in Amsterdam in 1675. Of course a dike should be storm-resistant to protect a city against flooding, and in this case a margin of "9 feet and 5 inches" (2.67&amp;nbsp;m - margin is defined in Amsterdam feet) was deemed enough to cope with rising water. So he measured the water level of the adjacent sea arm, ''{{lang|nl|[[IJ (Amsterdam)|Het IJ]]}}'' and compared it with the water level in the [[canal]]s within the city itself. He found that the water level at an average summer flood in the sea arm (when the water level reaches its maximum, not counting storms) was about the same as the level on the other side of the sea-dike, plus the margin of 9 feet and 5&amp;nbsp;inches. The relatively constant water level in the canals of Amsterdam, called ''{{lang|nl|Amsterdams Peil}}'' ("Amsterdam level", AP), equalled the level at summer flood at sea in the sea-inlet, which changes throughout the year. AP was carried over to other areas in the Netherlands in 1860, to replace locally used levels. In this operation, an error was introduced which was corrected (normalised) between 1885 and 1894, resulting in the ''{{lang|nl|Normaal Amsterdams Peil}}''.

Originally the zero level of NAP was the average summer flood water level in the IJ just north of the centre of Amsterdam (which was at the time, in 1684, the main shipping area, then still connected with the open sea). Currently it is physically realised by a brass benchmark on a 22-meter pile below the [[Dam (Amsterdam)|Dam]] square in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicaties.minienm.nl/download-bijlage/57206/agi-gap-04-004.pdf ''Herberekening van het primaire net van het NAP'' (Dutch only)]&lt;/ref&gt; The brass benchmark in the Amsterdam [[Stopera]] (combined city hall and opera house), which is a tourist attraction, is no longer used as a reference point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6488">The '''Caribbean bioregion''' is a [[biogeography|biogeographic]] region that includes the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and nearby Atlantic islands, which share a [[fauna]], [[flora]] and [[mycobiota]] distinct from surrounding bioregions.

The Caribbean bioregion, as described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]], includes the [[Greater Antilles]] ([[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Jamaica]]), the [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Lucayan archipelago]] ([[Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]), and [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]]. The Lucayan archipelago lies north of the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean, but is part of the bioregion based on its flora and fauna. The bioregion does not include [[Trinidad and Tobago]]; these islands rest on South America's [[continental shelf]], and have been historically part of the South American continent. Trinidad and Tobago are part of the [[Orinoco bioregion]]&lt;ref&gt; Dinerstein, Eric; David Olson; Douglas J. Graham; et al. (1995). ''A Conservation Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean.'' World Bank, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of the ecoregion is tropical, and varies from humid to arid. Geology and topography also vary, with larger mountainous islands of continental rock, volcanic islands, and low-lying coral and limestone islands. The bioregion includes [[tropical moist forests]], [[tropical dry forests]], [[tropical pine forests]], [[flooded grasslands and savannas]], [[xeric shrublands]], and [[mangrove]]s.

The Caribbean bioregion's distinct fauna, flora and mycobiota was shaped by long periods of physical separation from the neighboring continents, allowing animals, fungi and plants to evolve in isolation. Other animals, fungi and plants arrived via long-distance [[oceanic dispersal]] or [[island hopping]] from North America and South America.&lt;ref&gt;Dinerstein, Eric; David Olson; Douglas J. Graham; et al. (1995). ''A Conservation Assessment of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean.'' World Bank, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iturralde-Vinent, M.A., and R.D.E. MacPhee (1999). Paleogeography of the Caribbean region: Implications for Cenozoic biogeography. ''Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History'', 238:1-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioregion has a large number of plant species, including many [[endemism|endemics]]. There are about 200 endemic genera of plants. Wallenia, the largest endemic genus, has 30 species, and 6 other genera have 10 or more species.&lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Fund. "Islands of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean". Accessed 4 September 2017. [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0134]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three mammal families are endemic to the bioregion; the [[Solenodontidae]] includes two species of ''[[Solenodon]]'', one species on Cuba, the other on Hispaniola. Fossil evidence shows that the family was once more widespread in North America. Family [[Nesophontidae]], or the West Indian shrews, contained a single genus, ''[[Nesophontes]]'', which inhabited Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and the Cayman Islands. All members of the family are now believed to be extinct. The [[Capromyidae]], or hutias, include a number of species, mainly from the Greater Antilles. Many other [[rodents of the Caribbean]] are also restricted to the region.&lt;ref&gt;Iturralde-Vinent, M.A., and R.D.E. MacPhee (1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2480">The '''Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers''' (CLAG) was formed in 1970 to foster geographic education and research on Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[William M. Denevan, "Traditional Versus New Directions: The First Meeting of the Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers, 1970," ''Journal of Latin American Geography'' 7 (2008):155-62. {{DOI|10.1353/lag.0.0013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Board of Directors governs CLAG. CLAG publishes a Newsletter and the [http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/journals/journals.html ''Journal of Latin American Geography'']. It also operates CLAGNET, an electronic [[Listserv]] for members.

The [http://archives.syr.edu Syracuse University Archives] preserve documents and photographs related to the history of the organization because the long-standing Executive Director, David J. Robinson, is a professor at that university.


==Awards==
Each year CLAG makes several awards to distinguished Latin Americanist geographers and others.

*Preston E. James Eminent Latin Americanist Career Award
*[[Carl O. Sauer]] Distinguished Scholarship Award
*Outstanding Service to CLAG
*Private Sector and Government Award
*Enlaces Award


CLAG also makes awards to graduate students to support research and conference travel.


==Conferences==
CLAG organizes a conference on a regular basis. The conference typically takes place in [[the Americas]] but in 2001 met in [[Benicassim]], [[Spain]].

Under provincial law, municipalities in [[British Columbia]] are to be designated "district municipalities" on incorporation if the area to be incorporated is greater than 800 hectares (8&amp;nbsp;km²) and has an average population density of less than 5 persons per hectare (500 persons per km²).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities may be incorporated under different classifications under the direction of the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] in Council, as is the case with the [[District of North Vancouver]].

== Usage in Nova Scotia ==
In [[Nova Scotia]], a [[List of district municipalities in Nova Scotia|district municipality]] is one of four municipal status types.&lt;ref name=MGA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/municipal%20government.pdf | title=Municipal Government Act | publisher=Office of the Legislative Counsel, Nova Scotia House of Assembly | page=16 | quote=(aw) "municipality" means a regional municipality, town or county or district municipality, except where the context otherwise requires or as otherwise defined in this Act; | date=June 19, 2012 | accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; District municipalities and [[county|county municipalities]] are further considered [[rural municipality|rural municipalities]].&lt;ref name=RuralMuniGovt&gt;{{cite web | url=https://novascotia.ca/dma/pdf/mun-history-establishment-elective-government.pdf | title=The Establishment of Elective Rural Municipal Government in Nova Scotia | publisher=Government of Nova Scotia: Department of Municipal Affairs | pages=1, 2 | accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province's twelve district municipalities were created in 1879 from six [[List of counties of Nova Scotia|historical counties]].&lt;ref name=RuralMuniGovt/&gt; They are referred to as [[municipal district]]s by [[Statistics Canada]].&lt;ref name=StatCaninterim&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/92f0009x/2015000/t/tbl0a-eng.htm | title=Interim List of Changes to Municipal Boundaries, Status, and Names: From January 2, 2014 to January 1, 2015 (Table A: Census subdivision types by province and territory, as of January 1, 2015) | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in Ontario ==
Currently, only one district municipality exists in [[Ontario]] &amp;ndash; [[District Municipality of Muskoka]]. It was formerly a [[Districts#Ontario|district]], but has undergone heavy [[urbanization]] and [[real estate developer|development]], particularly from [[tourism]], as it is the heart of Ontario's [[cottage country]]. As a result, it was "upgraded" from a district (such as neighbouring [[Parry Sound District, Ontario|Parry Sound District]]) to having powers similar to a [[regional municipality]], such as [[York Regional Municipality]].

== Usage in South Africa ==
In [[South Africa]], [[Districts of South Africa|district]] municipalities are administrative divisions of a province. South Africa recognizes three types of municipality; metropolitan, district and local. [[District municipality (South Africa)|District municipalities]] are made up of a number of local municipalities. The vast majority of land consists of district municipalities, with metropolitan municipalities being reserved for large cities and the areas around them. There are eight metropolitan municipalities, and 44 district municipalities subdivided into 226 local municipalities.

'''Euphrates Region''', formerly Kobanî Canton, ({{lang-ku|Herêma Firatê}}, {{lang-ar|إقليم الفرات}}, {{lang-syc|ܦܢܝܬܐ ܕܦܪܬ|translit=Ponyotho d'Prat}}), is the central of [[Cantons of Rojava|three regions]] of the de facto autonomous [[Rojava|Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]], factually comprising [[Ayn al-Arab District]] of the [[Aleppo Governorate]], [[Tell Abyad District]] of the [[Raqqa Governorate]], and the westernmost tip of [[Nahiya Ras al-Ayn]] of the [[Ras al-Ayn District]] of [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]]. Euphrates Region unilaterally declared autonomy in January 2014 and since ''de facto'' is under direct democratic government in line with the polyethnic [[Constitution of Rojava]]. 

The regional capital city is [[Kobanî]], which was [[Siege of Kobanî|under siege]] between October 2014 and January 2015 by ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiroglu.net/the-constitution-of-the-rojava-cantons/|title=The Constitution of the Rojava Cantons|work=Personal Website of Mutlu Civiroglu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region has two subordinate cantons, the '''Kobani canton''' consisting of the Sarin area (with the al-Jalabiya district subordinate to it) and the Kobani area (with the Şêran and the Qenaya districts subordinate to it), as well as the '''Tel Abyad canton''' (with the Ain Issa and Suluk districts subordinate to it).&lt;ref&gt;http://en.hawarnews.com/euphrates-region-within-the-administrative-division/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The region is bordered by [[Euphrates]] river to the west, [[Urfa Province]] of [[Turkey]] to the north, [[Jazira Region]] to the east, [[al-Thawrah District]] and [[Raqqa District]] of the [[Raqqa Governorate]] to the south and south-east respectively. At latitude approximately 36 and a half degrees north, its landscape consists of plains and low hills, rivers being Euphrates and [[Balikh River|Balikh]]. Part of the [[Fertile Crescent]], its climate is mostly "warm mediterranean" on the [[Köppen climate classification]], as opposed to the colder, semi-arid regions in its and further to the south and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.html|title=Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification|publisher=European Geosciences Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
 	
The current population of Euphrates Region is unknown due to substantial refugee movements; however, the population of the territory before 2014 was estimated at roughly 400,000, with an ethnic [[Kurds in Syria|Kurdish]] majority. Due to intense fighting at least three-quarters of the population fled across the [[Syrian-Turkish border|border to Turkey]] in 2014;&lt;ref name=military_support&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Oct-22/274938-syria-says-giving-military-support-to-kurds-in-koban.ashx#axzz3GNeXxGTV|title=Syria says giving military support to Kurds in Kobani|newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2014|agency = [[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many returned in 2015.&lt;ref name=rebuild1&gt;{{cite web|title=The dangerous rebuilding of Kobani|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/18/kobani-rebuilding/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Cities and towns with more than 10.000 inhabitants according to the 2004 Syrian census are [[Kobanî]] (44,821) and [[Tell Abyad]] (14,825).

==History==
{{see also|Rojava conflict}}
{{further information|Siege of Kobanî|Tell Abyad offensive}}

The present Kurdish populated area on the left bank of the [[Euphrates]] was settled by Kurdish tribes at the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Tejel2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordi Tejel|title=Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-09643-5|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern post-independence Syria, the Kurdish society of the region was subject to heavy-handed [[Arabization]] policies by the Damascus government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYRIA: The Silenced Kurds; Vol. 8, No. 4(E)|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm|website=Human Rights Watch|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]] and the [[Rojava conflict]], Damascus government forces withdrew from the area, and on 27 January 2014 an autonomous ''Kobanî Canton'' under the [[Constitution of Rojava]] was declared and institutions established.

In July 2013, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) began to forcibly displace Kurdish civilians from towns in Raqqa Governorate. After demanding that all Kurds leave [[Tell Abyad]] or else be killed, thousands of civilians, including [[Turkmens]] and Arabs, fled on 21 July. Its fighters looted and destroyed the property of Kurds, and in some cases, resettled displaced [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Arab families from the [[an-Nabek District]] (Rif Damascus), [[Deir ez-Zor]] and [[Raqqa]], in abandoned Kurdish homes. A similar pattern was documented in [[Tel Arab]] and [[Tal Hassel]] in July 2013. As ISIL consolidated its authority in Raqqa, Kurdish civilians were forcibly displaced from [[Tel Akhader]], and from the immediate [[Kobanî]] area, in March and September 2014, respectively.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic: Twenty-seventh session|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/HRC_CRP_ISIS_14Nov2014.doc|website=UN Human Rights Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euphrates Region has seen fighting with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) since 2014. In September 2014, ISIL [[Siege of Kobanî|launched a major assault]] against Euphrates Region, seizing more than 100 [[Kurds|Kurdish]] villages.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/22/isis-onslaught-kurds-syria-disaster-turkey-refugees|title=Isis onslaught against Kurds in Syria brings ‘man-made disaster’ into Turkey|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=afpReuters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.einnews.com/article/224533266/r3F_mOq1ZvLUZW3e|title=ISIL seizes 21 Kurdish villages in northern Syria, close in on Kobane|publisher=AFP/Reuters|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the ISIL occupation, up to 200,000 Kurdish refugees fled from the Euphrates Region to Turkey, allowed in only under the condition that they leave vehicles or livestock behind.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2014/10/17/hundreds-wait-for-kobani-fighting-to-end-risking-lives-at-border/|title=Hundreds Wait for Kobani Fighting to End, Risking Lives at Border|author=Ayla Albayrak|work=Wall Street Journal|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While committing massacres and kidnapping womenen the seized villages,&lt;ref name=afpReuters/&gt; ISIL forces were not able to occupy the entire region, as the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) and [[Women's Protection Units]] (YPJ) forces successfully [[Siege of Kobanî|put up stiff resistance]] in the city of [[Kobanî]]. After weeks of isolation as a result of Turkey blocking arms and fighters from entering the city, the US-led coalition finally began to target the ISIL assault forces with airstrikes. This move helped the YPG/YPJ to force ISIL to retreat from the city, and much of the surrounding region was retaken by Kurdish forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2014/10/ypg-kobani-fighting-islamic-state-turkey.html#|title=YPG official: Airstrikes not enough to protect Kobani|work=Al-Monitor|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the successful summer 2015 [[Tell Abyad offensive]] of YPG/YPJ forces against ISIL, municipalities there voted to join the autonomous Kobanî Canton administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Perry |title=Town joins Kurdish-led order in Syria, widening sway at Turkish border|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/21/us-mideast-crisis-syria-kurds-idUSKCN0SF1BD20151021|agency=[[Reuters]]|date= 21 October 2015|accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating the region in its contemporary shape.

==Politics and administration==
{{See also|Constitution of Rojava|List of political parties in Rojava}}

Kobanî's Legislative Assembly has appointed a president, two deputies and 22 ministers to rule Euphrates Region. Its prime minister is Enver Müslim.
According to the constitutional Charter of the Social Contract, the Kobanî Canton's Legislative Assembly on its 27 January 2014 session declared autonomy. The assembly elected Enver Müslim prime minister, who appointed Bêrîvan Hesen and Xalid Birgil his deputies. The government is lobbying for a humanitarian corridor, and the creation of new refugee camps inside Syria, where they can help with rebuilding.&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;{{cite news|title=Kobani: destroyed and riddled with unexploded bombs, but its residents dare to dream of a new start|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/31/kobani-kurdish-forces-retake-isis-destroyed-power-sanitation-bombs-residents-hopes|publisher=Guardian|date=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{see also|Economy of Syria|Rojava#Economy}}

The economy of the region is mainly based on agriculture, with the invention of [[greenhouse]] agriculture since the constitution of Euphrates Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukssd.de/preparations-for-agricultural-project-in-jotkar-kobani-syria/|title=Preparations for “Jotkar” agricultural project|work=UKSSD e.

While there is no significant industrial area in Euphrates Region, there is a notably large number of cement production facilities.&lt;ref name="branches" /&gt;

Electricity is supplied by [[Tishrin Dam]] on the Euphrates, within Euphrates Region; apart from that, electricity is produced by diesel generators.&lt;ref name="branches"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cooperativeeconomy.info/rojava-the-economic-branches-in-detail/|title=Rojava: The Economic Branches in Detail|work=cooperativeeconomy.info|date=14 January 2017|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the region, but in particular in the city of Kobanî, economic priorities are the continuing war and reconstruction, including help for returning refugees.&lt;ref name=rebuild1 /&gt; Most of the city and surrounding villages have been destroyed or badly damaged, and there is a danger of landmines.&lt;ref name=rebuild1 /&gt; As of January 2017, in spite off the paucity of resources available and the embargoes imposed on the region, the rebuilding process has made considerable progress; over 70% of damaged roads have been restored, two hospitals rebuilt and another two added, and the 15 schools rebuilt now host over 50,000 students.&lt;ref name="raising"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realmedia.press/raising-kobani-rubble/|title=Raising Kobanî from Rubble|author=Manisha Ganguly|publisher=realmedia.press|date=14 January 2017|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{See also|Education in Syria|Rojava#Education, media, culture}}

Like in the other [[Rojava|DFNS]] regions, primary education in public schools is initially instructed according to each student's mother tongue, be it Kurdish or Arabic. Students then begin to learn their second language of Kurdish or Arabic, as well as additional instruction of English. This is due to Rojava's stated goal of students achieving [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] in both Kurdish and Arabic by secondary schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anfenglish.com/culture/education-in-rojava-after-the-revolution|title=Education in Rojava after the revolution|publisher=ANF|date=2016-05-16|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/syria-kurdistan-self-governance-teach-kurdish-language.html|title=After 52-year ban, Syrian Kurds now taught Kurdish in schools|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=2015-11-06|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curricula are a topic of continuous debate between the regions' Boards of Education and the Syrian central government in Damascus, which partly pays the teachers.&lt;ref name=syriaclanguage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syrianobserver.com/EN/News/31729/Hassakeh_Syriac_Language_Be_Taught_PYD_controlled_Schools/|title=Hassakeh: Syriac Language to Be Taught in PYD-controlled Schools|publisher=The Syrian Observer|date=3 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2015/10/kurds-introduce-own-curriculum-at-schools-of-rojava-2/|title=Kurds introduce own curriculum at schools of Rojava|publisher=Ara News|date=2015-10-02|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/revolutionary-education-rojava|title=Revolutionary Education in Rojava|publisher=New Compass|date=2015-02-17|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdishquestion.com/oldsite/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/education-system-in-rojava/538-education-system-in-rojava.html/|title=Education in Rojava: Academy and Pluralistic versus University and Monisma|publisher=Kurdishquestion|date=2014-01-12|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Euphrates Region being home to a [[Syrian Turkmen]] minority, school education bilingual in Turkish and Arabic has also been made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdiscat.blogspot.de/2016/10/confederalisme-democratic-noves-classes.html|title=Confederalisme democràtic: Noves classes en llengua turcmana al nord de Síria|work=KurdisCat|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal, regional and local administrations in Rojava put much emphasis on promoting libraries and educational centers, to facilitate learning and social and artistic activities. One cited example is the May 2016 established ''Rodî û Perwîn Library'' in [[Kobani]].&lt;ref name=k24education&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/dfa4b335-fe1c-4a3c-b5b6-7bc5848e9e97/Kurds-establish-university-in-Rojava-amid-Syrian-instability|title=Kurds establish university in Rojava amid Syrian instability|publisher=Kurdistan24|date=2016-07-07|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4993">'''Geographic Data Files''' ('''GDF''') is an [[data exchange|interchange]] [[file format]] for [[geographic data]].
In contrast with generic [[Geographic information system|GIS]] formats, GDF provides detailed rules for data capture and representation, and an extensive catalog of standard features, attributes and relationships. The most recent extension expanded applicability further towards pedestrian [[navigation]], 3-D map rendering, and [[advanced driver-assistance systems]] (ADAS).

GDF is commonly used for data interchange in many industries such as [[automotive navigation system]]s, [[fleet management]], [[dispatch management]], [[road traffic analysis]], [[:Category:Road traffic management|traffic management]], and [[automatic vehicle location]].

Originated as a flat [[plain-text]] file, GDF is not intended to be used directly for any large scale geographic application and normally requires conversion into a more efficient format. Consumability has been increased with most-recent developments for XML and SQL renditions.

The maps in GDF format are provided by many map vendors such as [[Here (company)|HERE]], [[TomTom]], [[Mapscape BV]], [[GeoSmart]], [[Automotive Navigation Data]], [[AutoNavi]] and  [[NavInfo]].

==Standardisation==

GDF is an international standard that is used to model, describe and transfer [[road network]]s and other geographic data.

The standard was initially drawn up by [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] in co-operation with digital map providers, automotive and electronic equipment manufacturers. The outcome of these standardisation efforts (CEN GDF 3.0, or ENV14825:1996) has formed the major input to a global standard created by ISO/TC204 Sub [[Working group]] 3:
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] GDF 4.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2004, now replaced by
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] GDF 5.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2011.

However, despite the existence of an ISO GDF standard, the nature of model abstractions as well as semantic interpretations and proprietary content extensions lead to [[interoperability]] issues between flavors of GDF map products from different vendors.  In practice the GDF files are not fully interchangeable due to vendor specific extensions. To this end, GDF5.0 provides major improvements in terms of extended meta data and flags for signalling implementation choices.

===The new GDF5.0===

The specifications of GDF5.0 were developed and compiled between 2001 and 2008, involving experts from Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States of America. Extensive activities towards harmonization with ISO/TC211 standards were undertaken. GDF 5.0 was published in July 2011.

Major GDF5.0 enhancements include UML model migration &amp; refinements; harmonization with [[linear referencing]] and geo-spatial web standards; support for 3-D content and time coordinates; comprehensive character set and [[phonetic representation]]s; and new XML and SQL based delivery formats.

===Background and rationale of GDF standardization===

By the late 1980s, producers and users of digital road map data became increasingly aware of the need for a common data interchange standard. Lack of such a standard was seen as an impediment to the commercial growth and success of industries using such data. Before the advent of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) industry, development of spatial data interchange standards was done mostly on a regional basis and not designed for the specialised requirements of road transport-related applications.

In the 1990s, the GDF standard was instrumental in enabling the European [[business-to-business]] (B2B) market for in-vehicle navigation in that it provided interoperability for exchanging digital map data between map manufacturers and navigation system integrators. The GDF specifications provided a base for both the capturing of geographic content and the exchanging of it. Its original design foresaw a powerful, application-independent model, while its initial rendition as a standard specifically addressed the requirements for the richness of navigable map databases. Since then, GDF has evolved in terms of data modelling capabilities, broadened international applicability, expanded geographic domains, and diversified exchange formats. As a result, GDF covers a wide range of application domains and has been adapted to many geo-spatial technologies.

The [[East China Sea]] lies to the north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to the south and the [[South China Sea]] to the southwest. The island makes up 99% of the [[Free Area of the Republic of China|current territory]] of the Republic of China, which is also known as "[[Taiwan]]".

Taiwan is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&amp;nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{convert|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.

The climate ranges from [[tropical monsoon climate|tropical]] in the south to [[humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] in the north, and is governed by the [[East Asian Monsoon]]. The island is struck by an average of four [[typhoon]]s in each year. The eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.

[[File:Philippine Sea Plate br.JPG|thumb|right|Taiwan lies on the western edge of the Philippine Plate]]
The island of Taiwan was formed approximately 4 to 5 million years ago at a complex [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. In a boundary running the length of the island and continuing southwards in the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] (including [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]] and [[Orchid Island]]), the Eurasian Plate is sliding under the Philippine Sea Plate.

Most of the island comprises a huge [[fault block]] tilted to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The tectonic boundary remains active, and Taiwan experiences 15,000 to 18,000 earthquakes each year, of which 800 to 1,000 are noticed by people.

== Terrain ==
{{see also|List of mountains in Taiwan|List of rivers of Taiwan}}
[[File:Taiwan map large.gif|thumb|right|A [[Cartographic relief depiction|relief map]] of Taiwan]]

The terrain in Taiwan is divided into two parts: the flat to gently rolling plains in the west, where 90% of the population lives, and the mostly rugged forest-covered mountains in the eastern two-thirds.

The eastern part of the island is dominated by five mountain ranges, each running from north-northeast to south-southwest, roughly parallel to the east coast of the island. As a group, they extend {{convert|330|km|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from north to south and average about {{convert|80|km|mi}} from east to west. They include more than two hundred peaks with elevations of over {{convert|3000|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=40}}

The [[Central Mountain Range]] extends from [[Su'ao]] in the northeast to [[Eluanbi]] at the southern tip of the island, forming a ridge of high mountains and serving as the island's principal watershed. The mountains are predominantly composed of hard rock formations resistant to weathering and erosion, although heavy rainfall has deeply scarred the sides with gorges and sharp valleys. The relative relief of the terrain is usually extensive, and the forest-clad mountains with their extreme ruggedness are almost impenetrable. The east side of the Central Mountain Range is the steepest mountain slope in Taiwan, with fault scarps ranging in height from {{convert|120|to|1200|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. [[Taroko National Park]], on the steep eastern side of the range, has good examples of mountainous terrain, gorges and [[erosion]] caused by a swiftly flowing river.

The [[Haian Range|East Coast Mountain Range]] extends down the east coast of the island from the mouth of the [[Hualien River]] in the north to [[Taitung County]] in the south, and chiefly consist of sandstone and shale. It is separated from the Central Range by the narrow [[Huatung Valley]], at an altitude of {{convert|120|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Although Hsinkangshan (新港山), the highest peak, reaches an elevation of {{convert|1682|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, most of the range is composed of large hills. Small streams have developed on the flanks, but only one large river cuts across the range. Badlands are located at the western foot of the range, where the ground water level is the lowest and rock formations are the least resistant to weathering. Raised coral reefs along the east coast and the frequent occurrences of earthquakes in the rift valley indicate that the fault block is still rising.

The ranges to the west of the Central range are divided into two groups separated by the [[Sun Moon Lake]] Basin in the centre of the island. The [[Dadu River (Taiwan)|Dadu]] and [[Zhuoshui River]]s flow from the western slopes of the Central Range through the basin to the west coast of the island.

[[File:San Guang River, Fusing, Taoyuan, Taiwan - 20080601.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dahan River|Sanguang River]] in northwestern Taiwan]]
The [[Xueshan Range]] lies to the northwest of the Central Mountain Range, beginning at [[Sandiaojiao]], the northeast tip of the island, and gaining elevation as it extends southwest towards [[Nantou County]]. [[Xueshan]], the main peak, is {{convert|3886|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high.

The [[Yushan Range]] runs along the southwestern flank of the Central Range. It includes the island's tallest peak, the {{convert|3952|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Yushan (mountain)|Jade Mountain]] (''Yu Shan''),&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Taiwan's National Geographic Information System Steering Committee ([http://www.land.moi.gov.tw/landdatabase/enhtml/index.asp NGISSC])&lt;/ref&gt; which makes Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]], and is the highest point in the western Pacific region outside of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], [[New Guinea Highlands]] and [[Mount Kinabalu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/TALLESTV1.htm |title=Tallest Islands of the World&amp;nbsp;– World Island Info web site |publisher=Worldislandinfo.com |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alishan Range]] lies west of the Yushan Range, across the valley of the south-flowing [[Kaoping River]]. The range has major elevations between {{convert|1000|and|2000|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. The main peak, Data Mountain (大塔山), towers {{convert|2663|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Below the western foothills of the ranges, such as the [[Hsinchu Hills]] and the [[Miaoli Hills]], lie raised [[terrace (geology)|terrace]]s formed of material eroded from the ranges.  These include the [[Linkou Plateau]], the [[Taoyuan Plateau]] and the [[Dadu Plateau]]. About 23% of Taiwan's land area consists of fertile [[alluvial plain]]s and [[sedimentary basin|basin]]s watered by rivers running from the eastern mountains. Over half of this land lies in the [[Chianan Plain]] in southwest Taiwan, with lesser areas in the [[Pingtung Plain]], [[Taichung Basin]] and [[Taipei Basin]]. The only sizable plain on the east coast is the [[Yilan Plain]] in the northeast.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|pp=2, 43}}

== Climate ==
The island of Taiwan lies across the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its climate is influenced by the [[East Asian Monsoon]]. Northern Taiwan has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with substantial seasonal variation of temperatures, while parts of central and most of southern has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] where seasonal temperature variations are less noticeable with temperatures typically varying from warm to hot. During the winter (November to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny.  The summer monsoon (from May to October) accounts for 90% of the annual precipitation in the south, but only 60% in the north.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=45}} The average rainfall is approximately 2,600&amp;nbsp;mm per year.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=45}}

== Flora and fauna ==
{{See also|List of endemic species of Taiwan|List of national parks in Taiwan}}

Before extensive human settlement, the vegetation on Taiwan ranged from [[tropical rainforest]] in the lowlands through [[temperate forest]]s, [[boreal forest]] and [[alpine plant]]s with increasing altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | title=Late Pleistocene vegetation and climate of Taiwan (Formosa)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the plains and low-lying hills of the west and north of the island have been cleared for agricultural use since the arrival of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants during the 17th and 18th century. However the mountain forests are very diverse, with several [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species such as [[Chamaecyparis formosensis|Formosan cypress]] (''Chamaecyparis formosensis'') and [[Taiwan fir]] (''Abies kawakamii''), while the camphor laurel (''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'') was once also widespread at lower altitudes.

[[File:長鬃山羊.jpg|thumb|left|[[Formosan serow]]]]
Taiwan is a center of bird [[endemism]] (see [[List of endemic birds of Taiwan]]).

Prior to the country's [[industrialization]], the mountainous areas held several endemic animal species and subspecies, such as the [[Swinhoe's pheasant]] (''Lophura swinhoii''), [[Taiwan blue magpie]] (''Urocissa caerulea''), the [[Formosan sika deer]] (''Cervus nippon taiwanensis'' or ''Cervus nippon taiouanus'') and the [[Formosan landlocked salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus masou formosanus''). A few of these are now [[extinction|extinct]], and many others have been designated [[endangered species]].

Taiwan had relatively few [[Carnivora|carnivores]], 11 species in total, of which the [[Formosan clouded leopard]] and [[European otter|otter]] are likely extinct. The largest carnivore is the [[Formosan black bear]] (''Selanarctos thibetanus formosanus''), a rare and endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 51| pages = 500–511| last1 = Chiang| first1 = Po-Jen| author2 = Kurtis Jai-Chyi Pei| author3 = Michael R.

Nine national parks in Taiwan showcase the diverse terrain, flora and fauna of the archipelago. [[Kenting National Park]] on the southern tip of Taiwan contains [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[coral reef]]s, [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist tropical forest]] and marine ecosystems. [[Yushan National Park]] has alpine terrain, mountain ecology, forest types that vary with altitude, and remains of ancient road. [[Yangmingshan]] National Park has volcanic geology, hot springs, waterfalls, and forest. [[Taroko National Park]] has marble canyon, cliff, and fold mountains. [[Shei-Pa National Park]] has alpine ecosystems, geological terrain, and valley streams. [[Kinmen National Park]] has lakes, wetlands, coastal topography, flora and fauna-shaped island. [[Dongsha Atoll National Park]] has the Pratas reef atolls for integrity, a unique marine ecology, biodiversity, and is a key habitat for the marine resources of the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://np.cpami.gov.tw/english/ National Parks of Taiwan], Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior, ROC (Taiwan).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural resources ==
[[File:Abies kawakamii Chi-You.jpg|thumb|upright|Taiwan fir (''[[Abies kawakamii]]'')]]

Natural resources on the islands include small deposits of [[gold]], [[copper]], [[coal]], [[natural gas]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], and [[asbestos]]. The island is 55% forest and woodland (mostly on the mountains) and 24% arable land (mostly on the plains), with 15% going to other purposes. 5% is permanent [[pasture]] and 1% is permanent crops.

Because of the intensive [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] throughout [[History of Taiwan|Taiwan's pre-modern and modern history]], the island's mineral resources (e.g. coal, gold, marble), as well as wild animal reserves (e.g. deer), have been virtually exhausted. Moreover, much of its forestry resources, especially [[Abies kawakamii|firs]] were harvested during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] for the construction of [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] and have only recovered slightly since then. To this day, forests do not contribute to significant timber production mainly because of concerns about production costs and environmental regulations.

=== Agriculture ===
{{main|Agriculture in Taiwan}}
The few natural resources with significant economic value remaining in Taiwan are essentially agriculture-associated. [[Sugarcane]] and rice have been cultivated in western Taiwan since the 17th century. [[Camphor]] extraction and sugarcane refining played an important role in Taiwan's exportation from the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=304}} The importance of these industries subsequently declined not because of the exhaustion of related natural resources but mainly due to the decline of international demand.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Domestic agriculture (rice being the dominant kind of crop) and [[fisheries]] retain importance to a certain degree, but they have been greatly challenged by foreign imports since Taiwan's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001. Consequently, upon the decline of subsistent importance, Taiwan's agriculture now relies heavily on the marketing and exportation of specialty crops, such as banana, [[guava]], [[lychee]], [[bell fruit]], and high-mountain tea.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|pp=160–168}}

Taiwan has a population of over 23 million, the vast majority of whom live in the lowlands near the western coast of the island.&lt;ref name="population-data"/&gt;
The island is highly urbanized, with nearly 9 million people living in the [[Taipei–Keelung–Taoyuan metropolitan area]] at the northern end, and over 2 million each in the urban areas of [[Kaohsiung metropolitan area|Kaohsiung]] and [[Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area|Taichung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Environmental issues ===
{{see also|Air pollution in Taiwan}}
[[File:Scooters in taipei.jpg|thumb|[[Scooter (motorcycle)|Scooter]]s are a very common means of transportation in Taiwan and contribute to urban air pollution.]]

Some areas in Taiwan with high population density and many factories are affected by heavy pollution. The most notable areas are the southern suburbs of Taipei and the western stretch from Tainan to Lin Yuan, south of Kaohsiung. In the late 20th century, Taipei suffered from extensive vehicle and factory [[air pollution]], but with mandatory use of unleaded petrol and the establishment of the [[Environmental Protection Administration (Republic of China)|Environmental Protection Administration]] in 1987, the air quality of Taiwan has improved dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Taiwan: Environmental Issues |work=Country Analysis Brief&amp;nbsp;– Taiwan |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/taiwanenv.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007165852/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/taiwanenv.html |accessdate=8 March 2006 |archivedate=7 October 2006 |date=October 2003|quote = The government credits the APC system with helping to reduce the number of days when the country's pollution standard index score exceeded 100 from 7% of days in 1994 to 3% of days in 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scooter (motorcycle)|Motor scooters]], especially older or cheaper [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] versions, which are ubiquitous in Taiwan, also contribute disproportionately to urban air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/taiwan.html#envir|title= Taiwan Country Analysis Brief|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|date=August 2005|quote= Taipei has the most obvious air pollution, primary caused by the motorbikes and scooters used by millions of the city's residents.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202151338/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/taiwan.html|archivedate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Viable Niche Market–Fuel Cell Scooters in Taiwan | first=Chunto | last=Tso | journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy | date=July 2003 | volume=28 | number=7 | pages=757–762 | doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(02)00245-8 | url=http://www.tfci.org.tw/Uploadfile/DownFile/8/1023155544541.pdf | quote=In Taiwan's cities, the main source of air pollution is the waste gas exhausted by scooters, especially by the great number of two-stroke engine scooters.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other environmental issues include [[water pollution]] from industrial emissions and raw [[sewage]], contamination of drinking water supplies, and trade in [[endangered species]]. Though regulation of sulfate aerosol emissions from petroleum combustion is becoming stringent, [[acid rain]] remains a threat to the health of residents and forests. Atmospheric scientists in Taiwan estimate that more than half of the pollutants causing Taiwan's acid rain are carried from mainland China by monsoon winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Forests in Taiwan jeopardized by acid rain: EPA | last=Chiu | first=Yu-Tzu | newspaper=Taipei Times | date=26 January 2005 | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/01/26/2003220998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zurych Turicum.jpg|thumb|A 1581 bird's-eye etching of [[Zürich]], published by Georg Braun and [[Frans Hogenberg]].]]

'''Georg Braun''' (also ''Brunus, Bruin''; 1541 &amp;ndash; 10 March 1622) was a topo-[[geographer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171109023424/http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/0001/bsb00016318/images/index.html?id=00016318&amp;nativeno=550 Neue Deutsche Biographie]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1572 to 1617 he edited the ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]],'' which contains 546 prospects, bird's-eye views and maps of cities from all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historic-cities.huji.ac.il/mapmakers/braun_hogenberg.html |title=Civitates orbis terrarum - Braun and Hogenberg |publisher=Historic-cities.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the principal editor of the work, he acquired the tables, hired the artists, and wrote the texts. He died as an octogenarian in 1622, as the only survivor of the original team to witness the publication of volume VI in 1617.

==Biography==
Braun was born and died in [[Cologne]]. His principal profession was as a Catholic cleric, however, he spent thirty-seven years as [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and [[Dean (religion)|dean]] at the church, [[St. Maria ad Gradus]], in Cologne. His six-volume work was inspired by [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]''. In form and layout it resembles the 1570 ''[[Theatrum orbis terrarum]]'' by [[Abraham Ortelius]], as Ortelius was interested in a complementary companion for the Theatrum.

The Braun publication set new standards in cartography for over 100 years. [[Frans Hogenberg]] (1535–1590, from [[Mechelen]]) created the tables for volumes I through IV, and [[Simon van den Neuwel]] created those for volumes V and VI. Other contributors were [[Joris Hoefnagel]], [[Jacob Hoefnagel]], cartographer [[Daniel Freese]], and [[Heinrich Rantzau]]. Works by [[Jacob van Deventer (cartographer)|Jacob van Deventer]], [[Sebastian Münster]], and [[Johann Stumpf (writer)|Johannes Stumpf]] were also used. Primarily European cities are depicted in the publication; however, [[Casablanca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historic-cities.huji.ac.il/morocco/casablanca/maps/braun_hogenberg_I_57_1.html |title=Map of Casablanca, 1572, Braun and Hogenberg |publisher=Historic-cities.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Mexico City]]/[[Cuzco]] on one sheet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historic-cities.huji.ac.il/america/mexico/maps/braun_hogenberg_I_58_1.html |title=Map of Mexico City &amp; Cuzco, 1572, Braun and Hogenberg |publisher=Historic-cities.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also included in volume I.

In [[hydrogeology]], '''groundwater flow''' is defined as the "...part of [[streamflow]] that has [[infiltrated]] the ground, has entered the [[phreatic zone]], and has been discharged into a [[stream channel]], or [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s and [[seep (hydrology)|seepage water]]."&lt;ref&gt;Chorley, R.J., 1978. Glossary of Terms. In: M.J. Kirkby (Ed), Hillslope Hydrology, John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, U.K.: 1-42&lt;/ref&gt;  It is governed by the [[groundwater flow equation]].
Groundwater is water that is found underground in cracks and spaces in the soil, sand and rocks. An area where water fills these spaces is called a phreatic zone or saturated zone. Groundwater is stored in and moves slowly through the layers of soil, sand and rocks called [[aquifer]]s. The rate of groundwater flow depends on the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] (the size of the spaces in the soil or rocks and how well the spaces are connected) and the [[hydraulic head]] (water pressure).

== Preferential flow study ==

Vertical flow of solute in porous media (preferential flow) is studied and compared with Darcy's flow. The methodology used for the study is experimental. The laboratory model used is similar to Darcy apparatus with slight modification. The study has compared measured velocity of the first reach of solute with an average velocity of flow in porous media. The laboratory model consists of 150&amp;nbsp; mm diameter High-density Polyethylene pipe of 750&amp;nbsp; mm height filled uniform sand. Nine sets of experiment is conducted with 3 types of sand (D10= 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm and Cu1.42, D10= 0.11&amp;nbsp;mm and Cu1.55, D10= 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm and Cu1.4) and 3 types of brine concentration (5%, 10%, 20% by weight brine solution). A brine solution is found to be 1.13 to 1.84 times faster than the average velocity of flow as a result of preferential flow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/july2016/Comparison-Of-Preferential-Flow-Of-Solute-In-Porous-Media-With-Darcys-Flow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arstabron 1929.jpg|thumb|right|The Årstaviken area of the waterway (looking east). One of the [[Årstabroarna]] bridges can be seen crossing the waterway.]]
'''Hammarbyleden''' is an artificial waterway in [[Stockholm]] which connects [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] with [[Saltsjön]], the westernmost bay of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kanaler.arnholm.nu/stockholm/hammarbys.shtml |title=Hammarbyleden |last=Arnholm |first=Bosse |date=19 November 2012 |website=Nordens all kanaler |access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waterway is located along the southern edge of [[Södermalm]], one of Stockholm's many islands.

The waterway is composed mostly of interconnected natural bodies of water, which were expanded and dredged in the late-1910s and 1920s; the waterway was opened in 1929. A [[Lock (water navigation)|water lock]] was constructed as part of the project to account for the water level variation between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea.

==Route==
The waterway begins at Liljeholmsviken (near the eastern edge of Lake Mälaren) where it flows east into Årstaviken. At the eastern end of Årstaviken is the water lock, called {{ill|Hammarby Lock|sv|Hammarbyslussen}}, which lowers the water level from Årstaviken into [[Hammarby Sjö]] (Hammarby Lake). The final connection between Hammarby Lake and Saltsjön is made through the {{ill|Danvik Canal|sv|Danvikskanalen}}. The canal meets Saltsjön near the wharf of [[Masthamnen]].

'''ISO 3166-2:MR''' is the entry for [[Mauritania]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Mauritania, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[regions of Mauritania|15 regions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">An '''Index of Biological Integrity''' ('''IBI'''), also called an '''Index of Biotic Integrity''', is a scientific tool used to identify and classify [[water pollution]] problems. An IBI associates [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] influences on a water body with biological activity in the water body, and is formulated using data developed from [[biosurvey]]s.

==Overview==
To quantitatively assess changes in the composition of biologic communities, IBIs are developed to accurately reflect the [[ecological complexity]] from statistical analysis. There is no one universal IBI, and developing metrics that consistently give accurate assessment of the monitored population requires rigorous testing to confirm its validity for a given subject.  Often IBIs are region-specific and require experienced professionals to provide sufficient quality data to correctly assess a score.  Because communities naturally vary as do samples collected from a larger population, identifying robust [[statistics]] with acceptable variance is an area of active research.

This is the most powerful tool existing to identify systemic impacts on the [[health]] of biological systems.  IBIs are increasingly involved in the identification of [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|impairment]], and confirmation of recovery of [[impaired water]]s, in the [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] process required by the [[Clean Water Act]] in the USA.  

Unlike [[Water pollution#Chemical testing|chemical testing]] of water samples, which gives brief snap-shots of chemical concentrations, an IBI captures an integrated net impact on a biological community structure.  While the complete absence, particularly sudden disappearance of, suits of [[indicator species]] can constitute powerful evidence of a specific pollutant or [[stress factor]], IBIs generally do not resolve a specific cause of impairment.

The IBI concept was formulated by Dr. James Karr in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm ''Ecological Applications''] 1:66–84.&lt;/ref&gt; To date IBIs have been developed for [[fish]], [[algae]], [[macroinvertebrate]]s, pupal [[exuvia]] (shed skins of [[chironomidae]]), [[vascular plants]], and combinations of these.

==Biosurvey protocols==
Biosurvey protocols have been published for use in different waterbody types and ecoregions. One such publication is the ''Rapid Bioassessment Protocol'' for streams and rivers, issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, M.T., J. Gerritsen, B.D. Snyder, and J.B. Stribling. [http://www.epa.gov/owowwtr1/monitoring/rbp/ "Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers: Periphyton, Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish, Second Edition."] EPA, 1999. Document No. 841-B-99-002.&lt;/ref&gt; Such protocols provide a structure for developing an IBI, which may include measures such as richness of [[taxa]] (species, [[genera]], etc.) and proportion of pollution-tolerant or intolerant taxa.

==Development with volunteer and professional staff==
It is possible to create IBIs for use by minimally trained monitoring personnel, however the precision obtainable is lower than that conducted by trained professionals. Safeguards to assure robustness in spite of potential misidentifications or [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] variations require careful testing. Ongoing [[quality control]] by established experts is needed to maintain data integrity, and the analysis of IBI results becomes more complex.  Use of trained volunteers is being pioneered by government agencies responsible for monitoring large numbers of water bodies with limited resources, such as the [[Minnesota Pollution Control Agency]] (MPCA) and local volunteer stream monitoring programs supported by MPCA.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the [http://www.mnwhep.org Wetland Health Evaluation Program (WHEP)] in the greater [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] area.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has published guidance to assist volunteer programs in formulating IBIs and related findings.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/stream.pdf "Volunteer Stream Monitoring: A Methods Manual."] November 1997. Document No. EPA 841-B-97-003. Section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; While IBIs from such programs are legally admissible in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|US courts]], defending the validity of conclusions based solely on such results is unlikely to be feasible.

Agreement among multiple IBIs from data collected by established professionals can be more conclusive. A case in point is the phenomenon that stream IBI scores indicate significant impairment, or partial [[ecological collapse]] where more than 10 to 15 percent of the immediately surrounding [[drainage basin|watershed]] is [[impervious surface|impervious]] due to [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;Schueler, Thomas R. [http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf "The Importance of Imperviousness."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227110104/http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf |date=2009-02-27 }} Reprinted in [http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm ''The Practice of Watershed Protection.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223004441/http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm |date=2008-12-23 }} 2000. Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying reasons for such impairments, and possible exceptions to these trends, are major research challenges for academics studying [[cumulative watershed effects]], and the use of [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] techniques to mitigate the impacts of [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] pollution.

The '''Inter-Services Topographic Department''' (1940–1946) was a joint British Army and Navy organization created during World War II that was responsible for supplying topographic intelligence for all combined operations, and in particular, for preparing reports in advance of military operations overseas.
This is an intelligence unit administered by the Royal Navy. Dr. [[Diamond Jenness]]{{Clarify|date=June 2013|reason=The 'Diamond Jenness' article says he worked for the Inter-Services Topographic Department in the Canadian Department of National Defence and that he retired in 1948.}} was formerly chief of the Division of Anthropology of the [[National Museum of Canada]] and during the war headed the Inter-Service Topographical Section of the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]]. In 1949 he retired from government service.

==Origin==
The Interservices Topographical Department (ISTD) came out of the near-fiasco of the British invasion of Norway (9 April – 9 May 1940). Prior to that time, the Army and Royal Navy had different intelligence units that were independent of each other. The ISTD was established at [[Manchester College, Oxford]]. Working together with members of each arm and the Allies, this unit was able to bring together zero-elevation [[aerial photography]], which is phototgraphy taken as close to the wave tops as possible, in order to bring the views of the beach landscape, which were then made into continuous horizontal strip photographs. These files were marked with military targets such as bridges, [[marshalling yard]]s and the like, and up-to-date photos and intelligence were used to up date obsolete maps. From these new maps, and from older maps, magazine illustrations, and old family photographs taken on holiday collected from the public, new maps could be produced for the planning staffs and operations forces.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Leonard S. 1946. "Some Observations on Wartime Geography in England." ''Geographical Review''. Volume 36, 1946. pp. 601–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departmental actions and publications==
"Inadequate topographic intelligence could result in troops encountering impenetrable terrain, amphibious assaults landing on impassable beaches, or airborne assaults dropping into water. The U.S. Army's plan to provide photographic mapping support to advancing troops illustrates topographical intelligence's importance to the Western Allies. Further, the British developed the Inter-Service Topographic Department (ISTD) in October 1940.  The ISTD responded to the British topographical intelligence shortage before the April 1940 German invasion of Norway. In fact, the paucity of topographical intelligence on Norway resulted in Royal Air Force Bomber Command pilots relying on 1912 revised [[Baedeker]]'s guides—commonly used by foreign travelers— for navigation when attacking airfields in Norway. This lack of intelligence also caused Royal Navy carrier pilots to rely on contourless [[Admiralty chart]]s during their attack on [[Narvik]]'s port.  Later, the topographical intelligence produced by the ISTD proved invaluable to the Royal Navy midget submarine attack and the Royal Navy torpedo aircraft attack during September 1942 and late 1944, respectively, on the [[German battleship Tirpitz]] based in Norway. It was also invaluable during the November 1942 Allied North African landings, and the [[St. Nazaire]] commando raid in March 1942.  In tribute to the ISTD's effectiveness, the department received compliments from General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for its support to the allied landings in French North Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mumford. Private correspondence, 28 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Although direct foreign procurement could not be undertaken at this time, substantial amounts of material were received from the British Inter-Services Topographic Department and the [[Royal Naval Intelligence Division 5]], respectively the publishers of the ISIS reports and the Geographic Handbooks. Colonel [[C. Bassett]], R.M., and Admiral [[John Henry Godfrey]], directors respectively of the ISTD and Naval Intelligence, RN, assisted in establishing map exchanges between the Allied planning staffs; subsequently a working alliance was maintained through the London Map Division of the OSS."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Leonard S. 1949. "Lessons from the Experience of the Map Information Section, OSS." p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum and library cooperation==
As the war progressed, the Museum and Library staffs participated more and more in the activities of the Inter-Services Topographical Department (I.S.T.D.), a special department responsible for supplying topographical intelligence for all combined operations, and, in particular, for preparing reports in advance of military operations overseas. It relied in large measure upon the Museum and Library organization for the provisions of the geological information incorporated into the reports, such information being written up by the Museum staff or by the staff of the I.S.T.D. from bibliographies, maps and texts supplied to its Library Liaison Service from the Museum. The work was of a highly confidential character but, in special circumstances, of great importance and interest, and it is now permissible to state that the Museum and Library staffs provided information relating to every considerable military operation in Africa and Europe from the first landings in North Africa. Of special significance, not always apparent at the time that they were supplied, are the reports of North Africa and other Mediterranean territories in 1942; on [[Yugoslavia]], [[Crete]], the [[Dodecanese]], and [[Möhne Valley]], [[Lampedusa]], [[Pantelleria]], the geology of certain [[Alpine tunnel]]s, and various regions of the Far East in 1943; and those on the [[flying bomb]] sites in France in 1944. In connexion with this class of work and in the course of a visit to the United States in 1944 by a member of the Museum staff, the opportunity was taken to establish contact with the [[Military Geology Unit]] of the [[US Geological Survey]], with most helpful results. 
Considerable assistance was also given to the Naval Intelligence Division, whose handbooks are extensively used by the Services, by Government Departments, and by British embassies abroad. Chapters were contributed on the Mineral economics of West Africa, the [[Belgian Congo]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Angola]], and accounts of the geology and mineral resources of other territories prepared the staff of [[Naval Intelligence Division]] were checked prior to printing off.
In addition to the contributions made to the work of these two service Departments, assistance and information was given from time to time to various Government Departments such as the [[Ministry of Supply]], the [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]], the [[Ministry of Works and Buildings]], the [[Imperial War Graves Commission]], the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], the [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]], and to the scientific liaison officers of the Dominion Governments.&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain.

Cartographic Journal. Maney Publishing: 02. Volume 44, Issue 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–43. Descriptors: Geology—Maps; Geological mapping; Maps, Military; Cartography; Maps. Abstract: Between November 1943 and May 1946, geologists assisted the Inter-Service Topographical Department (ISTD) to prepare reports and maps to guide planning of British military operations in Europe and the Far East. Early reports were illustrated by pre-war geological maps reprinted by the Geographical Section, General Staff, (GSGS), later reports by new simplified geological maps, usually accompanied by one or more thematic maps. An airfield suitability map for Bulgaria and soils maps for both the Middle Danube region (Hungary) and Austria were printed as part of the GSGS Miscellaneous map series, and groundwater and soils maps prepared as tracing overlays for use with topographical maps for parts of Germany. Simplified geological maps were prepared by ISTD and printed by GSGS for Sumatra, Borneo, Formosa, the Kra Isthmus region of the Burma/Thailand peninsula, Siam (Thailand) and Indo-China, Java, Hainan, and the Hong Kong to Canton region of China. These were mostly at a scale of 1:1000 000 but in varying styles, to innovatively indicate terrain features of specific military significance. Airfield suitability maps were printed at scales between 1:250 000 and 1:1000 000 for many of these regions, based on ground features and predicted soil permeability. All these specialist maps were printed in small numbers, and few copies have survived the war – notably in the British Library, the National Archives, or the library of the Royal Geographical Society. The ISTD Geological Section constituted the larger of only two teams of British military geologists to be established in either World War, exercising a role in military intelligence that is seldom acknowledged. {{ISSN|0008-7041}}.

'''John Anthony Allan''' (born 2 January 1937), sometime cited as Tony Allan, is a British [[geographer]]. He was awarded the [[Stockholm Water Prize]] in 2008 for his revolutionary [[virtual water]] concept. Although being an emeritus of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and [[King's College London]] of the [[University of London]], he still acts as a teaching Professor at [[King's College London]].

== Education ==
Allan received a B.A. from [[Durham University]] and a PhD from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London.

== Research ==
Having been a long time water analyst with emphasis on the Middle East, he coined the term [[virtual water]] in 1993 after having been inspired by Gideon Fishelson from Tel Aviv University, who criticised his government over the amount of water that had been used to produce and export citrus fruits to the European Union. Allan then researched trade figures of Middle Eastern states to conclude that this water-scarce region was only able to survive through large quantities of food imports in grain, livestock etc. Thus, the region was not dependent on its own scarce water resources but could purchase water already embedded in agricultural produce. It was this logic that enabled Tony Allan to challenge the then prevailing thesis that the wars in the next century will be fought over water.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E.W. 1988.

{{Original research|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Mount Everest as seen from Drukair2 PLW edit.jpg|thumb|400px|Aerial view of [[Mount Everest]] from the south. The peak rises over [[Lhotse]], while [[Nuptse]] is the ridge on the left.]]
There are at least 109 [[mountain]]s on Earth with [[elevation]]s greater than {{Convert|7200|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]]. The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the [[Indian plate|Indian]] and [[Eurasian plate|Eurasian]] [[continental plate]]s. Only those [[summit]]s are included that, by an objective measure, may be considered individual mountains as opposed to subsidiary peaks.

==Considerations==
[[Image:relative-height.svg|thumb|300px|Figure demonstrating the concept of [[topographic prominence]]: The prominence of a peak is the height of the peak’s summit above the lowest contour line encircling it and no higher summit. For example, vertical arrows show the topographic prominence of three peaks on an island. A dotted horizontal line links each peak (except the highest) to its key [[col]].]]
The dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see also [[Highest unclimbed mountain]]). A popular and intuitive way to distinguish mountains from subsidiary peaks is by their height above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit, a measure called [[topographic prominence]] or re-ascent (the higher summit is called the "parent peak"). A common definition of a mountain is a summit with {{Convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} prominence. Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence/height) is used (usually 7–8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The table below lists the highest 100 summits with at least {{Convert|500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude well-known or spectacular mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit, such as [[Eiger]] or [[Nuptse]]. A few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in this list.

It is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, [[Ulugh Muztagh]] on the north [[Tibetan Plateau]] is often listed as {{Convert|7723|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|7754|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, but appears to be only {{Convert|6973|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|6987|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Some mountains differ by &gt; {{Convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of [[Mount Everest#Measurement|Mount Everest]] range from {{Convert|8840|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|8850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.

Though some parts of the world, especially the most mountainous parts, have never been thoroughly mapped, it is unlikely that any mountains this high have been overlooked, because [[synthetic aperture radar]] can and [[SRTM|has been]] used to measure elevations of most otherwise inaccessible places. Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even "new" mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all {{Convert|7200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} peaks.

The highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but [[Denali]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and [[Nanga Parbat]] are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration [[Mauna Kea]] ({{Convert|4207|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level) is the [[world]]'s tallest mountain and [[volcano]], rising about {{Convert|10203|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor. [[Ojos del Salado]] has the greatest rise on [[Earth]]—{{Convert|13420|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from the summit{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to the bottom of the [[Atacama Trench]] about {{Convert|560|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away, though most of this rise is not part of the mountain.

The highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous. [[Mauna Loa]] ({{Convert|4169|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about {{convert|2000|sqmi|km2|-2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and volume (about {{Convert|10000|mi3|km3|-3|abbr=on|disp=or}}), although, due to the intergrade of [[lava]] from [[Kilauea]], [[Hualalai]] and [[Mauna Kea]], the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. [[Mt. Kilimanjaro]] is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area ({{convert|245|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and volume ({{Convert|1150|mi3|km3|0|abbr=on||disp=or}}). [[Mount Logan]] is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area ({{convert|120|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the [[figure of the Earth]] is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several kilometres farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]], [[Ecuador]]'s tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of [[Peru]]'s tallest mountain, [[Huascarán]], is another contender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krulwich|first=Robert|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163|title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth?|date=April 7, 2007|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have elevations above sea level more than 2&amp;nbsp;km less than that of Everest.

==Geographical distribution==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
Almost all mountains in the list are located in the [[Himalaya]] and [[Karakoram]] ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks {{Convert|7000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} or higher are located in [[East Asia|East]], [[Central Asia|Central]] or [[South Asia]] in a rectangle edged by [[Noshaq]] ({{Convert|7492|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the [[Durand Line|Afghanistan–Pakistan border]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in the west, [[Jengish Chokusu]] (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, {{Convert|7439|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the [[Kyrgyzstan]]–[[Xinjiang]] border to the north, [[Gongga Shan]] (Minya Konka, {{Convert|7556|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in [[Sichuan]] to the east, and [[Kabru]] ({{Convert|7412|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the [[Sikkim]]–[[Nepal]] border to the south.

{{As of|2018|December}}, the highest peak on four of the mountains — [[Gangkhar Puensum]], [[Labuche Kang III/East]], [[Karjiang]], and [[Tongshanjiabu]], all located in [[Bhutan]] or [[China]]&lt;!--- disputes not important, still one of these two countries ---&gt; — have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is [[Saser Kangri|Saser Kangri II East]], in [[India]], on 24 August 2011. 

The highest mountain outside of Asia is [[Aconcagua]] ({{Convert|6961|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), 189th in the list, with a {{Convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} prominence cutoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=High Asia summits over 6,750 metres high with 500 metres of re-ascent |url=http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/reascent/highaltitude1.html |publisher=viewfinderpanoramas.org |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The locations of the highest mountains are shown on the composite satellite image of High Asia below. The numbers refer to the ranking in the list. For clarity, lower peaks with labels overlapping higher peaks are left out of the main image. The boxed regions are those with the highest density of summits and are enlarged in two separate images to show all peaks.

===Stem and leaf plot===
The following is a [[stem and leaf plot]] of the above data. The two digits to the left of the line are the first two digits of the mountain's height (metres), and each digit to the right of the line represents the third digit of the mountain's height. Each number on the right is linked to the corresponding mountain's article. For example, the height of one of the mountains (namely Mount Everest) is 8848 meters. Also, it is apparent that there are five mountains above 8,200 metres.

It was torn down in 1950 by order of the [[Soviet Union]] authorities. A new monument designed by [[Henrikas Šilgalis]] was erected in its place in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trijų kryžių kalnas|url=http://www.vilniauspilys.lt/triju14|publisher=Directorate of the State Cultural Reserve of Vilnius Castles|accessdate=2009-01-26|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9465">This is a '''list of warehouse districts''' that are notable.

A '''warehouse district''' or '''warehouse row''' is an area found in many urban setting known for being the current or former location of numerous [[warehouses]]. Logistically, warehouses are often located in [[industrial park]]s, with access to bulk transportation outlets such as highways, railroads, and airports.&lt;ref&gt;G. Jason Goddard, Bill Marcum, ''Real Estate Investment: A Value Based Approach'' (2012), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The areas where warehouses are typically built are often designated as [[Zoning|special zones]] for [[urban planning]] purposes, and "can have their own substantial [[infrastructure]]s, comprising [[road]]s, [[Public utility|utilities]], and [[Energy industry|energy systems]]".&lt;ref&gt;Neil S. Grigg, ''Economics and Finance for Engineers and Planners'' (2009), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, where changing social and economic conditions have made it unfeasable to maintain an existing warehouse district, cities or communities will invest in converting the district to other purposes for which this infrastructure can still be used, such an art district.&lt;ref&gt;American Planning Association, ''Planning and Urban Design Standards'' (2006), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a converted area may continue to be known as a warehouse district.

The '''Old Bahama Channel''' ({{lang-es|Canal Viejo de Bahama}}) is a [[strait]] of the [[Caribbean region]], between [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]].

==Geography==
The strait/channel is located off the Atlantic coast of north-central and northeastern mainland and the [[Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago]] of Cuba, and south of the [[Bahama Banks|Great Bahama Bank]] of the Bahamas. It is approximately {{convert|100|mi|km|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|15|mi|km|0|sp=us}} wide.  It divides the northernmost bank of the [[Caribbean islands]] into two nearly equal parts. To the north and northeast is the Great Bahama Bank and the [[Bahama Islands]]; and to the south the bank on which the island of Cuba rests.

The Old Bahama Channel is connected at its north-western extremity end to the [[Florida Straits]] by two arms, enclosing [[Cay Sal Bank]], of which the northern is called [[Santaren Channel]] and the southern [[Nicholas Channel]]. It is considered as terminating on the east between [[Maisí, Cuba|Cape Maysi]] in Cuba, and [[Inagua|Inagua island]] in the Bahamas. However, it can also be considered to include the deep sea which separates the minor banks north of [[Haiti]] from this island, so that it extends to the [[Mona Passage]], or the strait between the islands of [[Hispaniola]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

The narrowest portion of the Old Bahama Channel is between [[22nd parallel north|22°]] and [[23rd parallel north|23° North latitude]], where its width rarely exceeds {{convert|12|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==History==
In the 1500s, [[Alonso  Valiente]] was one of the discoverers of the Old Bahama Channel.&lt;ref name=Alcaldes&gt;{{cite web

The Spanish colonial trade routes in the [[Spanish West Indies]] originally favored the Old Bahama Channel, then shifted to the [[Straits of Florida]]—New Bahama Channel, as it was a safer alternative.

In the Old Bahama Channel, ship captains had to pick their way through the low-lying [[cay]]s and [[shoal]]s of the southern [[Bahama Banks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The West India Pilot.

'''Olinger, Pennsylvania''' is a [[rural]] [[List of fictional towns in literature|fictional town]] in the southeastern part of the state that serves as the setting for several [[Short story|short stories, such as "The Alligators"]] and one [[novel]] (''[[The Centaur]]'') by American writer [[John Updike]].  It is based on Updike’s boyhood town of [[Shillington, Pennsylvania]].

The small town’s residents are primarily [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and of [[Germans|German]] descent and many of them live in [[Middle class|middle-class]] brick houses.  Olinger is a suburb of [[Brewer, Pennsylvania]] (itself based on [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]) and it is home to a box factory and a [[hosiery]] mill.

There is a real place called Olinger, an unincorporated town in Lee County, Virginia. It sits along the north fork of the Powell River and is located in the Yokam District of the county. It is named for a Confederate Civil War commander. {{Relevance-inline|date=March 2014|reason=Apparently about a real town in Virginia, not a fictional town in Pennsylvania}}

'''SAR-Lupe''' is [[Germany]]'s first [[reconnaissance satellite]] system and is used for military purposes. SAR is an abbreviation for [[synthetic aperture radar]] and "Lupe" is German for [[magnifying glass]]. The SAR-Lupe program consists of five identical (770&amp;nbsp;kg) [[satellite]]s, developed by the German aeronautics company [[OHB-System]] which are controlled by a ground station&lt;ref name="groundstation"&gt;SAR-Lupe ground station:  Zentrum für Nachrichtenwesen der [[Bundeswehr]] (ZNBw), Max-Planck-Str. 17, 53501 Gelsdorf {{coord|50.5683|N|7.0363|E|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is responsible for controlling the system and analysing the retrieved data. A large data archive of images will be kept in a former [[Cold War]] [[bunker]] belonging to the ''Kommando Strategische Aufklärung'' (Strategic Reconnaissance Command) of the [[Bundeswehr]].

== Specifications ==
SAR-Lupe's "high-resolution" images can be acquired day or night through all weather conditions. The first satellite was launched from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk]] in [[Russia]] on 19 December 2006, about a year after the intended launch date; four more satellites were launched at roughly six-month intervals, and the entire system achieved full operational readiness on 22 July 2008.&lt;ref name=sfnow-launch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0807/21sarlupe5/ |author=Stephen Clark |work=Spaceflight Now |title=Radar reconnaissance spacecraft launched |date= July 22, 2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five satellites operate in three 500-kilometre orbits in planes roughly sixty degrees apart.  They use an [[Radar#Frequency bands|X-band]] radar with a three-metre dish, providing a resolution of about 50 centimetres over a frame size of 5.5&amp;nbsp;km on a side ('spotlight mode', in which the satellite rotates to keep the dish pointed at a single target) or about one metre over a frame size of 8&amp;nbsp;km x 60&amp;nbsp;km ('stripmap mode', in which the satellite maintains a fixed orientation over the earth and the radar image is formed simply by the satellite's motion along its orbit). Response time for imaging of a given area is ten hours or less. [[Thales Alenia Space]] provided the core of the Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors.&lt;ref name=thales-sensors&gt;
{{cite press release |url=https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/content/successful-launch-sar-lupe-satellite-thales-alenia-spaces-sar-sensor-electronics-units |title=Successful Launch Of Sar-lupe Satellite, With Thales Alenia Space's SAR Sensor Electronics Units |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=May 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506075333/https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/content/successful-launch-sar-lupe-satellite-thales-alenia-spaces-sar-sensor-electronics-units |archivedate=May 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The testing of SAR-Lupe involved an inverse procedure, in which the satellite, mounted in a [[radome]] on Earth, was used to image the [[International Space Station]], whose orbit is reasonably close to the one the satellite will eventually be in.  One-metre resolution at the ISS was apparently achieved.

On 30 July 2002 a cooperation treaty between [[Germany]] and [[France]] was signed, under which the SAR-Lupe satellites and the French [[Helios 2A|Helios]] optical reconnaissance satellite will operate jointly. Other EU countries have been invited to join as well and [[Italy]] has shown considerable interest.

== Future ==
A replacement of SAR-LUPE, called SARah, will be put into service from 2017-2019. It will consist of 3 radar satellites and one optical satellite. The satellites of SARah will be bigger and more capable than those of SAR-Lupe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/sarah-bundeswehr-will-drei-neue-spionagesatelliten-kaufen-a-907583.html&lt;/ref&gt;  SARah-1, a phased-array-antenna satellite, and SARah-2 and 3, passive-antenna synthetic aperture radars, are planned to be launched on [[Falcon 9]] sometime in 2019 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacex.com/press/2013/08/08/spacex-awarded-launch-german-radar-reconnaissance-satellite-system&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sambisa Forest''' is a forest in [[Borno State]], northeast [[Nigeria]]. It is in the southwestern part of [[Chad Basin National Park]], about {{convert|60|km|mi}} southeast of [[Maiduguri]], the capital of [[Borno State]].

==Geography==
The Sambisa forest is located at the northeastern tip of the west [[Sudanian Savanna]] and the southern boundary of the [[Sahel]] Acacia Savanna about 60&amp;nbsp;km. south east of [[Maiduguri]] the capital of the state of Borno.&lt;ref name=nation&gt;Kayode, Bodumin (27 April 2014) [http://thenationonlineng.net/new/sambisa-forest-of-a-thousand-myths "Sambisa: Forest of a thousand myths"], thenationonlineng.net; retrieved 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It occupies parts of the states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Yobe]], [[Gombe State, Nigeria|Gombe]], [[Bauchi]] along the corridor [[Darazo]], [[Jigawa]], and some parts of [[Kano state]] farther north.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; It is administered by the [[Local government areas of Nigeria]] of [[Askira/Uba]] in the south, by [[Damboa]] in the southwest, and by [[Konduga]] and [[Jere, Nigeria|Jere]] in the west.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

The name of the forest comes from the village of Sambisa which is on the border with Gwoza in the East. The Gwoza hills in the East have peaks of 1,300 meters above sea level and form part of the [[Mandara Mountains]] range along the Cameroon-Nigeria border.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The forest is drained by seasonal streams into the [[Chad Basin|Yedseram]] and the [[Ngadda River]]s.&lt;ref name=JRFWE&gt;Mbaya, Y.P. and Malgwi, H. (March 2010) [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/jrfwe/article/view/82370/72525 Species list and status of Mammals and Birds in Sambisa game reserve, Borno State, Nigeria] Journal of Research in Forestry, Wildlife and Environment, Vol 2, no 1, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIKE/&gt;

==Climate==
The climate is hot, dry and wet with minimum temperatures of about 21.5&amp;nbsp;°C between December and February, a maximum of about 48&amp;nbsp;°C in May and average temperatures of about 28-29&amp;nbsp;°C. The dry season is from November to May and the wet season is between May and September/October with annual rainfall of about 190&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=JRFWE/&gt;&lt;ref name=MIKE/&gt;

==Flora==
The Sambisa forest is one of the few forests in North Eastern Nigeria where sparse vegetation is the norm.  Most of the vegetation is typical of the [[Sudanian Savanna]] although, because of human activity, some parts have become more like the [[Sahel]] savanna. The forest consists of a mixture of open woodland and sections of very dense vegetation of short trees about two metres high and thorny bushes, with a height of 1/2-1 metre, which are difficult to penetrate.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|first1=Bodunrin|last1=Kayode|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/29/nigeria-sambisa-forest-boko-haram-hideout-kidnapped-school-girls-believed-to-be-held|title=Inside Nigeria's Sambisa Forest|date=29 April 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major trees and bushes in the forest include [[Detarium microcarpum|tallow]], [[rubber]], [[Vitex|wild black plum]], [[African birch|birch]], [[date palm]], [[Prosopis africana|mesquite]], [[acacia]], [[Piliostigma thonningii|monkey bread]], [[Combretum apiculatum|red bushwillow]], [[African baobab|baobab]], [[Diospyros mespiliformis|jackalberry]], [[tamarind]] and [[Terminalia (plant)|terminalia]].&lt;ref name=BirdLI/&gt;

==Fauna==
[[BirdLife International]] reported that 62 species of birds have been recorded in the Sambisa Game Reserve,&lt;ref name=BirdLI&gt;(2015) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=6757 Sambisa Game Reserve] Birdlife International; retrieved 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[guinea fowl]], [[francolin]], [[village weaver]], [[Abyssinian ground hornbill]], [[Arabian bustard]], [[Savile's bustard]], [[African collared-dove]], [[chestnut-bellied starling]], [[black scrub-robin]] and the [[Sudan golden sparrow]]. The forest was also thought to be the last remaining site of the [[ostrich]] in Nigeria.&lt;ref name =BirdLI/&gt;

17 species of mammals were reported in 2010 in the Sambisa Game Reserve&lt;ref name=JRFWE/&gt; including, [[baboon]], [[patas monkey]], [[tantalus monkey]], [[Sylvicapra grimmia|Grimm's duiker]], [[red-fronted gazelle]], [[African bush elephant]], [[roan antelope]], [[hartebeest]], [[African leopard]] and [[spotted hyena]]s. However poaching, chopping downing trees for fuel, human agricultural penetration&lt;ref name=JRFWE/&gt; and the [[Boko Haram]] [[jihadist]] group's activities since 2013&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; have reduced their numbers since then.&lt;ref name=thisdaylive/&gt; An aerial survey of the game reserve in 2006 reported seeing only five large wild animal species.&lt;ref name=MIKE/&gt;

During the colonial period, the Sambisa game reserve covered an area of {{Convert|2258|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} in the eastern part of the forest.&lt;ref name=thisdaylive/&gt; Later reports put the size of the game reserve at 518 square kilometers,&lt;ref name=JRFWE/&gt; or 686 square kilometers&lt;ref name=BirdLI/&gt; although some official documents included the Marguba Forest Reserve in the Sambisa Game Reserve.&lt;ref name=MIKE&gt;Omondi, P., et al, (6 July 2006) [http://www.cites.org/common/prog/mike/survey/0607_FW_AT_Survey_Sambisa_big.pdf Total Aerial Count of Elephants and other Wildlife Species in Sambisa Game Reserve in Borno State, Nigeria] per MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) Program (cites.org); retrieved 3 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970, the reserve was used for safaris. It had a large population of leopards, lions, elephants, hyenas, that tourists could observe from cabins or safari lodges. In 1991, the government of the state of Borno incorporated this reserve into the national park of the Chad Basin. But the abandonment of its management, following the Sambisa takeover by Boko Haram insurgents in February 2013, led to the gradual disappearance of animals, lodges collapsed or were destroyed, vegetation invaded roads, and rivers dried up.&lt;ref name=thisdaylive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/sambisa-forest-from-nature-conservation-to-terrorists-haven/178216|title=Sambisa Forest From Nature Conservation to Terrorists Haven|date=10 May 2014|publisher=thisdaylive.com|access-date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The Sambisa forest, especially the mountainous region of Gwoza near the Cameroon border, is used as shelter by the jihadist [[Boko Haram]] group and is believed to be where they keep the hostages from the [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping]] in April 2014.&lt;ref name=thisdaylive/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kayode|first=Bodunrin|title=Inside Nigeria's Sambisa forest, the Boko Haram hideout where kidnapped school girls are believed to be held|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/29/nigeria-sambisa-forest-boko-haram-hideout-kidnapped-school-girls-believed-to-be-held|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okonkwo|first=Emeka|title=US Marines, Satellite locate missing girls in Sambisa forest|publisher=The Herald (Nigeria)|date=10 May  2014|url=http://www.theheraldng.com/us-marines-satellite-locate-missing-girls-sambisa-forest-bringbackourgirls|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: 18 May 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chibok girls: Kidnapped schoolgirl found in Nigeria|publisher=BBC|date= 18 May 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36321249|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During spring 2015 the [[Nigerian Army]] started an offensive against Boko Haram in the forest, but was slowed down due to finding the forest to be heavily [[land mine|mined]] and the militants having better local knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Oladipo, Tomi (24 April 2015) [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32435614 Analysis: Islamic State strengthens ties with Boko Haram], BBC News; retrieved 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, on 28 April 2015, four Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa forest were overrun by the Nigerian military who freed nearly 300 girls and women,&lt;ref&gt;(29 April 2015) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32506942 Nigerian army 'rescues nearly 300' from Sambisa Forest], BBC News Africa; retrieved 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; who were not, however, the missing Chibok girls. On 30 April 2015 another 13 Boko Haram camps were destroyed and 234 more women and children were reportedly freed near [[Kawuri massacre|Kawuri]] and [[Konduga]].&lt;ref&gt;(2 May 2015) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32561052 Boko Haram: Nigerian army frees another 234 women and children], BBC News, Africa; retrieved 2 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nigerian Army]] Wednesday night 4 November 2015, said troops of 5 Brigade Task Group, killed two Boko Haram suspects, after destroying their camps at Hausari and Baranga in Marte Local Government Area of [[Borno State]]. According to official statement by the military, "In efforts to continually dominate recovered territories and clear all Nigerian territory of Boko Haram vestiges, the advancing troops of 5 Brigade Task Group have today cleared 5 more terrorists camps at Hausari and Baranga in Marte Local Government Area of Borno State."&lt;ref&gt;salisu Idris (November 4, 2015) Troops kill two Boko Haram suspects [https://www.today.ng/news/33867/troops-kill-two-boko-haram-suspects-army] today News, (Nigeria); Retrieved 4 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2016, one of the schoolgirls abducted from Chibok in 2014, was reportedly found by local militia men fighting Boko Haram in the Sambisa forest. It was also reported that 218 of the girls were still missing and that the found girl claimed that except six, said to have died, all of them were still held captive in the forest.&lt;ref name="BBC: 18 May 2016" /&gt;

'''Steve Coast''' (born 20 December 1980) is a British [[entrepreneur]] and the founder of the [[OpenStreetMap]] community-based world mapping project and CloudMade, a geography-related company.

==Early life==
Coast grew up in [[Walderslade]] and [[London]], England.

==Career==
Coast interned at [[Wolfram Research]] before studying [[computing science]] at [[University College London]] (UCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/06/30/will-the-real-steve-coast-please-stand-up/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704135247/http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/06/30/will-the-real-steve-coast-please-stand-up/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 July 2008|title=Will the Real Steve Coast Please Stand Up?|last=Gorman|first=Sean|date=30 June 2008|publisher=FortiusOne|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, he founded the [[OpenStreetMap]] project (OSM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/may/11/copyright.epublic|title=A sidestep in the right direction|last=Mathieson|first=S. A.|date=11 May 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coast set up Z.X.V. Ltd. with [[Nick Black (OpenStreetMap)|Nick Black]], Tom Carden and Ben Gimpert as a technology consultancy in 2005. In 2008 this became CloudMade after investment by [[Nikolaj Nyholm]] and Sunstone Capital (company's website claims it was established in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cloudmade.com/about|title=About CloudMade|work=CloudMade|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cloudmade.com/team/steve-coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802102515/http://cloudmade.com/team/steve-coast|archivedate=2 August 2008|title=Steve Coast - profile|publisher=CloudMade|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from CloudMade in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.stevecoast.com/ive-resigned-from-cloudmade |title=I've resigned from CloudMade - SteveC |publisher=Blog.stevecoast.com |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210162408/http://blog.stevecoast.com/ive-resigned-from-cloudmade |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he remained a shareholder.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

On 23 November 2010, Coast announced that he had accepted a position as Principal Architect at [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing (search engine)|Bing Mobile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.stevecoast.com/im-working-at-microsoft-and-were-donating-ima|title=I’m working at Microsoft and we’re donating imagery to OpenStreetMap!|publisher=Steve Coast|accessdate=23 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125151952/http://blog.stevecoast.com/im-working-at-microsoft-and-were-donating-ima|archivedate=25 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2013, Coast wrote on his blog that he had started to work for [[TeleNav]], taking care of OSM development for the company's Scout navigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevecoast.com/2013/09/03/mapping-my-next-adventure/|title=Mapping My Next Adventure|publisher=Steve Coast|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Coast became an advisor to Auth0, an identity-as-a-service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://auth0.com/about|title=About - Auth0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Coast published "The Book of OSM". The book contains 15 interviews conducted by Coast with various users who had participated in the project since its beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/237731198/the-book-of-openstreetmap|title=The Book of OSM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, he stepped down from full-time work at TeleNav&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stevecoast.com/2016/01/06/new-year-new-roles/|title=New Year, New Roles|last=Coast|first=Steve|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started his work as a board advisor in Navmii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://navmii.com/2016/01/25/steve-coast-joins-navmii-as-a-board-advisor/|title=Steve Coast joins Navmii as a Board Advisor|publisher=Team Navmii|date=25 January 2016|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 he started working as Chief Evangelist for [[what3words]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/pressreleases/what3words-scoops-up-founder-of-openstreetmap-to-capitalize-on-north-americ/465684|title=what3words scoops up founder of OpenStreetMap to capitalize on North American growth|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevecoast.com/2016/03/25/why-i-like-what3words/|title=Why I like what3words|publisher=Steve Coast|last=Coast|first=Steve|date=25 March 2016|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016 he became an advisor in MapJam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gisuser.com/2016/05/openstreetmap-founder-steve-coast-joins-mapjam-as-advisor/ | title=OpenStreetMap Founder Steve Coast Joins MapJam As Advisor | date=24 May 2016 | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2017, he joined [[DigitalGlobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Digital Globe |url=https://stevecoast.com/2017/10/20/a-digital-globe/ |website=Steve Coast |accessdate=28 July 2018 |date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art''''' is a 2015 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[James Crump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/land-art-smithson-holt-heizer-troublemakers-movie/ Su Wu, ''A New Documentary Sheds Light on the 'Troublemakers' of Land Art, T Magazine, ''May 4, 2015'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/virginia-dwan Christopher Bollen, ''LandArt'', ''Interview Magazine'', August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artforum.com/words/id=54731 Laura Hoffmann, ''James Crump Discusses'' Troublemakers The Story of Land Art, ''Artforum''], September 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/land-art-gets-its-close-up-in-new-film-1443403854 Andy Battaglia, ''Land Art Gets Its Close-Up In New Film'', ''Wall Street Journal''] September 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ''Troublemakers'' chronicles the history of [[land art]] in the 1960s and 1970s, when a group of radical New York artists began producing earthworks on a monumental scale in the desert spaces of the American southwest. The film follows the enigmatic careers of artists who use the earth itself as their primary medium, including [[Robert Smithson]] ([[Spiral Jetty]]), [[Walter De Maria]] ([[The Lightning Field]]) and [[Michael Heizer]] ([[Double Negative (artwork)|Double Negative]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curbed.com/archives/2015/05/22/troublemakers-review-land-art-documentary.php|title=Troublemakers and the Angst Behind Land Art|work=Curbed|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Eric Gibson of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing, "A film that takes its place among the great art documentaries of the past half-century... filled with great moments, large and small... deftly captures the madcap ambition, grandeur and even sublimity of the works these artists created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/troublemakers-the-story-of-land-art-review-1444081218|title='Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art' Review|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Kenny of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in a NYT Critics' Pick called it a "thrilling documentary," writing "The film’s generous views of spectacular works like Smithson’s monumental ([[Spiral Jetty]]) (the work projects into the Great Salt Lake in Utah) and Mr. Heizer’s ([[Double Negative (artwork)|Double Negative]]) in Nevada (a huge trench bisected by a canyon) are best seen on the largest screen available." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/movies/review-troublemakers-the-story-of-land-art-a-documentary.html Glenn Kenny, Review: ''Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art'', a Documentary, ''The New York Times,'' January 8, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; John DeFore of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "a colorful and sometimes gorgeous primer on this influential moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/troublemakers-story-land-art-film-832275|title='Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art': Film Review|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Hoffman, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' of London proclaimed "Forget ''Dawn of Justice'' – this is the best superhero team-up we’ll see at the cinema this year."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/08/troublemakers-the-story-of-land-art-robert-smithson-walter-de-maria-michael-heizer Jordan Hoffman, ''Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art Review - a story of art superheroes, The Guardian, ''January 8, 2016'']&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Patricia Zohn declared ''Troublemakers'' "does something that is rare for art documentaries: It is very beautiful and dynamic itself in examining work that is challenging. It meets the subject head-on."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patricia-zohn/culturezohn-troublemakers_b_9154462.html Patricia Zohn, CultureZohn: Troublemakers, ''The Huffington Post'', February 4, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Île-à-Vache''', ([[French language|French]], also expressed '''Île-à-Vaches''', former [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name '''Isla Vaca''', all translate to '''Cow Island''') is a [[Caribbean]] island, one of [[Haiti]]'s satellite islands. It lies in the Baie de Cayes about {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} off the coast of the country's southwest peninsula, roughly between the town of [[Les Cayes]] and Pointe l'Abacou. It was formerly known by the name of Abacca. Administratively, it became a [[List of communes of Haiti|commune]] in 1976 as part of the [[Les Cayes Arrondissement]] in the [[Sud (department)|Sud]] [[Departments of Haiti|department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Communes de la République d'Haiti | url = http://www.gexperthaiti.com/haiti/Site/Communes.htm | author = Haitian Institute of Statistics and Informatics (IHSI) | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Île-à-Vache was claimed by the Spanish Empire in 1492 as part of [[Hispaniola]], and for the next two centuries it was known by the name Isla Vaca. In 1697 the island of Hispaniola was formally divided between Spain and France in the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] which ended the [[Nine Years War]]. France assumed control of the western half of Hispaniola and named it [[Saint-Domingue]], and Isla Vaca took on its current name, Île-à-Vache.

==Geography==
The island is about {{convert|8|mi|km}} long and {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide, with an area of {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}}. The western end of the island has rolling hills with elevations as high as {{convert|490|ft|m}} with several small [[swamp]]s in the valleys; the eastern side of the island is swampy, and contains a [[lagoon]] with one of the largest [[mangrove]] forests in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = T. Brooks &amp; L.M. Davalos | title = The Birds of Île-à-Vache, Haiti | year = 2001 | publisher = Caribbean Journal of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is also surrounded by several dangerous shoals, reefs, and rocks that have been the cause of many shipwrecks throughout history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry|Moreau de Saint-Méry, Médéric Louis Élie]] | title = Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie française de l'isle Saint-Domingue | year = 1797–1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; including that of the famous Canadian fishing and racing [[schooner]] ''[[Bluenose]]'', which was wrecked on the island in 1946.

==Demographics==
The population of the island in 2015 was 14,004 adult inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Population totale, population de 18 ans et plus menages et densites estimes en 2009 | publisher = Haitian Institute of Statistics and Informatics (IHSI) | year = 2009 | url = http://www.ihsi.ht/pdf/projection/POPTOTAL&amp;MENAGDENS_ESTIM2009.pdf | accessdate = 2014-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Île-à-Vache is one of the most popular tourist sites in Haiti and it has some of the best island scenery in the [[Caribbean]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} There are two tourist resorts on the island, Port Morgan and Abaka Bay.

==History==
===Henry Morgan===
The pirate captain [[Henry Morgan]] (c.1635–1688) frequently used the little island as a base for his operations.{{sfn|Cordingly|1996|p=48}}{{sfn|Cordingly|1996|p=50}} Morgan planned and staged many of his largest raids from Isla Vaca, and lost multiple ships in the island's waters which have recently been found and explored by research divers.
[[File:Captain Henry Morgan.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Henry Morgan]].]]
In January 1669, Morgan brought ten ships and 800 men to Isla Vaca as a rendezvous point before launching a raid on the Spanish city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Because he and his fellow buccaneers had just captured two French warships, they decided to celebrate in the easily accessible Ferret Bay on the northwest side of the island. They made a fire to roast several pigs and fired the cannons of their flagship as was typical for a buccaneer celebration. In the midst of their drunken revelry, the ship's gunpowder magazine was accidentally lit, triggering an explosion that blew up Morgan's flagship ''Oxford''. In the explosion, Morgan, who was on board the ship, was thrown through the window of his quarters and into the sea. He survived the accident, but the ''Oxford'' sank, taking down with it the two captured French warships (which were tied to it) and about 200 of his men.{{sfn|Cordingly|1996|p=48}}{{sfn|Cordingly|1996|p=49}}

The ship, which was only {{convert|4|m}} below the water's surface, was found in 2004 by a team of researchers. They were accompanied by a team from the Welsh television channel S4C, which has made a documentary of the discovery. If there is still spoil located on board, is not yet known.

In 1675-1676 he again narrowly survived a costly shipwreck on the island's shores. Morgan had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica and was on his way from England to take up the post. He possibly headed for Isla Vaca to salvage what he could from the sunken ships of the 1669 incident.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} But a storm arose and sank his ship ''Jamaica Merchant'', which was loaded with a full complement of cannon which he had been bringing to bolster the defenses at [[Port Royal]].{{sfn|Cordingly|1996|p=54}}{{sfn|Cordingly|1996|p=55}} This ship has been found by researchers, who have recovered dishes, bronze coins, and the ship's anchor.

The current tourist resort of Port Morgan is named after him.

From 1682-1684 French pirate [[Jean Hamlin]] used the island as his hideout while plundering English and Dutch ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Kris E.|title=Blood and Silver: A History of Piracy in the Caribbean and Central America|date=1999|publisher=Signal Books|location=Oxford UK|isbn=9781902669014|pages=128-129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FeDivv4UsEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernard Kock===
[[File:Bernard Kock 5 Haitian dollar note.jpg|thumb|Bernard Kock 5 Haitian dollar note]]
[[File:Bernard Kock 2 Haitian dollar note.jpg|thumb|Bernard Kock 2 Haitian dollar note]]

In 1862 the entrepreneur Bernard Kock, who owned a Florida cotton plantation, visited the [[The Great Exhibition|World Fair]] in London. When he saw two bales of cotton from Haiti, he was impressed by the quality and immediately saw a business opportunity. He was an ardent [[abolitionism|abolitionist]], but he believed that after they were freed, former slaves had to have meaningful work. Therefore, he conceived the plan to develop Île-à-Vache by sending 5,000 emancipated slaves from the United States to grow cotton there.

He left for Haiti on May 17, 1862 and arrived in [[Jacmel]] on June 3. From there he went on horseback to [[Port-au-Prince]], where he was warmly received by the president of the country, [[Fabre Geffrard]]. The negotiations were difficult, however. On the one hand, the president supported the arrival of more blacks to the country, but he was also reluctant to rent a piece of Haitian soil to a white man.

Still, Kock managed to sign a contract on August 8 which granted him a 10 year lease of Île-à-Vache, with the right to an extension of a further 10 years. The rent was 3.5 [[Haitian gourde|gourdes]] (about $0.35) per hectare. He had to start operations within six months and a number of employee supervisors had to be black. They would be immediately naturalized as Haitians upon arrival. Kock was to provide a percentage of all the wood that he chopped on the island, as a kind of tax. The contract also guaranteed that he would protect the Haitian state, and that he would not have to pay import duties on the supplies that he imported.

During the same period, the United States was embroiled in the [[American Civil War]] and President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], who was in favor of the abolition of slavery, was considering plans to establish "colonies" of emancipated slaves in countries like New Granada and Liberia where they could live and work. He even offered $50 to anyone who took a black person abroad and gave him a job there.

Kock left on August 14 for New York, and arrived on August 28. However, the [[United States Secretary of State|American Secretary of State]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], had received many complaints from Central American governments who saw no advantage in the advent of so many blacks to their region. In light of these complaints, Seward stalled Kock's plan.

So Kock went directly to President Lincoln. Lincoln had his doubts about Kock's sincerity at first. He suspected that Kock was only after the $50 per person which had been promised. Kock managed to convince him, however, and on December 31, the President promised that he would think about his plan. But just one day later, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which contained not a single word about this or any other colonial plan.

Disappointed, Kock moved to Washington. There, he managed to find some blacks who were interested in going to Haiti. Back in New York, he found three financiers who pledged $70,000 to his venture. On the basis of this pledge, Koch chartered the British ship the ''Ocean Ranger'' and with this ship he brought 500 people to Île-à-Vache on April 13, 1863. Some of his passengers became ill from [[smallpox]] while on board, forcing Kock to found a small emergency hospital upon arrival.

Kock closed with laborers on a 4-year contract for a wage of $0.16 per day, costs included. He printed special Gourde notes, upon which read the text ''Island of A'Vache'' {{sic}} and his own name, Bernard Kock. These were exchangeable for normal Haitian gourdes.

The financiers, however, did not fulfill their promise. They still paid the initial amount, partly in hopes of reaping the promised $50 per person. This reward remained in effect because the government continued to doubt Koch's good intentions. After the reward was given, the financiers sent scarcely any more money or supplies to the island. The workers found themselves in rebellion, and Koch had to call in 15 Haitian soldiers for help in controlling the situation. In addition, the financiers made increasing demands, which Koch could not meet without money and goods.

Ultimately, the contract was broken. On December 22, 1863 President Lincoln sent a ship to Haiti to bring the remaining 453 workers back to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.numismondo.net/pm/hti/bernardkock/ |title=HAÏTI Paper Money,  Bernard Kock Issues, Ca. 1863 |year=1863 |access-date=29 May 2014 |first=Richard H. |last=Ponterio |publisher=Garry Saint, Esquire |work=Numismondo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thompsongenealogy.com/2011/12/bernard-kock-colonized-cow-island-with-freed-slaves/ |title=Bernard Kock Colonized Cow Island With Freed Slaves |date=December 2011 |access-date=29 May 2014 |last=Thompson |first=Boyce |work=Thompson Family History |publisher=Boyce Thompson Media, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current times===
The best-known personality on the island is Sr. Flora, a French-Canadian [[Franciscan]] nun who founded an orphanage and school which she has run for decades in the village of Madame Bernard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soulofhaiti.ie/what-we-do/developing-sustainable-communities/ile-a-vache-orphanage-community-programme/ |work=Soul of Haiti |title=Ile a Vache Orphanage &amp; Community Programme |author=Sr Flora |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429051401/http://www.soulofhaiti.ie/what-we-do/developing-sustainable-communities/ile-a-vache-orphanage-community-programme/ |archive-date=29 April 2014 |publisher=LPHmedia ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haitian government has announced plans to begin an international touristic destination project on the island of Île-à-Vache.
The government’s projects on the island has launched with plans for 1,000 luxury hotel rooms, an archaeology museum, nightclubs, art galleries and craft boutiques. Since its commencement in 2013 to its projected completion in late 2015, this makes Île-à-Vache among the largest ongoing tourism projects in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=Staff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caribjournal.com/2014/08/30/haiti-planning-to-develop-1000-hotel-rooms-on-ile-a-vache/ |title=Haiti Planning to Develop 1,000 Hotel Rooms on Ile a Vache |work=Caribbean Journal |date=30 August 2014 |access-date=20 July 2018 |author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has built a 2.6-kilometre runway with plans for an international airport.&lt;ref name=Staff/&gt;

As of February 2014, the Haitian government has begun the process of expropriation and relocation.&lt;ref&gt;HA/radio Métropole Haiti&lt;/ref&gt;
