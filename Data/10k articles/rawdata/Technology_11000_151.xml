'''3D Structure Change Detection''' is a type of [[Change detection (GIS)]] processes for [[GIS]] (geographical information systems).  It is a process that measures how the volume of a particular area have changed between two or more time periods.  A high-spatial resolution [[Digital elevation model | Digital elevation model (DEM)]] that provides accurate 4-d (space and time) structural information over area of interest is required to compute such changes.  In production, two or more [[Digital_elevation_model|DEMs]] that cover the same area are used to monitor topographic changes of area.  By comparing the [[Digital_elevation_model|DEMs]] made at different times, structure of terrain changes can be realized by the ground elevation difference from [[Digital_elevation_model|DEMs]].  Details, occurring time and accuracy of such changes are strongly relied on the resolution, quality of [[Digital_elevation_model|DEMs]].  In general, the problem of involves whether or not a change has occurred, or whether several changes have occurred.  Such structure changes detection has been widely used to assess urban growth, impact of natural disasters like earthquake, volcano and battle damage assessment.

==Products==
The company sold a range of [[laptop computer]]s. The systems used [[Microsoft Windows]] rather than the [[RISC OS]] operating system developed by the original [[Acorn Computers]] and this incarnation of Acorn did not support or license any technologies or products of the original, apart from the name and trademark.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071008042529/http://www.acorncomputers.co.uk/about.htm Acorn Computers Limited – About], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet goodwins diary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/mixed-signals-10000051/rupert-goodwins-diary-10004273/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505104212/http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/mixed-signals-10000051/rupert-goodwins-diary-10004273/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=Rupert Goodwins' Diary |work=[[ZDNet]] |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=15 December 2011 |author=Goodwins, Rupert |quote=But all that's left of the company itself now finds itself employed as a badge on a series of laptops imported by a Nottingham firm with, it has to be said, almost no interesting features.

The reuse of the Acorn Computers Ltd name caused an amount of confusion and controversy, particularly amongst users of the original company's products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.acorn.misc/browse_thread/thread/f11f0971025447c/a8269d8c0713c529?q=acorn+computers&amp;lnk=ol&amp; Computer Trade Show Exhibitor thread], comp.sys.acorn.misc, started 4 May 2006; [http://www.iconbar.com/Its_Acorn_but_not_as_we_know_them.../news698.html It's Acorn, but not as we know them...] Andrew Poole, iconbar.com, 5 May 2006; [http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1594.html Acorn brand name in PC laptop launch] Chris Williams, drobe.co.uk, 5 May 2006; [http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1608.html Acorn is a legendary brand says new Acorn] Chris Williams, drobe.co.uk, 15 May 2006; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313175446/http://wiki.onega.net/index.php?title=News Onega evaluates Acorn]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain dispute==
On 24 July 2006, [[Nominet]]'s Dispute Resolution Service (DRS) ruled that the domain name &lt;tt&gt;acorncomputers.co.uk&lt;/tt&gt; should be transferred to the new Acorn from computer enthusiast Roy Johnson. The company made a complaint to the DRS contending that the "use of Acorn Computers' company name is illegal and has caused much confusion and continues to do so which is detrimental to [Acorn] and extremely misleading". Despite the fact that Johnson appeared to have been operating the website since at least 2001, five years before the new Acorn was registered as a company, Nominet ruled in favour of Acorn, as Johnson had not maintained an accurate record of his postal address, and mail to Johnson's registered address was returned by [[Royal Mail]] marked 'addressee has gone away'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1699.html ROS fan loses Acorn domain in dispute], Josh Eilken, drobe.co.uk, 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/DRS/2006/3682.html DRS Number 03682, Acorn Computers Limited and Roy Johnson], Nominet UK Dispute Resolution Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
Acorn Computers Ltd failed to file any accounts at [[Companies House]], and so was struck off the limited companies register&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/822185/supplements/473 London Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt; and dissolved in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/81b8ecfd4288608e9886401ffcf2a982/compdetails Companies House WebCheck]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''air blaster''' or '''air cannon''' is a de-clogging device composed of two main elements: a [[pressure vessel]] (storing air pressure)  and a triggering mechanism (high speed release of compressed air). They are permanently installed on [[Storage silo|silos]], bins and hoppers walls for all powdery forms of materials, and are used to prevent caking and allowing maximum storage capacity. They are also used in the entertainment industry for shock value in Halloween haunts and other attractions.

Air blasters do not need any specific air supply. Available plant air is enough with a minimum of 4 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] [[air pressure]] (60 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] or 400 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]), although 5 to 6 bar are preferred for better results (75 to 90 psi). The average air consumption is moderate, and depends on the number of firings per hour, size of the pressure vessel, and number of air cannons installed. For instance, a 50-liter air cannon consumes 0.60 Nm³/hour at 6 bar air pressure (90 psi or 600 kPa), with 2 firings per hour.

The compressed air contained in the pressure vessel is instantly released, and the achieved blast, called the impact force, evacuates material sticking to the walls (rat holing),  as well as breaking potential bridging thanks to the shock wave obtained.

The blasts are usually organized by using an automatic sequencer.

==Operating principle==
*Phase 1: Air feeding: Air supply from the [[air compressor]] passes through a 3/2 way [[solenoid valve]] feed, the Quick Release Valve (QRV), and reach the triggering mechanism with its piston disc in closed position. The air reservoir is then pressurized in less than 15 seconds, depending on the air pressure and air volume used.
*Phase 2: Waiting: An air pressure equilibrium between air circuit, triggering mechanism, and pressure vessel is created.
*Phase 3: Blasting: When activated, a solenoid valve purges the air circuit, thus creating an air vacuum. Then, the piston inside triggering mechanism is abruptly pushed back by negative pressure, thus creating a sudden blast from the air contained in the pressure vessel. This phase is measured in milliseconds.
*Then the cycle repeats again at Phase 1.

==Design criteria and construction==
An efficient air blaster should be designed to ensure:
* Complete safety for the operators, thus avoiding harsh rodding or other manual cleaning methods;
* A sturdy design, able to cope with the most severe operating conditions; 
* Easy maintenance, due to an easily accessible triggering device; 
* A metal-to-metal construction design, making the air blaster extremely reliable even in harsh environment (such as exposed to heat and/or dust);
* A cost effective solution to all customers that prevents hopper, bin, and silo discharge interruption, as well as process disr

==Construction==
Usually 2 versions exist
A high temperature version: mainly for heat exchanger and cooler applications to remove clogging and to avoid costly plant stoppages and downtime.
A low temperature version: to eliminate build-up and dead stock for powdery and granular materials thus preventing caking and allowing optimization of storage capacity.

==Installation==
Air blasters solves problem occurring in cement factories among other industries, with blockages occurring in preheater towers (Kiln inlet, Cyclones, riser ducts...etc.) and in grate coolers, thus providing substantial savings.

'''Alexander (Aleco) Christakis''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Χρηστάκης}}; born 1937) is a [[Greece|Greek]] American [[social scientist]], [[systems scientist]] and [[cyberneticist]], former faculty member of several Universities, organizational consultant and member of the [[Club of Rome]], known for his "study and design of social systems".&lt;ref name = "CWA"&gt;[http://www.cwaltd.com/index1.htm?main.htm&amp;2 Biography] Alexander N. Christakis, January 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Christakis came to the United States in 1956, and received a BA in [[theoretical physics]] at [[Princeton University]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in theoretical nuclear physics at [[Yale]]. Later on he proceeded studying [[urban planning]], and [[systems science]] until 1970.&lt;sup&gt;where?&lt;/sup&gt;

After the birth of his son [[Nicholas A. Christakis|Nicholas]] &lt;ref&gt;https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/3943/nicholas-christakis&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Greece and joined the architectural firm of [[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Doxiadis Associates]] which was specialized in architecture and town planning. In 1968 he was co-founder of the [[Club of Rome]], where he was a collaborator of [[Aurelio Peccei]], [[Erich Jantsch]] and [[Hasan Özbekhan]]. Since the 1970s Christakis has served on the faculties of [[Yale University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[University of Athens]], and the [[University of Virginia]]. He also spent five years at [[George Mason University]] as the Director of the Center for Interactive Management headed by [[John N. Warfield]]. In 1989 Christakis founded his own management consultancy firm CWA Ltd. dedicated to apply Interactive Management principles, and he has been CEO ever since.

Christakis serves on the Editorial Boards of several journals, including ''[[Systems Research and Behavioral Science]]s'', ''Systems: Journal of Transdisciplinary Systems Science'', and the ''Journal of Applied Systems Studies''.

In 2002, Dr. Christakis served as President of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]]. He also serves as President of the [[Institute for 21st Century Agoras]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalagoras.org Global Agoras&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization dedicated to the evolution of civic, global, and institutional capacity for coordinated democratic decision-making using systems principles (Co-Laboratories of Democracy.) The Institute for 21st Century Agoras is credited for the formalization of the science of [[Structured dialogic design]] in its present form. Dr. Christakis is also a partner with Dialogic Design International,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialogicdesignllc.com/ dialogicdesignllc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a consulting firm that deploys SDD in systemic design approaches for complex organizational and systems problems.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a common [[unit process]] used in [[oil refinery|refineries]], and is also used in [[petrochemical]] plants, [[natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and other industries.

Processes within oil refineries or chemical processing plants that remove hydrogen sulfide are referred to as "sweetening" processes because the odor of the processed products is improved by the absence of hydrogen sulfide.  An alternative to the use of amines involves [[membrane technology]]. However, membrane separation is less attractive due to the relatively high capital and operating costs as well as other technical factors.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, R. W.  "Future Directions of Membrane Gas Separation Technology" Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2002, volume 41, pages 1393-1411. {{DOI|10.1021/ie0108088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different amines are used in gas treating:
* [[Diethanolamine]] (DEA)
* [[Ethanolamine|Monoethanolamine]] (MEA)
* [[Methyl diethanolamine|Methyldiethanolamine]] (MDEA)
* [[Diisopropanolamine]] (DIPA)
* Aminoethoxyethanol (Diglycolamine) (DGA)

The most commonly used amines in industrial plants are the alkanolamines DEA, MEA, and MDEA.  These amines are also used in many oil refineries to remove [[sour gas]]es from liquid hydrocarbons such as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG).

== Description of a typical amine treater ==

Gases containing {{H2S}} or both {{H2S}} and {{CO2}} are commonly referred to as ''[[sour gas]]es'' or ''[[acid gas]]es'' in the [[hydrocarbon]] processing industries.

The chemistry involved in the amine treating of such gases varies somewhat with the particular amine being used. For one of the more common amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) denoted as '''RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', the chemistry may be expressed as:

:RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{H2S}} {{eqm}} RNH{{su|p=+|b=3}} + SH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

A typical amine gas treating process (the [[Girbotol process]], as shown in the [[Process Flow diagram|flow diagram]] below) includes an absorber unit and a regenerator unit as well as accessory equipment.  In the absorber, the downflowing amine solution absorbs {{H2S}} and {{CO2}} from the upflowing sour gas to produce a sweetened gas stream (i.e., a gas free of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) as a product and an amine solution rich in the absorbed acid gases.  The resultant "rich" amine is then routed into the regenerator (a stripper with a [[reboiler]]) to produce regenerated or "lean" amine that is recycled for reuse in the absorber. The stripped [[overhead gas]] from the regenerator is concentrated {{H2S}} and {{CO2}}.

[[Image:AmineTreating.svg|frame|center|[[Process flow diagram]] of a typical amine treating process used in petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants and other industrial facilities.]]

===Alternative processes===
Alternative stripper configurations include matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure with split feed. Many of these configurations offer more energy efficiency for specific solvents or operating conditions. Vacuum operation favors solvents with low heats of absorption while operation at normal pressure favors solvents with high heats of absorption. Solvents with high heats of absorption require less energy for stripping from temperature swing at fixed capacity. The matrix stripper recovers 40% of {{CO2}} at a higher pressure and does not have inefficiencies associated with multipressure stripper. Energy and costs are reduced since the reboiler duty cycle is slightly less than normal pressure stripper. An Internal Exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to {{CO2}} in the overheads stream, and therefore less steam is required. The multipressure configuration with split feed reduces the flow into the bottom section, which also reduces the equivalent work. Flashing feed requires less heat input because it uses the latent heat of water vapor to help strip some of the {{CO2}} in the rich stream entering the stripper at the bottom of the column. The multipressure configuration is more attractive for solvents with a higher heats of absorption.&lt;ref name="Oyenekan2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oyenekan|first1=Babatunde|last2=Rochelle|first2=Gary T.|title=Alternative Stripper Configurations for {{CO2}} Capture by Aqueous Amines|journal=AIChE|volume=53|issue=12|year=2007|pages=3144–154 |doi=10.1002/aic.11316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amines ==

The amine concentration in the absorbent aqueous solution is an important parameter in the design and operation of an amine gas treating process. Depending on which one of the following four amines the unit was designed to use and what gases it was designed to remove, these are some typical amine concentrations, expressed as weight percent of pure amine in the aqueous solution:&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;

:* Monoethanolamine: About 20 % for removing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and about 32 % for removing only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:* Diethanolamine: About 20 to 25 % for removing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:* Methyldiethanolamine: About 30 to 55 % for removing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:* Diglycolamine: About 50 % for removing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The choice of amine concentration in the circulating aqueous solution depends upon a number of factors and may be quite arbitrary. It is usually made simply on the basis of experience. The factors involved include whether the amine unit is treating raw [[natural gas]] or [[Petroleum refining processes|petroleum refinery]] by-product gases that contain relatively low concentrations of both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or whether the unit is treating gases with a high percentage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such as the offgas from the steam reforming process used in [[ammonia production]] or the [[flue gas]]es from [[Conventional coal-fired power plant|power plants]].&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;

Both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are acid gases and hence corrosive to [[carbon steel]]. However, in an amine treating unit, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the stronger acid of the two. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S forms a film of [[iron sulfide]] on the surface of the steel that acts to protect the steel. When treating gases with a high percentage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, corrosion inhibitors are often used and that permits the use of higher concentrations of amine in the circulating solution.

Another factor involved in choosing an amine concentration is the relative solubility of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the selected amine.&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt; The choice of the type of amine will affect the required circulation rate of amine solution, the energy consumption for the regeneration and the ability to selectively remove either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S alone or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alone if desired. For more information about selecting the amine concentration, the reader is referred to Kohl and Nielsen's book.

===MEA and DEA===
MEA and DEA are primary and secondary amines. They are very reactive and can effectively remove a high volume of gas due to a high reaction rate. However, due to stoichiometry, the loading capacity is limited to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mol CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per mole of amine.&lt;ref name="Idem2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Idem|first1=Raphael|title=Pilot Plant Studies of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Performance of Aqueoues MEA and Mixed MEA/MDEA Solvents at the University of Regina CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Technology Development Plant and the Boundary Dam CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Demonstration Plant|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.|volume=45|year=2006|pages=2414–2420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MEA and DEA also require a large amount of energy to strip the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during regeneration, which can be up to 70% of total operating costs. They are also more corrosive and chemically unstable compared to other amines.&lt;ref name="Idem2006"/&gt;

== Uses ==
In oil refineries, that stripped gas is mostly H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, much of which often comes from a sulfur-removing process called [[hydrodesulfurization]].  This H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich stripped gas stream is then usually routed into a [[Claus process]] to convert it into elemental [[sulfur]]. In fact, the vast majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and other hydrocarbon processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sulfur/sulfumcs06.pdf Sulfur production report] by the [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/july03/resources.html Discussion of recovered byproduct sulfur]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another sulfur-removing process is the [[WSA Process]] which recovers sulfur in any form as concentrated sulfuric acid. In some plants, more than one amine absorber unit may share a common regenerator unit. 
The current emphasis on removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the flue gases emitted by fossil fuel power plants has led to much interest in using amines for removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (See also: [[Carbon capture and storage]] and [[Conventional coal-fired power plant]].)

In the specific case of the industrial synthesis of [[ammonia]], for the [[steam reforming]] process of hydrocarbons to produce gaseous [[hydrogen]], amine treating is one of the commonly used processes for removing excess carbon dioxide in the final purification of the gaseous hydrogen.

In the [[biogas]] production it is sometimes necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the biogas to make it comparable with the natural. The removal of the sometimes high content of hydrogen sulfide is necessary to prevent corrosion of metallic parts after burning the bio gas.&lt;ref name="AbatzoglouBoivin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abatzoglou|first1=Nicolas|last2=Boivin|first2=Steve|title=A review of biogas purification processes|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining|volume=3|issue=1|year=2009|pages=42–71|issn=1932-104X|doi=10.1002/bbb.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertasGiraldo2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huertas|first1=J.I.|last2=Giraldo|first2=N.|last3=Izquierdo|first3=S.|title=Removal of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from Biogas by Amine Absorption|year=2011|doi=10.5772/20039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon capture and storage ===
Amines are used to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in various areas ranging from natural gas production to the food and beverage industry, and have been for over sixty years.&lt;ref name="Rochelle2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rochelle|first1=G. T.|title=Amine Scrubbing for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5948|year=2009|pages=1652–1654|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1176731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple classifications of amines, each of which has different characteristics relevant to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. For example, Monoethanolamine (MEA) reacts strongly with acid gases like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and has a fast reaction time and an ability to remove high percentages of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, even at the low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Typically, Monoethanolamine (MEA) can capture 85% to 90% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the flue gas of a coal-fired plant, which is one of the most effective solvent to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=folger&gt;{{cite journal| first = P. | last = Folger| title =Carbon Capture: a Technology Assessment | journal = Congressional Research Service Report for Congress | volume= 5 | year= 2009 | pages = 26–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges of carbon capture using amine include:
* Low pressure gas increases difficulty of transferring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the gas into amine
* Oxygen content of the gas can cause amine degradation and acid formation 
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degradation of primary (and secondary) amines 
* High energy consumption 
* Very large facilities 
* Finding suitable location for the removed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="WuCarroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ying |last1=Wu|first2=John J.|last2= Carroll|title=Carbon Dioxide Sequestration and Related Technologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrTpKKHj7zgC|date=5 July 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-93876-8 | pages= 128–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partial pressure is the driving force to transfer CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the liquid phase. Under the low pressure, this transfer is hard to achieve without increasing the reboiler’s heat duty, which will result in higher cost.&lt;ref name="WuCarroll2011" /&gt;

Primary and secondary amines, for example, MEA and DEA, will react with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and form degradation products. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the inlet gas will cause degradation as well. The degraded amine is no longer able to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which decreases the overall carbon capture efficiency.&lt;ref name="WuCarroll2011" /&gt;

Currently, variety of amine mixtures are being synthesized and tested to achieve a more desirable set of overall properties for use in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture systems. One major focus is on lowering the energy required for solvent regeneration, which has a major impact on process costs. However, there are tradeoffs to consider. For example, the energy required for regeneration is typically related to the driving forces for achieving high capture capacities. Thus, reducing the regeneration energy can lower the driving force and thereby increase the amount of solvent and size of absorber needed to capture a given amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus, increasing the capital cost.&lt;ref name=folger /&gt;

An '''anemometer''' is a device used for measuring [[wind speed]], and is also a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]]. The first known description  of an anemometer was given by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450.

==History==
The anemometer has changed little since its development in the 15th century. [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450. In following centuries, numerous others, including [[Robert Hooke]]
(1635–1703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. In 1846, [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]] (1792–1882) improved upon the design by using four hemispherical cups and mechanical wheels. In 1926, Canadian meteorologist [[John Patterson (meteorologist)|John Patterson]] (January 3, 1872 – February 22, 1956) developed a three-cup anemometer, which was improved by Brevoort and Joiner in 1935. In 1991, [[Derek Weston]] added the ability to measure wind direction. In 1994, [[Andrews Pflitsch]] developed the sonic anemometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/articles/history-anemometer/|title=History of the Anemometer|publisher=Logic Energy|access-date=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Velocity anemometers==

===Cup anemometers===
[[File:Cup-Anemometer-Animation.gif|thumb|right|Cup anemometer animation]]
A simple type of anemometer was invented in 1845 by Dr. [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]], of [[Armagh Observatory]]. It consisted of four [[hemispherical]] cups mounted on horizontal arms, which were mounted on a vertical shaft. The air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the shaft at a rate that was roughly proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting the turns of the shaft over a set time interval produced a value proportional to the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds. It is also called a rotational anemometer.

On an anemometer with four cups, it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross. Since a hollow hemisphere has a [[drag coefficient]] of .38 on the spherical side and 1.42 on the hollow side,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://doc-0c-ac-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/s7aiua40ikv6hnfbpqppab412ps8c66a/1519704000000/08405723359066499286/*/0Bx0MqOfev7dnTnB0eFRIN2JQb0k?e=download|title=Sighard Hoerner's Fluid Dynamic Drag|pages=3–17, Figure 32|publication-date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; more force is generated on the cup that is presenting its hollow side to the wind. Because of this asymmetrical force, torque is generated on the axis of the anemometer, causing it to spin.

Theoretically, the speed of rotation of the anemometer should be proportional to the wind speed, because the force produced on an object is proportional to the speed of the fluid flowing past it, but other factors influence the rotational speed, including turbulence produced by the apparatus, increasing drag in opposition to the torque that is produced by the cups and support arms, and friction of the mount point. When Robinson first designed his anemometer, he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind, unaffected by the cup size or arm length. This was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments, but it was incorrect. Instead, the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups, the ''anemometer factor'', depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have a value between two and a little over three. Every previous experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated after the error was discovered.

The three-cup anemometer developed by the Canadian [[John Patterson (meteorologist)|John Patterson]] in 1926 and subsequent cup improvements by Brevoort &amp; Joiner of the United States in 1935 led to a cupwheel design with a nearly linear response and had an error of less than 3% up to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Patterson found that each cup produced maximum torque when it was at 45° to the wind flow. The three-cup anemometer also had a more constant torque and responded more quickly to gusts than the four-cup anemometer.

The three-cup anemometer was further modified by the Australian Dr. Derek Weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed. Weston added a tag to one cup, which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind. Wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed, while wind speed is determined from the average cupwheel speed.

Three-cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for [[wind resource assessment]] studies &amp; practice.

===Vane anemometers===
One of the other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer is the ''vane anemometer''. It may be described as a [[windmill]] or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a [[weather vane|wind vane]] or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.

A ''vane anemometer'' thus combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument.&lt;ref name= WMO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/vaneanem.htm|title=Vane anemometer|author=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|work=Eumetcal|access-date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flow rate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.

In cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in ventilating shafts of mines and buildings, wind vanes known as air meters are employed, and give satisfactory results.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Hot-wire anemometers===
[[File:Hd sonde.jpg|thumb|left|Hot-wire sensor]]
Hot wire anemometers use a very fine wire (on the order of several micrometres) electrically heated to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the wire cools the wire. As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal ([[tungsten]] is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm|title=Hot-wire Anemometer explanation|publisher=eFunda|access-date=18 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010125307/http://www.efunda.com/DesignStandards/sensors/hot_wires/hot_wires_intro.cfm |archivedate=10 October 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ways of implementing this exist, and hot-wire devices can be further classified as CCA ([[constant current]] anemometer), CVA ([[Voltage source|constant voltage]] anemometer) and CTA (constant-temperature anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature) constant, following [[Ohm's law]].

Additionally, PWM ([[pulse-width modulation]]) anemometers are also used, wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold "floor" is reached, at which time the pulse is sent again.

Hot-wire anemometers, while extremely delicate, have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods, and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows, or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest.

An industrial version of the fine-wire anemometer is the [[Thermal mass flow meter|thermal flow meter]], which follows the same concept, but uses two pins or strings to monitor the variation in temperature. The strings contain fine wires, but encasing the wires makes them much more durable and capable of accurately measuring air, gas, and emissions flow in pipes, ducts, and stacks. Industrial applications often contain dirt that will damage the classic hot-wire anemometer.

[[File:Laser anemometer.png|thumb|360px|Drawing of a laser anemometer. The laser light is emitted (1) through the front lens (6) of the anemometer and is backscattered off the air molecules (7). The backscattered radiation (dots) re-enters the device and is reflected and directed into a detector (12).]]

===Laser Doppler anemometers===
In [[laser Doppler velocimetry]], laser Doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a [[laser]] that is divided into two beams, with one propagated out of the anemometer. Particulates (or deliberately introduced seed material) flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect, or backscatter, the light back into a detector, where it is measured relative to the original laser beam. When the particles are in great motion, they produce a [[Doppler shift]] for measuring wind speed in the laser light, which is used to calculate the speed of the particles, and therefore the air around the anemometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iten|first=Paul D.|date=29 June 1976|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=3966324|title=Laser Doppler Anemometer|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|access-date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ultrasonic Windsensor.png|thumb|2D ultrasonic anemometer with 3 paths]]

===Ultrasonic anemometers===
[[File:WindMaster.jpg|thumb|3D ultrasonic anemometer]]
Ultrasonic anemometers, first developed in the 1950s, use [[ultrasound|ultrasonic sound waves]] to measure wind velocity. They measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of [[transducer]]s. Measurements from pairs of transducers can be combined to yield a measurement of velocity in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional flow. The [[spatial resolution]] is given by the path length between transducers, which is typically 10 to 20 [[centimeter|cm]]. Ultrasonic anemometers can take measurements with very fine [[temporal resolution]], 20 [[hertz|Hz]] or better, which makes them well suited for [[turbulence]] measurements. The lack of moving parts makes them appropriate for long-term use in exposed automated weather stations and weather buoys where the accuracy and reliability of traditional cup-and-vane anemometers are adversely affected by salty air or dust. Their main disadvantage is the distortion of the air flow by the structure supporting the transducers, which requires a correction based upon wind tunnel measurements to minimize the effect. An international standard for this process, [[ISO 16622]] ''Meteorology—Ultrasonic anemometers/thermometers—Acceptance test methods for mean wind measurements'' is in general circulation. Another disadvantage is lower accuracy due to precipitation, where rain drops may vary the [[speed of sound]].

Since the speed of sound varies with temperature, and is virtually stable with pressure change, ultrasonic anemometers are also used as [[thermometers]].

Two-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as [[weather station]]s, ship navigation, aviation, [[weather buoy]]s and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giebhardt |first=Jochen |editor-last1=Dalsgaard Sørensen |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=N Sørensen |editor-first2=Jens |title=Wind Energy Systems: Optimising design and construction for safe and reliable operation |publisher=Elsevier |date=December 20, 2010 |pages=329–349 |chapter=Chapter 11: Wind turbine condition monitoring systems and techniques |isbn=9780857090638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the [[eddy covariance]] method when used with fast-response [[infrared gas analyzer]]s or [[laser]]-based analyzers.

Two-dimensional wind sensors are of two types:
* '''Two ultrasounds paths''': These sensors have four arms. The disadvantage of this type of sensor is that when the wind comes in the direction of an ultrasound path, the arms disturb the airflow, reducing the accuracy of the resulting measurement.
* '''Three ultrasounds paths''': These sensors have three arms. They give one path redundancy of the measurement which improves the sensor accuracy and reduces aerodynamic turbulence.

====Acoustic resonance anemometers====
[[File:Acoustic Resonance Wind Sensor.jpg|thumb|left|Acoustic resonance anemometer]]
Acoustic resonance anemometers are a more recent variant of sonic anemometer. The technology was invented by Dr Savvas Kapartis and patented in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;European Patent No. EPO 801311 A and USA Patent No. 5,877,416 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas conventional sonic anemometers rely on time of flight measurement, acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic (ultrasonic) waves within a small purpose-built cavity in order to perform their measurement.

[[File:Acoustic Resonance Anemometer.jpg|thumb|Acoustic resonance principle]]
Built into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers, which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies. As wind passes through the cavity, a change in the wave's property occurs (phase shift). By measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer, and then by mathematically processing the data, the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction.

Acoustic resonance technology enables measurement within a small cavity, the sensors therefore tend to be typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity and the fact that it does not require re-calibrating once installed.

===Ping-pong ball anemometers===
A common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a [[ping-pong ball]] attached to a string. When the wind blows horizontally, it presses on and moves the ball; because ping-pong balls are very lightweight, they move easily in light winds. Measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed.

This type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction, which most students make on their own, but a similar device was also flown on [[Phoenix Mars Lander#Meteorological station|Phoenix Mars Lander]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marslab.au.dk/research/instrument-development/the-telltale-project/ "The Telltale project."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220080017/http://www.marslab.dk/TelltaleProject.html |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pressure anemometers==
[[File:Britannia Yacht Club tour, burgee, and wind gauge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Britannia Yacht Club]] clubhouse tour, burgee, and wind gauge on roof]]
The first designs of anemometers that measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes.

===Plate anemometers===
These are the first modern anemometers. They consist of a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. Plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.

===Tube anemometers===
[[File:Tube anemometer invented by William Henry Dines.jpg|thumb|left|Tube anemometer invented by William Henry Dines. The movable part (right) is mounted on the fixed part (left).]]
[[File:Instruments at Mount Washington Observatory.JPG|thumb|Instruments at [[Mount Washington Observatory]]. The pitot tube static anemometer is on the right.]]
[[File:Pitot tube static anemometer.JPG|thumb|The pointed head is the pitot port. The small holes are connected to the static port.]]

[[James Lind (1736–1812)|James Lind]]'s anemometer of 1775 consisted of a glass U tube containing a liquid [[manometer]] (pressure gauge), with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow. Though the Lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer. The wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer. The resulting elevation difference in the two legs of the U tube is an indication of the wind speed. However, an accurate measurement requires that the wind speed be directly into the open end of the tube; small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the reading.

The successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anemometer Comparisons|first=W. H.|last=Dines|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|date=1892|volume=18|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2kMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Royal Meteorological Society (Great Britain), James Glaisher|doi=10.1002/qj.4970188303|bibcode=1892QJRMS..18..165D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10&amp;nbsp;mi/h (16&amp;nbsp;km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.

While the Dines anemometer had an error of only 1% at {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, it did not respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind. In 1918 an aerodynamic vane with eight times the torque of the flat plate overcame this problem.

====Pitot tube static anemometers====
Modern tube anemometers use the same principle as in the Dines anemometer but using a different design. The implementation uses a [[pitot tube|pitot-static tube]] which is a pitot tube with two ports, pitot and static, that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft. The pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind, and the static port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube. The pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind. Additionally, the tube is heated to prevent [[rime ice]] formation on the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instrumentation: Pitot Tube Static Anemometer, Part 1|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation/14828|publisher=Mt. Washington Observatory|access-date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines. The measurement devices can be [[manometer]]s, [[pressure transducer]]s, or analog [[chart recorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instrumentation: Pitot Tube Static Anemometer, Part 2|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/clarkb/instrumentation-1/15065|publisher=Mt. Washington Observatory|access-date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of density on measurements===
In the tube anemometer the dynamic pressure is actually being measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. If the actual air density differs from the calibration value, due to differing temperature, elevation or barometric pressure, a correction is required to obtain the actual wind speed. Approximately 1.5% (1.6% above 6,000 feet) should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000&amp;nbsp;ft (5% for each kilometer) above sea-level.

==Effect of icing==
At airports, it is essential to have accurate wind data under all conditions, including freezing precipitation. Anemometry is also required in monitoring and controlling the operation of wind turbines, which in cold environments are prone to in-cloud icing. Icing alters the aerodynamics of an anemometer and may entirely block it from operating. Therefore, anemometers used in these applications must be internally heated.&lt;ref&gt;Makkonen, L. et al. (2001) Anemometry in icing conditions. Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology 18:1457-1469&lt;/ref&gt; Both cup anemometers and sonic anemometers are presently available with heated versions.

==Instrument location==
In order for wind speeds to be comparable from location to location, the effect of the terrain needs to be considered, especially in regard to height. Other considerations are the presence of trees, and both natural canyons and artificial canyons (urban buildings). The standard anemometer height in open rural terrain is 10 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oke|first=Tim R.|title=Initial Guidance to Obtain Representative Meteorological Observations At Urban Sites|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/IOM-81/IOM-81-UrbanMetObs.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2013|series=Instruments and Observing Methods|volume=81|year=2006|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|pages=19–26|chapter=3.5 Wind speed and direction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capacitor voltage transformer''' (CVT or CCVT), is a [[transformer]] used in [[power systems]] to step down [[extra high voltage]] signals and provide a [[low voltage]] signal, for metering or operating a [[protective relay]].

==Components==
In its most basic form, the device consists of three parts: two [[capacitor]]s across which the transmission line signal is split, an [[inductor|inductive element]] to tune the device to the line frequency, and a [[voltage transformer]] to isolate and further step down the voltage for metering devices or protective relay.

The tuning of the divider to the line frequency makes the overall division ratio less sensitive to changes in the burden of the connected metering or protection devices.&lt;ref&gt;T. Davies ''Protection of industrial power systems second edition'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996 {{ISBN|0-7506-2662-3}} page 55&lt;/ref&gt; The device has at least four terminals: a terminal for connection to the high voltage signal, a ground terminal, and two secondary terminals which connect to the instrumentation or protective relay.

Capacitor C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is often constructed as a stack of smaller capacitors connected in series. This provides a large voltage drop across C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a relatively small voltage drop across C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As the majority of the voltage drop is on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, this reduces the required insulation level of the voltage transformer. This makes CVTs more economical than the wound voltage transformers under high voltage (over 100{{nbsp}}kV), as the latter one requires more winding and materials.

==Other applications==
The CVT is also useful in communication systems. CVTs in combination with wave traps are used for filtering high-frequency communication signals from power frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley H. Horowitz, Arun G. Phadke ''Power system relaying third edition'', John Wiley and Sons, 2008 {{ISBN|0-470-05712-2}} pages 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; This forms a [[Power line carrier communication|carrier communication network]] throughout the transmission network, to communicate between substations. The CVT is installed at a point after [[Lightning arrester|Lightning Arrester]] and before [[High frequency line trap|Wave trap]].

{{Chemical engineering}}
In a [[Process (science)|scientific]] sense, a '''chemical process''' is a method or means of somehow changing one or more [[chemical]]s or [[chemical compound]]s. Such a chemical process can occur by itself or be caused by an outside force, and involves a [[chemical reaction]] of some sort. In an "[[Process (engineering)|engineering]]" sense, a chemical process is a method intended to be used in [[manufacturing]] or on an industrial scale (see [[Industrial process]]) to change the composition of chemical(s) or material(s), usually using technology similar or related to that used in [[chemical plant]]s or the [[chemical industry]].  

Neither of these definitions are exact in the sense that one can always tell definitively what is a chemical process and what is not; they are practical definitions.  There is also significant overlap in these two definition variations.   Because of the inexactness of the definition, chemists and other scientists use the term "chemical process" only in a general sense or in the engineering sense.  However, in the "process (engineering)" sense, the term "chemical process" is used extensively.  The rest of the article will cover the engineering type of chemical process.  

Although this type of chemical process may sometimes involve only one step, often multiple steps, referred to as [[unit operation]]s, are involved.  In a [[Factory|plant]],   each of the unit operations commonly occur in individual vessels or sections of the plant called '''units'''.  Often, one or more [[chemical reaction]]s are involved, but other ways of changing chemical (or material) composition may be used, such as [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]] or [[separation process]]es.  The process steps may be sequential in time or sequential in space along a stream of flowing or moving material; see [[Chemical plant#Continuous and batch operation|Chemical plant]].  For a given amount of a feed (input) material or product (output) material, an expected amount of material can be determined at key steps in the process from empirical data and material balance calculations.  These amounts can be scaled up or down to suit the desired capacity or operation of a particular chemical plant built for such a process.  More than one chemical plant may use the same chemical process, each plant perhaps at differently scaled capacities.  
Chemical processes like [[distillation]] and [[crystallization]] go back to [[alchemy]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].

Such chemical processes can be illustrated generally as '''[[Block diagram|block flow diagram]]s''' or in more detail as '''[[process flow diagram]]s'''.  Block flow diagrams show the units as blocks and the streams flowing between them as connecting lines with arrowheads to show direction of flow.   

In addition to chemical plants for producing chemicals, chemical processes with similar technology and equipment are also used in [[Oil refinery|oil refining]] and other [[Refining|refineries]], [[natural gas processing]], [[polymer]] and [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturing, [[food processing]], and [[water]] and [[wastewater treatment]].

==Unit processing in chemical process==
'''Unit processing''' is the basic processing in [[chemical engineering]].  Together with [[unit operation]]s it forms the main principle of the varied chemical industries.  Each genre of unit processing follows the same chemical law much as each genre of [[unit operation]]s follows the same physical law.

Chemical engineering unit processing consists of the following important processes:

*[[Oxidation]]
*[[Redox|Reduction]]
*[[Hydrogenation]]
*[[Dehydrogenation]]
*[[Hydrolysis]]
*[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]]
*[[Dehydration reaction|Dehydration]]
*[[Halogenation]]
*[[Nitrification]]
*[[Sulfonation]]
*[[Ammoniation]]
*[[Alkaline fusion]]
*[[Alkylation]]
*[[Dealkylation]]
*[[Esterification]]
*[[Polymerization]]
*[[Polycondensation]]
*[[Catalysis]]

The '''combustion tap-off cycle''' is a power cycle of a [[bipropellant rocket]] [[rocket engine|engine]]. The cycle routes hot gases from the main [[combustion chamber]] of the rocket engine and routes them through engine [[turbopump]] turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted. Since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine. The cycle is comparable to a [[gas-generator cycle]] engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner.&lt;ref name="gsLRPE"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sutton|first1=George|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|date=November 2005|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics|isbn=978-1563476495}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[J-2S]] rocket engine, a cancelled engine developed by NASA, used the combustion tap-off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969.&lt;ref name="j-2sTest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/874400.pdf|title=Altitude Developmental Testing of the J-2S Rocket Engine|website=Defense Technical Information Center|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, [[Blue Origin]], with their [[New Shepard]] launch vehicle, had successfully [[Flight test|flight-tested]] the [[BE-3]] engine using a tap-off cycle. According to Blue Origin, the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity, with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process. However, engine startup is more complicated, and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps, the turbine must be built to withstand higher-than-normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="awst20131209"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Guy|title=Blue Origin Tests New Engine|url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/blue-origin-tests-new-engine|website=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|publisher=Penton|accessdate=3 February 2016|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the upper-stage variant of the BE-3, the [[BE-3U]], uses an [[expander cycle]] to power the turbopump, and will be used on the upper stage of the [[New Glenn]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=blue20180810&gt;[https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1028017095643209728 BE-3 test update], Blue Origin, 10 August 2018, accessed  15 August 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CPR technicians working.jpg|thumb|right|Laptop technicians working at stations (2000). Tagged repairs in process can be seen on lower shelves at left, and service parts in labeled boxes seen above them.]]
A '''computer repair technician''' is a person who repairs and maintains [[computer]]s and [[Server (computing)|servers]]. The [[technician]]'s responsibilities may extend to include building or configuring new [[computer hardware|hardware]], installing and updating [[computer software|software]] packages, and creating and maintaining [[computer network]]s.

==Overview==
Computer  technicians work in a variety of settings, encompassing both the [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s. Because of the relatively brief existence of the profession, institutions offer certificate and degree programs designed to prepare new technicians, but computer repairs are frequently performed by experienced and [[Professional certification (Computer technology)|certified]] technicians who have little formal training in the field like private sectors &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos268.htm Computer Support Specialists and Systems Administrators], Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, ''Occupational Outlook Handbook'', 2006-07 Edition, August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A repair technician might work in a corporate [[information technology]] department, a central service center, or a retail computer sales environment. A public sector technician might work in the military, national security or law enforcement communities, health or public safety field, or an educational institution. Despite the vast variety of work environments, all computer technicians perform similar physical and investigative processes, including [[technical support]]. Experienced technicians might specialize in fields such as [[data recovery]], [[System administrator|system administration]], or [[Information Systems Technician|information systems]]. Some technicians are self-employed or own a firm that provides services in a regional area. Some are subcontracted as [[freelancer]]s or [[Information technology consulting|consultants]]. This type of technician ranges from hobbyists and enthusiasts to those who work professionally in the field.

Computer malfunctions can range from a minor setting that is incorrect, to [[spyware]], [[Computer virus|viruses]], and as far as replacing hardware and an entire [[operating system]]. Some technicians provide on-site services, usually at an hourly rate. Others can provide services off-site, where the client can drop their computers and other devices off at the repair shop. Some have pickup and drop off services for convenience. Some technicians may also take back old equipment for [[computer recycling|recycling]] (In the EU, this is required under [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|WEEE]] rules).

==Hardware repair==
While computer hardware configurations vary widely, a "Computer OEM &amp; Repair" technician will work with five general categories of hardware; [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[computer cluster]]s and [[smartphone]]s / [[mobile computing]]. Technicians also work with and occasionally repair a range of [[peripheral]]s, including [[input device]]s (like [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]], [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[Image scanner|scanners]]), [[output device]]s (like [[Display device|displays]], [[Computer printer|printers]], and [[Loudspeaker|speakers]]), and [[data storage device]]s such as internal and external [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] and disk arrays. Technicians involved in system administration might also work with [[networking hardware]], including [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network switch|switches]], [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optics]], and [[wireless network]]s.
OEM= Original Equipment Manufacturer.

==Software repair==
When possible, repair technicians protect the computer user's data and settings, so that, after repair, the user will not have lost any data and can fully use the device with little interruption. Addressing the issue, the technician could take action as minor as adjusting one or several settings or preferences, but could also apply more involved techniques like installing, uninstalling, or reinstalling various software packages.

A reliable, but somewhat more complicated procedure for addressing software issues is known as a restore (also referred to as imaging, and/or reimaging), in which the computer's original installation image (including operating system and original applications) is reapplied to a [[Disk formatting|formatted]] hard drive. Anything unique such as settings or personal files will be destroyed if not backed up on external media, as this reverts everything back to its original unused state. The computer technician can only reimage if there is an image of the hard drive for that computer either in a separate partition or stored elsewhere.

On a [[Microsoft Windows]] system, if there is a restore point that was saved (normally saved on the hard drive of the computer) then the [[Windows Registry]] can be restored to that point, sometimes solving problems that have arisen after the time the restore point was created.

==License==
In [[Texas]], computer companies and professionals are required to have [[private investigator]]s’ licenses if they access computer data for purposes other than diagnosis or repair. Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1702 section 104, subsection 4(b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCCUPATIONS RELATED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/OC/htm/OC.1702.htm|publisher=Texas Constitution and Statutes|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyber electronic warfare''' ('''cyber EW''') is a form of [[electronic warfare]]. Cyber EW is any military action involving the use of [[electromagnetic energy]] to control the domain characterized by the use of [[electronics]] and the electromagnetic spectrum to use exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.

Cyber EW consists of the following three activities:  cyber electronic attack (cyber EA), cyber electronic protection (cyber EP), and cyber electronic warfare support (cyber ES).  These three activities are defined as follows:
;Cyber electronic attack (cyber EA): Is the use of electromagnetic energy to attack an adversary’s electronics or access to the electromagnetic spectrum with the intent of destroying an enemy’s ability to use data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.
;Cyber electronic protection (cyber EP): Is any means taken to protect electronics from any effects of friendly or enemy employment of cyber EW that destroys ability to use data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.
;Cyber electronic warfare support (cyber ES): Is any action to locate sources of electromagnetic energy from networked systems for the purpose of immediate threat recognition or conduct of future operations.

'''Docter Optics''' is a [[Germany|German]] manufacturer of quality sports optics, including [[binoculars]], [[rifle scope]]s, [[spotting scope]]s, [[red dot sight]]s, [[flashlight]]s and [[reading glasses]]. Its headquarters are in [[Eisfeld]], Thuringia, [[Germany]], where most of the products are developed and manufactured. Docter is part of the [[Analytik Jena]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docter-germany.com/ Docter company website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Binoculars#Military}}
The company grew out of binocular production by the forerunner of [[Carl Zeiss AG]] before World War Two. In 1952 a part of the company [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] Carl Zeiss Jena was established in Eisfeld in what was then [[East Germany]]. Starting from tasks as supplier of parts and pre-assembling products for the Zeiss factories in Jena the company continuously developed over the following years to become a producer of precision-engineered optical consumer goods and industrial products.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;[http://www.docter-germany.com/ Docter Company and Product History]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides that VEB Carl Zeiss Jena produced military optics for the armed forces of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) like the [[National People's Army|NVA]] DF 7x40 and NVA EDF 7x40 [[roof prism]] [[binoculars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holgermerlitz.de/kronos8x40.html Review: NVA DF 7x40 vs. BPO 7x30 vs. Kronos BPWC 8x40 by Holger Merlitz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.arcor.de/thuernagel/df.htm Das Doppelfernrohr DF 7x40 {{icon de}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holgermerlitz.de/edf7x40.html Review: NVA EDF 7x40 vs. KOMZ BPO 7x30 vs. Hensoldt DF 8x30 by Holger Merlitz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.arcor.de/thuernagel/edf.htm Das Das Einheitsdoppelfernrohr EDF {{icon de}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the [[German reunification]], the Eisfeld plant of the Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, which employed 550 staff, was taken over by Bernhard Docter, who lent his name to the company and products. The company now traded under the name Docter-Optic-Eisfeld GmbH and continued with the production of binoculars, riflescopes, spotting scopes, magnifying glasses and opto-electronic measurement equipment. The company Docter-Optic in Wetzlar declared bankruptcy for the whole business on 15 November 1995.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;[http://www.docter-germany.com/ Docter Company and Product History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.arcor.de/thuernagel/czj.htm Der VEB Carl Zeiss Jena {{icon de}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1997 a part of the business with 40 staff was continued by Analytik Jena GmbH, to which traditionally good relations existed. Already the first year after the takeover was completed with very good turnover and results. By 2006 Docter Optics employed 100 staff.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;[http://www.docter-germany.com/ Docter Company and Product History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elements Software''', formerly known as Helveta, is a [[supply chain management software]] company based in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]]. With revenues of £2.1 million in 2010, it has been recognized for its work in [[forestry]] conservation, specifically [[illegal logging]] prevention.

==History==
Patrick Newton founded Helveta in Abingdon, Oxfordshire in 2004. The company developed supply-chain management software Control Intelligence (CI) World to allow customers to track assets. Supported industries include [[biofuel]], [[food processing]], and forestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Company Overview of Helveta Ltd.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=9709065|accessdate=2015-08-30|work=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Helveta's revenues reached £2.1 million.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt;

In 2008, the Forest Development Authority hired Helveta and SGS, an inspection firm, to develop a technology [[barcode]] scanning system to track lumber in [[Liberia]], where the [[United Nations]] banned the logging trade in 2003.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Protected by bars|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10804107|accessdate=2015-08-30|work=The Economist|date=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helveta also earned clients in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henley|first1=Will|title=Tracking timber: could new technology help clean up the supply chain?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/tracking-timber-new-technology-supply-chain|accessdate=2015-08-30|work=The Guardian|date=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cameroon]], where a similar project ran from 2008 to 2011. The Cameroon project met many of its goals but failed to secure a long-term commitment in part due to changing government authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Jerome|last2=Nkuintchua|first2=Teodyl|title=Accessible technologies and FPIC: independent monitoring with forest communities in Cameroon|date=2012|publisher=International Institute for Education and Development|pages=152–163|url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/14618IIED.pdf#page=153|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[http://www.ewb-international.com Engineers Without Borders International] (EWB-I)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewb-international.com|title=EWB International {{!}} Engineers Without Borders International|website=EWB International|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an association of individual [[Engineers Without Borders]]/Ingenieurs Sans Frontieres groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewb-international.com/countries/south-africa/ http://ewb-international.com/countries/]&lt;/ref&gt;.  EWB-I facilitates collaboration and the exchange of information among the member groups. EWB-I helps its member groups develop their capacity to assist underserved communities in their respective countries and around the world.

==Organizational structure==
EWB-I is a virtual organization with staff located in both the United States and South Africa.  EWB-I is run by an international board, composed of representatives of the EWB/ISF groups.

The member groups of EWB-I support the association’s vision for ''“A sustainable world where engineering enables long-term positive social and global development for the benefit of people and the environment everywhere.”''  EWB-I seeks to promote collaboration so that collectively we can achieve more than the sum of our parts and fulfill our mission “To be the beating heart of the engineering movement for sustainable global development, building and evolving engineering capacity throughout the world.

==Projects==
Projects conducted by individual EWB/ISF member groups are [[grassroots]] and small and are not usually addressed by in-country consulting firms. Through their work and projects, EWB-I member groups contribute to meeting the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;(MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300|title=Sustainable Development Goals .:.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11073">'''Example-centric programming''' is an approach to [[software development]] that helps the user to create software by locating and modifying small examples into a larger whole. That approach can be helped by tools that allow an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) to show code examples or [[API]] documentation related to coding behaviors occurring in the IDE. “Borrow” tactics are often employed from online sources, by programmers leaving the IDE to troubleshoot.&lt;ref name="blueprint"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scaffidi|first1=Christopher|last2=Brandt|first2=Joel|last3=Burnett|first3=Margaret|author3-link=Margaret Burnett|last4=Dove|first4=Andrew|last5=Myers|first5=Brad|title=SIG: end-user programming|journal=CHI '12 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2012|pages=1193–1996|doi=10.1145/2212776.2212421|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2212776.2212421&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=597181533&amp;CFTOKEN=26959364}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The purpose of example-centric programming is to reduce the time spent by developers searching online. Ideally, in example-centric programming, the [[user interface]] integrates with help module examples for assistance without programmers leaving the IDE. The idea for this type of “instant documentation” is to reduce programming interruptions.&lt;ref name="redprint"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhardwaj|first1=Anant|last2=Luciano|first2=Date|last3=Klemmer|first3=Scott|title=Redprint: integrating API specific "instant example" and "instant documentation" display interface in IDEs|journal=Proceedings of the 24th annual ACM symposium adjunct on User interface software and technology|date=2011|pages=21–22|doi=10.1145/2046396.2046408|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of this feature is not limited to experts, as some novices reap the benefits of an integrated knowledge base, without resorting to frequent web searches or browsing.&lt;ref name="blueprint" /&gt;

==Background==
The growth of the web has fundamentally changed the way software is built. Vast increase in information resources and the democratization of access and distribution are main factors in the development of example-centric programming for [[end-user development]]. Tutorials are available on the web in seconds thus broadening the space of who writes it: designers, scientists, or hobbyists. By 2012 13 million program as a part of their job, yet only three million of those are actual professional programmers.
Prevalence of online code repositories, documentation, blogs and forums—enables programmers to build applications iteratively searching for, modifying, and combining examples.

Using the web is integral to an opportunistic approach to programming when focusing on speed and ease of development over code robustness and maintainability. There is a widespread use of the web by programmers, novices and experts alike, to [[software prototyping|prototype]], ideate, and discover.&lt;ref name="original"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Joel|last2=Guo|first2=Philip|last3=Lewenstein|first3=Joel|last4=Dontcheva|first4=Mira|last5=Klemmer|first5=Scott|title=Two studies of opportunistic programming: interleaving web foraging, learning, and writing code|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2009|pages=1589–1598|doi=10.1145/1518701.1518944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop software quickly programmers often mash up various existing systems. As part of this process, programmers must often search for suitable components and learn new skills, thus they began using the web for this purpose.

When developing software programmers spend 19% of their programming time on the web.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; Individuals use the web to accomplish several different kinds of activities. The intentions behind web use vary in form and time spent. Programmers spend most of the time learning a new concept, the least time is spent reminding themselves of details of a concept they already know, and in between they use the web to clarify their existing knowledge.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt;

Example-centric programming tries to solve the issue of having to get out of the development environment to look for references and examples while programming. For instance, traditionally, to find API documentation and sample code, programmers will either visit the language reference website of they go to search engines and make API specific queries.&lt;ref name="redprint" /&gt; When trying to learn something new, programmers use [[Tutorial#Internet|web tutorials]] for just-in-time learning. Additionally, programmers deliberately choose not to remember complicated syntax and instead use the web as an external memory that can be accessed when needed.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Some of the benefits of example-centric programming include:
*Prevention of usage errors &lt;ref name=codelets&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oney|first1=Stephen|last2=Brandt|first2=Joel|title=Codelets: linking interactive documentation and example code in the editor|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2012|pages=2697–2706|doi=10.1145/2207676.2208664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codex&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fast|first1=Ethan|last2=Steffee|first2=Daniel|last3=Wang|first3=Lucy|last4=Brandt|first4=Joel|last5=Bernstein|first5=Michael|title=Emergent, crowd-scale programming practice in the IDE|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2014|pages=2491–2500|doi=10.1145/2556288.2556998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction of time searching for code examples &lt;ref name="blueprint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="redprint" /&gt;
*Reduction of time searching for API documentation &lt;ref name="redprint" /&gt;
*Clarification of existing knowledge and reminding of forgotten details &lt;ref name="blueprint" /&gt;

==Emergent programming==
{{see also|Emergence}}
Emergence can be defined as a process whereby larger entities, patterns, and regularities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties. The extensive amount of code publicly available on the web can be used to find this type of patterns and regularities. By modeling how developers use programming languages in practices, algorithms for finding common idioms and detecting unlikely code can be created.&lt;ref name="codex" /&gt;

This process is limited to the amount of code that programmers are willing and able to share. Because people write more code than they share online there is a lot of duplicated effort. To fully use the power of the crowd, the effort required to publish code online should be reduced.&lt;ref name=ditty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lieber|first1=Thomas|last2=Miller|first2=Rob|title=Programming with everybody: tightening the copy-modify-publish feedback loop|journal=Adjunct proceedings of the 25th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology|pages=101–102|doi=10.1145/2380296.2380342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
;Blueprint &lt;ref name="blueprint" /&gt;
Blueprint is a plugin for [[Adobe Flash Builder]] that automatically augments queries with code context, presents a code-centric view of search results, embeds the search experience into the editor, and retains a link between copied code and its source. It is designed to help programmers with web searches and allow them to easily remember forgotten details and clarify existing knowledge.

It displays results from a varied set of web pages enabling users to browse and evaluate search results rapidly.

Blueprint is task-specific, meaning that it will specifically search for examples in the programming language.

;Redprint &lt;ref name="redprint" /&gt;
Redprint is a browser-based development environment for [[PHP]] that integrates API specific "instant example" and "instant documentation" display interfaces. The prototype IDE was developed by [[Anant Bhardwaj]], then at [[Stanford University]] on the premise that task-specific example interfaces leave programmers having to understand the example code that has been found, and thus Redprint also includes an API specific search interface.&lt;ref name="redprint"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhardwaj|first1=Anant|last2=Luciano|first2=Date|last3=Klemmer|first3=Scott|title=Redprint: integrating API specific "instant example" and "instant documentation" display interface in IDEs|journal=Proceedings of the 24th annual ACM symposium adjunct on User interface software and technology|date=2011|pages=21–22|doi=10.1145/2046396.2046408|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2046408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The API specific search interface searches for relevant API specific examples and documentation.

;Codex &lt;ref name="codex" /&gt;
Codex is a knowledge base that records common practices for [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Uses [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] data from developers and searches all code, looking for patterns, that way if someone is coding in a strange way, Codex lets them know that they are doing something wrong.

Codex uses statistical linting to find poorly written code, or code which is syntactically different from well written code, and warn the user, pattern annotation to automatically discover common programming idioms and annotate them with metadata using crowdsourcing, and library generation to construct a utility package that encapsulates emergent software practice.

;Codelets&lt;ref name=codelets/&gt;
A codelet is a block of example code an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example.

;Bing Code Search &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shiban|first1=Ala|title=Introducing Bing Code Search for C#|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2014/02/17/introducing-bing-code-search-for-c.aspx|website=blogs.msdn.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bing Code Search is an extension to [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] developed by a team made of people from Visual Studio, Bing and Microsoft Research that allows developers to search code examples and documentation from [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] directly from [[IntelliSense]].

Bing Code Search gathers its code samples from MSDN, StackOverflow, Dotnetperls and CSharp411.

;Codota 
Codota helps developers find typical [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code examples by analyzing millions of code snippets available on sites such as [[GitHub]] and [[StackOverflow]]. Codota ranks these examples by criteria such as commonality of the coding patterns, credibility of the origin and clarity of the code.
The Codota plugin for the [[IntelliJ IDEA]] and [[Android Studio]] IDEs allows developers to get code examples for using Java and android APIs without having to leave their editor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7514">'''Fixes that fail''' is a [[system archetype]] that in [[system dynamics]] is used to describe and analyze a situation, where a fix effective in the short-term creates [[unintended consequence|side effects]] for the long-term behaviour of the [[system]] and may result in the need of even more fixes.&lt;ref name="5th"&gt;Senge, Peter M., "The Fifth Discipline" (1990). {{ISBN|0-385-26095-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This archetype may be also known as fixes that backfire&lt;ref name=pegas&gt;[http://www.pegasuscom.com/course_preview/module6/6-05-0-0-fixes.htm Fixes that backfire] Isee systems, 2006. Retrieved 2011-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; or corrective actions that fail.&lt;ref name="re5"&gt;Flood, Robert L., "Rethinking The Fifth Discipline: learning within the unknowable" (1999). {{ISBN|0-203-02855-4}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; It resembles the [[System Archetypes#Shifting the burden|Shifting the burden]] archetype.&lt;ref name="braun"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Braun |first= William |title= System archetypes |year= 2002 |url=http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/~gossimit/pap/sd/wb_sysarch.pdf |format=pdf|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In a "fixes that fail" scenario the encounter of a problem is faced by a corrective action or fix that seems to solve the issue. However, this action leads to some unforeseen consequences. They form then a [[feedback]] loop that either worsens the original problem or creates a related one.&lt;ref name="pegas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="re5" /&gt;
[[File:ftf.jpg|none|framed|'''Fig. 1: Causal loop diagram''']]

In [[system dynamics]] this is described by a [[causal loop diagram|circles of causality]] (Fig. 1) as a system consisting of two [[feedback]] loops. One is the [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]] loop B1 of the corrective action, the second is the [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] loop R2 of the unintended consequences. These influence the problem with a delay and therefore make it difficult to recognize the source of the new rise of the problem.&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;

Representation of the long-term disadvantages of the scenario can be seen on Fig. 2. Although the symptoms go through a decrease when fixes are applied, the overall crisis threshold rises.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kim&gt;Kim, Daniel H., "Fixes that Fail: Why Faster is Slower," ''The Systems Thinker Newsletter,'' Vol. 10, No. 3 (Apr., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:ftfgraph.png|none|framed|'''Fig. 2: Behavior over time''']]

A representation with a [[stock and flow]] diagram of this [[archetype]] is on Fig. 3.
[[File:Ftfstockflow.png|none|framed|'''Fig. 3: Stock and flow diagram''']]
The fix influences the number of problems present in the system proportionally to the fix factor and the problems to be resolved. When activated by the action variable, the fix lowers the problems, thus creating a balancing loop. However, each fix also starts a delayed consequence which adds to the problems proportionally to the consequence factor and the fix applied. Combined, these create a growing number of problems to be dealt with.

== Uses ==
As an archetype, it helps to gain insight into patterns that are present in the system and thereby also give the tools to change these patterns. In the case of "Fixes that fail", the warning sign is a problem which reappears although fixes were applied. It is crucial to recognize that the fix only adds to the overall deteriorating state and does not solve the problem. To identify this pattern, it is needed to consider a connection between the symptoms and the fixes we apply to solve them, which can be very difficult to do.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt; In management this can be present as a "hero-scapegoat" cycle. While the manager who applied the fix gets promoted for diminishing the problem. A new manager must face the returning problem symptom and may be punished for failing to do his job. Then a new hero is found who temporarily solves the problem symptoms. The delay of the reinforcing loop makes it difficult to recognize the causal relation between the fix applied to the symptoms and the new problems arising. What then seems to be a series of successes in short-term then are steps towards failure on the long-term.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

Some typical ways of thinking associated with the pattern are:
* "It always seemed to work before; why isn't it working now?"&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
* "This is a simple problem and the solution is straightforward."&lt;ref name=syswiki&gt;[http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Fixes_that_Fail Fixes That Fail Archetype] SystemsWiki, October 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;
* "We need to fix this problem now. We can deal with any consequences later." &lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
They can serve as a warning that this archetype is present or will be. 

If this pattern is recognized, then there are multiple possibilities how to react, depending on which [[lever]]age point is addressed:
* Focus on the long-term and if a fix is inevitably needed, use it only to buy time to work on the long-term remedy.&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
* Raise awareness of the unintended consequences of the fixes.
* Focus on the underlying problem and not the symptoms.
* Find either a fix without consequences or with limited long-term impact.&lt;ref name="pegas" /&gt;
* Find a way to measure the intended and also unintended consequences of the solutions by learning also from the past fixes.&lt;ref name="braun" /&gt;
* Change the performance review time so that the long-term progress becomes visible.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt;

== Examples ==
A few common examples of the pattern. The situation describes always the starting point to which a fix is applied. This bears then the consequences which are confronted again with a new fix.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Maximizing ROR'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
:'''Situation''': A manufacturing company becomes successful with high-performance parts, and its CEO wants to maximize the [[Rate of return|ROR]].
:'''Fix''': Refusal of investment in expensive, new production machines.
:'''Consequences''': The product quality drops and therefore the sales of it.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Cutting back maintenance'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="5th" /&gt;
: '''Situation''': The company needs to [[saving|save]] money.
: '''Fix''': Decrease the amount of [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].
: '''Consequences''': More breakdowns of the equipment, higher costs and cost-cutting pressure.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Quest for water'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': Farmers are confronted with water shortage.
: '''Fix''': Drilling new wells or making the old ones deeper.
: '''Consequences''': The [[water table]] drops.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Cash shortage'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=kim /&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': A person can't pay [[interest]] (for example on a [[credit card]]).
: '''Fix''': Take up a new [[loan]] to pay the interest (a new credit card).
: '''Consequences''': There is more interest to pay next time.

* &lt;big&gt;'''Tax revenue shortage'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name=syswiki /&gt;
: '''Situation''': A government is not satisfied with its [[tax revenue]]s.
: '''Fix''': Increase the cigarette tax to raise more taxes.
: '''Consequences''': Smuggling of cigarettes develops and reduces the number of taxed cigarettes sold in the country.

The '''FreePBX Distro''' is a [[freeware]] [[unified communications]] software system that consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring, controlling, and managing [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk PBX]] software. The FreePBX Distro includes packages that offer VoIP, PBX, Fax,IVR, voice-mail and email functions.

The FreePBX Distro [[Linux distribution]] is based on [[CentOS]], which maintains binary compatibility with [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]. FreePBX has contributed to the popularity of Asterisk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449332426/WebInterface.html Web Interface]; O'Reilly&lt;/ref&gt;

== Installation ==
The Official FreePBX Distro is installed from a CD-ROM image available by web download, that includes the system [[CentOS]], [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]], [[FreePBX]] GUI and assorted dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmcnet.com/tmc/videos/default.aspx?vid=7511 Video 7511]; [[TMC.net]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for telephony hardware ==
The FreePBX Distro has built in support for cards from multiple vendors, including [[Digium]], OpenVox, Alto, Rhino Equipment, [[Xorcom]] and Sangoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepbx.org/news/2012-12-27/beta-2-upcoming-training-new-website ''beta 2 announcement'']; December 12, 2012 article; [[FreePBX]]; retrieved December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FPB159"&gt;[http://www.the159.com/endpointman/tut.html The 159]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis as a drug]] and industrial hemp both derive from the species ''Cannabis sativa'' and contain the [[psychoactive]] component [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), they are distinct [[strain (biology)|strains]] with unique [[phytochemistry|phytochemical]] compositions and uses.{{sfn|Swanson|2015|p=602}} Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects.{{sfn|Swanson|2015|p=602}} The [[legality of cannabis|legality of industrial hemp]] varies widely between countries. Some governments regulate the concentration of THC and permit only hemp that is bred with an especially low THC content.&lt;ref name="Talbot2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Talbot|first=Geoff|title=Specialty Oils and Fats in Food and Nutrition: Properties, Processing and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGyZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39|date= 2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-78242-397-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crime2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crime|first=United Nations Office on Drugs and|title=Recommended Methods for the Identification and Analysis of Cannabis and Cannabis Products: Manual for Use by National Drug Testing Laboratories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLR3bFaUZj0C&amp;pg=PA12|year=2009|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-148242-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{further|Etymology of cannabis}}

The etymology is uncertain but there appears to be no common [[Proto-Indo-European]] source for the various forms of the word; the Greek term ''{{lang|grc|kánnabis}}'' is the oldest attested form, which may have been borrowed from an earlier [[Scythian]] or [[Thracian]] word.&lt;ref name=EncycIndoEU&gt;{{citation| first=JP|last=Mallory| title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture| editors=JP Mallory and DQ Adams|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis| page=266| edition=Illustrated| location=London, UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Encyclopedia%20of%20Indo-European%20Culture&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q=hemp&amp;f=true| isbn=9781884964985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=DQ|last=Adams|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|editors=JP Mallory and DQ Adams| year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=166|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lzilBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=oxford+dictionary+indo-european| isbn=9780191058127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it appears to have been borrowed into Latin, and separately into Slavic and from there into Baltic, Finnish, and [[Germanic language]]s.&lt;ref name=BarberPhrehistoricTextiles&gt;{{citation| first=EJW|last=Barber| title=Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=36–38|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;vq=hemp|isbn=9780691002248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Grimm's law]], the "k" would have changed to "h" with the first Germanic sound shift,&lt;ref name=EncycIndoEU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first1=Patrick| last1=McConvell| first2=Michael| last2=Smith| editor=Henning Andersen| chapter=Millers and Mullers: The archaeo-linguisitic stratigraphy of technological change in holocene Australia|page=181|title=Language Contacts in Prehistory: Studies in Stratigraphy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing| year=2003| isbn=9781588113795| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuAIyYdrHJQC&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it may have been adapted into the Old English form, ''{{lang|ags|hænep}}''. However, this theory assumes that hemp was not widely spread among different societies until after it was already being used as a psychoactive drug, which Adams and Mallory (1997) believe to be unlikely based on archaeological evidence.&lt;ref name=EncycIndoEU/&gt; [[Elizabeth Wayland Barber|Barber]] (1991) however, argued that the spread of the name "kannabis" was due to its historically more recent drug use, starting from the south, around Iran, whereas non-THC varieties of hemp are older and prehistoric.&lt;ref name=BarberPhrehistoricTextiles /&gt; Another possible source of origin is Assyrian ''qunnabu'', which was the name for a source of oil, fiber, and medicine in the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref name=BarberPhrehistoricTextiles /&gt;

[[Cognates]] of hemp in other Germanic languages include Dutch ''hennep'', Danish and Norwegian ''hamp'', German ''Hanf'', and Swedish ''hampa''.&lt;ref name=EncycIndoEU/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Hemp bunch-dried out -seeds close up PNr°0063.jpg|thumb|Hemp seed]]

Hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, and biofuel.&lt;ref name=Keller/&gt; The [[bast fiber]]s can be used to make textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other fibers, such as [[flax]], cotton or silk, as well as virgin and recycled polyester, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding and litter. When [[oxidize]]d (often erroneously referred to as "drying"), [[hemp oil]] from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_culture2.shtml | title=Erowid Cannabis Vault : Culture #2|publisher=erowid.org | accessdate=2008-06-20 }}{{better source|date=May 2016|reason=Questionable source—low-quality website that doesn't publish its editorial policy and doesn't have a reputation for fact-checking or accuracy (WP:QS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the [[European Union]] was used in animal and bird feed.&lt;ref name="michael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a902981619~frm=titlelink |title=Michael Karus: European Hemp Industry 2002 Cultivation, Processing and Product Lines.

'''Hemp seeds''' can be eaten raw, ground into hemp meal, [[sprouting|sprouted]] or made into dried sprout powder. The leaves of the hemp plant can be consumed raw in salads.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hemp seeds can also be made into a liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as [[hemp milk]], [[hemp juice]], and [[tea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America's First Hemp Drink - Chronic Ice - Making a Splash in the Natural Beverage Market |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/06/08/prweb8548278.DTL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227105313/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fg%2Fa%2F2011%2F06%2F08%2Fprweb8548278.DTL |archivedate=27 December 2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=8 June 2011 |agency=[[Vocus (software)|Vocus]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hempseed oil|Hemp oil]] is [[cold-pressed]] from the seed and is high in [[unsaturated fatty acids]].&lt;ref name="ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/328226/ages001eh_1_.pdf |format=PDF|title=USDA ERS - Industrial Hemp in the United States: Status and Market Potential |publisher=Ers.usda.gov |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Storage====
[[Hemp oil]] oxidizes and turns [[Rancidification|rancid]] within a short period of time if not stored properly;&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt;  its shelf life is extended when it is stored in a dark airtight container and refrigerated.

===Fiber===
Hemp fiber has been used extensively throughout history, with production climaxing soon after being introduced to the New World. For centuries, items ranging from rope, to fabrics, to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber. Hemp was also commonly used to make sail [[canvas]]. The word "canvas" is derived from the word ''cannabis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crrh.org/cannabis |title=CRRH, Archaeologists agree that cannabis was among the first crops cultivated by human beings at least over 6,000 years ago, and perhaps more than 12,000 years ago |publisher=Crrh.org |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=canvas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure hemp has a texture similar to [[linen]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Building material===
{{main|hempcrete}}

Concrete-like blocks made with hemp and lime have been used as an insulating material for construction. Such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements; they must be supported by a brick, wood, or steel frame.&lt;ref&gt;NNFCC. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-project-factsheet-guide-to-building-with-hemp-lime-composites-nnfcc-07-001 "NNFCC Project Factsheet: Guide to Building with Hemp-Lime Composites, NNFCC 07-001"], "[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]", Retrieved on 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, hemp fibres are extremely strong and durable, and have been shown to be usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs, including creating very durable and breathable homes. The most common use of hemp lime in building is by casting the hemp and lime mix while wet around a timber frame with temporary shuttering, and tamping the mix to form a firm mass; after the removal of the temporary shuttering, the solidified hemp mix is then ready to be plastered with a lime plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Build with Hemp?

A panellized system of hemp-lime panels for use in building construction is currently under test in a European Union-funded research collaboration led by the [[University of Bath]]. The panels are being designed to assure high-quality construction, rapid on-site erection, optimal hygrothermal performance from day one, and energy- and resource-efficient buildings. The 36-month-long work programme aims to refine product and manufacturing protocols, produce data for certification and marketing, warranty, insurance cover, and availability of finance. It also includes the development of markets in Britain, France, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEMPSEC project website|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/ace/research/cicm/hempsec/index.html|work=European Union research|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemp is used as an internal plaster and is a mixture of [[hemp hurd]] (shive) mixed with larger proportions of a lime-based binder. Hemp plaster has insulative qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Allin, Steve. ''Building with Hemp'', Seed Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9551109-1-7}}. (p. 95, 2nd Edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper===
{{Main|Hemp paper}}
Hemp paper are [[paper]] varieties consisting exclusively or to a large extent from [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] obtained from [[Hemp Fiber | fibers]] of [[industrial hemp]]. The products are mainly specialty papers such as [[cigarette paper]]&lt;ref name="Kraus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eiha.org/attach/10/05-02_EU-EIHA_e.pdf |title=Michael Karus:European hemp industry 2001 till 2004: Cultivation, raw materials, products and trends, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[banknotes]] and technical [[filter paper]]s&lt;ref name=filterpaper&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |chapter-url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 978-952-5216-18-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 114 |chapter= 5|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Compared to wood pulp, hemp pulp offers a four to five times longer fibre, a significantly lower [[lignin]] fraction as well as a higher tear resistance  and [[tensile strength]]. However, production costs are about four times higher than for paper from [[wood]]&lt;ref name="Gertjan"&gt;{{cite journal |

===Jewelry===
{{main|Hemp jewelry}}[[File:Hemp and Bead Jewelry, Oakland Chinatown Street Fair.jpg|thumb|Hemp and bead Jewelry]]

[[Hemp jewelry]] is the product of knotting hemp twine through the practice of [[macramé]]. Hemp jewellery includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches and other adornments. Some jewellery features beads made from crystals, [[glass]], [[stone]], [[wood]] and [[bone]]s. The hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors. There are many different [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es used to create hemp jewellery, however, the half knot and full knot stitches are most common.

=== Shoes ===
In recent years, hemp has been growing in popularity as a material used in shoes. Today you can find boots, athletic shoes, sandals, and dress shoes that are made with 100% hemp fiber, or textiles that blend hemp fibers with materials such as cotton, [[jute]], virgin [[polyester]], and recycled polyester. The strength of hemp fibers makes it an ideal material for shoes because it's durable. In addition, it's breathable and naturally antimicrobial, so it doesn't hold on to odors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uniguide.com/hemp-shoes-hemp-sandals-guide/|title=The Definitive Guide to Hemp Shoes|last=Stanton|first=Kristen M.|date=October 28, 2018|website=UniGuide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because hemp can be grown sustainably, shoes, clothing, and accessories made with hemp are representative of the [[sustainable fashion]] movement.

===Cordage===
[[File:Cordage en chanvre.jpg|thumb|left|Hemp rope]]

Hemp rope was used in the [[Age of Sail|age of sailing ships]], though the rope had to be protected by [[Tarring (rope)|tarring]], since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from [[Decomposition|rot]], as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior, while seeming dry from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

title=Our ropes are much stronger than we believe |
author=Schubert, Pit |
publisher=Union Internationale Des Associations D'Alpinisme }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname "[[Jack Tar]]". Hemp rope was phased out when Manila, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as [[Manila hemp]], but is not related to hemp; it is [[abacá]], a species of [[banana]].

===Animal bedding===
[[File:Hemp Straw.JPG|thumb|upright|Hemp straw animal bedding]]

Hemp shives are the core of the stem, hemp hurds are broken parts of the core. In the EU, they are used for animal bedding (horses, for instance), or for horticultural mulch.&lt;ref&gt;NNFCC. In the US, pet manufacturers use hemp in dog and cat bedding. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7199;isa=DBRow;op=show;dbview_id=2457 "Crop Factsheet: Hemp"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved on 2009-05-06&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial hemp is much more profitable if both fibers and shives (or even seeds) can be used.

===Water and soil purification===
Hemp can be used as a "mop crop" to clear impurities out of wastewater, such as sewage effluent, excessive phosphorus from chicken litter, or other unwanted substances or chemicals.  Additionally, hemp is being used to clean contaminants at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] site, by way of a process which is known as [[phytoremediation]]—the process of clearing radioisotopes and a variety of other toxins from the soil, water, and air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/botany/botany_map/articles/article_10.html |title=Phytoremediation: Using Plants to Clean Soil |publisher=Mhhe.com |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weed control===
{{Main|Weed control#Organic methods}}
Hemp crops are tall, have thick foliage, and can be planted densely, and thus can be grown as a [[smother crop]] to kill tough weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gametec.com/hemp/WEED.CTRL.htm
|title=Hemp As Weed Control
|publisher=gametec.com
|accessdate=2008-07-09
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, gain [[organic certification]], and gain the benefits of [[crop rotation]]. However, due to the plant's rapid and dense growth characteristics, some jurisdictions consider hemp a prohibited and noxious weed, much like [[Cytisus scoparius|Scotch Broom]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

&lt;gallery caption="" widths="220px" heights="150px"&gt;
File:Hanflabyrinth Berlin 2009 - 40.jpg|The dense growth of hemp helps kill weeds, even [[thistle]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Biofuels===
[[File:Biodiesel.JPG|thumb|upright|Biodiesel sample]]

[[Biodiesel]] can be made from the oils in hemp seeds and stalks; this product is sometimes called "hempoline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tv/cool-fuel/episode-sugarcane-hempoline.html | title=COOLFUEL Episode: Sugarcane and Hempoline | accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alcohol fuel]] (ethanol or, less commonly, methanol) can be made by fermenting the whole plant.

Filtered hemp oil can be used directly to power [[diesel engine]]s. In 1892, [[Rudolf Diesel]] invented the diesel engine, which he intended to power "by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed oils, which earlier were used for [[oil lamp]]s, i.e. the [[Argand lamp]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemp4fuel.com/ |title=Clean Energy Solutions |publisher=Hemp 4 Fuel |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/petvshemp.shtml |title=Pollution: Petrol vs. Hemp |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720175048/http://www.hempcar.org/petvshemp.shtml |archivedate=2006-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |title=Biofuels Facts |publisher=Hempcar.org |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520231032/http://hempcar.org/biofacts.shtml |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of vehicle fuel from hemp is very small. Commercial [[biodiesel]] and [[biogas]] is typically produced from cereals, coconuts, palmseeds and cheaper raw materials like garbage, wastewater, dead plant and animal material, animal [[feces]] and kitchen waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biogasmax.co.uk/media/d2_15_biogasmax_svab_v2_20100518final__078478600_0944_26012011.pdf|format=PDF|title=Increased biogas production at the Henriksdals Waste Water plant, Cajsa Hellstedt et. all, June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
Traditionally, hemp stalks would be water-[[Retting|retted]] first before the fibers were beaten off the inner [[Hemp hurds|hurd]] by hand, a process known as [[scutching]]. As mechanical technology evolved, separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers that would produce a nearly clean fiber. After the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937|Marijuana Tax Act]] was implemented in 1938, the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained "frozen in time".

Only in 1997, did Ireland, parts of the Commonwealth and other countries begin to legally grow [[industrial hemp]] again. Iterations of the 1930s [[decorticator]] have been met with limited success, along with steam explosion and chemical processing known as [[Pulp (paper)#Thermomechanical pulp|thermomechanical pulping]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Cultivation==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}

Hemp is usually planted between March and May in the northern hemisphere, between September and November in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green.net.au/gf/hemp_cultivation.htm Hemp Cultivation (www.green.net.au)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219132638/http://www.green.net.au/gf/hemp_cultivation.htm |date=February 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It matures in about three to four months.

Millennia of [[selective breeding]] have resulted in [[cultivar|varieties]] that display a wide range of traits; e.g. suited for a particular environments/latitudes, producing different ratios and compositions of terpenoids and cannabinoids (CBD, THC, CBG, CBC, CBN...etc.), fibre quality, oil/seed yield etc. Hemp grown for fiber is planted closely, resulting in tall, slender plants with long fibers.

Use of industrial hemp plant and its cultivation was commonplace until the 1900s, when it was associated with its genetic sibling aka Drug-Type Cannabis species (which contain higher levels of psychoactive THC). Influential groups misconstrued hemp as a dangerous 'drug', even though it is not a 'drug' and it has the potential to be a sustainable &amp; profitable alternative crop.

In the United States, the public's perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product,"&lt;ref name="luginbuhl.industrial.hemp"&gt;This paper begins with a history of hemp use and then describes how hemp was constructed as a dangerous crop in the U.S. The paper then discusses the potential of hemp as an alternative crop. {{cite book |author=Luginbuhl, April M. |chapter=Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L): The geography of a controversial plant |title=The California Geographer |volume=41 |pages=1–14 |year=2001 |publisher=California Geographical Society |chapterurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10211.2/2738 |url=http://scholarworks.csun.edu/handle/10211.2/2738 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-03-28 |quote= Hemp contains less than 1% THC, or tetrahydrocannabinols, the psychoactive property in marijuana.

The seeds are sown from mid-April to mid-May with grain drills to 4–6&amp;nbsp;cm sowing depth. Hemp needs less fertilizer than corn does. A total of 60–150&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen, 40–140&amp;nbsp;kg phosphorus (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and 75–200&amp;nbsp;kg of potassium [5] per acre for hemp fiber made before sowing and again later, maybe three to four weeks. When practiced, especially in France double use of fiber and seed fertilization with nitrogen doses up to 100&amp;nbsp;kg / [[hectare|ha]] rather low. Organic fertilizers such as manure can utilize industrial hemp well. Neither weeds nor crop protection measures are necessary.&lt;ref name="luginbuhl.industrial.hemp" /&gt;

''Cannabis sativa'' L. subsp. ''sativa'' var. ''sativa'' is the variety grown for industrial use, while ''C. sativa'' subsp. ''indica'' generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes. The major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance, and the amount of Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-[[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) secreted in a resinous mixture by [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal]] hairs called glandular [[trichomes]], although they can also be distinguished genetically.&lt;ref name=Sawler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Datwyler | first1 = SL | last2 = Weiblen | first2 = GD | year = 2006 | title = Genetic Variation in Hemp and marijuana (''Cannabis sativa L.'')

===Harvesting===
Smallholder plots are usually harvested by hand. The plants are cut at 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;cm above the soil and left on the ground to dry. Mechanical harvesting is now common, using specially adapted cutter-binders or simpler cutters.

The cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry for up to four days. This was traditionally followed by ''[[retting]]'', either water retting (the bundled hemp floats in water) or dew retting (the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew, and by molds and [[bacterial]] action).

===Location and crop rotation===

For profitable hemp farming, particularly deep, [[humus]]-rich, nutrient-rich soil with controlled water flow is preferable. Waterlogged acidic, compressed or extremely light (sandy) soils primarily affect the early development of plants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Steep and high altitudes of more than 400&amp;nbsp;m above sea level are best avoided. Hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to −5&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Seeds can germinate down to 1–3&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Hemp needs a lot of heat, so earlier varieties come to maturation. The water requirement is 300–500&amp;nbsp;l/kg dry matter.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} This is around 1/14th&lt;!-- no such thing as 14 times less --&gt; that of cotton, which takes between 7,000 and 29,000&amp;nbsp;l/kg, according to WWF.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Roots can grow up to 3 feet into the soil and use water from deeper soil layers.

Hemp benefits crops grown after it. So, it is generally grown before winter cereals. Advantageous changes are high weed suppression, soil loosening by the large hemp root system, and the positive effect on soil [[tilth]]. Since hemp is very self-compatible, it can also be grown several years in a row in the same fields (monoculture).

===Diseases===
{{Main|List of hemp diseases}}

Hemp plants can be vulnerable to various [[pathogen]]s, including [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[nematodes]], [[viruses]] and other miscellaneous pathogens. Such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality, stunted growth, and death of the plant. These diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field, so hemp production is not traditionally dependent on the use of pesticides.

===Environmental impact===
Hemp is considered by a 1998 study in ''[[Environmental Economics]]'' to be [[environmentally friendly]] due to a decrease of [[land use]] and other environmental impacts, indicating a possible decrease of [[ecological footprint]] in a US context compared to typical benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800997000402 |title=Industrial hemp's double dividend: a study for the USA  |date=1998-06-30 |accessdate=2013-11-09 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(97)00040-2 |volume=25 |issue=3  |journal=Ecological Economics |pages=291–301|bibcode=2005ecec.book.....C  |last1=Common  |first1=Michael  |last2=Stagl  |first2=Sigrid  |last3=Gay  |first3=Philip W.  |citeseerx=10.1.1.603.9935  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study, however, that compared the production of [[paper]] specifically from hemp and [[eucalyptus]] concluded that "industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper"; however, the article also highlights that "there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Industrial hemp or eucalyptus paper? | doi=10.1007/s11367-010-0152-y |volume=15 | issue=4 |journal=The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment |pages=368–375|year = 2010|last1 = Da Silva Vieira|first1 = Ricardo| last2=Canaveira | first2=Paulo | last3=Da Simões | first3=Ana | last4=Domingos | first4=Tiago }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp is also claimed to require few [[pesticide]]s and no herbicides, and it has been called a [[carbon negative]] raw material.&lt;ref name="thehia"&gt;

The world-leading producer of hemp is [[China]], which produces more than 70% of the world output. [[France]] ranks second with about a quarter of the world production. Smaller production occurs in the rest of [[Europe]], [[Chile]], and [[North Korea]]. Over 30 countries produce industrial hemp, including [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Canada]], Chile, [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[Egypt]], [[Finland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekmon.eu/lawmakers-legalize-industrial-hemp-farming-in-greece-prospects-opportunities/ |title=Lawmakers legalize industrial hemp farming in Greece: Prospects &amp; Opportunities. |publisher=Tekmon Geomatics |accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azhemp.org/Archive/Package/Legal/legal.html|title=Hemp vs. Marijuana|publisher=azhemp.org|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehia.org/facts.html |title=Hemp Facts |publisher=thehia.org |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom and Germany resumed commercial production in the 1990s. British production is mostly used as bedding for [[horse]]s; other uses are under development. Companies in Canada, the UK, the United States, and Germany, among many others, process hemp seed into a growing range of [[food]] products and [[cosmetics]]; many traditional growing countries still continue to produce [[textile]]-grade fibre.

[[File:Hemp bunch-dried out PNr°0062.jpg|thumb|Dried hemp stalks displayed at the International Hemp Fair in [[Vienna]]]]
Air-dried stem yields in Ontario have from 1998 and onward ranged from 2.6-14.0 tonnes of dry, retted stalks per hectare (1-5.5 t/ac) at 12% moisture. Yields in Kent County, have averaged 8.75 t/ha (3.5 t/ac). Northern Ontario crops averaged 6.1 t/ha (2.5 t/ac) in 1998. Statistic for the European Union for 2008 to 2010 say that the average yield of hemp straw has varied between 6.3 and 7.3 ton per ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eiha.org/media/2014/10/13-06-European-Hemp-Industry.pdf|title=The European Hemp Industry: Cultivation, processing and applications for fibres, shivs and seeds|last=Carus|first=Michael|date=June 2013|website=European Industrial Hemp Association|accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUSTAT" /&gt; Only a part of that is bast fiber.

===Australia===
In the Australian states of [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], and most recently, [[South Australia]], the state governments have issued licences to grow hemp for industrial use. The first to initiate  modern research into the potential of cannabis  was the state of Tasmania, which pioneered the licensing  of hemp during the early 1990s. The state of Victoria was an early adopter in 1998, and has reissued the regulation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

===Canada===
Commercial production (including cultivation) of industrial hemp has been permitted in Canada since 1998 under licenses and authorization issued by Health Canada (9,725 ha in 2004, 5450 ha in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/econ9631 |title=Government of Alberta: Industrial Hemp Production in Canada, February 2, 2010 |publisher=.agric.gov.ab.ca |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, industrial hemp agriculture in North America began with the [[University of Manitoba Hemp Awareness Committee|Hemp Awareness Committee]] at the [[University of Manitoba]]. The Committee worked with the provincial government to get research and development assistance, and was able to obtain  test plot permits from the [[Canadian government]]. Their efforts led to the legalization of [[industrial hemp]] (hemp with only minute amounts of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]]) in [[Canada]] and the first harvest in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hempline.com/hemp/hemp_articles/58/ |title=Where the heck is hemp?, The Alberta Express, April 18th, 2007 |publisher= www.hempline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ecolibris.blogspot.ca/2007/10/manitoba-harvest-2007-peoples-choice.html |title= Manitoba Harvest 2007 Peoples Choice, Eco Libris, Oct 8th, 2007 |publisher= ecolibris.blogspot.ca/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the cultivated area for hemp in the [[Prairie provinces]] include [[Saskatchewan]] with more than {{convert|56000|acre|ha}}, [[Alberta]] with {{convert|45000|acre|ha}}, and [[Manitoba]] with {{convert|30000|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Halsall|title=Hemp area may stall in 2018|url=https://www.country-guide.ca/2018/03/02/are-canadas-hemp-acres-poised-for-a-downward-slide-in-2018/52710/|publisher=CountryGuide, Glacier FarmMedia Limited Partnership|accessdate=18 May 2018|date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian hemp is cultivated mostly for its food value as hulled hemp seeds, hemp oils and hemp protein powders, with only a small fraction devoted to production of hemp fiber used for construction and insulation.&lt;ref name=cg/&gt;

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the commercial cultivation of hemp declined sharply. However, at least an estimated 2.5 million acres of hemp grow wild in the Russian Far East and Black Sea regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(Website/ Products)|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/09/28/Russia-mulls-resumption-of-hemp-growing/UPI-84461317226391/|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, cultivation licences are issued by the [[Home Office]] under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. When grown for nondrug purposes, hemp is referred to as industrial hemp, and a common product is fibre for use in a wide variety of products, as well as the seed for nutritional aspects and for the oil. Feral hemp or ditch weed is usually a naturalized fibre or oilseed strain of ''Cannabis'' that has escaped from cultivation and is self-seeding.&lt;ref name="MerrillsFisher2013m"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jon Merrills|author2=Jonathan Fisher|title=Pharmacy Law and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4a6gA0a4V8MC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-394618-8|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, even with this progress, hemp businesses seem to face difficulty expanding in the US as they face challenges in traditional marketing and sales approaches.

Textile expert [[Elizabeth Wayland Barber]] summarizes the historical evidence that ''Cannabis sativa'', "grew and was known in the Neolithic period all across the northern latitudes, from Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, Ukraine) to East Asia (Tibet and China)," but, "textile use of Cannabis sativa does not surface for certain in the West until relatively late, namely the Iron Age."&lt;ref&gt;Barber, E. J. W. (1992). ''Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean''. Princeton University Press. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
"I strongly suspect, however, that what catapulted hemp to sudden fame and fortune as a cultigen and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium B.C. was the spread of the habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central Asia, where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred. The linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory, both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause."&lt;ref&gt;Barber (1992). p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews living in [[Palestine (region)#Classical antiquity|Palestine]] in the 2nd century were familiar with the cultivation of hemp, as witnessed by a reference to it in the [[Mishna]] (''[[kil'ayim (Talmud)|Kil'ayim]]'' 2:5) as a variety of plant, along with [[Arum]], that sometimes takes as many as three years to grow from a seedling. In [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]], hemp was employed in cooked dishes, as filling in [[pie]]s and [[torte]]s, or boiled in a [[soup]].&lt;ref&gt;''Regional Cuisines of Medieval Europe: A Book of Essays'' (2002), edited by Melitta Weiss Adamson, {{ISBN|0-415-92994-6}}, pg. 98, 166&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp in later Europe was mainly cultivated for its fibers, and was used for ropes on many ships, including those of [[Christopher Columbus]]. The use of hemp as a cloth was centered largely in the countryside, with higher quality [[textiles]] being available in the towns.

===United States===
George Washington pushed for the growth of hemp and even grew hemp himself, as it was a [[cash crop]] commonly used to make rope and fabric. In May 1765 he noted in his diary about the sowing of seeds each day until mid-April. Then he recounts the harvest in October which he grew 27 bushels that year.

There is some speculation that [[George Washington]] smoked the flower of the cannabis plant in order to achieve a recreational high ("Like all farmers, Washington probably sampled the quality and potency of what he grew, and he may have used this hemp to treat his chronic tooth aches"),&lt;ref name="Robert Deitch" /&gt; but there is no evidence in any of his writings that he grew hemp for anything other than industrial purposes. It is sometimes supposed that an excerpt from Washington's diary, which reads "Began to {{sic|sep|erate}} the Male from the Female hemp at Do.&amp;—rather too late" is evidence that he was trying to grow female plants for the [[THC]] found in the flowers. However, the editorial remark accompanying the diary states that "This may arise from their [the male] being coarser, and the stalks larger"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diary of George Washington, entry 7 August 1765|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/01-01-02-0011-0006-0004|website=founders.archives.gov| accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent days, he describes soaking the hemp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diary of George Washington, entry 22 August 1765|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/01-01-02-0011-0006-0010|website=founders.archives.gov| accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (to make the fibers usable) and harvesting the seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diary of George Washington, entry September 1765| url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/01-01-02-0011-0007|website=founders.archives.gov| accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that he was growing hemp for industrial purposes, not recreational.

George Washington also imported the Indian Hemp plant from Asia, which was used for fiber and, by some growers, for intoxicating resin production. In a letter to William Pearce who managed the plants for him Washington says, "What was done with the Indian Hemp plant from last summer? It ought, all of it, to be sown again; that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised, but to have disseminated seed to others; as it is more valuable than common hemp."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Historically, hemp production had made up a significant portion of [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] Kentucky's economy. Before the [[American Civil War]], many slaves worked on [[plantation economy|plantations]] producing hemp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/history/slavery.htm James F. Hopkins, "Slavery in the Hemp Industry"], Drug Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] was passed in the United States, levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis, hemp, or marijuana. The passing of the Act to destroy the US hemp industry has been disputed to involve businessmen [[Andrew Mellon]], [[Randolph Hearst]] and the [[Du Pont family]].&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= French |first1= Laurence |first2= Magdaleno |last2= Manzanárez |title= NAFTA &amp; neocolonialism: comparative criminal, human &amp; social justice|publisher=University Press of America |year=2004 |page=129 |isbn=978-0-7618-2890-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4ozF1Yg-c4MC&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earlywine, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=r9wPbxMAG8cC&amp;pg=PA24 p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under-influence-55"&gt;Peet, 2004: [https://books.google.com/?id=uC0_YznYjScC&amp;pg=PA55 p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

One claim is that Hearst believed{{Dubious|date=March 2015}} that his extensive timber holdings were threatened by the invention of the [[decorticator]] which he feared would allow hemp to become a cheap substitute for the [[paper pulp]] used for newspaper.&lt;ref name="nafta-neocolonialism-129" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bound in twine: the history and ecology of the henequen-wheat complex for Mexico and the American and Canadian Plains, 1880–1950|author=Sterling Evans|publisher= Texas A&amp;M University Press| year= 2007| isbn= 978-1-58544-596-7| page= 27| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_wFkZgyuGFAC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical research indicates  this fear was unfounded because improvements of the [[decorticator]]s in the 1930s – machines that separated the fibers from the hemp stem – could not make hemp fiber a cheaper substitute for fibers from other sources.

===Historical cultivation===
Hemp has been grown for millennia in Asia and the Middle East for its fibre. Commercial production of hemp in the West took off in the eighteenth century, but was grown in the sixteenth century in eastern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2434380|title = New Fossil Evidence for the Past Cultivation and Processing of Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) in Eastern England|journal = The New Phytologist|volume = 89|issue = 3|pages = 503–510|last1 = Bradshaw|first1 = R.

R.|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of colonial and naval expansion of the era, economies needed large quantities of hemp for rope and [[oakum]]. In the early 1940s, world production of hemp fiber ranged from 250 000 to 350 000 metric tonnes, [[Russia]] was the biggest producer.&lt;ref name="Dew" /&gt;

In Western Europe, the cultivation of hemp was not legally banned by the 1930s, but the commercial cultivation stopped by then, due to decreased demand compared to increasingly popular artificial fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01214.html |title=Dr. Ivan BÛcsa, GATE Agricultural Research Institute, Kompolt - Hungary, Book Review Re-discovery of the Crop Plant Cannabis Marihuana Hemp (Die Wiederentdeckung der Nutzplanze Cannabis Marihuana Hanf) |publisher=Hempfood.com |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221071148/http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01214.html |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation about the potential for commercial cultivation of hemp in large quantities has been criticized  due to successful competition from other fibers for many products. The  world production of hemp fiber fell from over 300,000 metric tons 1961 to about 75,000 metric tons in the early 1990s and has after that been stable at that level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/cmspubsclass/files/EconomicConsiderationsforGrowingIndustrialHemp.pdf |format=PDF |author=Lynn Robins|title= Economic Considerations for Growing Industrial Hemp:Implications for Kentucky's Farmers and Agricultural Economy|publisher=Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Kentucky |date=July 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
[[File:Kamidana.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[Shinto shrine]] with rope made of hemp]]

In [[Japan]], hemp was historically used as paper and a fiber crop. There is archaeological evidence cannabis was used for clothing and the seeds were eaten in Japan back to the [[Jōmon period]] (10,000 to 300 BC). Many [[Kimono]] designs portray hemp, or ''asa'' ({{lang-ja|麻}}), as a beautiful plant. In 1948, marijuana was restricted as a narcotic drug. The ban on marijuana imposed by the United States authorities was alien to Japanese culture, as the drug had never been widely used in Japan before. Though these laws against marijuana are some of the world's strictest, allowing five years imprisonment for possession of the drug, they exempt hemp growers, whose crop is used to make robes for [[Buddhist monk]]s and [[mawashi|loincloth]]s for [[Sumo wrestler]]s. Because marijuana use in Japan has doubled in the past decade, these exemptions have recently been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123612257155123461|title=In Drug-Leery Japan, Arrests for Marijuana Are on the Rise|author=Yuka Hayashi|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====
The cultivation of hemp in Portuguese lands began around the fourteenth century onwards, it was raw material for the preparation of rope and plugs for the Portuguese ships. Colonies for factories for the production of flax hemp, such as the Royal Flax Hemp Factory in Brazil.

After the Restoration of Independence in 1640, in order to recover the ailing Portuguese naval fleet, were encouraged its cultivation as the Royal Decree of D. John IV in 1656. At that time its cultivation was carried out in Trás-os-Montes, Zone Tower Moncorvo, more precisely in Vilariça Valley, fertile land for any crop irrigation, and a very large area, flat and very fertile culture still wide until the last century grew up tobacco, a plant that needs a large space to expand and grow, the area lies in the valley of Serra de Bornes.

In 1971, the cultivation of hemp became illegal, and the production was substantially reduced. Because of EU regulations 1308/70, 619/71 and 1164/89, this law was revoked (for some certified seed varieties).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.1998.080.01.0021.01.ENG|title= Commission Regulation (EC) No 605/98 of 17 March 1998 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1164/89 laying down detailed rules concerning the aid for fibre flax and hemp |date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Early home automation began with labour-saving machines. Self-contained electric or gas powered [[home appliances]] became viable in the 1900s with the introduction of [[electric power distribution]]&lt;ref name="gerhart"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1|title = Home Automation &amp; Wiring|url =|publisher = McGraw-Hill/TAB Electronics|date = 1999-03-31|location = New York|isbn = 9780070246744|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the introduction of [[washing machine]]s (1904), [[water heater]]s (1889), [[refrigerator]]s, [[sewing machine]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s.

In 1975, the first general purpose home automation network technology, [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]], was developed. It is a communication protocol for electronic devices. It primarily uses [[electric power transmission]] wiring for signalling and control, where the signals involve brief [[radio frequency]] bursts of [[digital data]], and remains the most widely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hometoys.com/emagazine.php?url=/htinews/oct99/articles/rye/rye.htm|title = My Life at X10|date = October 1999|accessdate = October 8, 2014|website = AV and Automation Industry eMagazine|publisher = AV and Automation Industry eMagazine|last = Rye|first = Dave|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140930080338/http://hometoys.com/emagazine.php?url=%2Fhtinews%2Foct99%2Farticles%2Frye%2Frye.htm|archivedate = September 30, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, X10 products included a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.

By 2012, in the United States, according to ABI Research, 1.5 million home automation systems were installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abiresearch.com/press/15-million-home-automation-systems-installed-in-th/|title=1.5 Million Home Automation Systems Installed in the US This Year|website=www.abiresearch.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Li et al. (2016) there are three generations of home automation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Rita Yi Man|last2=Li|first2=Herru Ching Yu|last3=Mak|first3=Cho Kei|last4=Tang|first4=Tony Beiqi|title=Sustainable Smart Home and Home Automation: Big Data Analytics Approach|url=http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJSH/vol10_no8_2016/18.pdf|journal=International Journal of Smart Home|volume=10|issue=8|pages=177–198|doi=10.14257/ijsh.2016.10.8.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# First generation: wireless technology with proxy server, e.g. ZigBee automation;
# Second generation: artificial intelligence controls electrical devices, e.g. Amazon Echo;
# Third generation: robot buddy who interacts with humans, e.g. Robot Rovio, Roomba.

The word "''domotics''" (and "''domotica''" when used as a verb) is a contraction of the Latin word for a home (''[[domus]]'') and the word ''[[robotics]]''.&lt;ref name="t3"/&gt;

In a review of home automation devices, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' found two main concerns for consumers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/06/run-your-home-from-your-phone/index.htm|title=Best Home Automation System - Consumer Reports|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Wi-Fi network connected to the internet can be vulnerable to hacking.
* Technology is still in its infancy, and consumers could invest in a system that becomes [[abandonware]]. In 2014, Google bought the company selling the Revolv Hub home automation system, integrated it with [[Nest Labs|Nest]] and in 2016 shut down the servers Revolv Hub depended on, rendering the hardware useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/googles-nest-closing-smart-home-company-revolv-bricking-devices-2016-4|title=Google's parent company is deliberately disabling some of its customers' old smart-home devices|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Microsoft Research]] found in 2011, that home automation could involve high cost of ownership, inflexibility of interconnected devices, and poor manageability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brush|first=A.

Historically systems have been sold as complete systems where the consumer relies on one vendor for the entire system including the hardware, the communications protocol, the central hub, and the user interface. However, there are now [[open hardware]] and [[Open-source model|open source software]] systems which can be used instead of or with proprietary hardware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The nature of home automation devices can also be a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices.&lt;ref name="Goodbye, Android"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/goodbye-android|title=Goodbye, Android|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice|last1=Franceschi-Bicchierai|first1=Lorenzo|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-android-toxic-hellstew-survival-guide/|title=The toxic hellstew survival guide|website=ZDnet|last1=Kingsley-Hughes|first1=Adrian|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active devices vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-security-a-market-for-lemons-that-leaves-87-percent-insecure/|title=Android security a 'market for lemons' that leaves 87 percent vulnerable|date=2015-10-13|website=zdnet.com|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|first1=Liam|last1=Tung|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~drt24/papers/spsm-scoring.pdf|title=Security Metrics for the Android Ecosystem|last2=Beresford|first2=Alastair R.|publisher=[[Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge]]|doi=10.1145/2808117.2808118|last3=Rice|first3=Andrew|first1=Daniel R.|last1=Thomas|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on March 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the [[United States|American]] businessman [[Howard Hughes]] in 1953. It is one of the largest private funding organizations for [[biology|biological]] and medical research in the [[United States]]. HHMI spends about $1 million per HHMI Investigator per year, which amounts to annual investment in biomedical research of about $825 million. The institute has an endowment of $22.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], making it the second-wealthiest [[philanthropic]] organization in the United States and the second-best endowed medical research foundation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhmi.org/year-in-review/2013 Howard Hughes Medical Institute | 2013 Year in Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  HHMI is the former owner of the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] - an American [[aerospace]] firm which was divested to various firms over time.

== History ==
[[File:Howard Hughes 1938.jpg|thumb|Howard Hughes, businessman, investor, pilot, film director, philanthropist, and founder of the institute]]
The institute was formed with the goal of basic research including trying to understand, in Hughes's words, "the genesis of life itself." Despite its principles, in the early days it was generally viewed as a tax haven for Hughes's huge personal fortune. Hughes was HHMI's sole trustee and transferred his stock of [[Hughes Aircraft]] to the institute, in effect turning the large defense contractor into a tax-exempt charity. For many years the Institute grappled with maintaining its non-profit status; the [[Internal Revenue Service]] challenged its "charitable" status which made it tax exempt. Partly in response to such claims, starting in the late 1950s it began funding 47 investigators researching at eight different institutions; however, it remained a modest enterprise for several decades.

The institute was initially in Miami, Florida in 1953. Hughes's internist, [[Verne Mason]], who treated Hughes after his 1946 plane crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Verne Mason. Miami Physician. Howard Hughes aide dies. Also treated Pershing. The New York Times. November 17, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute moved to [[Coconut Grove, Florida]], in the mid-1970s and then to Bethesda, Maryland, in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wernick | first = Ellen D | title = Howard Hughes Medical Institute | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/howard-hughes-medical-institute | accessdate = 2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the institute moved to its headquarters in Chevy Chase, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Howard Hughes Medical Institute History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/howard-hughes-medical-institute-history/|website=Funding Universe|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until after Hughes's death in 1976 that the institute's profile increased from an annual budget of $4 million in 1975 to $15 million in 1978 and prior to Hughes Aircraft sale the number had peaked to $200 million per year. At the time of the sale Hughes Aircraft employed 75,000 people and vast amounts of money from the approximate annual revenue of $6 billion dollars were put into Hughes Aircraft internal research and development rather than the medical institute. Most of the money for the medical institute came from the operations at Ground System Group responsible for providing Air Defense Systems to NATO, Pacific Rim, and the USA. In this period it focused its mission on [[genetics]], [[immunology]], and [[molecular biology]]. Since Hughes died without a will as the sole trustee of the HHMI, the institute was involved in lengthy court proceedings to determine whether it would benefit from Hughes's fortune. In April 1984, a court appointed new trustees for the institute's holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Note: the original trustees were: Helen K. Copley, Donald S. Fredrickson, M.D., Frank William Gay, James H. Gilliam, Jr., Esq., Hanna H. Gray, Ph.D., William R. Lummis, Esq., Irving S. Shapiro, Esq., George W. Thorn, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1985 the trustees announced they would sell Hughes Aircraft by private sale or public stock offering. On June 5, 1985 [[General Motors]] (GM) was announced as the winner of a secretive five-month, sealed-bid auction. The purchase was completed on December 20, 1985 for an estimated $5.2 billion, $2.7 billion in cash and the rest in 50 million shares of GM Class H stock. The proceeds caused the institute to grow dramatically.

HHMI completed the building of a new research campus in [[Ashburn, Virginia]] called [[Janelia Research Campus]] in October 2006. It is modeled after [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T's Bell Labs]] and the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. With a main laboratory building nearly {{convert|1000|ft|m}} long, it contains {{convert|760000|sqft|m2}} of enclosed space, used primarily for research. The campus also features apartments for visiting researchers.

In 2007, HHMI and the publisher Elsevier announced they have established an agreement to make author manuscripts of HHMI research articles published in Elsevier and Cell Press journals publicly available six months following final publication. The agreement takes effect for articles published after September 1, 2007. In 2008, the Trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute selected [[Robert Tjian]] as the new president of HHMI. In 2009, HHMI awarded fifty researchers, as part of the HHMI Early Career Scientist Competition. In 2016, the HHMI Trustees selected [[Erin K. O'Shea]], a previous Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at the institute, the new president of HHMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/news/the-week-in-science-5-11-february-2016-1.19327|title = The week in science: 5&amp;ndash;11 February 2016|last = Staff|date = February 10, 2016|journal = Nature|doi = 10.1038/530134a|access-date = 2016-02-10|at = People: HHMI president}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HybridConjugate.jpg|thumb|120px|W and Y, X and Z are conjugate pairs]]

A '''hybrid coil''' (or '''bridge transformer''', or sometimes '''hybrid''') is a [[transformer]] that has three windings, and which is designed to be configured as a [[electrical network|circuit]] having four [[port (circuit theory)|ports]] that are conjugate in pairs.  

A signal arriving at one port is divided equally between the two adjacent ports but does not appear at the opposite port. In the schematic diagram, the signal into W  splits between X and Z, and no signal passes to Y. Similarly, signals into X split to W and Y with none to Z, etc. 

Correct operation requires matched [[characteristic impedance]] at all four ports.  Hybrids are a class of [[directional coupler]] in which the input port power is split equally between the two output ports.  Forms of hybrid other than transfomer coils are possible; any format of directional coupler can be designed to be a hybrid.  These formats include [[transmission line]]s and [[waveguide]]s.

== Explanation ==
[[File:TwoWireRepeater.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Using hybrids for bidirectional amplification]]The primary use of a [[voiceband]] hybrid coil is to convert between [[Two-wire circuit|2-wire]] and [[Four-wire circuit|4-wire]] operation in sequential sections of a [[information transfer|communications]] circuit, for example in a [[four-wire terminating set]].  Such conversion was necessary when [[repeater]]s were introduced in a 2-wire circuit, a frequent practice at early 20th century [[telephony]].  Without hybrids, the output of one amplifier feeds directly into the input of the other, resulting in a howling situation (upper diagram). By using hybrids, the outputs and inputs are isolated, resulting in correct 2-wire repeater operation. Late in the century, this practice became rare but hybrids continued in use in [[line card]]s.

===Hybrid coil circuit diagrams===
Hybrids are realized using [[transformer]]s. Two versions of transformer hybrids were used, the single transformer version providing unbalanced outputs with one end [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]], and the double transformer version providing [[Balanced circuit|balanced ports]]. [[Image:DoubleTransformerHybrid.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Wiring diagram of a double transformer hybrid]]

====Single transformer hybrid====
[[File:SingleTransformerHybrid.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Wiring diagram of a single transformer hybrid]]For use in [[Two-wire circuit|2-wire]] [[repeater]]s, the single transformer version suffices, since amplifiers in the repeaters have grounded inputs and outputs. X, Y, and Z share a [[Ground (electricity)|common ground]]. As shown at left, signal into W, the 2-wire port, will appear at X and Z. But since Y is bridged from center of coil to center of X and Z, no signal appears. Signal into X will appear at W and Y. But signal at Z is the difference of what appears at Y and, through the transformer coil, at W, which is zero. Similar reasoning proves both pairs, W &amp; Y, X &amp; Z, are conjugates.

====Double transformer hybrid====
When both the [[Two-wire circuit|2-wire]] and the [[Four-wire circuit|4-wire circuits]] must be [[Balanced circuit|balanced]], double transformer hybrids are used, as shown at right. Signal into port W splits between X and Z, but due to reversed connection to the windings, cancel at port Y. Signal into port X goes to W and Y. But due to reversed connection to ports W and Y, Z gets no signal. Thus the pairs, W &amp; Y, X &amp; Z, are conjugates.

== Applications ==
[[Telephone hybrid]]s are used in [[telephone exchange]]s to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire [[last mile]] connection to the subscriber's [[telephone]].  A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone [[handset]]s to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphhone) to the 2-wire line connection.  This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an '''induction coil''' due to its derivation from high-voltage [[induction coil]]s.  It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a [[step-up transformer]] in order to [[impedance matching|impedance match]] the low-impedance [[Carbon microphone|carbon button transmitter]] to the higher impedance parts of the system.  The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a [[sidetone]] reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carr, Steve Winder, Stephen Bigelow, ''Understanding Telephone Electronics'', pp. 68-70, Newnes, 2001 {{ISBN|0080520030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Coe, ''The Telephone and Its Several Inventors: A History'', pp. 124, 173, McFarland, 2006 {{ISBN|0786426098}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the transformer version of the hybrid has been replaced by [[Power dividers and directional couplers#6 dB resistive bridge hybrid|resistor networks]] and compact IC versions, which use [[integrated circuit]] electronics to do the job of the hybrid coil.

Radio-frequency hybrids are used to split radio signals, including television.  The splitter divides the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] signal to feed multiple receivers.

== History ==

===Prior efforts===
The first VCR system (strictly, "video tape recorder" as there was no cassette) sold directly to home users was 1963's Telcan from the UK, but this was not a commercial success. [[Sony]]'s [[CV-2000]] was a complete system based on commercial {{frac|2}}-inch tape on open reels, requiring the user to thread the tape around the [[helical scan]] heads. In order to conserve tape, the system recorded every other frame of the television signal, producing 200-line output. Similar models from [[Ampex]] and [[RCA]] followed that year. The number of video tape recorders continued to increase during the late 1960s, leading to the [[EIAJ-1]] standard for {{frac|2}}-inch tape on a 7&amp;nbsp;inch reel. The follow-up EIAJ-2 built the take-up reel into the VCR body.

In September 1971, Sony introduced the [[U-matic]] format, aimed at professional users, which replaced the open reels with a cassette. The next year [[Philips]] introduced the [[Video Cassette Recording]] format specifically for home users. Over the next five years, a number of companies introduced similar cassette-based home formats, all of which were incompatible. Among the better known examples are [[Sanyo]]'s [[V-Cord]] from 1974, Sony's [[Betamax]] from 1975, and [[Panasonic]]'s [[VX (videocassette format)|VX]] from 1975.

===VHS===
{{See also|VHS}}
JVC engineers Yuma Shiraishi and Shizuo Takano led the effort in developing the VHS tape format starting in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/20/world/shizuo-takano-68-an-engineer-who-developed-vhs-recorders.html |title=Shizuo Takano, 68, an Engineer Who Developed VHS Recorders |work=The New York Times  |date=1992-01-20 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |first=Andrew |last=Pollack}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project started off by designing guidelines for VHS, creating a matrix on a blackboard called the VHS Development Matrix. Included in the matrix was a list of objectives in building a home video recording unit.&lt;ref name="rickmaybury"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rickmaybury.com/Altarcs/homent/he97/vhstoryhtm.htm |title=VHS STORY - Home Taping Comes of Age |publisher=Rickmaybury.com |date=1976-09-07 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095527/http://www.rickmaybury.com/Altarcs/homent/he97/vhstoryhtm.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The HR-3300 is a result of these objectives.

Soon after the matrix was produced, the commercial video recording industry in Japan took a financial hit. As a result, JVC cut its budgets and restructured its video division - even going as far as shelving the VHS project. However, despite the lack of funding for the VHS project, Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project in secrecy within the video division. By 1973, the two engineers successfully produced a functional prototype of the HR-3300.&lt;ref name="rickmaybury" /&gt;

===Release===
The first HR-3300 was released in 1976. These early units used two large rotary knobs for tuning television signals for recording, one for VHF and another for UHF. Separate antenna inputs and pass-throughs were provided for both frequencies, as well [[composite video]] in and out via [[RCA jack]]s. An electronic timer with four [[seven-segment display]]s was located in the lower left of the front panel allowed the user to automatically record programs, one event up to 24 hours in the future. It also included a mechanical three-digit counter, similar to those on audio cassette recorders.

For the US and UK release the next year, the system was updated by replacing the mechanical tuning dials with a push-button system with eight pre-selected channels. A panel in the top flipped up to access small mechanical tuning dials for each of the eight channels. Push-button tuning was relatively rare at this time. The UK model was also released under the Ferguson brand name.

===Format war===
In December 1974, Sony attempted to standardize their Betamax format by inviting Matsushita (Panasonic) and JVC to license the system.&lt;ref&gt;"The Format War," Video Magazine, April 1988, pp. 50-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently to their surprise, both companies refused. At the time, Matsushita not only sold through its own Panasonic brand, but was the majority shareholder in JVC as well. Through 1976 Sony was unrivalled in the VCR market, selling 30,000 units in the US alone.

The HR-3300 was introduced late in 1976 with one crucial feature, the ability to hold two hours of video on a single cassette. This made the format able to record an entire movie. JVC licensed the VHS format as an [[open standard]], and in January 1977 there were VHS products from four other Japanese companies on the market.

In February Sony once again started to look for licensors for the Betamax format, and joined forces with US-based [[Zenith Electronics]]. Matsushita then started looking for US partners as well, and formed an alliance with [[RCA]]. RCA was interested, but stated that the format should be extended to allow recordings of five to six hours. Victor refused to compromise on picture quality by slowing down the tape speed, but Matsushita produced a prototype of such a system, and RCA announced they were going with VHS in March 1977. Simply re-badging units made by Matsushita in Japan, by 1978, RCA held 36% of the VCR market, and VHS was on its way to becoming a ''de facto'' standard.

[[File:Kraft Banbutry.jpg| thumb|right|175px|The [[Kraft Foods]] factory in [[Banbury]] has been a major employer in the town since the mid-1960s]]
[[File:The Kraft Factory - geograph.org.uk - 327633.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Kraft Factory]] 
'''Kraft Foods''' in the [[Ruscote]] ward of [[Banbury]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]] is a large food and [[coffee]] producing factory in the north of the town.&lt;ref name="kraftfoods.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kraftfoods.co.uk/kraft/page?siteid=kraft-prd&amp;locale=uken1&amp;PagecRef=2297&amp;Mid=2297 |title=Kraft Foods Europe Home |publisher=Kraftfoods.co.uk |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1964, it was partly due to the [[London overspill]]. Kraft Foods Banbury is the [[Kraft Foods]] centre of manufacturing with the Kraft UK headquarters located at [[Uxbridge]]. The factory is still sometimes known as [[General Foods]] after the American company which originally owned the building, before 'GF' as it is commonly known was taken over by Kraft.

During October 2006, a block of Kraft Foods that was being prepared for demolition caught on fire and remained on fire for most of the day.

There was a non-lethal fire at the coffee plant on Tuesday 7 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Manufacturing/Kraft-coffee-production-relatively-unaffected-by-Banbury-factory-fire |title=Kraft: coffee production 'relatively unaffected' by Banbury factory fire |publisher= Foodmanufacture.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/general_election_2010/banbury/8724452.Fire_at_Kraft_factory/ |title=Fire at Kraft factory (From Oxford Mail) |publisher=Oxfordmail.co.uk |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2010, a truckload of [[Kenco|Kenco Coffee]] was stolen by a driver who conned his way into the plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.banburyguardian.co.uk/news/local/trailer_full_of_coffee_stolen_from_kraft_1_599132&lt;/ref&gt;

With the split of Kraft General Foods into Mondelez International and Kraft Foods in October 2012,  this factory site became part of new company Mondelez International

'''Methane''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|m|ɛ|θ|eɪ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|m|iː|θ|eɪ|n}}) is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} (one atom of [[carbon]] and four atoms of [[hydrogen]]). It is a [[group-14 hydride]] and the simplest [[alkane]], and is the main constituent of [[natural gas]]. The relative abundance of methane on [[Earth]] makes it an attractive [[fuel]], though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its [[gaseous]] state under [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions for temperature and pressure]].

Natural methane is found both below ground and under the [[sea floor]]. When it reaches the surface and the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], it is known as [[atmospheric methane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.645| title = Non-Co2 Greenhouse Gases in the Atmosphere| journal = Annual Review of Energy and the Environment| volume = 24| pages = 645–661| year = 1999| last1 = Khalil | first1 = M. A. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750, and it accounts for 20% of the total [[radiative forcing]] from all of the long-lived and globally mixed [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Technical summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/017.htm|title=Technical summary|website=Climate Change 2001|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120130/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/017.htm |archivedate=June 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alessandro Volta]]]]
In November 1776, methane was first scientifically identified by [[Italian people|Italian]] physicist [[Alessandro Volta]] in the marshes of [[Lake Maggiore]] straddling [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]].  Volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] about "flammable air".&lt;ref name = Volta&gt;Volta, Alessandro (1777) [https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200332/BibliographicResource_3000123618397.html ''Lettere del Signor Don Alessandro Volta ... Sull' Aria Inflammable Nativa Delle Paludi'']  [Letters of Signor Don Alessandro Volta ... on the flammable native air of the marshes], Milan, Italy:  Giuseppe Marelli.&lt;/ref&gt; Volta collected the gas rising from the marsh, and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas.&lt;ref name = bookrags&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/methane-woc/ |title=Methane |publisher=BookRags |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated that the gas could be ignited with an electric spark.&lt;ref name=bookrags /&gt;

The name "methane" was coined in 1866 by the German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  A. W. Hofmann (1866) [http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/54.full.pdf+html "On the action of trichloride of phosphorus on the salts of the aromatic monoamines,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''15''' :  55– 62; see footnote on pp. 57–58.
*  James Michael McBride (1999) "Development of systematic names for the simple alkanes".  Available online at [https://webspace.yale.edu/chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html Chemistry Department, Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut).]&lt;/ref&gt; The name was derived from [[Methanol#History|methanol]].

===Etymology===
Etymologically, the word "''methane''" is coined from the chemical suffix "''-ane''", which denotes substances belonging to the alkane family; and the word "''methyl''", which is derived from the German "''methyl''" (A.D.1840) or directly from the French "''méthyle''" which is a back-formation from the French "''méthylène''" (corresponding to English "methylene"), the root of which is coined from the Greek "''methy''" (related to English "mead") and "''hyle''" (meaning "wood"). The radical is named after this because it was first detected in wood alcohol. The chemical suffix "''-ane''" is from the coordinating chemical suffix "''-ine''" which is from Latin feminine suffix "''-ina''" which is applied to represent abstracts. The coordination of "-ane", "-ene", "-one", etc. was proposed in 1866 by German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892).

==Properties and bonding==
Methane is a [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] molecule with four equivalent [[Carbon–hydrogen bond|C–H bond]]s. Its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals (MOs) resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on [[Carbon|C]] and [[Hydrogen|H]]. The lowest energy MO is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms. Above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of MOs that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen. The resulting "three-over-one" bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements.

At [[room temperature]] and [[standard pressure]], methane is a colorless, odorless gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yp3qEgHrsJ4C&amp;pg=PA168|page=168|title=Handbook of transport and the environment|author1=Hensher, David A.  |author2=Button, Kenneth J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year= 2003|isbn=978-0-08-044103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an [[odorant]], usually blends containing [[tert-butylthiol]], as a safety measure. Methane has a boiling point of −164 °[[Celsius|C]] (−257.8 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C74828&amp;Mask=4#Thermo-Phase Methane Phase change data]. NIST Chemistry Webbook.&lt;/ref&gt; As a gas it is [[flammable]] over a range of concentrations (5.4–17%) in air at [[standard pressure]].

Solid methane exists in several [[Polymorphism (materials science)|modifications]]. Presently nine are known.&lt;ref name="BiniPratesi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bini | first1 = R. | last2 = Pratesi | first2 = G. | year = 1997 | title = High-pressure infrared study of solid methane: Phase diagram up to 30 GPa | url = | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 55 | issue = 22| pages = 14800–14809 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.55.14800| bibcode = 1997PhRvB..5514800B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane I. This substance crystallizes in the cubic system ([[space group]] Fm{{overline|3}}m). The positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane I, i.e. methane molecules may rotate freely. Therefore, it is a [[plastic crystal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paarpraxis-rheinmain.de/W/kristallgitter/kristallgitter_e.php|title=Crystal structures|accessdate=2016-06-13|author=Wendelin Himmelheber|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809181715/http://paarpraxis-rheinmain.de/W/kristallgitter/kristallgitter_e.php|archivedate=August 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical reactions==
The primary chemical reactions of methane are [[combustion]], [[steam reforming]] to [[syngas]], and [[halogenation]]. In general, methane reactions are difficult to control. Partial oxidation to [[methanol]], for example, is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] even with an insufficient supply of oxygen. The enzyme [[methane monooxygenase]] produces methanol from methane, but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr950244f |title=Mechanistic Studies on the Hydroxylation of Methane by Methane Monooxygenase |year=2003 |last1=Baik |first1=Mu-Hyun |last2=Newcomb |first2=Martin |last3=Friesner |first3=Richard A. |last4=Lippard |first4=Stephen J. |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=2385–419 |pmid=12797835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some homogeneously catalyzed systems and heterogeneous systems have been developed, but all have significant drawbacks. These generally operate by generating protected products which are shielded from overoxidation. Examples include the [[Catalytica system]], copper zeolites, and iron zeolites stabilizing the [[Alpha-Oxygen]] active site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Benjamin E. R.|last2=Bols|first2=Max L.|last3=Schoonheydt|first3=Robert A.|last4=Sels|first4=Bert F.|last5=Solomon|first5=Edward I.|date=2017-12-19|title=Iron and Copper Active Sites in Zeolites and Their Correlation to Metalloenzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|language=en|volume=118|issue=5|pages=2718–2768|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00344|pmid=29256242|issn=0009-2665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acid-base reactions===
Like other [[hydrocarbon]]s, methane is a very weak acid. Its pKa in [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] is estimated to be 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar00156a004|title=Equilibrium acidities in dimethyl sulfoxide solution|year=1988|last1=Bordwell|first1=Frederick G.|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=21|issue=12|pages=456–463}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be [[Deprotonation|deprotonated]] in solution, but the [[conjugate base]] is known in forms such as [[methyllithium]].

A variety of [[cation|positive ions]] derived from methane have been observed, mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures. These include [[methenium]] or methyl cation {{chem|CH|3|+}}, methane cation {{chem|CH|4|+}}, and [[methanium]] or protonated methane {{chem|CH|5|+}}. Some of these have been [[list of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|detected in outer space]]. Methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with [[superacid]]s. [[Cation]]s with higher charge, such as {{chem|CH|6|2+}} and {{chem|CH|7|3+}}, have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable.&lt;ref name=Rasul/&gt;

Despite the strength of its C–H bonds, there is intense interest in [[catalysts]] that facilitate [[C–H bond activation]] in methane (and other lower numbered [[alkanes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1177485 |title=Characterization of a Rhodium(I) σ-Methane Complex in Solution |year=2009 |last1=Bernskoetter |first1=W.H. |last2= Schauer |first2=C.K. |last3=Goldberg |first3=K.I. |last4=Brookhart |first4=M. |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5952 |pages=553–556 |pmid=19900892 |bibcode=2009Sci...326..553B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion===
[[File:The fire within her.jpg|alt=A young woman holding a flame in her hands|thumb|Methane bubbles can be burned on a wet hand without injury.]]

Methane's [[heat of combustion]] is 55.5 MJ/kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch8en/conc8en/energycontent.html Energy Content of some Combustibles (in MJ/kg)]. People.hofstra.edu. Retrieved on March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Combustion]] of methane is a multiple step reaction summarized as follows:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ({{nowrap|Δ''H'' {{=}} −891 [[kilo-|k]][[joule|J]]/[[mole (unit)|mol]]}}, at standard conditions)
[[Peters four-step chemistry]] is a systematically reduced four-step chemistry which explains the burning of methane.

===Methane Reactions===
Given appropriate conditions, methane reacts with as follows:

:X• + CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → HX + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;•
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;• + X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;X + X•

where X is a [[halogen]]: [[fluorine]] (F), [[chlorine]] (Cl), [[bromine]] (Br), or [[iodine]] (I). This mechanism for this process is called [[free radical halogenation]]. It is initiated when UV light or some other [[radical initiator]] produces a halogen [[atom]]. A two-step [[chain reaction]] ensues in which the halogen atom abstracts a hydrogen atom from a methane molecule, resulting in the formation of a [[hydrogen halide]] molecule and a [[methyl radical]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;•). The methyl radical then reacts with a molecule of the halogen to form a molecule of the halomethane, with a new halogen atom as byproduct. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= March|first1=Jerry|title= Advance Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure|year= 1968|publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company|location= New York|pages= 533–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar reactions can occur on the halogenated product, leading to replacement of additional hydrogen atoms by halogen atoms with [[dihalomethane]], [[trihalomethane]], and ultimately, [[tetrahlomethane]] structures, depending upon reaction conditions and the halogen-to-methane ratio.

==Uses==
Methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid (liquefied natural gas, or [[LNG]]). While leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas, the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air. [[Pipeline transport|Gas pipelines]] distribute large amounts of natural gas, of which methane is the principal component.

===Fuel===
Methane is used as a [[fuel]] for ovens, homes, water heaters, kilns, automobiles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energymanagertoday.com/lumber-company-locates-kilns-at-landfill-to-use-methane-0115981/|title=Lumber Company Locates Kilns at Landfill to Use Methane – Energy Manager Today|website=Energy Manager Today|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|quote=Compressed natural gas is touted as the 'cleanest burning' alternative fuel available, since the simplicity of the methane molecule reduces tailpipe emissions of different pollutants by 35 to 97%. Not quite as dramatic is the reduction in net greenhouse-gas emissions, which is about the same as corn-grain ethanol at about a 20% reduction over gasoline|url=http://www.gas2.org/2008/04/29/natural-gas-cars-cng-fuel-almost-free-in-some-parts-of-the-country/|title=Natural Gas Cars: CNG Fuel Almost Free in Some Parts of the Country|date=April 29, 2008|author=Cornell, Clayton B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; turbines, and other things. [[Activated carbon]] is used to store methane. Liquid methane is also used as a [[Liquid rocket propellant|rocket fuel]] when combined with [[liquid oxygen]], as in the [[BE-4]] and [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] engines.

Methane is important for [[electricity generation]] by burning it as a fuel in a [[gas turbine]] or [[Boiler (power generation)|steam generator]]. Compared to other [[fossil fuel|hydrocarbon fuels]], methane produces less [[carbon dioxide]] for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's [[heat of combustion]] is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kJ/g) than other complex hydrocarbons. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic [[heating]] and cooking. In this context it is usually known as [[natural gas]], which is considered to have an energy content of 39 [[megajoule]]s per cubic meter, or 1,000 [[British thermal unit|BTU]] per [[standard cubic foot]].

Methane in the form of [[compressed natural gas]] is used as a [[vehicle fuel]] and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]] and [[diesel fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Research into [[adsorption]] methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Düren |first1=Tina |last2=Sarkisov |first2=Lev |last3=Yaghi |first3=Omar M. |last4=Snurr |first4=Randall Q. |title=Design of New Materials for Methane Storage |journal=Langmuir |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=2683–9|year=2004 |pmid=15835137 |doi=10.1021/la0355500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liquefied natural gas====
{{main|Liquefied natural gas}}
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is [[natural gas]] (predominantly methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport.

Liquefied natural gas occupies about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is [[odorless]], [[Transparency and translucency|colorless]], [[toxicity|non-toxic]] and [[Corrosive substance|non-corrosive]]. Hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state, freezing, and [[asphyxia]].

The [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefaction]] process involves removal of certain components, such as dust, [[acid gases]], [[helium]], water, and heavy [[hydrocarbons]], which could cause difficulty downstream. The natural gas is then [[condensation|condensed]] into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure (maximum transport pressure set at around {{convert|25|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) by cooling it to approximately {{convert|-162|°C|K}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

LNG achieves a higher reduction in volume than [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) so that the [[energy density]] of LNG is 2.4&amp;nbsp;times greater than that of CNG or 60% that of [[diesel fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envocare.co.uk/lpg_lng_cng.htm |title=Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) |publisher=Envocare Ltd. |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes LNG cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist. Specially designed [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] sea vessels ([[LNG carrier]]s) or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport. Even if pressurized, methane must be cooled below its [[critical temperature]] of {{cvt|-82.3|°C|K}} in order to be liquefied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_properties.php|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center|author=|date=|website=www.afdc.energy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LNG, when it is not highly refined for special uses, is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets, where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas. It can be used in [[natural gas vehicles|LNG-fueled road vehicles]]. 
However, it remains more common to design vehicles to use [[compressed natural gas]]. {{asof|2002}}, the relatively higher cost of LNG production and the need to store LNG in more expensive [[Cryogenic storage dewar|cryogenic tanks]] had slowed widespread commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Fuels of the Future for Cars and Trucks, Dr. James J. Eberhardt, U.S. Department of Energy,  2002 Diesel Engine Emissions Reduction (DEER) Workshop, August 25–29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural gas located far from its user base is often released into the atmosphere or [[Gas flare|flared]]. Some is subjected to [[gas to liquid]]s technologies (GTL) to produce liquid fuels, which are more readily transported than methane.

===Chemical feedstock===

[[Natural gas]], which is mostly composed of methane, is used to produce hydrogen gas on an industrial scale. Steam Methane Reforming, or [[Steam methane reforming|SMR]], is the most common method of producing commercial bulk hydrogen gas.
More than 50 million metric tons are produced annually worldwide (2013), principally from SMR of natural gas. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/hpep_report_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this hydrogen is used in petroleum refineries, in the production of chemicals and in food processing. Very large quantities of hydrogen are used in the [[Ammonia production|industrial synthesis of ammonia]]. 

At high temperatures (700 &amp;ndash; 1100&amp;nbsp;°C) and in the presence of a [[metal]]-based [[catalyst]] ([[nickel]]), steam reacts with methane to yield [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen: 

:[[methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] ⇌ [[carbon monoxide|CO]] + 3 [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Additional hydrogen is obtained by reacting the [[carbon monoxide|CO]] with water via the [[water-gas shift reaction]].
:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⇌ [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first reaction is strongly [[endothermic]] (consumes heat, ΔH&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;= 206 kJ/mol), the second reaction is mildly [[exothermic]] (produces heat, ΔH&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;= -41 kJ/mol).


Methane is also subjected to free-radical [[halogenation|chlorination]] in the production of chloromethanes, although methanol is a more typical precursor.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Rossberg, M. ''et al.'' (2006) "Chlorinated Hydrocarbons" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geological routes===
There are two main routes for geological methane generation, organic (thermogenic), and inorganic ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]], meaning non-living). Thermally generated methane, referred to as thermogenic, originates from deeper sedimentary [[stratum|strata]]. Thermogenic methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) formation occurs due to the breakup of organic matter, forced by elevated temperatures and pressures. This type of methane is considered to be the primary methane type in sedimentary basins, and from an economical perspective the most important source of natural gas. Thermogenic methane components are generally considered to be relic (from an earlier time). Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth) can occur through organic matter breakup, or organic synthesis. Both ways can involve microorganisms (methanogenesis) but may also occur inorganically. The involved anaerobic and aerobic processes can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms. The more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is abiotic. Abiotic means that the methane formation took place involving inorganic compounds, without biological activity, magmatic or created at low temperatures and pressures through water-rock reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The origin, source, and cycling of methane in deep crystalline rock biosphere|year=2015|journal=Front.

===Biological routes===
{{Main|methanogenesis}}
Naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by microbial [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lessner, Daniel J(Dec 2009) Methanogenesis Biochemistry. In: eLS. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, Chichester. http://www.els.net [doi: 10.1002/9780470015902.a0000573.pub2]&lt;/ref&gt; This multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source. The net reaction is
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 8 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme [[Coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase]]. Methanogenesis is a form of [[anaerobic respiration]] used by organisms that occupy [[landfill]], [[ruminants]] (for example [[cows]] or [[cattle]]), and the guts of termites.

It is uncertain whether plants are a source of methane emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=J. T. |last2=McRoberts |first2=W.

===Industrial routes===
There are many technological methane production methods. However, as methane is the main component in natural gas and a major energy source, there is little industrial incentive to prepare it from other sources, although some plants use coal to gas processes (see below). Methane created from [[biomass]] in industrial plants via biological route is called [[biogas]]. A more synthetic method to produce methane is [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] carbon dioxide through the [[Sabatier process]]. Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]], which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer-chain molecules than methane.

Example of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the [[Great Plains Synfuels]] plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade [[lignite]], a resource that is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight, [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]] content, low calorific value and propensity to [[spontaneous combustion]] during storage and transport.

[[Power to gas#Power to methane|Power to methane]] is a technology that uses [[electricity|electrical power]] to produce hydrogen from water by [[electrolysis]] and uses the [[Sabatier reaction]] to combine hydrogen with [[carbon dioxide]] to produce methane. As of 2016, this is mostly under development and not in large-scale use. Theoretically, the process could be used as a buffer for excess and off-peak power generated by highly fluctuating [[wind generators]] and [[Solar panel|solar arrays]]. However, as currently very large amounts of natural gas are used in power plants (e.g. [[Combined cycle|CCGT]]) to produce electric energy, the losses in efficiency are not acceptable.

====Laboratory synthesis====
Methane can be produced by protonation of [[methyl lithium]] and [[methylmagnesium iodide]]. In practice, a requirement for pure methane will be filled with a steel gas bottle from standard suppliers.

==Occurrence==
Methane was discovered and isolated by [[Alessandro Volta]] between 1776 and 1778 when studying [[marsh gas]] from [[Lake Maggiore]]. It is the major component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as [[natural gas fields]], with [[coal seam gas]] extraction becoming a major source (see [[Coal bed methane extraction]], a method for extracting methane from a [[coal]] deposit, while [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]] is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, and sometimes accompanied by [[helium]] and [[nitrogen]]. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Decomposition|decay]] of [[organic matter]] and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the [[sediment]]s that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain [[Petroleum|oil]].

Methane is generally transported in bulk by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] in its natural gas form, or LNG carriers in its liquefied form; few countries transport it by truck.

===Alternative sources===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1898 Testing Sheep for Methane Production.jpg|thumb|Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), [[CSIRO]]]]
Apart from gas fields, an alternative method of obtaining methane is via [[biogas]] generated by the [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of organic matter including [[manure]], wastewater sludge, [[municipal solid waste]] (including landfills), or any other biodegradable feedstock, under anaerobic conditions. [[Rice]] fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth. [[Methane clathrate|Methane hydrates/clathrates]] (ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor, found in vast quantities) are a potential future source of methane.

[[File:Mlo ch4 ts obs 03437.png|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Methane concentrations up to May 2018 (Mauna Loa)]]
In 2010, methane levels in the Arctic were measured at 1850 nmol/mol.  This level is over twice as high as at any time in the last 400,000 years. Historic methane concentrations in the world's atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmol/mol during glacial periods commonly known as [[ice ages]], and between 600 and 700 nmol/mol during the warm [[interglacial]] periods. The Earth's oceans are a potential important source of Arctic methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study Finds Surprising Arctic Methane Emission Source|date=April 22, 2012|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/earth20120422.html|website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methane is an important [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[global warming potential]] of 34 compared to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over a 100-year period, and 72 over a 20-year period.&lt;ref name="AR5WG1"&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] Fifth Assessment Report, [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/WGIAR5_WGI-12Doc2b_FinalDraft_Chapter08.pdf Table 8.7, Chap.&amp;nbsp;8, p.&amp;nbsp;8–58] (PDF; 8,0&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1174760 |title=Improved Attribution of Climate Forcing to Emissions |year=2009 |last1=Shindell |first1=D.

The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750, and it accounts for 20% of the total [[radiative forcing]] from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases (these gases don't include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect).&lt;ref name="Technical summary"/&gt;

===Clathrates===
Methane is essentially insoluble in water, but significant deposits of [[methane clathrate]] have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth at large depths. Estimates consider up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of clathrates (hydrates) in the ocean floor, not accounting for abiotic methane, a relatively newly discovered source of methane, formed below the ocean floor, in the earth crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Maja |last=Sojtaric |url=https://cage.uit.no/news/new-source-methane-discovered-arctic-ocean/ |title=New Source Of Methane Discovered In The Arctic Ocean |date=April 13, 2015 |publisher=CAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested, that today's methane emission regime from the ocean floor, is potentially similar to that during the [[PETM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The interaction of climate change and methane hydrates |year=2017 |doi=10.1002/2016RG000534 |authors=Ruppel and Kessler |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=55 |issue = 1|pages=126–168|bibcode=2017RvGeo..55..126R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Methane is [[nontoxic]], yet it is extremely flammable and may form [[explosive]] mixtures with air. Methane is also an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can [[Cabin pressurization#need for cabin pressurisation|tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects]]. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near [[landfills]] and expose occupants to significant levels of methane.

{{refimprove|date=September 2015}}
A '''mower''' is a person or machine that cuts (mows) [[grass]] or other plants that grow on the ground. Usually mowing is distinguished from reaping, which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for [[harvest]]ing grain [[crops]], e.g. with [[reaper]]s and [[combine harvester|combines]].

A smaller mower used for lawns and sports grounds ([[playing field]]s) is called a ''[[lawn mower]]'' or ''grounds mower'', which is often self-powered, or may also be small enough to be pushed by the operator. Grounds mowers have reel or rotary cutters. 
Larger mowers or ''[[Conditioner (farming)|mower-conditioner]]s'' are mainly used to cut grass (or other crops) for [[hay]] or [[silage]] and often place the cut material into rows, which are referred to as ''[[windrow]]s''. ''[[Swather]]s'' (or ''windrowers'') are also used to cut grass (and grain crops).  Prior to the invention and adoption of mechanized mowers, (and today in places where use a mower is impractical or uneconomical), grass and grain crops were cut by hand using [[scythe]]s or [[sickle]]s.

==Mower configurations==
Larger mowers are usually ''ganged'' (equipped with a number or gang of similar cutting units), so they can adapt individually to ground contours. They may be powered and drawn by a [[tractor]] or [[draft animal]]s. The cutting units can be mounted underneath the tractor between the front and rear [[wheel]]s, mounted on the back with a [[three-point hitch]] or pulled behind the tractor as a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]. There are also dedicated self-propelled cutting machines, which often have the mower units mounted at the front and sides for easy visibility by the driver. ''Boom'' or ''side-arm'' mowers are mounted on long hydraulic arms, similar to a [[backhoe]] arm, which allows the [[tractor]] to mow steep banks or around objects while remaining on a safer surface.

==Mower types==
The cutting mechanism in a mower may be one of several different designs:

===Sickle mower===
[[File:Eicher Mähbalken.jpg|thumb|[[Eicher tractor]] with a mid-mounted finger-bar mower]]
''Sickle mowers'', also called ''reciprocating mowers'', ''bar mowers'', ''sickle-bar mowers'', or ''finger-bar mowers'', have a long (typically six to seven and a half feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates.  In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).

The bar rides on the ground, supported on a skid at the inner end, and it can be tilted to adjust the height of the cut. A spring-loaded board at the outer end of the bar guides the cut hay away from the uncut hay. The so-formed channel, between cut and uncut material, allows the mower skid to ride in the channel and cut only uncut grass cleanly on the next swath. These were the first successful horse-drawn mowers on farms and the general principles still guide the design of modern mowers.

===Rotary mower===
[[File:WindrowerRotaryCutter.JPG|thumb|Rotary cutters mounted on a swather]]
[[Rotary mower]]s, also called ''drum mowers'', have a rapidly rotating bar, or disks mounted on a bar, with sharpened edges that cut the crop. When these mowers are tractor-mounted they are easily capable of mowing grass at up to 20 miles per hour (32&amp;nbsp;km/h) in good conditions. Some models are designed to be mounted in double and triple sets on a tractor, one in the front and one at each side, thus able to cut up to 20 foot (6 metre) swaths.

In rough cutting conditions, the blades attached to the disks are swivelled to absorb blows from obstructions. Mostly these are rear-mounted units and in some countries are called ''scrub cutters''. Self-powered mowers of this type are used for rougher grass in gardening and other land maintenance.

===Reel mower===
[[File:Rusted reel mower.JPG|thumb|Reel mower]]
''Reel mowers'', also called ''cylinder mowers'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelmowers.org|title=Reel Mowers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (familiar as the hand-pushed or self-powered cylinder [[lawn mower]]), have a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel composed of helical blades, each of which in turn runs past a horizontal cutter-bar, producing a continuous scissor action. The bar is held at an adjustable level just above the ground and the reel runs at a speed dependent on the forward movement speed of the machine, driven by wheels running on the ground (or in self-powered applications by a motor). The cut grass may be gathered in a collection bin.

This type of mower is used to produce consistently short and even grass on bowling greens, lawns, parks and sports grounds. When pulled by a tractor (or formerly by a horse), these mowers are often ganged into sets of three, five or more, to form a ''gang mower''.  A well-designed reel mower can cut quite tangled and thick tall grass, but this type works best on fairly short, upright vegetation, as taller vegetation tends to be rolled flat rather than cut.

Home reel mowers have certain benefits over motor-powered mowers as they are quieter and not dependent on any extra form of power besides the person doing the mowing.  This is useful not only to lessen dependence on other types of power which may have availability issues, but also lessens the impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eartheasy.com/article_reel_mower.htm|title=Switching to a reel mower|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flail mower===
[[File:Mähschlegel.JPG|thumb|[[Flail mower]]]]
[[Flail mower]]s have a number of small blades on the end of chains attached to a horizontal axis. The cutting is carried out by the ax-like heads striking the grass at speed. These types are used on rough ground, where the blades may frequently be fouled by other objects, or on tougher vegetation than grass, such as brush (scrub). Due to the length of the chains and the higher weight of the blades, they are better at cutting thick brush than other mowers, because of the relatively high inertia of the blades.  In some types the cut material may be gathered in a collection bin.  As a boom mower (see above), a flail mower may be used in an upright position for trimming the sides of hedges, when it is often called a ''hedge-cutter''.

===Drum mower===
[[File:Fella Radon Drum Mower.jpg|thumb|Fella Radon Drum Mower]]
[[Drum mower]]s have their horizontally-mounted cutting blades attached to the outside of a relatively large diameter disc fixed to the bottom of a smaller diameter drum and are principally designed for cutting lighter crops, such as grass, very quickly. The drive mechanism is top-mounted and often in the form of fully enclosed, bevel geared drive shafts.

The [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) has seven subject-based environmental data centres (EDCs) to store and distribute data from its own research programmes and data that are of general use to the environmental research community. These data centres are sometimes called the NERC designated Data Centres.

== The Data Centres ==

The NERC Environmental Data Centres and their areas of responsibility are as follows:&lt;ref name="NERCds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/|title=Data centres|access-date=26 January 2018|website=[[Natural Environment Research Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002070144/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/|archive-date=2 October 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[British Oceanographic Data Centre]] - Marine Science
* [[Centre for Environmental Data Analysis]] (CEDA), joint responsibility with [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] which include:
** British Atmospheric Data Centre - Atmospheric Science
** NERC Earth Observation Data Centre - Earth Observation
** UK Solar System Data Centre - Solar terrestrial physics (Earth Orientated)
* Environmental Information Data Centre - Terrestrial &amp; Freshwater Science, part of the [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]&lt;ref name="EIDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/|title=Environmental Information Data Centre|publisher=[[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329235911/http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/|archive-date=29 March 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC) - Earth Sciences - part of [[British Geological Survey]]
* Polar Data Centre (UK PDC) - Polar Science - [[British Antarctic Survey]]

The data centres hold data from environmental scientists working in the UK and around the world.
They provide access to a comprehensive data and information resource about our environment, through the NERC Data Catalog Service.  {{As of|2018}} CEDA hosts the NERC Data Catalog Service &lt;ref name="NERC-DCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csw-nerc.ceda.ac.uk/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home|title=NERC Data Catalog Service|access-date=26 January 2018|website=Centre for Environmental Data Analysis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126132554/https://csw-nerc.ceda.ac.uk/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home|archive-date=26 January 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, data may also be cataloged from certain NERC Data Centres and also at [[data.gov.uk]].
Access to these data is freely available to students, researchers and stakeholders, as well as business users and policy makers, to help them understand the environment in which we live.

Each data centre works to build user confidence, using common data formats and noting sources, contexts, and degrees of accuracy. They combine expertise in the scientific collection of information, state-of-the-art data management and preservation techniques, making them an important national asset.

== NERC Data Policy ==

The NERC Data Policy is commitment to support the long-term management of environmental data and also outlines the roles and responsibilities of all those involved in collecting and managing environmental data. The NERC Data Centres provide support and guidance in data management to those funded by NERC, are responsible for the long-term management of data and provide access to NERC's holdings of environmental data.

The data policy is consistent with legal frameworks, such as the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, the INSPIRE Regulations 2009 and contractual arrangements with other bodies where, for example, NERC holds data on their behalf but does not own the intellectual property rights.

To reflect NERC's continuing commitment to openness and transparency in the research process, and in support of the government's developing agenda on open access to public data, the NERC Data Policy has been substantially revised, and this new version of NERC's Data Policy came into force in January 2011.&lt;ref name="NERCpolicy11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/policy2011.asp|title=NERC Data Policy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703101154/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/policy2011.asp|archive-date=3 July 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charging Policy ===

The NERC charging regime recognises two classes of data:

# Raw or unrefined - these are data collected (or held) by NERC, with any necessary quality assurance or post processing applied, and used to deliver NERC's public function;
# Value added or refined - these are data where an extra level of intellectual input has been added, for example, by combining a number of data sets together, or producing an information product by the interpretation of a number of data sets, and crucially, is above and beyond what is required to deliver NERC's public function.

The licence charges that NERC can levy for the supply of data and information are governed by HM Treasury guidance and Government regulations.
During 2010 NERC aimed to move to a position where it will supply its data for free for all teaching and research activities, apart from large or complex requests where they may make a nominal handling charge.

== Science Information Strategy ==

The NERC Science Information Strategy (SIS) was created to provide the framework for NERC to work more closely and effectively with its scientific communities, both internal and external, in delivering data and information management services to support its five-year science strategy, the Next Generation Science for Planet Earth 2007-2012.&lt;ref name="NERC-SIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/sis.asp|title=NERC Science Information Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708040031/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/sis.asp|archive-date=8 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strategy2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/strategy/ngscience.asp|title=NERC's strategy - Next Generation Science for Planet Earth: 2007-2012|archive-date=3 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703105236/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/strategy/ngscience.asp|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Science Information Strategy is being implemented in three phases, beginning April 2010. Each of these phases will be made up of a number of smaller projects. Project/Phase 1 will concentrate on determining user requirements, documenting existing holdings, agreeing an information architecture, updating the NERC Data Policy and improving the data discovery tools.

The benefits of the SIS implementation for science include the increased competence of data centre staff to inform the science community, policy and decision makers nationally and internationally on best practice, standards development and the establishment of new projects and initiatives (e.g. EU Framework projects):enhancing NERC's national and international reputation and increased capability to conduct multi-disciplinary, integrated science.

'''Polyglot persistence''' is the concept of using different data storage technologies to handle different data storage needs within a given software application. '''[[Polyglot_(computing)|Polyglot programming]]''', a term coined by Neal Ford in 2006, expresses the idea that computer applications should be written in a mix of different [[programming language]]s, in order to take advantage of the fact that different languages are suitable for tackling different problems. Complex applications combine different types of problems, so picking the right language for each job may be more productive than trying to solve all aspects of the problem using a single language. This same concept can be applied to [[database]]s, that an application can communicate with different [[database]]s, using each for what it is best at to achieve an end goal, hence the term ''polyglot persistence''.

There are numerous [[database]]s available to solve different problems. Using a single database to satisfy all of a program's requirements can result in a [[Computer performance|non-performant]], "jack of all trades, master of none" solution. [[Relational database management system|Relational databases]], for example, are good at enforcing relationships that exist between various data tables. To discover a relationship or to find data from different tables that belong to the same object, an [[SQL]] [[Join (SQL)|join]] operation can be used. This might work when the data is smaller in size, but becomes problematic when the data involved grows larger. A [[graph database]] might solve the problem of relationships in case of [[Big data|Big Data]], but it might not solve the problem of [[database transaction]]s, which are provided by [[Relational database management system|RDBM systems]]. Instead, a [[NoSQL]] [[Document-oriented database|document database]] might be used to store unstructured data for that particular part of the problem. Thus different problems are solved by different database systems, all within the same application.

A '''portable computer''' was a [[computer]] designed to be easily&lt;ref&gt;as contrasted with [[DYSEAC]] and [[MOBIDIC]], 1950s era military systems which were Truck-based/"movable by truck"&lt;/ref&gt; moved from one place to another and included a display and keyboard. 
The first commercially sold portable was the 50 pound [[IBM 5100]], introduced 1975. The next major portables were [[Osborne Computer Corporation|Osborne]]'s 24 pound [[CP/M]]-based [[Osborne 1]] (1981) and [[Compaq Computer Corporation|Compaq]]'s 28 pound 100% IBM [[PC compatible]] [[Compaq Portable]] (1983).  These "luggable"s lacked the next technological advance, not requiring an external power source;&lt;ref name=Sh.Fr&gt;{{cite web 
|url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/first-portable-computer.htm
|title=What was the first portable computer? |author=Shanna Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; that feature was introduced by the [[laptop]].&lt;ref&gt;"and plug in instead of relying on battery power."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sh.Fr/&gt; Laptops were followed by lighter models, so that in the 2000s [[mobile device]]s and by 2007 [[smartphone]]s made the term almost meaningless. The 2010s introduced [[wearable computer]]s such as [[smartwatch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/1/181635-wearables/abstract|title=Wearables: Has the Age of Smartwatches Finally Arrived? {{!}} January 2015 {{!}} Communications of the ACM|last=Petre|first=Reza Rawassizadeh, Blaine A Price, Marian|website=cacm.acm.org|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Portable computers, by their nature, were generally [[microcomputer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name: |url=http://acmeportable.com/portable-computer/ |title=What is a Portable Computer? &amp;#124; ACME Portable Machines |publisher=Acmeportable.com |date=2014-05-23 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger portable computers were commonly known as 'Lunchbox' or 'Luggable' computers. They were also called a 'Portable Workstation' or 'Portable PC'. In [[Japan]] they were often called {{Nihongo|'Bentocom'.|ベントコン|Bentokon}} from "[[bento]]".

Portable computers, more narrowly defined, were distinct from [[desktop replacement computer]]s in that they usually were constructed from full-specification desktop components, and did not incorporate features associated with laptops or mobile devices. A portable computer in this usage, versus a laptop or other [[mobile computing]] [[mobile device|device]], had a standard [[motherboard]] or [[backplane]] providing plug-in slots for add-in cards. This allowed mission specific cards such as test, A/D, or communication protocol (IEEE-488, 1553) to be installed. Portable computers also provided for more disk storage by using standard disk drives and providing for multiple drives.

==History==
===SCAMP===
In 1973, the [[IBM]] Palo Alto Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based on the [[IBM PALM processor|IBM PALM]] processor with a [[Philips]] compact cassette drive, small [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and  full function keyboard. SCAMP emulated an [[IBM 1130]] minicomputer in order to run APL\1130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Shanna |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/first-portable-computer.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "What was the first portable computer?" |publisher=Computer.howstuffworks.com |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[APL (programming language)|APL]] was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the [[Wang 2200]] or [[HP 9800 series|HP 9800]] offered only [[BASIC]]. Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL\1130 performance on a portable, single user computer, ''PC Magazine'' in 1983 designated SCAMP a "revolutionary concept" and "the world's first personal computer".&lt;ref&gt;''PC Magazine'', Vol. 2, No. 6, November 1983, ‘’SCAMP: The Missing Link in the PC's Past?‘’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc/pc_2.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 5100 Portable Computer |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM 5100===
Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to the first commercial [[IBM 5100]] portable microcomputer launched in 1975. The product incorporated an [[IBM PALM processor|IBM PALM]] processor, 5 inch [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], full function keyboard and the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians and other business problem-solvers. [[IBM]] referred to its [[IBM PALM processor|PALM]] processor as a [[microprocessor]], though they used that term to mean a processor that executes [[microcode]] to implement a higher-level [[instruction set]], rather than its conventional definition of a complete processor on a single [[silicon]] [[integrated circuit]]. In the late 1960s, such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton. In comparison, the IBM 5100 weighed about 53 pounds (24 kg and very portable for that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advantech.com/products/Portable-Computers/sub_1-2JKOHS.aspx |title=Industrial Portable Computers |publisher=Advantech |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIT Suitcase Computer===
The MIT Suitcase Computer, constructed in 1975, was the first known microprocessor-based portable computer.  It was based on the [[Motorola 6800]].  Constructed in a Samsonite suitcase approximately 20"x30"x8" and weighing approximately 20&amp;nbsp;lbs., it had 4K of SRAM, a serial port to accept downloaded software and connect to a modem, a keyboard and a 40-column thermal printer taken from a cash register.  Built by student David Emberson in the MIT Digital Systems Laboratory as a thesis project, it never entered production.  It is currently in the collection of Dr. Hoo-Min D. Toong.{{fact|date=May 2015}}

===Xerox NoteTaker===
[[Xerox NoteTaker]], developed in 1976 at [[Xerox PARC]], was a precursor to later portable computers from [[Osborne Computer Corporation]] and [[Compaq]], though it remained a prototype and did not enter production. 

===Micro Star or Small One===
An early portable computer was manufactured in 1979 by GM Research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/X1243.96 Computer History Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; a small company in Santa Monica, California.  The machine which was designed and [http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US4294496 patented]  by James Murez.  It was called the Micro Star and later changed the name to The Small One.  Although Xerox claims to have designed the first such system, the machine by Murez predated anything on the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time{{snd}} hence the patent was issued.  As early as 1979, the U.S. Government was contracting to purchase these machines.  Other major customers included Sandia Labs, General Dynamics, BBN (featured on the cover of their annual report in 1980 as the C.A.T. system) and several dozen private individuals and companies around the world. In 1979, [[Adam Osborne]] viewed the machine along with several hundred other visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the IEEE Westec in Los Angeles.  Later that year the machine was also shown at the first [[COMDEX]] show.

===Portal R2E CCMC===
[[File:Micro ordinateur portable le PORTAL de R2E CCMC.jpg|thumb|R2E CCMC [[Portal (computer)|Portal]] laptop in September 1980 at the SICOB show in PARIS]]
The portable micro computer the "[[Portal (computer)|Portal]]" of the French company R2E [[Micral]] CCMC officially appeared in September 1980 at the Sicob show in Paris. The Portal was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department of the french firm R2E Micral in 1980 at the request of the company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. The Portal was based on an intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2&amp;nbsp;MHz. It was equipped with a central 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, a keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys (separate blocks), a 32-character screen, a floppy disk: capacity = 140 000 characters, of a thermal printer: speed = 28  characters / sec, an asynchronous channel, a synchronous channel, a 220&amp;nbsp;V power supply. Designed for an operating temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;°C to 35&amp;nbsp;°C, it weighed 12&amp;nbsp;kg and its dimensions were 45 × 45 × 15&amp;nbsp;cm. It provided total mobility. Its operating system was [[Prolog]].  A few hundred were sold between 1980 and 1983.

===Osborne 1===
The first mass-produced microprocessor-based portable computer released in 1981 was the [[Osborne 1]], developed by Osborne, which owed much to the NoteTaker's design.

===Kaypro===
Another early portable computer released in 1982 was the [[Kaypro]]. 

===Compaq Portable===
In January 1983, the first [[IBM PC compatible]] portable computer (and the first 100% IBM PC compatible, or "clone," of any kind) was the [[Compaq Portable]]. 

===Commodore SX-64===
The first full-color portable computer was the [[Commodore SX-64]] in January 1984. 

===Apple Macintosh===
[[Apple Inc.]] introduced and released [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989.

==Modern use==
Smaller portable computers are also known as [[mobile computer]]s. They are referred to by their more specific terms:

* The [[laptop]] (or notebook) with a [[flat panel display]] and [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], requiring a seated position and both hands. A relatively recently introduced modification has been the [[tablet computer|tablet PC]], which has a monitor with a touch-sensitive screen.  See also [[desktop replacement computer]], a large laptop designed to perform all of the functions of a [[desktop computer]].
* The [[sub-notebook]] which is something between a laptop and a [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]. They have a full keyboard (though often in reduced size), 11–13" screens and usually no internal optical drive.
* [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s are more portable, and have even fewer peripherals. 
* The [[wearable computer]] with [[hands-free]] [[User interface|interface]], and usually some  voice capability ([[speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]]).

Portable computers have been increasing in popularity over the past decade, as they do not restrict the user in terms of mobility as a [[desktop computer]] would. Wireless access to the [[Internet]], extended [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] life and more comfortable [[ergonomics]] have been factors driving this increase in popularity. [[All-in-One PC]]s such as the [[iMac]] can also be considered portable computers and often have handles built into the case. [[Home theater PC|Home theater computers]] (HTPC) tend to be much smaller than desktop computers, but still require a power source.

'''Remote and virtual tower''' (RVT) is a new concept where the [[air traffic service]] (ATS) at an airport is performed somewhere else than in the local [[control tower]].

The first remote tower implementation providing aerodrome ATS  was approved and introduced into operations in Sweden in April 2015, with further
implementations in other EASA Member States well underway. (EASA, 2017)

==Concept==

The [[air traffic control officer]] (ATCO) or [[aerodrome flight information service]]s officer (AFISO) will be re-located to a remote tower centre (RTC) from where they will provide the [[Air traffic service|ATS]].

The RVT concept is aiming at providing:

* Remote tower services at small and medium size airports, by personnel located at a remote tower centre somewhere else.
* Contingency services at major airports, in the case of fire or other events which could take place at the [[control tower]] building. The contingency facility should be at safe, nearby, but different physical location.
* Synthetic augmentation of vision to increase [[situational awareness]] at airports during poor visibility conditions at the local airport control tower facilities.

The full range of [[air traffic service]]s defined in [[ICAO]] Documents 4444,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icao.int&lt;/ref&gt; 9426 and [[EUROCONTROL]]’s Manual for AFIS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurocontrol.int/airspace/public/standard_page/1464_Library.html&lt;/ref&gt; will still be provided remotely by an [[Air Traffic Control Officer|ATCO]] or AFISO. The [[airspace]] users should be provided with the appropriate level of services as if the [[Air traffic service|ATS]] were provided locally at the airport.

The [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]] projects are looking at RVT concepts, based on either one person controlling one airport, or one person controlling multiple airports.

==Technology==

The basic concept, formerly known as virtual towers, was introduced by [[German Aerospace Center|Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR)]] in 2002 and describes a remote ATC control room with video-sensor based surveillance instead of 'out-of-the-window' view from a real tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/Portaldata/1/Resources/management_admin/aussenbeziehungen/WettbewerbVisionen_screen.pdf Wettbewerb der Visionen 2001-2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The initial trials of remote ATS, for low and medium-density airports, have been based on [[optical]] sensors (cameras), providing the ATCOs at the RTC with a high-quality real-time image of the runway, the [[airport ramp]] (APRON) and the very nearby [[airspace]]. These real-time images are displayed at large monitors providing up to 360-degree view.

Beside the live video feed from the airport, the ATCOs have available the same [[air traffic management]] [[computer systems]] as they would have in a local control tower building, being [[voice communication]] systems, [[meteorological]] systems, [[flight plan]] systems, and [[Surveillance]] display systems. The level of equipage might depend on whether it is a controlled TWR service, or a Flight Information Service being provided at the specific airport.
Depending on the complexity of the airport, the traffic densities, and weather conditions, it might be preferable to complement the optical images with an  [[SMGCS|advanced surface movement guidance and control system]] (A-SMGCS) with signal inputs from surface movement [[radar]] (SMR) and/or Local Area [[Multilateration]] (LAM).

==Development and validation==
The RVT concept is under development, besides of other former research &amp; development inititaives (e.g. by [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]], DFS, LFV, Searidge Technologies, SAAB, FREQUENTIS, [[Indra Sistemas]] or the FP6 EU project ART, etc.), as part of the [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]] (SJU), where work package 6&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wp-6-airport-operations--193&lt;/ref&gt; develops the operational concepts, while Work Package 12&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sesarju.eu/programme/workpackages/wp-12-airport-systems--199&lt;/ref&gt; develops the corresponding technology to enable the RVT functionality.

There will be carried out live [[SESAR Joint Undertaking|SESAR]] validation trials at a few selected airports in Germany, Spain ([[ENAIRE]]), Norway ([[Avinor]]) and Sweden ([http://www.lfv.se Luftfartsverket]) as part of [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]] Projects 06.08.04 and 06.09.03 during the years 2012–2015.

[[Airservices Australia]] intends to evaluate RVT technology from [[Saab Group]] at [[Alice Springs]] airport in Central Australia from late 2012, with the control centre placed in [[Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canso.org/cms/showpage.aspx?id=2889&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, [[Saab Group]] and [http://www.lfv.se Luftfartsverket] (LFV) carried out a live shadow mode demonstration of their existing remote tower concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canso.org/cms/showpage.aspx?id=425&lt;/ref&gt;
This demonstration took place at a remote tower centre facility established at [[Malmö]] air traffic control centre (ATCC), controlling a flight in and out of [[Angelholm]] airport ([[ICAO airport code|ICAO]]:ESTA) in southern [[Sweden]]. As a contingency mechanism during this trial, the local control tower at [[Angelholm]] was staffed by [[air traffic control officer|ATCOs]].

In 2010 DLR carried out the first human in the loop remote tower center simulation, whereas a remote controller operated traffic at two different low frequented airports simoultanouesly. Despite several biases the controllers' situation awareness was over-average and their workload remained in average range and operational feasibility could be shown the first time.

DLR Institute of Flight Guidance, [[Saab Group]], [http://www.lfv.se Luftfartsverket], Indra and DFS have been the major driving forces behind the Remote Tower development, and are all represented in the [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]] projects, SAAB through North European ATM Industry Group ([http://www.sesarju.eu/players/members/natmig--28 NATMIG)] and LFV [http://www.noracon.aero NORACON].

During [http://www.atcglobalhub.com/home ATC Global] in [[Amsterdam]] in March 2011, [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]] had a ceremony where Project 6.9.3 'Remote &amp; Virtual Tower' was given the award for 'most advanced for deployment'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sesarju.eu/news-press/news/sesar-awards-770&lt;/ref&gt; The price was presented by Executive Director of [[SESAR Joint Undertaking]] [http://www.sesarju.eu/about/team/patrick-ky--45 Mr Patrick Ky], and received by Project 6.9.3 Project Manager Mr Göran Lindqvist, [http://www.noracon.aero NORACON].

==RVT in operation==

As of 21 April 2015 12:00 am, the airport of Örnsköldsvik/Gideå ([[Örnsköldsvik Airport|OER]]/ESNO) is run using remote ATC services from Sundsvall/Midlanda ([[Sundsvall-Härnösand Airport|SDL]]/ESNN). This is reported to be the first production deployment of RVT in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=110&amp;artikel=6146607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gizmag.com/saab-remote-tower-system/37191/&lt;/ref&gt;  The system was tested at [[Leesburg Executive Airport]] in summer 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leesburgva.gov/government/departments/airport/remote-air-traffic-control-tower&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2015 the FAA announced Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport as the first official FAA approved Virtual Air Traffic Control Tower test site in the United States.  The equipment necessary for the testing is expected to be installed at the Fort Collins-Loveland Municipal Airport by spring of 2016, with initial testing and assessments of the new virtual technology commencing shortly thereafter. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Virtual Air Traffic Control Tower Test Facility Announced|url = http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/CODOT/bulletins/11d0af7?reqfrom=share|website = Colorado Department of Transportation|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible benefits==

The main benefits of RVT is expected to be on cost efficiency.

The cost savings originate from the following factors:

* No need to build and maintain control tower buildings and facilities at the local airports
* More efficient use of human resources (ATCOs and AFISOs), especially by serving multiple airports with medium to low traffic levels from a centralised location
* Reduced need to establish and maintain ATM systems locally at the airports. By using [[data communication|data communication networks]] from the local airport to the remote tower centre, several technical systems can be centralised, hence costs savings are possible

There is also a great potential to better and more cost efficiently serve flights which either are scheduled outside the core opening hours of the airport, or by being able to serve non scheduled traffic (ambulance flights and search-and-rescue helicopters) with an [[air traffic service]] during night time when a smaller airports would normally be closed.

== Standardisation ==
In 2014 the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment  ([[European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment|EUROCAE]]) founded the Working Group (WG) 100 “Remote and Virtual Tower”. The WG-100 was launched under the Chair of the [[German Aerospace Center]] - DLR and [[Eurocontrol|EUROCONTROL]] in the Secretary role. WG-100 further consists of active contributors (air navigation service manufatcurers &amp; service providers) from more than 30 companies worldwide and acts in close coordination with [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[SESAR Joint Undertaking|SESAR]], and the most recent SESAR2020 project "[http://www.remote-tower.eu/ PJ05 Remote Tower]". The group was tasked as a first step to develop standards for remote towers optical systems. In September 2016 the ED-240 MINIMUM AVIATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION (MASPS) FOR REMOTE TOWER OPTICAL SYSTEMS document was published. These MASPS are applicable to all optical sensor configurations (visible, as well as infrared spectrum) to be used for the implementation of the remote provision of ATS to an aerodrome, encompassing the whole chain from sensor to display. This standard should help vendors and customers to quantify an optimal operational system performance and to verify it in a standardised way. For the time being the WG-100 work focuses on an extension of the current MASPS (revision A) to include ‘visual tracking’ and automatic Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera object following technologies. ‘Visual tracking’ is understood as the augmentation of the display of objects on the visual presentation by using information obtained only by image processing of the video from the optical sensors for the purpose of increasing the operator’s situation awareness. The PTZ Object Following function attaches the PTZ camera to a moving target and persistently follows and displays it automatically. The MASPS ED-240A are expected to be published by 2018.

==Disruptive technology==

While some may argue, there are strong similarities between the concept of RVT, and the criteria for [[disruptive innovation]]s as defined by [[Clayton Christensen]] and [[Michael Raynor]] in the book [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUsn9uIgkAUC&amp;dq=isbn:1578518520&amp;hl=en "Innovators Solution".] A closer examination of the technology and its practical use would indicate that it is more appropriately categorized as a sustainable innovation, marking an evolution in aerodrome control by supplanting visual observation with a surveillance system.

A '''rewrite''' in [[computer programming]] is the act or result of re-implementing a large portion of existing functionality without re-use of its [[source code]] or [[writing inscription]]. When the rewrite is not using existing code at all, it is common to speak of a '''rewrite from scratch'''.

==Motivations==
A piece of software is typically rewritten when one or more of the following apply:
*its [[Orphaned work|source code is not available]] or is only available under an [[License compatibility|incompatible]] [[license]]
*its code cannot be adapted to a new target platform
*its existing code has become too difficult to handle and extend
*the task of [[debugging]] it seems too complicated
*the programmer finds it difficult to understand its source code
*developers learn new techniques or wish to do a big feature overhaul which requires much change
*developers learn that new codes written may extend content options that can fix or overwrite previous problems
*the [[programming language]] of the source code has to be changed

==Risks==
Several software engineers, such as [[Joel Spolsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spolsky|first1=Joel|title=Things You Should Never Do, Part I|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html|website=Joel on Software|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; have warned against total rewrites, especially under schedule constraints or competitive pressures. While developers may initially welcome the chance to correct historical design mistakes, a rewrite also discards those parts of the design that work as required. A rewrite commits the development team to deliver not just new features, but all those that exist in the previous code, while potentially introducing new bugs or [[Software regression|regressions]] of previously fixed bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ronkes.nl/blog/?2005-04-15-neverrewritecode | title=Never Rewrite Code From Scratch | first=Joost | last=Ronkes Agerbeek | date=April 15, 2005 | accessdate=2008-09-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010211819/http://www.ronkes.nl/blog/?2005-04-15-neverrewritecode | archivedate=October 10, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spolsky"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html | title=Things You Should Never Do | first=Joel | last=Spolsky | authorlink=Joel Spolsky | date=April 6, 2000 | accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rewrite also interferes with the tracking of unfixed bugs in the old version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html | title=Cascade of Attention-Deficit Teenagers | first=Jamie | last=Zawinski | authorlink=Jamie Zawinski | accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incremental rewrite is an alternative approach, in which developers gradually replace the existing code with calls into a new implementation, expanding that implementation until it fully replaces the old one. This approach avoids a broad loss of functionality during the rewrite. [[Cleanroom software engineering]] is another approach, which requires the team to work from an exhaustive written specification of the software's functionality, without access to its code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=115511 | title=Rewriting, from scratch, a huge code base | first=Ben | last=Tilly | date=September 29, 2001 | accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
[[Netscape]]'s project to improve HTML layout in [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] 4 has been cited as an example of a failed rewrite. The new layout engine ([[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]) had developed independently from Navigator and did not integrate readily with Navigator's code; hence Navigator itself was rewritten around the new engine, breaking many existing features and delaying release by several months. Meanwhile, [[Microsoft]] focused on incremental improvements to [[Internet Explorer]] and did not face the same obstacles.&lt;ref name="spolsky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html | title=resignation and postmortem | first=Jamie | last=Zawinski | authorlink=Jamie Zawinski | date=March 31, 1999 | accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Navigator itself was a successful cleanroom rewrite of [[NCSA Mosaic]] overseen by that program's developers.

A '''standby generator''' is a back-up electrical system that operates automatically.&lt;ref name=Hickey02&gt;Robert B. Hickey ''Electrical Construction Databook'', McGraw Hill, 2002 {{ISBN|0-07-137349-7}}, Chapter 14 &lt;/ref&gt; Within seconds of a utility [[Power outage|outage]] an automatic [[transfer switch]] senses the power loss, commands the generator to start and then transfers the [[electrical load]] to the [[Electric generator|generator]]. The standby generator begins supplying power to the [[Electrical network|circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=325|title=AC Power Systems Handbook, Third Edition|author=Jerry C. Whitaker|isbn=0849340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; After utility power returns, the automatic transfer switch transfers the electrical load back to the utility and signals the standby generator to shut off.  It then returns to standby mode where it awaits the next outage. To ensure a proper response to an outage, a standby generator runs weekly self-tests. Most units run on [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[natural gas]], or [[propane|liquid propane gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Backup Power for the Individual and Volunteer, Part I: Generators|url=https://www.disaster.com/backup-power-for-the-individual-and-volunteer-part-i-generators/|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=December 8, 2014|author=Zachariah Amela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''storage water heater''', or a '''hot water system''' ('''HWS'''), is a domestic [[water heating]] appliance that uses a [[hot water storage tank]] to maximize heating capacity and provide instantaneous delivery of hot water.&lt;ref name=selectionguide&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoeschele|first=M|title=Strategy Guideline: Proper Water Heater Selection|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|location=Golden, CO|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/55074.pdf|author2=Springer, D. |author3=German, A. |author4=Staller, J. |author5= Zhang, Y. |accessdate=28 March 2013|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional storage water heaters use a variety of fuels, including [[natural gas]], [[propane]], [[fuel oil]], and [[electricity]]. Less conventional water heating technologies, such as heat pump water heaters and [[solar water heating|solar water heaters]], can also be categorized as storage water heaters.

== Solar ==
[[File:Photothermic module.png|thumb|Photothermic modules (or solar heat flat panel collectors) are increasingly used in the world.]]
[[File:Solar thermal roof.png|thumb|Solar vacuum tubes have poorer efficiency at 80°C but work better in cold and windy conditions.]]
{{Main|Solar water heating}}
Solar heat is clean and renewable. This is the most modern system. Increasingly, [[solar power#Solar heating systems|solar powered]] water heaters are being used.  Their solar collectors are installed outside dwellings, typically on the roof or walls or nearby, and the potable [[hot water storage tank]] is typically a pre-existing or new conventional water heater, or a water heater specifically designed for solar thermal.

The most basic solar thermal models are the direct-gain type, in which the potable water is directly sent into the collector.  Many such systems are said to use ''integrated collector storage'' (ICS), as direct-gain systems typically have storage integrated within the collector.  Heating water directly is inherently more efficient than heating it indirectly via heat exchangers, but such systems offer very limited freeze protection (if any), can easily heat water to temperatures unsafe for domestic use, and ICS systems suffer from severe heat loss on cold nights and cold, cloudy days.

By contrast, ''indirect'' or ''closed-loop'' systems do not allow potable water through the panels, but rather pump a heat transfer fluid (either water or a water/antifreeze mix) through the panels.  After collecting heat in the panels, the heat transfer fluid flows through a [[heat exchanger]], transferring its heat to the potable hot water.  When the panels are cooler than the storage tank or when the storage tank has already reached its maximum temperature, the controller in closed-loop systems will stop the circulation pumps.  In a ''drainback'' system, the water drains into a storage tank contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space, protected from freezing temperatures.  With antifreeze systems, however, the pump ''must'' be run if the panel temperature gets too hot (to prevent degradation of the antifreeze) or too cold (to prevent the water/antifreeze mixture from freezing.)

Flat panel collectors are typically used in closed-loop systems.  Flat panels, which often resemble [[skylight (window)|skylights]], are the most durable type of collector, and they also have the best performance for systems designed for temperatures within {{convert|100|F|C}} of [[ambient temperature]].  Flat panels are regularly used in both pure water and antifreeze systems.

Another type of solar collector is the ''evacuated tube collector'', which are intended for cold climates that do not experience severe hail and/or applications where high temperatures are needed (i.e., over {{convert|200|F|C}}).  Placed in a rack, evacuated tube collectors form a row of glass tubes, each containing absorption fins attached to a central heat-conducting rod (copper or condensation-driven).  The ''evacuated'' description refers to the vacuum created in the glass tubes during the manufacturing process, which results in very low heat loss and lets evacuated tube systems achieve extreme temperatures, far in excess of water's boiling point.

== Fossil fuel fired water heaters ==
[[File:Burner assembly of a water heater.jpg|thumb|Burner assembly of a gas-fired water heater]]
[[Image:Boiler and Cylinder.jpg|thumb|right|Gas furnace (top) and storage water heater (bottom) (Germany)]]

Natural gas and propane storage water heaters operate identically with a gas or propane burner located at the bottom of the storage tank heating the water. Fuel oil fired storage water heaters are configured similarly by igniting a vaporizing mist of oil and air with an electric spark.&lt;ref name=eereconventional&gt;{{cite web|title=Conventional Storage Water Heaters|url=http://energy.gov/eere/energybasics/articles/conventional-storage-water-heater-basics|work=eere.energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emissions from fossil fuel fired water heaters are expelled using a variety of venting technologies. Atmospheric vented systems use room air as combustion air and exhaust air. The exhaust air is expelled through the exhaust flue by [[buoyancy]] forces resulting from the [[combustion]]. Power vent models operate similarly to atmospheric vent systems, but an exhaust fan is added to aid in the expulsion of combustion gases. Direct vent systems do not use room air for combustion; instead, buoyancy forces air from the outside through the water heater combustion system and finally exhausts the combustion gases to the outside. Powered direct-vent systems include an exhaust fan to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.&lt;ref name=CPE&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Gas Water Heaters|url=http://www.centerpointenergy.com/staticfiles/CNP/Common/SiteAssets/doc/builder_water_heater&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;.pdf|publisher=Center Point Energy|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wood ==

As fossil fuels, burning wood causes greenhouse effect gases. However, wood is a renewable source of energy. A sustainable heat system would be to use solar heat in the summer, and the minimum of wood in the winter, thanks to maximum insulation.

== Electric water heaters ==
[[File:Consommation energie residentiel.png|thumb|Use of electricity in all-electrical French homes]]
Most electric water heaters use electric resistance elements to heat the water in the storage tank using two electric resistance elements, which are located at the bottom and top of the storage tank. Each element is controlled by an independent thermostat. In two element tanks the lower element provides recovery from standby losses and the upper element provides heating during periods of large hot water use. Some resistance water heaters contain only a lower element.&lt;ref name=eereconventional /&gt;

Electrical water heaters that store hot water can be a good match for an intelligent electrical power distribution system, heating when the electrical grid load is low and turning off when the load is high.  This could be implemented by allowing the power supplier to send [[loadshedding]] requests, or by the use of real-time energy pricing.  See [[Economy 7]].

Heat pump water heaters use an [[air source heat pumps|air source heat pump]] to transfer thermal energy from the air around the unit into the storage tank. Electric resistance element(s) are typically included to provide backup heating if the heat pump cannot provide sufficient heating capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Pump Water Heaters|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/heat-pump-water-heaters|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sparn, B., K. Hudon, and D. Christensen. (2014).

== Thermal and electrical systems ==

Most of the energy used in making electricity is lost as heat.

It is possible to send electricity more than 200 km, but moving thermal energy becomes impractical beyond about 1 km. The whole thermal system can be thought of as a way to transport heat over long distances.

A '''sugarcane harvester''' is a large piece of [[agricultural machinery]] used to harvest and partially process [[sugarcane]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=-PA94&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JfVZToXuPMeisQKWip3KDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Sugar-Cane Harvester Cuts Forty-Tons an Hour" ''Popular Mechanics Monthly'', July 1930]&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine, originally developed in the 1920s, remains similar in function and design to the [[combine harvester]]. Essentially a storage vessel on a truck with a mechanical extension, the machine cuts the stalks at the base, strips the leaves off, and then cuts the cane into segments. These are then deposited into either the on-board container, or a separate vehicle traveling alongside. Waste material is then ejected back onto the field, where it acts as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zelmeroz.com/album_rail/ctn/ctn_07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bae.ksu.edu/precisionag/Papers/Fiber%20Optic%20Yield%20Monitor%20for%20a%20Sugarcane%20Harvester.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-1109102-124123/unrestricted/Benjamin_thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/SW10000603/00001 |title=Sugar cane harvester machine loading wagons (4) |publisher=Ufdc.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ian.umces.edu/imagelibrary/displayimage-topn-22-1081.html |title=Sugarcane Harvester - Most viewed - Photo (JPG) - IAN Image and Video Library - Free High Resolution and Vector Environmental Science Images |publisher=Ian.umces.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Survival knives''' are [[knife|knives]] intended for [[survival skills|survival]] purposes in a [[wilderness]] environment, often in an emergency when the user has lost most of his/her main equipment. Military units issue some type of survival knife to pilots in the event their plane may be shot down. Survival knives can be used for trapping, skinning, wood cutting, wood carving, and other uses. Hunters, hikers, and outdoor sport enthusiasts use survival knives. Some survival knives are heavy-bladed and thick. Other survival knives are lightweight or fold in order to save weight and bulk as part of a larger [[survival kit]]. Their functions often include serving as a [[hunting knife]].&lt;ref name="FS"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Field &amp; Stream Wilderness Survival Handbook|last=McDougall|first=Len|publisher=The Lyons Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-58574-356-8|location=|pages=76–90|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features, such as hollow handles that could be used as storage space for matches or similar small items, began gaining popularity in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;  Custom or semi-custom makers such as Americans [[Jimmy Lile]], [[Randall Made Knives|Bo Randall]], and [[Chris Reeve]] are often credited with inventing those features.&lt;ref name="BL1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=Bud|year=1992|title=Chris Reeve Knives We Put Two Of His One-Piece Knives To The Test With Unexpected Results|journal=Knives Illustrated|publisher=|volume=|issue=|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite book|title=Randall Knives: Rare, Unique, &amp; Experimental|last=Hunt|first=Robert E.|publisher=Turner Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59652-217-6|location=|pages=143–147|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the survival knife ==
Prior to the late 19th century, outdoorsmen and military personnel did not use knives that were notably different from the knives used by butchers. [[Blade]]s were relatively thin and the handles were often no more than two wooden slabs riveted to the [[Tang (tools)|tang]]. Serrations appeared on knives in the 19th century for use as a wood saw or fish scaler.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Mark|year=1987|title=Survival Knives|url=|journal=Black Belt|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|volume=25|issue=2|pages=40–48|doi=|id=|authorlink=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the turn of the century, Webster L. Marble introduced the modern concept of the "hunting knife." These knives incorporated heavier blades, crossguards, and pommels. They very much resembled miniaturized [[bowie knife|Bowie knives]]. Case, Cattaraugus, and other cutlery manufacturers soon introduced similar knives of their own and it is from these that the modern concept of the survival knife is descended. These knives, along with [[machete]]s and [[bolo knife|bolo]]s constituted survival knives as used by military, explorers, and outdoorsmen up through at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="GP"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pacella | first = Gerard | authorlink = | title = 100 Legendary Knives | publisher = Krause Publications| year = 2002| location = | pages = 224| isbn = 0-87349-417-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During WWII, survival knives were issued to aircraft crew, as it was a real possibility that these personnel might be shot down over wilderness or behind enemy lines.  Lifeboats aboard naval vessels also frequently contained survival kits including knives.  These knives varied in design from one branch of the service to another and from one nation to another. The majority of them were simply commercial knives purchased in bulk by the military. From the Vietnam-era and to present, purpose-built survival knives evolved.&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Special Forces: A Guide to America's Special Operations Units-The World's Most Elite Fighting Force|last=Southworth|first=Samuel A.|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-306-81165-4|location=|pages=113–114|authorlink=|author2=Stephen Tanner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Randall's designs which became a popular fighting knife for troops in Vietnam was the Number 14 "Attack" Model.  During Vietnam, Randall received feedback from a Combat Surgeon in the US Army's 94th Medical Detachment named Captain George Ingraham.  Ingraham's request was for serrations on the spine to cut through the fuselage of downed aircraft to rescue trapped personnel and a hollow handle to allow storage of survival gear.  Randall made the changes and the result was the first of the modern survival knives.&lt;ref name ="GP"/&gt;

Some militaries (including Finland, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, Germany, Soviet Union and United States) have redesigned the [[bayonet]] used with their issued rifle to include survival knife features.  Historically, bayonets had functioned poorly as field knives, due to being designed primarily to turn a rifle into a thrusting weapon and only secondarily (if at all) to work as a field knife.  The newer models function more acceptably for mundane tasks while remaining capable of being attached to the muzzle of a rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons: From Bayonet to Multi-tool|last=Lewis|first=Jack|publisher=Gun Digest Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-89689-498-3|location=|pages=221–224|authorlink=Jack Lewis (screenwriter)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of a survival knife==
Survival knives are designed for work such as setting traps, cutting branches, carving wood, and skinning animals. Most survival knives have fixed blades that are 10&amp;nbsp;cm to 20&amp;nbsp;cm (3.9 - 7.9 inches) long with a full thick tang. Survival knives made by [[Aitor Knife Company|Aitor]], [[Jimmy Lile|Lile]], Parrish, [[Randall Made Knives|Randall]], or [[Chris Reeve|Reeve]] have hollow handles, which allow the user to store additional equipment in the handle. Some of these knives feature a [[compass]] in the cap. A hollow handle survival knife may have reduced strength and may break more easily when performing tasks such as chopping or batoning.

On some survival knives, the spine or back of the blade is flat; allowing it to make a good hitting platform when pounding it with a hard stick to aid in splitting wood.  Other models such as Lile's and Parrish's feature a serrated spine or in the case of Rob Simonich's and [[Strider Knives]], a band ([[strapping]]) breaker near the tip. For survival knives that have a distinct flat spine with sharp 90 degree edges, the user can strike the spine edges against a [[ferrocerium]] rod to create sparks for fire starting purposes.

If the knife has a strong tip, then the knife can also be used as a weapon for self defense. Some knives even include holes in the handle such that the knife can be fastened to a long stick and then it functions as a spear tip. The capability to mount the knife on a stick to create a spear allows the user to better hunt wildlife at a safer distance.

The handle material of survival knives differs from one to the next and is determined primarily by user preference. Handle materials can be hardened rubber, wood, bone (horn), aluminium, polymer, or even metal, such as stainless steel in the case of the Aitor Jungle King I, or tool steel as used in the Chris Reeve One-Piece line.  Makers like Lile, Strider, and Parrish often wrap these metal handled knives with [[parachute cord|cord]] which can be used in survival situations and in daily use provides a more comfortable and reliable grip. In a situation where the knife handle breaks, if the knife is full tang, users can also wrap the handle area of the tang with cord to create a functional makeshift handle and not lose the functionality of the knife.

==Aircrew Survival Egress Knife==
The serrations seen on [[Aircrew Survival Egress Knife|Aircrew Survival Egress Knife (ASEK)]] are intended to allow air crewmen to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;  Those knives that do include functional saw-teeth still suffer from lack of blade length, limiting the thickness of what can be cut when used as a saw.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

==AKM bayonet==
The [[AKM]] [[Bayonet|Type I bayonet]] (introduced in 1959) was revolutionary design.&lt;ref name="worldbayonets.com"&gt;http://worldbayonets.com/Misc__Pages/ak_bayonets/ak_bayonets.html | Kalashnikov Bayonets Ralph E. Cobb, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has a Bowie style (clip-point) blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose survival knife and wire-cutter when combined with its steel scabbard.&lt;ref name="worldbayonets.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0weLGUG6o how to use the wire cutter on an akm /ak 47 bayonet]. YouTube (16 July 2009). Retrieved on 2011-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt; This design was copied by other nations and formed the basis of the US [[M9 bayonet]].&lt;ref name="worldbayonets.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tactical-life.com"&gt;http://www.tactical-life.com/online/tactical-knives/akm-47-bayonet-from-battle/|AKM-47 Bayonet From Battle. by Steven Dick&lt;/ref&gt; The AK-74 bayonet 6Kh5 (introduced in 1983) represents a further refinement of the AKM bayonet. "It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled on the opposite side near the false edge."&lt;ref name="worldbayonets.com"/&gt; The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece moulded plastic grip, making it a more effective fighting knife.&lt;ref name="worldbayonets.com"/&gt; It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter.&lt;ref name="worldbayonets.com"/&gt; The wire cutting versions of the AK bayonets each have an electrically insulated handle and an electrically insulated part of the scabbard, so it can be used to cut an electrified wire.

{{Business administration}}

'''Systems management''' refers to enterprise-wide [[System administration|administration]] of [[distributed systems]] including (and commonly in practice) [[computer system]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Systems management is strongly influenced by [[network management]] initiatives in [[telecommunication]]s.  The [[application performance management]] (APM) technologies are now a subset of Systems management.  Maximum productivity can be achieved more efficiently through event correlation, system automation and predictive analysis which is now all part of APM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apmdigest.com/apm-and-mom-symbiotic-solution-sets |title=APM and MoM - Symbiotic Solution Sets |date=11 May 2012 |publisher=APM Digest }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centralized management has a time and effort trade-off that is related to the size of the company, the expertise of the [[Information technology|IT]] staff, and the amount of technology being used:
* For a [[small business]] startup with ten computers, automated centralized processes may take more time to learn how to use and implement than just doing the management work manually on each computer.
* A very large business with thousands of similar employee computers may clearly be able to save time and money, by having IT staff learn to do systems management automation.
* A small branch office of a large corporation may have access to a central IT staff, with the experience to set up automated management of the systems in the branch office, without need for local staff in the branch office to do the work.

Systems management may involve one or more of the following tasks:
* Hardware inventories.
* Server availability monitoring and metrics.
* Software inventory and installation.
* Anti-virus and anti-management.
* User's activities monitoring.
* Capacity monitoring.
* Security management.
* Storage management.
* Network capacity and utilization monitoring.
* Anti-manipulation management

== Functions ==
Functional groups are provided according to [[International Telecommunication Union]] [[Telecommunication Standardization Sector]] (ITU-T) [[Common management information protocol]] (X.700) standard. This framework is also known as [[Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security]] (FCAPS).

; [[Performance management]]
:* [[Software metering]]
:* ''Who is using the software and how often?''
::* ''If the license says only so many copies may be in use at any one time but may be installed in many more places than licensed, then track usage of those licenses.''
::* ''If the licensed user limit is reached, either prevent more people from using it, or allow overflow and notify accounting that more licenses need to be purchased.''
:* Event and metric monitoring
::* ''How reliable are the computers and software?''
::* ''What errors or software bugs are preventing staff from doing their job?''
::* ''What trends are we seeing for hardware failure and life expectancy?''
; [[Security management]]
:* [[Identity management]]
:* [[Policy appliances|Policy management]]

However this standard should not be treated as comprehensive, there are obvious omissions. Some are recently emerging sectors, some are implied and some are just not listed. The primary ones are:
* Business Impact functions (also known as [[Business Systems Management]])
* [[Capacity management]]
* Real-time Application Relationship Discovery (which supports Configuration Management)
* [[Security Information and Event Management]] functions (SIEM)
* Workload scheduling

[[Performance management]] functions can also be split into end-to-end performance measuring and [[IT infrastructure|infrastructure component]] measuring functions.  Another recently emerging sector is [[operational intelligence]] (OI) which focuses on real-time monitoring of business events that relate to business processes, not unlike [[business activity monitoring]] (BAM).

'''Tetrathiafulvalene''' is an [[organosulfur compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Studies on this  [[heterocyclic]] compound contributed to the development of [[molecular electronics]].  TTF is related to the hydrocarbon [[fulvalene]], (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, by replacement of four CH groups with sulfur atoms.  Over 10,000 scientific publications discuss TTF and its derivatives.&lt;ref name=Bendikov&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bendikov, M |author2=Wudl, F |author3=Perepichka, D. F. | title = Tetrathiafulvalenes, Oligoacenenes, and Their Buckminsterfullerene Derivatives: The Brick and Mortar of Organic Electronics | journal = [[Chemical Reviews]] | year = 2004 | volume = 104 | pages = 4891–4945 | doi = 10.1021/cr030666m | pmid = 15535637 | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
The high level of interest in TTFs has spawned the development of many syntheses of TTF and its analogues.&lt;ref name=Bendikov/&gt;  Most preparations entail the coupling of cyclic C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; building blocks such as 1,3-dithiole-2-thiones or the related 1,3-dithiole-2-ones.  For TTF itself, the synthesis begins with the trithiocarbonate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS, which is S-methylated and then reduced to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(SCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is treated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wudl, F. |author2=Kaplan, M. L. | title = 2,2'Bi-1,3-dithiolylidene (Tetrathiafulvalene, TTF) and Its Radical Cation Derivatives | journal = [[Inorg.

:{{chem|H|2|C|2|S|2|CH(SCH|3|)}} + {{chem|HBF|4}} → {{chem|[H|2|C|2|S|2|CH|+|]BF|4|-}} + {{chem|HSCH|3}}

==Redox properties==
Bulk TTF itself has unremarkable electrical properties.  Distinctive properties are, however, associated with salts of its oxidized derivatives, such as salts derived from TTF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

The high electrical conductivity of TTF salts can be attributed to the following features of TTF:  (i) its planarity, which allows π-π stacking of its oxidized derivatives, (ii) its high symmetry, which promotes charge delocalization, thereby minimizing coulombic repulsions, and (iii) its ability to undergo oxidation at mild potentials to give a stable radical cation.  [[Electrochemistry|Electrochemical measurements]] show that TTF can be oxidized twice reversibly:

:TTF → {{chem|TTF|+}} + {{e-}} (E = 0.34 V)

:{{chem|TTF|+}} → {{chem|TTF|2+}} + {{e-}} (E = 0.78 V, vs. Ag/AgCl in MeCN solution)

Each dithiolylidene ring in TTF has 7π electrons: 2 for each sulfur atom, 1 for each sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon atom.  Thus, oxidation converts each ring to an [[aromatic]] 6π-electron configuration, consequently leaving the central double bond essentially a single bond, as all π-electrons occupy ring orbitals.

This “segregated stack” motif was unexpected and is responsible for the distinctive electrical properties, i.e. high and [[anisotropic]] [[electrical conductivity]].  Since these early discoveries, numerous analogues of TTF have been prepared.  Well studied analogues include tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTF), tetramethylselenafulvalenes (TMTSFs), and bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene  (BEDT-TTF, CAS [66946-48-3]).&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Larsen, J.; Lenoir, C. | title = &lt;nowiki&gt;2,2'-Bi-5,6-Dihydro-1,3-Dithiolo[4,5-b][1,4]dithiinylidene (BEDT-TTF)&lt;/nowiki&gt; | collvol = 9 | collvolpages = 72 | prep = cv9p0072 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene salts (called '''Fabre salts''') are of some relevance as [[organic superconductor]]s.

The '''threshold pledge''' or '''fund and release''' system is a way of making a [[fundraising]] [[Promise|pledge]] as a group of individuals, often involving [[charity (practice)|charitable]] goals or financing the provision of a [[public good]]. An amount of money is set as the goal or ''threshold'' to reach for the specified purpose and interested individuals will pitch in, but the money at first either remains with the pledgers or is held in [[escrow]].

When the threshold is reached, the pledges are called in (or transferred from the escrow fund) and a contract is formed so that the collective good is supplied; a variant is that the money is collected when the good is actually delivered.  If the threshold is not reached by a certain date (or perhaps if no contract is ever signed, etc.), the pledges are either never collected or, if held in escrow, are simply returned to the pledgers. In [[economics]], this type of model is known as an [[assurance contract]].

This system is most often applied to creative works, both for financing new productions and for [[buyout|buying out]] existing works; in the latter cases, it is sometimes known as '''ransom publishing model'''&lt;ref&gt;Clive Thompson. [http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2005/06/the_ransom_mode.php "The “ransom” model of publishing"]. ''[http://www.collisiondetection.net/ Collision detection]'', June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Street Performer Protocol''' (SPP).&lt;ref name="SPP"&gt;John Kelsey; Bruce Schneier. [http://schneier.com/paper-street-performer.html "The Street Performer Protocol"] [[USENIX]] Press, ''The Third USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce Proceedings,''  November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street Performer Protocol==
Street Performer Protocol is an early description of a type of threshold pledge system. SPP is the threshold pledge system encouraging the creation of creative works in the [[public domain]] or [[copyleft]]ed, described by Steven Schear&lt;ref&gt;Steven Schear. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040624034123/http://freedom.orlingrabbe.com/lfetimes/copyleft.htm "COPYLEFT: Rethinking Intellectual Property in the Digital Age"] ''Laissez Faire City Times,'' Vol 2, No 16, May 25, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and separately by [[cryptographer]]s [[John Kelsey (cryptanalyst)|John Kelsey]] and [[Bruce Schneier]].&lt;ref name="SPP"/&gt; This assumes that current forms of [[copyright]] and business models of the creative industries will become increasingly inefficient or unworkable in the future, because of the ease of copying and distribution of digital information.

Under the Street Performer Protocol, the artist announces that when a certain amount of money is received in [[escrow]], the artist will release a work (book, music, software, etc.) into the public domain or under a [[free content]] license. Interested donors make their donations to a publisher, who contracts with the artist for the work's creation and keeps the donations in escrow, identified by their donors, until the work is released.

If the artist releases the work on time, the artist receives payment from the escrow fund. If not, the publisher repays the donors, possibly with interest. As detailed above, contributions may also be refunded if the threshold is not reached within a reasonable expiring date. The assessed threshold also includes a fee which compensates the publisher for costs and assumption of risks.

The publisher may act like a traditional publisher, by soliciting sample works and deciding which ones to support, or it may serve only as an escrow agent and not care about the quality of the works (like a [[vanity press]]). {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Ransom model in software==
In [[software]], [[source code escrow]] is a publishing model that applies the SPP to [[source code]] (often involving existing [[proprietary software]]) which is eventually released under an [[Open-source license|open source]] or [[free software]] license.

==History==
The Street Performer Protocol is a natural extension of the much older idea of funding the production of written or creative works through agreements between groups of potential readers or users.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The first illustrated edition of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was published under a subscription system;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|title=The First Illustrations for Paradise Lost|journal=Milton Quarterly|date=May 1975|volume=9|issue=2|pages=43–46|doi=10.1111/j.1094-348X.1975.tb00136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mozart and Beethoven, among other composers, used subscriptions to premiere concerts and first print editions of their works. Unlike today's meaning of ''[[subscription]]'', this meant that a fixed number of people had to sign up and pay some amount before the concert could take place or the printing press started.

&lt;blockquote&gt;These three (piano) concertos K413-415 ... formed an important milestone in his career, being the first in the series of great concertos that he wrote for Vienna, and the first to be published in a printed edition. Initially, however, he followed the usual practice of making them available in manuscript copies. Mozart advertised for subscribers in January 1783: "These three concertos, which can be performed with full orchestra including wind instruments, or only a quattro, that is with 2 violins, 1 viola and violoncello, will be available at the beginning of April to those who have subscribed for them (beautifully copied, and supervised by the composer himself)." Six months later, Mozart complained that it was taking a long time to secure enough subscribers. This was despite the fact that he had meanwhile scored a great success on two fronts:&amp;hellip;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Philip. &lt;!--http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/notes/67358.html--&gt;[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDH55333&amp;f=Mozart:%20Piano%20Concertos%2011 Sleeve Notes - ''Mozart: Piano Concertos 11 12 &amp; 13; Susan Tomes (piano), The Gaudier Ensemble'']. [[Hyperion Records]], ''Helios'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are a number of differences between this traditional model and the SPP. The most important difference is that traditionally, the subscribers would be among the first to get access and would do so with the understanding that the work would likely always be a "rare" good; thus, there was some status in owning a copy, as well as the prestige of being among the patrons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Additionally, subscriptions were generally sold at a set price,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} but some wealthy subscribers may have given more in order to be a patron. In the modern Street Performer Protocol, each funder chooses the amount they want to pay, and the work is released to the public and freely reproduced.

In 1970, [[Stephen Breyer]] argued for the importance of this model in "[[The Uneasy Case for Copyright]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Breyer]]. [[The Uneasy Case for Copyright|"The Uneasy Case for Copyright: A Study of Copyright in Books, Photocopies and Computer Programs"]], [http://www.harvardlawreview.org ''Harvard Law Review''] 84(2) 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Street Performer Protocol was successfully used to release the source code and brand name of the [[Blender (program)|Blender]] 3D animation program. After [[Not a Number Technologies|NaN Technologies BV]] went bankrupt in 2002, the copyright and trademark rights to Blender went to the newly created NaN Holding BV. The newly created [[Blender Foundation]] campaigned for donations to obtain the right to release the software as [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] under the [[GNU General Public License]]. NaN Holding BV set the price tag at 100,000 [[euros]]. More than 1,300 users became members and donated more than 50 euros each, in addition to anonymous users, non-membership individual donations and companies. On October 13, 2002, Blender was released on the Internet as free/open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.org/blenderorg/blender-foundation/history/|title=Blender.org history|location=Amsterdam|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of the SPP include the [http://logarithmic.net/pfh/rspp Rational Street Performer Protocol] and the [http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/865/774 Wall Street Performer Protocol].

[[Image:Large window fan.JPG|thumb|right|A large single [[Whole-house fan|whole-house]] window fan w/ 3-speed control and intake/exhaust control]]
[[Image:Large window fan2.JPG|thumb|right|The same fan, in operation]]
A '''window fan''' is a [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] designed to be placed inside the frame of a [[window]].  Window fans have been used for many decades to maintain [[room temperature|comfortable temperatures]] and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] within one's home, and operate at a tiny fraction of the cost of central air conditioning.

==Design and operation==
Window fans are designed to fit into open windows, and often have expandable side panels to cover the entire window opening. Most units have either one large fan, or two small fans mounted side by side.

Most window fans have two or three speeds, and some are electrically reversible so that the user can switch between intake and exhaust modes.

Manufacturers have added features to their models over the years. Some fans contain [[thermostat]]s which will turn the fan off if the temperature drops to a certain point, or adjustable [[grille]]s to direct the flow of air in a particular direction. Other fans offer sophisticated electronic features such as a [[remote control]], automatic shut-off [[timer]]s, and dimmer-like variable-speed motor controls.

Most window fans today are made of plastic. Many older fans, however, are made of metal and are more solid&lt;!-- By "more solid", does the author mean heavier, more durable, or what? --&gt;. The more powerful window fans can be used to circulate air throughout a house, acting as a [[whole house fan|whole-house fan]].

'''''Word Attack!''''' is a 1984 [[education]]al [[video game]] by [[Davidson &amp; Associates]]. An updated version was released entitled ''Word Attack! Plus.'' The game found similar success to the Davidson titles ''[[Spell It]]'' and ''[[Reading and Me]].''

== Gameplay ==
The game consists of a series of language-based "[[drill-and-practice]]" [[minigame]]s and exercises. In one, the player uses the [[arrow keys]] to fire at correct answer "targets". The nine programs are aimed at grades 4-12.

== Commercial performance ==
By October 13, 1984, the game had sustained an 11-week streak on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] for Top Educational Computer Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MiQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=%22word+attack%22+davidsons+and+associates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP3KSeuPjRAhWE2LwKHXE0BBI4ChDoAQg4MAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22word%20attack%22%20davidsons%20and%20associates&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1984-10-13|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It re-entered the charts on November 3, 1984 at #9,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22word+attack%22+davidsons+and+associates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU8PSXuPjRAhVDULwKHSqYAswQ6AEIJTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22word%20attack%22%20davidsons%20and%20associates&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1984-11-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on November 24, 1984 at #7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nyQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22word+attack%22+davidsons+and+associates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizo66kuPjRAhXIXbwKHYSyDso4FBDoAQgoMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22word%20attack%22%20davidsons%20and%20associates&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1984-11-24|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 15, 1985, the game had stayed on the list for a total of 44 weeks, and was currently at #8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-SQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT28&amp;dq=%22word+attack%22+davidsons+and+associates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU8PSXuPjRAhVDULwKHSqYAswQ6AEIOTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22word%20attack%22%20davidsons%20and%20associates&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1985-06-15|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''The Computer in Reading and Language Arts'' criticised the [[Game mechanics|mechanic]] of shooting the correct [[multiple choice]] answers, deeming the [[graphics]] to be out of place in an educational title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=CYZ4__pBowgC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22word+attack%22+davidsons+and+associates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP3KSeuPjRAhWE2LwKHXE0BBI4ChDoAQgYMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22word%20attack%22%20davidsons%20and%20associates&amp;f=false|title=The Computer in Reading and Language Arts|last=Blanchard|first=Jay S.|last2=Mason|first2=George E.|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780866566674|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[InfoWorld]]'' deemed it well-[[Organization|organised]] and flexible, adding that it is an [[Effectiveness|effective]] teaching tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ri8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22word+attack%22+davidsons+and+associates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizo66kuPjRAhXIXbwKHYSyDso4FBDoAQggMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22word%20attack%22%20davidsons%20and%20associates&amp;f=false|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=1983-10-17|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
