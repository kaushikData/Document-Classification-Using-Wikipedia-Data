{{Christian Eschatology}}
American Christian radio host [[Harold Camping]] stated that the [[Rapture]] and [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]] would take place on May 21, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Conversation With Harold Camping, Prophesier of Judgment Day |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/05/a_conversation_with_harold_cam.html |newspaper=New York Magazine |date=May 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold Camping is at the heart of a mediapocalypse |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/21/local/la-me-rapture-20110521 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 13, 2011 |first=Christopher |last=Goffard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the end of the world would take place five months later on October 21, 2011, based on adding the 153 fish of John 20 to May 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lamblion.us/2011/03/harold-camping-end-time-scenario.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/may21/index.html |title = May 21, 2011 – Judgment Day!; October 21, 2011 – The End of the World |publisher = Ebiblefellowship.com |date = May 21, 1988 |accessdate =November 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101028050127/http://ebiblefellowship.com/may21/index.html| archivedate= October 28, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rapture, as indicated in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 (''harpagēsometha'' = we shall be raptured / taken up, "rapture" derivable from the Latin translation ''rapiemur'') is the taking up of believers to a meeting in the air with the Lord Jesus, but for Camping the rapture was also associated with the End of the World.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lamblion.us/2011/03/harold-camping-end-time-scenario.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Camping, who was then president of the [[Family Radio]] Christian network, claimed the Bible as his source and said May 21 would be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment "beyond the shadow of a doubt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = End of Days in May?

The vast majority of Christian groups, including most Protestant and Catholic believers, did not accept Camping's predictions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://relijournal.com/christianity/may-21st-the-new-christian-doomsday/ |title = May 21st, The New Christian Doomsday |publisher = ReliJournal |date = May 6, 2011 |accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some explicitly rejected them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gracevalley.org/Letter_to_Harold_Camping_True_Prophet_Or_False.pdf |title = Letter to Harold Camping (Family Radio) True Prophet or False? |publisher =  |accessdate = May 10, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222183254/http://gracevalley.org/Letter_to_Harold_Camping_True_Prophet_Or_False.pdf |archive-date = December 22, 2010 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/billboards-marking-jesus-return-in-may-misguided-says-nt-scholar-48083/ |title = Billboards Marking Jesus' Return in May 'Misguided,' Says NT Scholar |publisher = |accessdate =May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/end-times-theology-an-insiders-guide/2011/05/10/AFCsXAiG_blog.html |title = End times theology: an insider's guide |date = May 10, 2011|work = The Washington Post|accessdate =May 10, 2011 |first=Brian D. |last=McLaren | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111102343/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/end-times-theology-an-insiders-guide/2011/05/10/AFCsXAiG_blog.html | archive-date = January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic-scholar-dismantles-may-21-judgment-day-claims/ |title = Catholic scholar dismantles May 21 Judgment Day claims |author = Marianne Medlin |date = May 20, 2011 |publisher = Catholic News Agency |accessdate =May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing Bible passages including the words of Jesus stating "about that day or hour no one knows" (Matthew 24:36). An interview with a group of church leaders noted that all of them had scheduled church services as usual for Sunday, May 22.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc29.com/story/14665758/church-leaders-across-denominations-reflect-on-the-end-of-days ''Church Leaders Across Denominations Reflect on Camping's Prediction''] NBC29, May 17, 2011. Retrieved May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the failure of the prediction, media attention shifted to the response from Camping and his followers. On May 23, Camping stated that May 21 had been a "spiritual" day of judgment, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God.&lt;ref name = "G&amp;M"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/radio-host-says-rapture-actually-coming-in-october/article2032209/ Radio host says Rapture actually coming in October] – ''Globe and Mail''.

''[[The Daily Mail]]'', October 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Camping "humbly acknowledged" in a letter to Family Radio listeners that he had been mistaken, that the attempt to predict a date was "sinful", and that critics had been right in pointing to the scriptural text "of that day and hour knoweth no man". He added that he was searching the Bible "even more fervently [...] not to find dates, but to be more faithful in our understanding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://charismanews.com/us/32958-harold-camping-admits-rapture-prediction-was-sinful-statement Letter from Harold Camping to the "Family Radio Family"], reproduced at ''Charisma News,'' March 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* Citing [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 25:32, earthquakes would continue "as the sun advances" with New York, United States, to be affected at approximately 6&amp;nbsp;pm EDT (2200 UTC). Some earthquakes will trigger giant [[Tsunamis]] 100 times taller than the average [[megatsunami ]] which they claim is 100 meters (330 feet) tall . The waves will go as far inland as [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name="sfgate faq" /&gt;

Camping presented several arguments labeled "[[numerology|numerological]]" by the mainstream media,&lt;ref name="party"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43082513/ns/us_news-life/?GT1=43001 ''End of the world? How about a party instead?''], Associated Press, quoted at MSNBC, May 18, 2011. Retrieved May 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which he considered biblical proofs, in favor of the May 21 end time. A civil engineer by training, Camping stated he had attempted to work out mathematically-based prophecies in the Bible for decades. In an interview with the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' he explained "...&amp;nbsp;I was an engineer, I was very interested in the numbers. I'd wonder, 'Why did God put this number in, or that number in?' It was not a question of unbelief, it was a question of, 'There must be a reason for it.'"&lt;ref name="SFGATE Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-01-01/bay-area/17466332_1_east-bay-bay-area-first-time-camping/2 |title = Biblical scholar's date for rapture: May 21, 2011 |last = Berton |first = Justin |date = January 1, 2010 |work = San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate = March 12, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629044050/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-01-01/bay-area/17466332_1_east-bay-bay-area-first-time-camping/2 |archive-date = June 29, 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Camping dated the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] to 4990 BC.&lt;ref name=BCH&gt;{{cite journal |last = Camping |first = Harold |title = The Biblical Calendar of History |journal = [[American Scientific Affiliation|Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation]] |year = 1970 |volume = 22 |url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1970/JASA9-70Camping.html |accessdate =May 16, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110607021007/http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1970/JASA9-70Camping.html| archivedate= June 7, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this date, taking the statement in Genesis 7:4 ("Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth") to be a prediction of the end of the world, and combining it with [[2 Peter]] 3:8 ("With the Lord a day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as a day"), Camping concluded that the end of the world would occur in 2011, 7000 years from 4990 BC.&lt;ref name=JudgmentDay&gt;{{cite web |title = Judgment Day |url = http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html |publisher = [[Family Radio]] |accessdate = May 16, 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110608095448/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/judgment/judgment.html |archivedate = June 8, 2011 |deadurl = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camping takes the 17th day of the second month mentioned in Genesis 7:11 to be May 21, and hence predicts the Rapture to occur on this date.&lt;ref name=JudgmentDay /&gt;

Another argument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Camping |first = Harold |title = We Are Almost There! |url = http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/waat/waat.pdf |publisher = Family Stations, Inc |pages = 44–63 |date = August 2010 |access-date = May 18, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110523175211/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/waat/waat.pdf |archive-date = May 23, 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Camping used in favor of the May 21 date is as follows:

# The number five equals "atonement", the number ten equals "completeness", and the number seventeen equals "heaven".
# The number of days (as calculated below) between April 1, 33 AD, and May 21, 2011 AD, is 722,500.
## Christ is believed by Camping to have hung on the cross on April 1, 33 AD. The time between April 1, 33 AD, and April 1, 2011, is 1,978 years.
## If 1,978 is multiplied by 365.2422 days (the number of days in a [[Solar year|solar]], as distinct from [[Lunar year|lunar]], year), the result is 722,449.
## The time between April 1 and May 21 is 51 days.
## 51 added to 722,449 is 722,500.
# (5 × 10 × 17)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or (atonement × completeness × heaven)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; also equals 722,500.

Camping said that 5 × 10 × 17 is telling us a "story from the time Christ made payment for our sins until we're completely saved."&lt;ref name="SFGATE Interview" /&gt;

Camping was not precise about the timing of the event, saying that "maybe" we can know the hour.&lt;ref name = "Slate"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/scocca/archive/2011/05/16/countdown-to-armageddon-maybe-the-world-will-end-friday-night-or-sunday-morning.aspx ''Countdown to Armageddon: Maybe the World Will End Friday Night (or Sunday Morning),''] Slate, May 7, 2011. Retrieved May 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that "days" in the Bible refer to daylight hours particularly.&lt;ref name = "Slate" /&gt; Another account said the "great earthquake" which signals the start of the Rapture would "start in the [[Pacific Rim]] at around the 6&amp;nbsp;pm local time hour, in each time zone."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/05/07/136053462/is-the-end-nigh-well-know-soon-enough ''Is The End Nigh?

==Criticism==
[[File:Doomsdayer in New York.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A demonstrator at [[Radio City Music Hall]].]]
Camping's rapture prediction, along with some of his other teachings and beliefs, sparked controversy in the Christian and secular Western worlds. His critics often quoted Bible verses (such as {{Bibleverse||Matthew|24:36|KJV}}) they interpret as saying that the date of the end will never be known by anyone but [[God the Father|God]] until it actually happens. However, Camping and his followers responded that this principle only applied during the "church age" or pre-[[Tribulation]] period and did not apply to the present day, citing other verses (such as {{Bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:1–5:5|KJV}}) in their rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/nomanknows/nomanknows.html |title = No Man Knows The Day Or The Hour? |publisher = Familyradio.com |accessdate =November 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101211021108/http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/nomanknows/nomanknows.html| archivedate= December 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 pamphlet, Camping asserted that believers should "flee the church", resigning from any church they belong to, because the "Church Age" is over and the "[[Great Tribulation]]" has begun.&lt;ref name = "CT"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/may21/12.21.html |title = New Dispensation?

Criticism of the May 21 prediction ranged from serious critique to ridicule. Theology professor Matthew L. Skinner, writing at the [[Huffington Post]], noted the "long history of failed speculation" about the End Times and cautioned that end-of-the-world talk can lead Christians to social passivity instead of "working for the world's redemption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-l-skinner/apocalypse-now-or-later-o_b_839878.html |last = Skinner |first = Matthew L. |title = Apocalypse Now?

In response to the prediction, more than 830,000 registered as attending a "Post Rapture Looting" event on Facebook.&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;Facebook group page: "[https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=121968371215699 Post rapture looting]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43082513/ns/us_news-life/t/end-world-how-about-party-instead/|title=End of the world?

On May 21, groups of protesters gathered at Family Radio's headquarters in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to mock the evangelical broadcaster's failed prediction. One group released human-shaped helium balloons to simulate souls rising to heaven,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8529127/Protesters-mock-end-of-world-church.html |title = Video: Protesters mock 'end of world' church |date = May 22, 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate =May 23, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pajamasmedia.com/zombie/2011/05/21/media-circus-of-biblical-proportions-at-armageddon-hq/ Pajamas Media: "Media Circus of Biblical Proportions at Armageddon HQ", May 21, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; while another person played [[The Doors]]' song "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]" over a [[boombox]].&lt;ref name="latimes-doors"&gt;''[[LA Times]]'' article: "[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-rapture-20110522,0,5118540.story In the end, rapture believers weren't going anywhere]."&lt;/ref&gt; Many atheist and secular groups in the United States hosted "Rapture parties" on May 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13468131 |title = 'Rapture' apocalypse prediction sparks atheist reaction |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date = May 20, 2011 |accessdate =May 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110520155338/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13468131| archivedate= May 20, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other secular groups intentionally scheduled activities for Sunday, May 22, such as "Non-Judgmental Day", celebrating tolerance, cooperation and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Judgmental Day|publisher=Facebook event|url=http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=207910619243449#!/event.php?eid=207910619243449|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Atheists hosted a two-day conference over the May 21 weekend in Oakland, not far from Camping's radio station. President David Silverman commented, "We're going to poke fun at these people, but in the end we need to keep in mind that there are people being hurt here ... We're hoping people look at this and learn to use their brains … so we don't have an occurrence of this in 2012" (when [[2012 phenomenon|some believed]] the [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] predicted as the Earth's final destruction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harold Camping is at the heart of a mediapocalypse |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-me-rapture-20110521,0,1687317.story |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 21, 2011 |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |first=Christopher |last=Goffard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523052517/http://www.latimes.com/la-me-rapture-20110521%2C0%2C1687317.story |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction for October 21, 2011==
Camping continued to predict that October 21 would mark the end of the world, but modified his prediction with words like "probably" and "maybe". "I really am beginning to think as I've restudied these matters that there's going to be no big display of any kind," Camping said in a podcast. "The end is going to come very, very quietly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold Camping, rapture prophet, hedges new bet |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/20/BASV1LJD1N.DTL |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2011 |first=Justin |last=Berton}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept a low profile as the date approached, and his daughter responded to a media request by saying, "I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we at Family Radio have been directed to not talk to the media or the press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold Camping avoids press despite end-of-days prediction |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1020/Harold-Camping-avoids-press-despite-end-of-days-prediction |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===

No statement was issued by Camping or Family Radio on October 21 or 22.&lt;ref name=WorldSurvives/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Judgment Day doesn't dawn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Judgment-Day-doesnt-dawn-20111021 |title=Judgment Day doesn't dawn |date=October 21, 2011 |publisher=news24 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that Camping told an interviewer on October 16 that God has not given anyone the power to know exactly when the Rapture would come.&lt;ref name = "retire" /&gt; He retired from his leadership position at Family Radio.&lt;ref name = "retire" /&gt; Sometime after October 21, Family Radio posted an audio message from Harold Camping on their home page. In the message, Camping stated, regarding end times prophecy, that "we are finding it very very difficult". He also told followers to "not feel abandoned by God" and that "God is still in charge of everything".

As October 21 approached, the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]] bought space on more than 40 billboards in the Bay Area to mock Camping's predictions and urge viewers to use rational judgment. The billboards featured slogans such as, "Fool me once...", "Still here", and "Every day is judgment day. Use yours. Use reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ffrf.org/news/releases/ffrfs-fool-me-once-campaign-asks-onlookers-to-judge-religion/ Freedom from Religion Foundation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports on October 21 and 22 stressed that Camping had been "wrong again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold Camping: Doomsday Prophet Wrong Again |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/10/harold-camping-doomsday-prophet-wrong-again/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=October 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harold Camping Doomsday Wrong Again; Now on to December 2012? |url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/harold-camping-doomsday-wrong-again-now-on-to-december-2012-59033/ |newspaper=Christian Post |date=October 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[International Business Times]]'' proclaimed him a "false prophet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/149632/20110521/harold-camping-false-prophet-ministry-probably-doomed.htm Harold Camping False Prophet: Ministry Probably Doomed], ''International Business Times'', October 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 2011, ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine's website listed Camping's end times predictions as one of the "Top 10 Failed Predictions", a list compiled in Camping's "honor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2097462_2097456_2097489,00.html | title=Top 10 Failed Predictions |work=Time | date=October 21, 2011 | accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal developments ==
Family Radio removed from its web site the archive of audio recordings of Camping's Open Forum program recorded prior to May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fsiarchive1.familyradio.org/forum/mp3d.php |title=Open Forum Download Archive |access-date=July 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728174447/http://fsiarchive1.familyradio.org/forum/mp3d.php |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{primary sources|section|date=August 2012}}

===eBible Fellowship===
Owned and operated by Chris McCann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBible Fellowship|url=http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Publications include:
* ''The End of the World October 21, 2011''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The End of the World October 21, 2011|publisher=eBible Fellowship|url=http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/generated/outreach/tracts/may21/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCann continued to teach that October 21, 2011 would be the end of the world, even after the failed May 21, 2011 prediction. And after October 21, 2011, he taught that the end of the world would occur in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Link Between May 21, 2011 and the Feast of Purim in March 2012|url=http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/2012-end-of-the-world/|publisher=eBible Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: The Link Between May 21, 2011 and the Feast of Purim in March 2012|url=http://vimeo.com/36590434|publisher=eBible Fellowship}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2012, McCann began teaching the possibility that the last day would be October 7, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apocalypse Shortly?|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-05-29/news/39582351_1_harold-camping-ebible-fellowship-judgment-day| newspaper=Philadelphia Weekly |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that there was "a strong likelihood that this will happen" and "an unlikely possibility that it will not".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/06/end-of-world-7-october-ebible-fellowship The Guardian newspaper:Christian group predicts the world will be 'annihilated' on Wednesday, 6 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

This date was arrived at by adding 1600 days (taken from {{Bibleverse||Revelation|14:20|KJV}}) to May 21, 2011, which McCann still teaches is the beginning of the day of judgment.  He noted that October 7, 2015 is last day of the [[Feast of Tabernacles]], and exactly 10,000 days from May 21, 1988, which he claims is the date the Church Age came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can 1600 Furlongs Represent 1600 Days? |url=http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/archives/2012/12/26/can-1600-furlongs-represent-1600-days/|publisher=eBible Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus''''' is the thirteenth studio album by the Australian [[alternative rock]] band [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], released on 20 September 2004 on [[Mute Records]]. It is a [[double album]] with a total of seventeen songs—nine on ''Abattoir Blues'' and eight on ''The Lyre of Orpheus''.

==History==
The album was produced by [[Nick Launay]] at Studio Ferber in Paris in March–April 2004 and [[Nick Cave]] used The Bad Seeds line up of [[Mick Harvey]], [[Thomas Wydler]], [[Martyn Casey]], [[Conway Savage]], [[Jim Sclavunos]], [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]], and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]]. It was the first album by the group for which [[Blixa Bargeld]] did not perform – English guitarist and organist Johnston, of the group [[Gallon Drunk]], replaced Bargeld. Cave decided to split drumming duties for the two parts, with Sclavunos on ''Abattoir Blues'' and Wydler on ''The Lyre of Orpheus''. According to Launay, the whole album was completed in twelve days.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Nick_Launay_Interview.html "Interview With Nick Launay"], ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 16 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's release was supported by the Abattoir Blues Tour, which travelled through Europe from 2 November to 5 December. In January 2007 a double live album and DVD was issued as ''[[The Abattoir Blues Tour]]''. ''Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus''{{'}}s last track, "O Children", was featured in the 2010 film ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'', and the song is referenced as an achievement in ''[[Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7]]''. In March 2005, to complement the success of the double album, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released ''[[B-Sides &amp; Rarities (Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds album)|B-Sides &amp; Rarities]]'', a three-disc, 56-track collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s, rarities, and tracks that had appeared on film soundtracks.

''Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus'' holds a score of 88 out of 100 from [[Metacritic]], indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; [[Susan Carpenter]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the album as "a bounty of [[gothic rock]]" and noted that "the more driving, menacing numbers have been separated from the slow and scurrilous in a double album that is not two halves of a whole so much as two distinct records released simultaneously and in one package."&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/28/news/wk-pop28 |title=A fertile mind for dark tales |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=28 October 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2012 |last=Carpenter |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Carpenter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] described ''Abattoir Blues'' as "a [[rock and roll|rock &amp; roll]] record... a pathos-drenched, volume-cranked rocker, full of crunch, punishment – and taste" and ''The Lyre of Orpheus'' as "a much quieter, more elegant affair... more consciously restrained, its attention to craft and theatrical flair more prevalent.".&lt;ref name="Jurek"/&gt; Greg Simpson of Punknews.org said that ''Abattoir Blues'' "is very bluesy indeed, a rock and roll album with many angry songs and booming bass lines," while ''The Lyre of Orpheus'' "insists on being a separate album, due to its completely different more gentle feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/review/3421/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-abattoir-blues-the-lyre-of-orpheus |title=Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Abattoir Blues / The Lyre Of Orpheus |publisher=Punknews.org |date=29 October 2004 |accessdate=27 February 2013 |author=greg0rb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rave review, ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'' critic Grigsby wrote that while ''Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus'' "may not be the best beginner's guide" to the band, for "anyone who is a fan of the duration of his career, this album rewards the listener with a bit of the best of everything he has to offer."&lt;ref name="TMT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/nick-cave-abattoir-bluesthe-lyre-orpheus-bad-seeds |title=Nick Cave – Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (&amp; The Bad Seeds) |work=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] |accessdate=27 February 2013 |author=Grigsby}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' said: "Aside from the power of the music and lyrics, the set draws on Cave’s compelling persona: part priest, part sideshow barker--crooning one moment and eviscerating the next. While this has always been the core of his talent, on ''Abattoir/Lyre'' it is particularly rich and rewarding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2004/10/nick-cave-the-bad-seeds.html |title=Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds: Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=1 October 2004 |accessdate=27 February 2013 |last=Sheridan |first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more mixed assessment, [[Douglas Wolk]], writing in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', was complimentary of ''Abattoir Blues'' but felt that ''The Lyre of Orpheus'' was "effectively ''Abattoir'' spillover: more mellow, less grand in conception, but—somehow—more pretentious in execution."&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt; In his Consumer Guide for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] designated three songs from the album ("The Lyre of Orpheus", "There She Goes, My Beautiful World", and "Hiding All Away") as "choice cuts",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv205-05.php |title=Consumer Guide: Harmonies and Abysses |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=8 February 2005 |accessdate=31 October 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating good songs "on an album that isn't worth your time or money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php |title=Key to Icons |publisher=RobertChristgau.com |accessdate=31 October 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apkallu''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), or '''Abgal''' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]), are terms found in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] inscriptions that in general mean either "wise" or "sage."

In several contexts the ''Apkallu'' are seven demi-gods, sometimes described as part man and part fish, associated with human wisdom; these creatures are often referred to in scholarly literature as the ''Seven Sages''. Each sage has an association with a specific mythic King. After the seventh sage and king, a deluge (see [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]) is said to have occurred. Records list further sages and further historic king pairings. Post-deluge, the sages are considered human, and in some texts are distinguished by being referred to as ''Ummanu'', not ''Apkallu''.

The terms ''Apkallu'' (as well as ''Abgal'') is also used as an epithet for kings and gods as a mark of wisdom or knowledge.

A further use of the term ''Apkallu'' is when referring to figurines used in [[apotropaic]] rituals; these figurines include fish-man hybrids representing the seven sages, but also include bird-headed and other figures.

In a later work by [[Berossus]] describing Babylonia, the Apkallu appear again, also described as fish-men who are sent by the gods to impart knowledge to people. In Berossus, the first one Oannes (a variant of Uanna) is said to have taught people the creation myth the ''[[Enuma Elis]]'' (qv)

==Etymology, names, and meaning==
[[File:Plate 6 fish god (A second series of the monuments of Nineveh) 1853 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|''Bas-relief'' (probably) of an Apkallu figure from the temple of Ninurta at Nimrud.&lt;ref name="relief1"/&gt;]]
The terms ''apkallu'' has multiple uses, but usually refers to some form of wisdom; translations of the term generally equate to English language uses of the terms "the wise" or "sage." {{sfn|Civil|Gelb|Landsberger|Oppenheim|1968|loc=apkallatu / apkallu|pp=171-173}}

As an [[epithet]], prefix, or adjective it can mean "the wise"; it has been used as an epithet for the gods [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]] and [[Marduk]], simply interpreted as "wise one amongst gods" or similar forms. It has also been applied to [[Enlil]], [[Ninurta]], and [[Adad]], alternatively translated as meaning 'expert.' {{sfn|Civil|Gelb|Landsberger|Oppenheim|1968|loc="apkallu", p.171, col.2 - p.172, col.1}}

A second meaning is when used to refer to the "seven sages." {{sfn|Civil|Gelb|Landsberger|Oppenheim|1968|loc="apkallu", p.172, col.1-2}} It has also been applied as an epithet of the sage [[Adapa]]{{sfn|Civil|Gelb|Landsberger|Oppenheim|1968|loc="apkallu", p.172, col.2}} The term has also been used specifically when referring to [[apotropaic]] figures, which are often figurines the 'seven sages' themselves.{{sfn|Civil|Gelb|Landsberger|Oppenheim|1968|loc="apkallu", p.172, col.2 - p.173, col.1}}

A collation of the names and 'titles' of theses seven sages in order can be given as: {{sfn|Conrad|Newing|1987|loc= ''The Mespotamian Counterparts of the Biblical Nepilim'' A. Draffkorn Kilner, pp.39- }}

:[[Uanna]], "who finished the plans for heaven and earth",
:[[Uannedugga]], "who was endowed with comprehensive intelligence",
:[[Enmedugga]], "who was allotted a good fate",
:[[Enmegalamma]], "who was born in a house",
:[[Enmebulugga]], "who grew up on pasture land",
:[[An-Enlilda]], "the conjurer of the city of Eridu",
:[[Utuabzu]], "who ascended to heaven".

Additionally, the term is used when referring to human "priests" (also 'exorcists', 'diviners').{{sfn|Civil|Gelb|Landsberger|Oppenheim|1968|loc="apkallu", p.173, col.1}} However, Mesopotamian human sages also used the term ''ummianu'' (ummânù).{{sfn|Conrad|Newing|1987|p=40}}{{sfn|Lenzi|2008|p=137}}
 
The term 'apkallu' is [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], it is thought to derive from the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''abgal''.{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|loc = "Apkallu", pp.72-}}

===Uanna (Oannes) or Adapa ?===
{{see also|Adapa}}
The first of these legendary fish-man sages is known as Oan/Oannes (Sumerian) or Uanna/U-An (Akkadian); on a few cuneiform inscriptions this first sage has "adapa" appended to his name.{{sfn|Borger|1974|p=186}}{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|p=228}} Borger notes, however, that it is difficult to believe that the half-man half-fish "Adapa" is the same as the fisherman of the Adapa myth, the son of the god Ea.{{sfn|Borger|1974|p=186}}{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|pp=228-9}} A potential solution was given by W.G. Lambert {{harv|Lambert|1959|loc=p.64, note 72}} --  evidence that "adapa" was also used as an appellative meaning "wise".{{sfn|Borger|1974|p=186}}

{{Harv|Kvanvig|2011}} considers the case for Adapa being one of or a name of one of the Apkallu. They note that while some texts contain plays on words between the terms 'adapa' and 'uan' and posit that 'adapa' may be an epithet, though in the Adapa myth itself it is likely a proper name. In terms of the name of the first Apkallu they consider that both terms 'adapa' ("wise") and 'ummanu' ("craftsman") together form the whole proper name. Additionally, they note closer similarities between the 7th Apkallu ''Utuabzu'', who is said to have ascended to heaven (in the ''Bit Meseri''), and the myth of Adapa who also visited heaven. Both Adapa and the Apkallu have legends that place them halfway between the world of men and gods; but additionally just as Oannes in the Greek version passes all the knowledge of civilization to people, so Adapa is described as having been "[made] perfect with broad understanding to reveal the plans of the land." However, despite some clear parallels between Adapa stories and both the first and last Apkallu, Kvanvig finally notes that the name used for the first Apkallu is given in both Berossus, and in the Uruk King list -- that is ''Uan''.{{sfn|Kvanvig|2011|loc = § 3.2 Bīt Mēseri and the Adapa Myth, pp.117-129}}

==Literary evidence==
===Uruk List of Kings and Sages===
These Sages are found in the "Uruk List of Kings and Sages" (165 BC) discovered in 1959/60 in the Seleucid era temple of [[Anu]] in Bit Res; The text consisted of list of seven kings and their associated sages, followed by a note on the 'Deluge' (see [[Gilgamesh flood myth]]), followed by eight more king/sage pairs.{{sfn|Lenzi|2008|p=138-140}}{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|pp=225-226}}{{sfn|Borger|1974|p=184}}

Lenzi notes that the list is clearly intended to be taken in chronological order. It is an attempt to connect real (historic) kings directly to mythologic (divine) kingship and also does the same connecting those real king's sages (ummanu) with the demi-godly mythic seven sages (apkallu).{{sfn|Lenzi|2008|p=143}}

Though the list is taken to be chronological, the texts do not portray the Sages (nor the kings) as genealogically related to each other or their kings. There is some similarity between the sages' and kings' names in the list, but not enough to draw any solid conclusions.{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|pp=63-64}}

===''Bit meseri''===
A list (similar to the Uruk list) of the seven sages followed by four human sages is also given in an apotropaic incantation the tablet series ''[[Bīt mēseri|Bit meseri]]''.{{sfn|Lenzi|2008|p=143}} The ritual involved hanging or placing statues of the sages on the walls of a house. A translation of the cuneiform was given by Borger:
&lt;!--

===''The Twenty-One "Poultices"''===
{{quote box|
Nudimmud became angry and summoned the seven sages of Eridu in high tones,

"Bring the document of my Anuship that it may be read before me,

That I may decree the destiny for Mu'ait,

The son who makes me happy, and grant him his desire."

They brought and read the tablet of destinies of the great gods,

He decreed the destiny for him and gave him ..

Anenlildam the purification priest of Eridu,

Made twenty-one "poultices" and gave them to him

|source= LKA 146 Obverse, Lines 5-12. {{harv|Lambert|1980|p=79}}

}}

A text giving the story known as the Twenty-One "Poultices" (ref. no. LKA No.76) contains duplications of much of the ''Bit meseir'' text concerning the seven sages - it was analyzed by {{harvnb|Reiner|1961}}. Another text from [[Uruk]] was later found that duplicated and further completed the coverage of Reiner's text.{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|pp=229-230}}

In ''the twenty-one poultices'' text the seven sages (of Eridu) are entrusted with the reading "tablets of destiny." Additionally the sage Anenlilda is the maker of the 'twenty-one poultices' -- these items are then given to [[Nudimmud]] to bring to the "upper world" to gain merit.{{sfn|Lambert|1980|p=79}}

===The Poem of Erra===
{{quotebox|
I made those ''ummanus'' [apkallus] go down to the ''apsu''

and I said they were not to come back up
|source= Poem of Erra; Tablet 1, line 147.{{harv|Kvanvig|2011|pp=161–2}}
|align=right
}}
The seven sages are also mentioned in the [[Epic of Erra]] (aka 'Song of Erra', or 'Erra and Ishum'); here again they are referenced as ''paradu''-Fish.{{sfn|Borger|1974|p=186}}{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|p=229}} In this text is described how after the Flood, [[Marduk]] banished them back to Abzu.{{sfn|Kvanvig|2011|pp=160-163}} Once the apkallu are banished, Marduk's phrasing becomes rhetorical (left):

{{quote box|
Where are the seven ''apkallu'' of the ''apsu'', the holy carp†,

who are perfect in lofty wisdom like Ea's their lord,

who can make my body holy?

:† ''Usually translated as "pure ''puradu''-fishes"''
|source=Poem of Erra; Tablet 2, line 162 {{harv|Kvanvig|2011|p=162}}
|align=right
}}

Finally Erra persuades Marduk to leave his temple and fetch back the apkallu from their banishment, reassuring that he will keep order whilst Marduk is away. However, chaos breaks out; though some of the text is missing it seems that the subsequent outcome was that instead, earthly ''ummanus'' are given the task of cleansing Marduk's shrine.{{sfn|Kvanvig|2011|pp=162-4}} Kvanvig infers from this text that the mythological role of the apkallu was to aid the god (Marduk) in keeping creation stable by maintenance of Marduk's idol.{{sfn|Kvanvig|2011|p=171}}

According to Scott B. Noegel this epic also contains several clever etymological wordplays on the names of apkallu, both textual and phonetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = "Wordplay" in the Song of Erra|pages = 161–194|first = Scott B.| last = Noegel| work= Strings and Threads| editor-first = Wolfgang| editor-last = Heimpel| editor-first2 = Gabriella|editor-last2 = Frantz-Szabo |year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This text appears to have a completely different role for the apkallu from that given in the lists of sages and kings -- essentially, Kvanvig proposes that the pre-deluge king-sage list was retroactively inserted onto a Sumerian king list, so to combine the historical record with the flood legend. In doing so it creates an pre-flood origin story for the Sumerian kings.{{sfn|Kvanvig|2011|p=177-181}}

===Berossus' ''Babyloniaca''===

[[Berossus]] wrote a history of Babylon in around 281 BC, during the Greek period of overlordship. According to his own account, he was a Chaldean priest of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] ([[Marduk]]). His ''Babyloniaca'' was written in Greek, probably for the [[Seleucid]] court of [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus I]].{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.2, pp.4-6}} His work gives a description of the wise men, their names, and their associated kings.{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|p=226}}{{sfn|Borger|1974|p=184}}  Berossus' original book is now lost,{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.3, pp.6-8 }} but parts have survived via the abridgment and copying of historians including  [[Alexander Polyhistor]], [[Josephus]], [[Abydenus]], and [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Cory|1828|pp=viii-xiii}}{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.3, pp.6-8 }} Mayer Burstein suggests that Berossus' work was partly metaphorical, intended to convey wisdoms concerning the development of man -- a nuance lost or uncommented on by later copyists.{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.3, pp.6-8 }}

What remains of Berossos' account via Apollodorus begins with a description on Babylonia, followed by the appearance of a learned fish-man creature named Oannes.{{sfn|Cory|1828|pp=24-26}} Truncated account:

{{quote box|

This is the history which Berossus has transmitted to us. He tells us that the first king was Alorus of Babylon, a Chaldaean ; he reigned ten sari: and afterwards Alaparus, and Amelon who came from Pantibiblon : then Ammenon the Chaldaean, in whose time appeared the Musarus Oannes the Annedotus from the Erythraean sea. (But Alexander Polyhistor anticipating the event, has said that he appeared in the first year; but Apollodorus says that it was after forty sari ; Abydenus, however, makes the second Annedotus appear after twenty-six sari.) Then succeeded Megalarus from the city of Pantibiblon ; and he reigned eighteen sari : and after him Daonus the shepherd from Pantibiblon reigned ten sari; in his time (he says) appeared again from the Erythrsean sea a fourth Annedotus, having the same form with those above, the shape of a fish blended with that of a man. Then reigned Euedoreschus from Pantibiblon, for the term of eighteen sari; in his days there appeared another personage from the Erythraean sea like the former, having the same complicated form between a fish and a man, whose name was Odacon. (All these, says Apollodorus, related particularly and circumstantially whatever Oannes had informed them of : concerning these Abydenus has made no mention.) Then reigned Amempsinus, a Chaldaean from Laranchae ; and he being the eighth in order reigned ten sari. Then reigned Otiartes, a Chaldaean, from Laranchae ; and he reigned eight sari. And upon the death of Otiartes, his son Xisuthrus reigned eighteen sari : in his time happened the great deluge. So that the sum of all the kings is ten ; and the term which they collectively reigned an hundred and twenty sari.

{{quote box|
So much concerning the wisdom of the Chaldseans.

It is said that the first king of the country was Alorus, who gave out a report that he was appointed by God to be the Shepherd of the people : he reigned ten sari : now a sarus is esteemed to be three thousand six hundred years ; a neros six hundred ; and a sossus sixty.

After him Alaparus reigned three sari : to him succeeded Amillarus from the city of Pantibiblon, who reigned thirteen sari ; in his time a semidaemon called Annedotus, very like to Oannes, came up a second time from the sea : after him Ammenon reigned twelve sari, who was of the city of Pantibiblon : then Megalarus of the same place eighteen sari : then Daos, the shepherd, governed for the space of ten sari ; he was of Pantibiblon ; in his time four double-shaped personages came out of the sea to land, whose names were Euedocus, Eneugamus, Eneuboulus, and Anementus : after these things was Anodaphus, in the time of Euedoreschus. There were afterwards other kings, and last of all Sisithrus : so that in the whole, the number amounted to ten kings, and the term of their reigns to an hundred and twenty sari.

Truncated account via Alexander Polyhistor:

{{quote box|

[Background of Berossus, followed by an introduction to the accounts of Babylon, and a geographical description of it]

In the first year there made its appearance, from a part of the Erythraean sea which bordered upon Babylonia, an animal endowed with reason, who was called Oannes. (According to the account of Apollodo- rus) the whole body of the animal was like that of a fish ; and had under a fish's head another head, and also feet below, similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish's tail. His voice too, and language, was articulate and human ; and a representation of him is preserved even to this day.

This Being in the day-time used to converse with men ; but took no food at that season ; and he gave them an insight into letters and sciences, and every kind of art. He taught them to construct houses, to found temples, to compile laws, and explained to them the principles of geometrical knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and shewed them how to collect fruits ; in short, he instructed them in every thing which could tend to soften manners and humanize mankind. From that time, so universal were his instructions, nothing has been added material by way of improvement. When the sun set, it was the custom of this Being to plunge again into the sea, and abide all night in the deep ; for he was amphibious.

After this there appeared other animals like Oannes, of which Berossus promises to give an account when he comes to the history of the kings.

Moreover Oannes wrote concerning the generation of mankind ; of their different ways of life, and of their civil polity ; and the following is the purport of what he said :

[follows a truncated account of what is essentially the ''enuma elis'']

(In the second book was the history of the ten kings of the Chaldeans, and the periods of each reign, which consisted collectively of an hundred and twenty sari, or four hundred and thirty-two thousand years ; reaching to the time of the Deluge. For Alexander, as from the writings of the Chaldteans, enumerating the kings from the ninth Ardates to Xisuthrus,

[an account essential the same as that of the Biblical Flood]

[Accounts then follow of Abraham, of Nabonasar, of the Destruction of the Jewish Temple, of Nebuchadnezzar, of the Chaldean Kings after Nebuchadnezzar, and of the Feast of Sacea]

In summary, Berossus' Babylonian history recounts ten kings before a deluge (followed by the reigns of later kings), with a record or myth of primitive man receiving civilized knowledge via the Oannes; in also contains a paraphrasing of the myth the ''[[Enuma Elis]]'', which was said to have been recounted by the Oannes.{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.3, pp.6-8 }} Though Berossus' history contains obvious historical errors, parts of it have convincing matches with ancient cuneiform texts, suggest he was recreating accounts known from ancient Mesopotamian texts. Mayer Burstein considers that the text was not well written in a 'Greek style', but was essentially a transliteration of Mesopotamian myths into Greek. Helpfully for future historians, Berossus does not seem to have altered the myths or narratives to suit a  Greek audience.{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.4, pp.8-10 }}

In terms of his relevance to the Apkallu: his lists match fairly well with the Uruk King/Apkallu list, though there are differences and variations.{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § A.4, pp.8-10 ; § C.1, p.18, Notes 26-}} Oannes is paired with the king Alorus, and by comparison can be considered equivalent to Adapa [Uanna].{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § B.1, p.13, Notes 6, 8 }} Matches between Berossus and the kings and apkallu in the Uruk King List have been proposed.{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|loc = § C.1, pp.18-19, Notes 26-47 }}

===Other references ===
Various other cuneiform texts have references to these seven sages. There are texts that associates a set of seven sages with the city [[Kuara (Sumer)|Kuar-Eridu]] or [[Eridu]], while in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] there is a reference to seven counselors as founders of [[Uruk]]. Another list of seven sages used in a ritual differs from the description and names give in the ''Bit meseri'' text.{{sfn|Hess|Tsumura|1994|p=229}}

Several of named apkulla are listed on inscriptions as authors, notably Lu-Nanna is recorded as author of the ''Myth of Etana''.{{sfb|Kvanvig|2011|p=146}}

==Depictions in ancient art ==

Representations of 'apkallu' were used in [[apotropaic]] rituals; in addition to fish-headed ones (similar to descriptions of the seven sages), other human-animal hybrids were used as 'apkallu' in this context (generally bird-headed humans).{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|loc = "Apkallu", p.73, col.2 - p.74, col.1}}

Apkallu reliefs appear prominently in [[Neo-Assyrian]] palaces, notably the constructions of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] of the 9th century BC. They appear in one of three forms, bird-headed, human-headed or dressed in fish-skin cloaks. They have also been found on reliefs from the reign of [[Sennacherib]].&lt;ref name="relief1"&gt;{{citation |last= Ataç|first= Mehmet-Ali|title= The mythology of kingship in Neo-Assyrian art|year=2010| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-51790-4| page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_0h0GUMU0sC&amp;pg=PA150 |edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form taken of a man covered with the 'pelt' of a fish is first seen the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period, continuing is used to the period of [[Persian Babylonia]] - the form was popular during the [[Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian]] periods.{{sfn|Black|Green|1998|loc="fish-garbed figure", pp.82-3}}

==Speculation==

The spread of the 'seven sage' legend westwards during the 1st and 2nd millennia has been speculated to have led to the creation of the tale of the [[Nephilim]] (Genesis 6:1-4) as recounted in the [[Old Testament]],{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|loc = "Apkallu", p.74, col.1}}{{sfn|Conrad|Newing|1987|loc= ''The Mespotamian Counterparts of the Biblical Nepilim'' A. Draffkorn Kilner, pp.39- }} and may have an echo in the text of the [[Book of Proverbs]] (Prov 9:1): ''"Wisdom built her house. She set out its seven pillars."'' The story of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] ("seventh from Adam") and his ascension to heaven has also been proposed to be a variant or influenced by the seventh apkallu Utuabzu who is also said to have ascended to heaven in the ''[[bit meseri]]''.{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|loc = "Apkallu", p.74, col.1}}

==Misconceptions==
Oannes was once conjectured to be a form or another name of the ancient Babylonian god [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Sayce| first = Archibald H.| authorlink=Archibald Sayce |year =1898|pages = 232, 368–9, 391|  work = The Hibbert Lectures| title = Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as illustrated by the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians| publisher =  Wiliams &amp; Norgate| edition = 5th }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now thought that the name is the Greek form of the Babylonian ''Uanna'', an Apkallu.{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|loc = "Apkallu", p.72}}

The '''argument from degrees''' or the '''degrees of perfection argument''' is an [[existence of God|argument for the existence of God]] first proposed by mediaeval [[Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] as one of the [[Quinquae viae|five ways]] to philosophically argue in favour of [[God]]'s existence in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. It is based on [[Perfection#Ontological and theological perfection|ontological and theological notions of perfection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=Simon | last=Blackburn | title=Degrees of perfection argument | encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-283134-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Thomist scholars are often in disagreement on the metaphysical justification for this proof.{{Citation needed|reason=I'm not wanting to dispute or argue this. I would just like to see some kind of a reputable source for this claim. 5/13/17|date=May 2017}}. According to Edward Feser, the metaphysics involved in the argument has more to do with Aristotle than Plato; hence, while the argument presupposes realism about universals and abstract objects, it would be more accurate to say Aquinas is thinking of Aristotelian realism and not Platonic realism per se.

== Aquinas's original formulation ==

{{quote|The fourth proof arises from the degrees that are found in things. A hierarchy of each quality. For there is found a greater and a less degree of goodness, truth, nobility, and the like. But more or less are terms spoken of various things as they approach in diverse ways toward something that is the greatest, just as in the case of hotter (more hot) that approaches nearer the greatest heat. In the hierarchy of complexity one might find a worm lower down, a dog higher, and a human higher than that. There exists therefore something that is the truest, most complex, best, and most noble, and in consequence, the greatest being. For what are the greatest truths are the greatest beings, as is said in the Metaphysics Bk. II. 2. What moreover is the greatest in its way, in another way is the cause of all things of its own kind (or genus); thus fire, which is the greatest heat, is the cause of all heat, as is said in the same book (cf. Plato and Aristotle). Therefore there exists something that is the cause of the existence of all things and of the goodness and of every perfection whatsoever—and this we call God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas3.html Medieval Sourcebook: Aquinas: Proof of the Existence of God&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Syllogistic form ==
A syllogistic form collected by Robert J. Schihl follows:
{{quote|
# Objects have properties to greater or lesser extents.
# If an object has a property to a lesser extent, then there exists some other object that has the property to the maximum possible degree.
# So there is an entity that has all properties to the maximum possible degree.
# Hence God exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/phd/com707/aquinas.html Aquinas'/Anselm's Arguments in Syllogistic Form&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220225324/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/phd/com707/aquinas.html |date=February 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Camma''' was a [[Galatia]]n princess and [[priest]]ess of [[Artemis]] whom [[Plutarch]] writes about in both ''On the Bravery of Women'' and the ''Eroticus'' or ''Amatorius''.{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|page=1}} As Plutarch is our only source on Camma, her historicity cannot be independently verified.{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Henri d’Arbois de Jubainville is cited by Sandra Péré-Noguès (2013) as declaring that the Greeks had invented such stories, though she is not so dismissive.&lt;/ref&gt; In both works, Plutarch cites her as an exemplar of fidelity and courage in love.{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|page=2}}

In Plutarch's accounts, Camma was wedded to the [[wikt:tetrarch|tetrarch]] Sinatus, and became known and admired for her virtue and beauty.&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|pages=2-3|ps=: text and translation of the passage from the ''Amatorius''.}} Sinatus' rival, another tetrarch named Sinorix, murdered Sinatus and proceeded to woo Camma herself. Rather than submit to Sinorix' advances, Camma took him to a temple of Artemis where she served poison to both herself and him in a libation of either milk and honey&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt; or mead.{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|pages=2-3|ps=: text and translation of the passage from the ''Amatorius''.}} Camma died happily, according to Plutarch, in the knowledge that she had avenged the death of her husband.&lt;ref name="plut"&gt;[[Plutarch]]. ''De Mulierum Virtutibus'' 20, in the ''[[Moralia]]''. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/B.html English translation published online by Bill Thayer.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|pages=2-3|ps=: text and translation of the passage from the ''Amatorius''.}}

Plutarch's story of Camma inspired a number of works of later art and literature. [[Polyaenus]] briefly reprises Plutarch's tale in his 2nd-century CE ''Stratagems of War''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polyaenus]], ''Stratagems'' [http://www.attalus.org/translate/polyaenus8B.html#39.1 VIII.39.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, the story of Camma enjoyed considerable popularity, inspiring ''De re uxoria'' by Barbaro,{{sfnp|Bartera|2011|page=140}} ''De institutione feminae christianae'' by Vives,{{sfnp|Bartera|2011|page=140}} the ''Libro del cortegiano'' by Castiglione,{{sfnp|Bartera|2011|page=140}} and ''Orlando furioso'' by Ariosto (where Camma is renamed Drusilla).{{sfnp|Bartera|2011|page=140}} [[Thomas Corneille]] wrote a play named ''Camma'' (1661) about the story of the Galatian princess. The opera ''[[Nephté]]'' (1789) by [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne (composer)|Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]] uses the story of Camma but moves the setting to Ancient Egypt. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] subsequently wrote the tragedy ''The Cup'' (1884), in which Camma is again a Galatian princess. The poem ‘Camma’ by [[Oscar Wilde]] has been seen as a hedonistic commentary on Plutarch's Camma.{{sfnp|Gilabert i Barberà|2000|page=4}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8797">In '''Judaism''', there is debate but not accepted evidence that cannabis may have been used ritually in ancient Judaism, and the use of cannabis continues to be a controversial topic in modern Judaism.

==Theories on ancient use==
It is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]] that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001); James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous" (Merlin, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin  Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]] (1967), who claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

According to those theories that hold that cannabis was present in Ancient Israelite society, a variant of [[hashish]] is held to have been present.&lt;ref&gt;Warf, Barney. "High points: An historical geography of cannabis." Geographical Review 104.4 (2014): 414-438. Page 422: "Psychoactive cannabis is mentioned in the Talmud, and the ancient Jews may have used hashish (Clarke and Merlin 2013)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
{{see also|Cannabis in Israel}}
In the United States, the Jewish population is overrepresented among the recreational cannabis using population. The reasons for this are thought to be their urban pattern of residence, the disproportionate association of Jewish residents in the academic milieu of the city as well as its avant-garde moments, and that Jewish families are thought to be less authoritarian and more tolerant toward "intellectual experimentation". In Toronto, differences between Jews and Christians with regard to attitudes toward cannabis usage were detected in the high school population, in which surveys show that more than twice as many Jewish students have used cannabis as Catholic ones.&lt;ref name=Goode&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goode |first1=Erich |title=Between Politics and Reason |isbn=0-312-13297-2 |url=http://druglibrary.net/special/goode/mjsmokers2.htm |chapter=Chapter 2 — A Profile of the Marijuana Smoker |quote=...Jews are far more likely to smoke marijuana than Gentiles, at least among young adults... Although it is possible that this over-representation can be entirely explained by Jewish dominance in academic and quasi-academic milieu in New York City (the groups to which I had readiest access), there are indications that lead me to suspect that there are social and cultural factors linking the Jews to activities such as marijuana use... Many of the avant-garde political and artistic movements today are associated with marijuana smoking, and the Jews are strongly over-represented in these movements... But it is to say that Jews will be more likely to be found among the more progressive artists and writers, and among the more radical and revolutionary political activists in America today. And it is precisely the political and artistic avant-garde that is most likely to smoke marijuana. However, we need not even concern ourselves with society's most progressive and revolutionary members, since they form such a tiny percentage of any population. Even contrasting Jews in general ( not merely the most liberal among them) with Gentiles in general, it is clear that in many ways, Jews grow up in … a family ambiance with a lower level of authoritarianism, greater tolerance, and a respect for intellectual experimentation. (The Jewish family is, however, much more rigid in many other ways, such as the closeness of family ties.)… Whatever the reasons, Jewish youths do seem to experiment with drugs, particularly marijuana, more than Gentiles. A study was done by the Toronto Addiction Research Foundation, entitled A Preliminary Report on the Attitudes and Behaviour of Toronto Students in Relation to Drugs. Of the Catholic high school students, 7 percent had taken drugs (mainly marijuana), and 75 percent said that they would not take drugs. These figures were g percent and 74 percent for Protestants. Among the Jewish students, about 15 percent had taken drugs, and 64 percent said that they would not use them...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1973 opinion, Orthodox rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] stated that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Jacobs1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian G. Jacobs|title=Judaism looks at modern issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVIRAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Aviva Press|isbn=978-0-9511560-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earleywine2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitch Earleywine|title=Pot Politics: Marijuana and the Costs of Prohibition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgASDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-518802-8|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Rosner|title=Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7w2oAmohpEC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2001|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-701-4|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Orthodox rabbi [[Efraim Zalmanovich]] stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher. In 2016, Belarusian-Israeli rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky]] declared that medicinal cannabis was [[kosher for Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elsa Vulliamy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/marijuana-is-kosher-for-passover-leading-rabbi-rules-a6995761.html |title=Marijuana is kosher for Passover, leading rabbi rules |publisher=The Independent |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the [[Orthodox Union]] certified some medical cannabis products made by [[Vireo]] as kosher, their first medical cannabis certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/business/kosher-medical-marijuana-heads-to-market.html|title=The Rabbis Are Here to Inspect the (Legal) Weed|first=Rachel|last=Abrams|date=6 May 2016|publisher=|via=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Jewish Social Policy Action Network in Philadelphia and Rabbi Eric Cytrin of Temple Beth El in Harrisburg, have supported medical legalization efforts for [[cannabis in Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejewishchronicle.net/view/full_story/23157425/article-Kosher-for-pain-relief?|title=Kosher for pain relief|publisher=Jewish Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kashrut==
If smoked, under normal circumstances there is no reason cannabis would not be kosher, although some rabbis apply this only to medical cannabis, not recreational usage.&lt;ref name=IfYouEatIt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/kosher-washing-medical-marijuana-1.5387374|title=Marijuana is Always Kosher, if you smoke it|agency=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is excepting that smoking it typically involves lighting a spark, so it would not be appropriate for example after sundown on [[Shabbat]]. If cannabis is "eaten", as edibles are, on the other hand, the issue is not as clear cut, as there may be small insects inside which are not kosher. For the observant it is recommended to only use brands that are certified as kosher.&lt;ref name=IfYouEatIt/&gt; For cannabis grown in Israel, the plants must observe [[Shmittah]], but this does not apply to cannabis from elsewhere.&lt;ref name=IfYouEatIt/&gt;

'''Cathal Joseph "Carl" Smyth''' (born 14 January 1959), also known as '''Chas Smash''', is an English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Smash came to prominence in the late 1970s as the [[backing vocalist]], trumpet player, harmonica player and dancer for the English [[ska]] band [[Madness (band)|Madness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4819/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography: Madness |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to trumpet, Smyth plays the [[bass guitar]] (having initially joined Madness as a bassist), [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and other various [[percussion instrument]]s. He occasionally performs the lead vocals, such as on the songs "[[Michael Caine (song)|Michael Caine]]", "[[Wings of a Dove (Madness song)|Wings of a Dove]]", "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]" and "[[Madness (Is All in the Mind)]]". He was initially an occasional [[songwriter]], but became a more regular contributor over the course of Madness's career and was credited as co-writer on the band's major international hit, "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun06/articles/classictracks_0606.htm |first=Richard |last=Buskin |title=Classic Tracks: 'Our House' by Madness |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=June 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Cathal Joseph Smyth was born on 14 January 1959, in [[Middlesex Hospital]], [[Fitzrovia]], London, England, and grew up in [[Marylebone]]. As a child he went by the name of Carl. His parents were Irish immigrants. His father worked in the oil business and moved the family from Ireland to England, and then to the Middle East because of his work. The Smyths were competitive Irish dancers, and Cathal grew up around dance, but never took much of an interest until he began to dance as a performer.&lt;ref name=Ska&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUba45txcJ8C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=chas+smash+born&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PoIKlFWSM0&amp;sig=Mshkpt7Wz1H718KgkOWhihxIN-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CHwQ6AEwE2oVChMItc7MtYfzxwIVCTI-Ch0SHQFC#v=onepage&amp;q=chas%20smash%20born&amp;f=false|title=Ska: An Oral History|author=Augustyn, Heather|date=2010|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the North London Invaders recruited Smyth to play the bass guitar with them when he was only 17 years old, but he was replaced a year later by Gavin Rogers. During the late seventies, Cathal became friends with members of the band Madness, and performed as a dancer onstage at their concerts.

==Music career==
{{Main|Madness (band)}}
In 1980, Smyth became the last of the seven original Madness members to join the band. He soon moved on to playing other instruments instead of bass.&lt;ref name=Ska /&gt; After Madness broke up in 1986, he formed a new short-lived band [[The Madness]] in 1988 along with [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]], [[Lee Thompson (saxophonist)|Lee Thompson]] and [[Chris Foreman]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/17/madness-new-album-norton-folegate-liberty |first=Simon |last=Garfield |title=Madness has released a new concept album about London and it may be their masterpiece |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Cathal became an executive for [[Go Discs]] where, at his suggestion, the label signed [[The Stairs]]. He was also responsible for reforming Madness in 1992 for [[Madstock!]], but he left Go Discs to reform the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seetickets.com/news/cathal-smyth-aka-chas-from-/1548|title=Cathal Smyth aka Chas from Madness |work=See Tickets |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989/1990, he became friends with former Smiths singer [[Morrissey]], who had once asked him to be his [[management|manager]]. Smyth declined, claiming that "I didn't fancy having to iron his socks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madness7.comuv.com/bio_chas.html |title=Chas Smash |work=Camden Town, Home of Madness |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smyth introduced Morrissey to [[Boz Boorer]], who went on to work with him from 1991 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://true-to-you.net/questions_with_answers_from_morrissey |title=Questions with answers from Morrissey |work=True To You |date=19 June 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626114539/http://true-to-you.net/questions_with_answers_from_morrissey# |archive-date=26 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathal is also the subject of the 1992 Morrissey single, "[[You're the One for Me, Fatty]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goddard |first=Simon |title=Mozipedia: The Encyclopedia of Morrissey and The Smiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3pEsVdZWUoC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;lpg=PA507&amp;dq=youre+the+one+for+me+fatty+carl+smyth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=80DqnqqNxM&amp;sig=Q9v3uXOc9UOCz-V4sNITMldq0OQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JIt4VNWANMLyPJfSgOgF&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=2 June 2015 |date=6 September 2012 |publisher=Ebury |isbn=978-0-09-192710-3 |page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also provided backing vocals on Morrissey's version of [[the Jam]]'s "[[That's Entertainment (song)|That's Entertainment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.discogs.com/Morrissey-Sing-Your-Life/release/573163 |title=Morrissey – Sing Your Life |publisher=discogs |year=2015 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathal also had a small part in Suggs' solo career, co-writing the song "Green Eyes,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lone-ranger-mw0000463580 |title=The Lone Ranger – Graham "Suggs" McPherson |first=Evan |last=Cater |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also performed backing vocals on ''[[The Lone Ranger (album)|The Lone Ranger]]'' album. In 1999, Smyth formed and fronted the [[folk music|folk]]-influenced band The Velvet Ghost, which played at the [[Fleadh]] festival in 2000.

In 2002, Cathal started up his own [[record label]], Rolled Gold Records (RGR Music), at an office in [[Camden Town]]. He released a debut single, "We're Coming Over", with The England Supporters Band (billed as Mr. Smash &amp; Friends) and it reached number 67 in the [[UK Singles Charts]]. RGR released an album and three singles by London rapper, [[Just Jack]]. The label also released material by dance and rap artists Autamata and Border Crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgk9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT426&amp;lpg=PT426&amp;dq=cathal+smyth+closed+rgr&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3cewLZVnAJ&amp;sig=9_ubc0QaO6HsctemdDnKXLpBn30&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBWoVChMI0KCw0JHzxwIVCMk-Ch2T1gmw#v=onepage&amp;q=cathal%20smyth%20closed%20rgr&amp;f=false|title=House of Fun: The Story of Madness|author=Reed, John|date=2014|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, after briefly moving his office to [[Islington]], he closed RGR.

In 2009 Madness released their first album of new material in ten years, ''[[The Liberty of Norton Folgate]]''. About this time, Smyth was rumoured to be working on several solo projects, including a dubstep album, according to ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''. In 2012 Madness followed up "Norton Folgate" with ''[[Oui Oui, Si Si, Ja Ja, Da Da]]''.

His debut solo album, ''[[A Comfortable Man]]'', was released in May 2015 and it reached no.68 in the UK album chart.&lt;ref name=guardian2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qthemusic.com/9873/listen-to-cathal-smyths-a-comfortable-man-plus-read-his-guide-to-the-record/ |title=Listen to Cathal Smyth's A Comfortable Man – plus read his guide to the album |work=Q |date=6 May 2015 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Madness released ''[[ Can't Touch Us Now]]'', the first Madness album since ''[[One Step Beyond...|One Step Beyond]]'' to be recorded without Smyth being credited as a member of the band.

==Personal life==
Smyth became a Freemason in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://zani.co.uk/archive/music-archive/item/343-carl-smyth-of-madness-talks-to-zani |title = Carl Smyth of Madness Talks to ZANI |last= |first= |author= |date= |year= |editor-last= |editor-first= |publisher = Zani.co.uk |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 18 November 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being a couple since their teen years, Smyth and his wife of 28 years separated in 2005.&lt;ref name=guardian2014/&gt; He has three grown-up children from the marriage: Casper, Milo, and Eloise. He appeared with Eloise at the 2012 [[Q Awards]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/pictures/79487898/chas-smash-from-madness-with-his-daughter-the-q-awards-2012-held-at_4138554 |title=Chas Smash from Madness with his daughter |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After his marriage ended, Smyth started to practise [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref name=guardian2014&gt;{{cite news |last=Duerden |first=Nick |title=Chas Smash: After the madness, going solo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/04/chas-smash-after-the-madness-going-solo |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 October 2014 |date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent time in rehab in Arizona&lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/ten-minutes-with-cathal-smyth-of-madness/&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[Ibiza]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2014/&gt;

The goddess '''Chía''' (from the [[Chibcha language]] "the one who is like the moon"), is a [[Triple deities#Triple goddesses|triple goddess]] in the [[Muisca religion|religion of the Muisca]] who inhabited the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] times. Of central importance to the pantheon, she was worshipped across various Muisca lands. In one of her many functions, Chía was considered to be the patron deity of the [[Muisca rulers|Zipa ruler]], who governed the territory encompassing what is now [[Bogotá]]. Her ceremonial center was located in or around the city of [[Chía, Cundinamarca]], which was aptly named after the goddess.

The ''chyquys''; priests of the sacred calendar, were in charge of the ceremonies dedicated to the goddess, which included offerings of gold and ceramic artwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6318">'''Coatlaxopeuh''' is a word proposed by father [[Mariano Jacobo Rojas]] of [[Tepoztlán]] as a possible [[Nahuatl]] origin of the word [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]], the appellation of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref&gt;Leatham 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion of a Nahuatl etymology for the Virgin's name was part of the Mexican [[Indigenismo|indigenista]] debates of the mid 20th century, in which prominent intellectuals reinterpreted Mexican history with a renewed emphasis on the nation's indigenous heritage. In addition to ''coatlaxopeuh'' many other proposed Nahuatl etymologies of Guadalupe have been suggested, but in the devotional literature coatlaxopeuh remains the most accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Leatham 1989:30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luís Becerra y Tanco==
The earliest suggestion that the word "Guadalupe" had originated as a misconstrual of an original Nahuatl word was by the priest Luís Becerra y Tanco in 1666.&lt;ref&gt;Becerra y Tanco 1979:9&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that since [[Juan Diego]] to whom the virgin had appeared did not speak Spanish, and since the Nahuatl language did not have the voiced consonants "g" or "d", it was likely that the name had originally been a Nahuatl word which was later misheard by Spaniards as Guadalupe. He proposed that the original name could have been "''tequantlanopeuh''" which he translated as "She who originated from the summit of the rocks".&lt;ref&gt;Leatham 1989:30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenismo==

Father Mario Rojas Sánchez who translated the [[Nican Mopohua]] suggested the Nahuatl name "Tlecuauhtlapeupeuh," which he translates as "She who emerges from the region 
of light like the Eagle from fire".&lt;ref&gt;Rojas Sánchez 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Jeanette Rodriguez, citing Xavier Escalada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Los catolicos hsipanos en los Estados Unidos|location=New York|publisher=Centra Catolico de Patoral para Hispanos del Nordest|author=Escalada, Xavier|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes "the Nahuatl language does not contain the letters d and g; therefore Our Lady's name could not have been "Guadalupe".&lt;ref name=Jeanette/&gt; She also presents the theory that Juan Diego and his uncle called the lady "Tlecuauhtlacupeuh", saying "The Nahuatl understanding of 'Tlecuauhtlacupeuh' is ''La que viene volando de la luz como el águila de fuego'' (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire). The region of light was the dwelling place of the Aztec gods, and the eagle was a sign from the gods. To the Spaniards, it sounded like 'Guadalupe' and reminded them of their Virgin at home."&lt;ref name=Jeanette/&gt; 

Rodriguez holds that the Spanish thought of "Guadalupe of Estremadura, Spain. [As] A large number of conquistadors were from the province of Estremadura and quite naturally were devoted to the local patroness. ...the devotion to [[Our Lady of Guadalupe, Extremadura|Our Lady of Guadalupe in Estremadura]] was reaching its peak at the time of the first contacts between Spain and the New World".&lt;ref name=Jeanette/&gt; 

Rodriguez states that the name "To the Spaniards...reminded them of their Virgin at home. To the natives, it...referred to a sign that had come from their gods."&lt;ref name=Jeanette/&gt; This allowed each side to see in the story something it "understood and valued, which would inevitably bring them together as a unifying force."&lt;ref name=Jeanette&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Lady of Guadalupe: Faith and Empowerment among Mexican-American Women|author=Jeanette Rodriguez|year=1994|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gloria Anzaldúa==
[[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]], in her book ''Borderlands / La Frontera,'' proposes the indigenous origin of Guadalupe as ''Coatlalopeuh'', which she translates as "She Who Has Dominion over Serpents." She argues that because Coatlalopeuh sounds like ''Guadalupe'', the Spanish saw Coatlalopeuh as parallel or identical to "the dark Virgin, ''Guadalupe'', patroness of West Central Spain" (Page 27). Anzaldúa gives ''Coatlaxopeuh'' as a variant name. She sees both versions as being linked historically to ''Coatlicue'', whose name means "Serpent Skirt."

'''Dagon''' ({{lang-phn|𐤃𐤂𐤍|Dāgūn}}; {{lang-he|דָּגוֹן}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Tiberian Hebrew|Tib.]]&lt;/small&gt; /dɔːgon/) or '''Dagan''' ({{lang-sux|2=&lt;sup&gt;[[dingir|d]]&lt;/sup&gt;da-gan|𒀭𒁕𒃶}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?searchword=l=da-gan%20t=DN&amp;charenc=gcirc The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[List of Mesopotamian deities|ancient Mesopotamian]] and [[ancient Canaanite religion|ancient Canaanite]] deity. He appears to have been worshipped as a [[List of fertility deities|fertility god]] in [[Ebla]], [[Assyria]], [[Ugarit]] and  among the [[Amorites]].

The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions him as the national god of the [[Philistines]] with  temples at [[Ashdod]] and elsewhere in [[Gaza City|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges'' on Judges 16:23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-standing association with a [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] word for "fish" (as in {{lang-he|דג}}, [[Tiberian Hebrew|Tib.]] {{IPA|/dɔːg/}}), perhaps going back to the [[History of the ancient Levant#Iron Age|Iron Age]], has led to an interpretation as a "fish-god", and the association of "[[merman]]" motifs in Assyrian art (such as the "Dagon" relief found by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in the 1840s). The god's name was, however, more likely derived from a word for "grain", suggesting that he was in origin associated with fertility and [[List of agricultural gods|agriculture]].

=={{anchor|Etymology}} Name ==
The name is recorded as [[Ugaritic]] {{transl|uga|Dgn}} ({{transl|uga|Dagnu}} or {{transl|uga|Daganu}}), [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] {{transl|akk|Dagana}}.

In Ugaritic, the root {{transl|uga|dgn}} also means "grain": in Hebrew, {{lang-he|label=none|דגן|dɔːgɔːn}} ([[Samaritan Hebrew]] {{transl|smp|dīgan}}), is an archaic word for grain.

According to [[Philo of Byblos]], the Phoenician author [[Sanchuniathon]] explained ''Dagon'' as a word for "grain" ({{transl|phn|siton}}). Sanchuniathon further explains: "And Dagon, after he discovered grain and the plough, was called [[Zeus]] Arotrios." The word {{transl|phn|arotrios}} means "ploughman" or "pertaining to agriculture" (from {{lang-phn|label=none|ἄροτρον||plow}}).

The theory relating the name to the Hebrew word "fish", based solely upon a reading of 1&amp;nbsp;Samuel 5:2–7, is discussed in {{section link||Fish-god tradition}} below.

== Ancient Near East ==
===Bronze Age===
The god Dagon first appears in extant records about 2500 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt; in the [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] texts and in personal [[Amorite]] names in which the [[Mesopotamian]] gods Ilu ([[El (god)|Ēl]]), Dagan, and [[Adad]] are especially common.

At [[Ebla]] (Tell Mardikh), from at least 2300&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;, Dagan was the head of the city [[wiktionary:pantheon|pantheon]] comprising some 200 deities and bore the titles ''BE-[[DINGIR]]-[[DINGIR]]'', "Lord of the gods" and ''Bekalam'', "Lord of the land". His consort was known only as Belatu, "Lady". Both were worshipped in a large temple complex called E-Mul, "House of the Star". One entire quarter of Ebla and one of its gates were named after Dagan. Dagan is called ''ti-lu ma-tim'', "dew of the land" and ''Be-ka-na-na'', possibly "Lord of [[Canaan]]". He was called lord of many cities: of [[Tuttul]], Irim, Ma-Ne, Zarad, Uguash, Siwad, and Sipishu.

Dagan is mentioned occasionally in early [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] texts but becomes prominent only in later [[Assyro-Babylonian]] inscriptions as a powerful and warlike protector, sometimes equated with [[Enlil]]. Dagan's wife was in some sources the goddess [[Shala]] (also named as wife of [[Adad]] and sometimes identified with [[Ninlil]]). In other texts, his wife is [[Ishara]]. In the preface to his famous [[Code of Hammurabi|law code]], King [[Hammurabi]] calls himself "the subduer of the settlements along the [[Euphrates]] with the help of Dagan, his creator". 
An inscription about an expedition of Naram-Sin to the Cedar Mountain relates (''ANET'', p.&amp;nbsp;268): "[[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] slew Arman and Ibla with the 'weapon' of the god Dagan who aggrandizes his kingdom."

An interesting early reference to Dagan occurs in a letter to King [[Zimri-Lim]] of Mari, 18th century &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;, written by Itur-Asduu an official in the court of Mari and governor of Nahur (the Biblical city of Nahor) (''ANET'', p.&amp;nbsp;623). It relates a dream of a "man from Shaka" in which Dagan appeared. In the dream, Dagan blamed Zimri-Lim's failure to subdue the King of the Yaminites upon Zimri-Lim's failure to bring a report of his deeds to Dagan in [[Terqa]]. Dagan promises that when Zimri-Lim has done so: "I will have the kings of the Yaminites [''coo'']''ked'' on a fisherman's ''spit'', and I will lay them before you."

In [[Ugarit]] around 1300 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;, Dagon had a large temple and was listed third in the pantheon following a father-god and Ēl, and preceding [[Baal|Baīl]] Ṣapān (that is the god Haddu or [[Hadad]]/Adad). [[Joseph Fontenrose]] first demonstrated that, whatever their deep origins, at Ugarit Dagon was sometime identified with El,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, "Dagon and El" ''Oriens'' '''10'''.2 (December 1957), pp. 277-279.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining why Dagan, who had an important temple at Ugarit is so neglected in the [[Ras Shamra]] mythological texts, where Dagon is mentioned solely in passing as the father of the god [[Hadad]] (Ba'al), but [[Anat]], El's daughter, is Ba'al's sister, and why no temple of El has appeared at Ugarit. It is suspected that Dagon was one of the "seventy sons of El and Athirat" that later sired [[Hadad]] (Ba'al) who would eventually attempt to forcefully insert himself in the second-tier of the council of El (although he would ultimately fail in this attempt)

''Dagan'' was sometimes used in Mesopotamian royal names. Two kings of the pre-Babylonian Dynasty of [[Isin]] were [[Iddin-Dagan]] (c. 1974–1954 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;) and [[Ishme-Dagan]] (c. 1953–1935 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;). The latter name was later used by two [[Assyria]]n kings: [[Ishme-Dagan I]] (c. 1782–1742 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;) and [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (c. 1610–1594 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;).

===Iron Age===

The [[Stela|stele]] of the 9th century BC Assyrian emperor [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (''ANET'', p.&amp;nbsp;558) refers to Ashurnasirpal as the favorite of [[An (mythology)|Anu]] and of Dagan. In an [[Assyria]]n poem, Dagan appears beside [[Nergal]] and [[Misharu]] as a judge of the dead. A late Babylonian text makes him the [[underworld]] prison warder of the seven children of the god Emmesharra.

The Phoenician inscription on the sarcophagus of King Eshmunʿazar of [[Sidon]] (5th century BC) relates (''ANET'', p.&amp;nbsp;662): "Furthermore, the Lord of Kings gave us Dor and [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]], the mighty lands of Dagon, which are in the Plain of [[Sharon, Israel|Sharon]], in accordance with the important deeds which I did."

[[Sanchuniathon]] reportedly made Dagon the brother of  [[Cronus]], both sons of the Sky ([[Uranus (god)|Uranus]]) and Earth, but not truly Hadad's father. Hadad (Demarus) was begotten by "Sky" on a concubine before Sky was castrated by his son Ēl, whereupon the pregnant concubine was given to Dagon. Accordingly, Dagon in this version is Hadad's half-brother and stepfather.

The Byzantine ''[[Etymologicon Magnum]]'' lists Dagon as the Phoenician Cronus.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose 1957:277.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hebrew Bible ==
[[File:Fall of Dagon.gif|thumb|240px|Depiction of the destruction of Dagon by [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]], 1793.]]
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], Dagon is particularly the god of the [[Philistine]]s with temples at Beth-dagon in the [[tribe of Asher]] ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 19.27), in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 16.23, which tells soon after how the temple is destroyed by [[Samson]] as his last act). Another temple, located in [[Ashdod]], was mentioned in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 5:2–7 and again as late as [[1 Maccabees]] 10.83;11.4. [[Saul|King Saul's]] head was displayed in a temple of Dagon.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|10:8-10|NIV}})&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a second place known as Beth-Dagon in [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] (Joshua 15.41). The first-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Antiquities'' 12.8.1; ''War'' 1.2.3&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a place named Dagon above [[Jericho]]. [[Jerome]] mentions Caferdago between [[Lod|Diospolis]] and Jamnia. There is also a modern Beit Dejan south-east of [[Nablus]]. Some of these toponyms may have to do with grain rather than the god.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The account in 1&amp;nbsp;Samuel 5.2–7 relates how the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was [[Philistine captivity of the Ark|captured by the Philistines]] and taken to Dagon's temple in Ashdod. The following morning the Ashdodites found the image of Dagon lying prostrate before the ark. They set the image upright, but again on the morning of the following day they found it prostrate before the ark, but this time with head and hands severed, lying on the ''miptān'' translated as "threshold" or "podium". The account continues with the puzzling words ''raq dāgôn nišʾar ʿālāyw'', which means literally "only Dagon was left to him." (The [[Septuagint]], [[Peshitta]], and [[Targum]]s render "Dagon" here as "trunk of Dagon" or "body of Dagon", presumably referring to the lower part of his image.)

Thereafter we are told that neither the priests nor anyone ever steps on the ''miptān'' of Dagon in Ashdod "unto this day". "We have remarkable evidence of the permanence of the custom in {{bibleverse||Zephaniah|1:9|NKJV}}, where the Philistines are described as 'those that leap on, or more correctly over, 'the threshold'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm Pulpit Commentary on 1 Samuel 5], accessed 24 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This story is depicted on the frescoes of the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] as the opposite to a depiction of the High Priest [[Aaron]] and the [[Temple of Solomon]].

== Marnas ==
The ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'' of [[Porphyry of Gaza]], mentions the great god of Gaza, known as Marnas ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''Marnā'' the "Lord"), who was regarded as the god of rain and grain and invoked against famine. Marna of Gaza appears on coinage of the time of [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Stewart Macalister, ''The Philistines'' (London) 1914, p. 112 (illus.).&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was identified at Gaza with [[Zeus|Cretan Zeus, ''Zeus Krētagenēs'']]. It is likely that Marnas was the Hellenistic expression of Dagon. His temple, the [[Marneion]]—the last surviving great cult center of paganism—was [[Porphyry of Gaza|burned by order of the Roman emperor]] during the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]] in 402. Treading upon the sanctuary's paving-stones had been forbidden. Christians later used these same to pave the public marketplace.

== Fish-god tradition ==
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e6 915-0.jpg|thumb|"Oannes" relief from [[Khorsabad]] ]]

The "fish" etymology was accepted in 19th and early 20th century scholarship. This led to the association with the "[[merman]]" motif in [[Assyria]]n and [[Phoenicia]]n art (e.g. [[Julius Wellhausen]], [[William Robertson Smith]]),{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and with the figure of the Babylonian ''[[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]]'' (Ὡάννης) mentioned by  [[Berossus]] (3rd century BC).
 
The first to cast doubt on the "fish" etymology was Schmökel (1928), who suggested that while Dagon was not in origin a "fish god", the association with ''dâg'' "fish" among the maritime Canaanites (Phoenicians) would have affected the god's iconography.&lt;ref&gt;H. Schmökel, ''Der Gott Dagan'' (Borna-Leipzig) 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontenrose (1957:278)  still suggests that Berossos's ''Odakon'', part man and part fish, was possibly a garbled version of Dagon.  Dagon was also equated with Oannes.
 
The association with ''dāg''/''dâg'' 'fish' is made by 11th-century  Jewish Bible commentator [[Rashi]].&lt;ref&gt;Rashi's commentary on 1 Samuel 5:2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 13th century, [[David Kimhi]] interpreted the odd sentence in 1&amp;nbsp;Samuel 5.2–7 that "only Dagon was left to him" to mean "only the form of a fish was left", adding: "It is said that Dagon, from his navel down, had the form of a fish (whence his name, Dagon), and from his navel up, the form of a man, as it is said, his two hands were cut off." The [[Septuagint]] text of 1&amp;nbsp;Samuel 5.2–7 says that both the hands ''and the head'' of the image of Dagon were broken off.&lt;ref&gt;Noticed by Schmökel 1928, noted in Fontenrose 1957:278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{main|Dagon in popular culture}}
The Semitic god Dagon has appeared in many works of popular culture.

Notable examples include [[John Milton]]'s epic poems ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Dagon (short story)|Dagon]]'' and ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], ''[[Dagon (novel)|Dagon]]'' by [[Fred Chappell]], ''[[Middlemarch]]'' by [[George Eliot]], and ''King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David'' by Malachi Martin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">'''Eileen May Duggan''' (21 May 1894 &amp;ndash; 10 December 1972) [[OBE]] was a New Zealand poet and journalist, from an Irish Roman Catholic family.&lt;ref name="DNZB Duggan"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Eileen May Duggan|first= Peter|last= Whiteford|id=4d23|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] as a journalist, and wrote a weekly article for the Catholic weekly ''[[The New Zealand Tablet]]'' for almost fifty years.

== Early life ==
She was born in [[Tuamarina]] near [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] in [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]], the youngest of four daughters of John and Julia Duggan. They were both from [[County Kerry]], Ireland, and had married in Wellington on 7 October 1885. John was a platelayer on the [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Railways]].

She attended [[Tuamarina]] School from 1901 to 1910 and  [[Marlborough Boys' College|Marlborough High School]]. She taught as a pupil teacher at Tuamarina School from 1912 to 1913, and attended [[Wellington Teachers Training College]] from 1914 to 1915. She studied at [[Victoria University College]], Wellington from 1916, receiving a BA in 1916, and a MA with first class honours in history in 1918, and was awarded the Jacob Joseph Scholarship. She taught at [[Dannevirke]] High School in 1918, then at Marlborough High School, St Patrick’s College, Wellington, and was an assistant lecturer at [[Victoria University College]] for one year. She was deeply affected by the death of her sister Evelyn in 1921, and after briefly staying with her other married sister Mary moved about 1925 to the Catholic Girls’ Hostel in Wellington. Her other sister Catherine (or Katherine) had entered the Order of Our Lady of the Missions.

==Later life==
She had continued ill health from a childhood sickness, so decided to give up teaching. Partly for the same reason she decided not to marry in 1918 and in 1940. She supported herself by journalism, with a weekly article in ''The New Zealand Tablet'', writing the women’s page under the pen name of Pippa. The first article appeared in the issue of 7 September 1927, and the last posthumously on 17 January 1973. She also wrote items for newspapers like ''[[The Dominion (Wellington)|The Dominion]]'' of Wellington. She lived in inner-city Wellington in Glencoe Terrace off The Terrace, in a weird canyon in the heart of the city up flights of precipitous stairs.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess p43, Whiteford p16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poet ==
Her first poems were published in ''The New Zealand Tablet'' in 1917. Soon after her arrival in Wellinngton she published her first volume, probably in 1921 (although other dates have been proposed: 1920, 1922 or 1924). Through her career she published individual poems in various newspapers and journals in New Zealand (''The School Journal''), Australia (''The Bulletin''), England (''The New English Weekly'') and America (''America'' and ''The Commonweal'', both Catholic journals).&lt;ref&gt;Burgess p68&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s she was New Zealand's best-known poet, with an Eileen Duggan Society in America. Her 1937 volume of poems had an introduction by [[Walter de la Mare]]. She stopped writing poems about 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Whiteford p17&lt;/ref&gt;  She wrote some poems on events for the Catholic Church, which treated her at times as an unofficial poet laureat, and a poem when Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] died.

Some of her poems were anthologised in books of New Zealand poems by Chapman, Bennett and Vincent O’Sullivan, but none of her poems were included in [[Allen Curnow]]s influential 1960 ''Penguin'' anthology because of a disagreement over selection of them. Her reputation declined after her death, from her association with the English [[Georgian poets]] and with the inclusion of some of her poems in the 1930 anthology ''[[Kowhai Gold]]'' which was rather self-consciously New Zealand.

She was awarded the O.B.E. in 1937 for services to the Dominion, one of the first writers to be so honoured. In 1942 Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]] who was a personal friend got her a small pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= [[Michael Bassett|Bassett]] |first= Michael |title= Tomorrow Comes the Song: A life of Peter Fraser |edition=  |origyear=  |year=  2000 |publisher= Penguin |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-14-029793-6 |oclc= |page= 141 |pages= }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 9 February 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Majorana syriaca - za'atar.jpg|thumb|250px|''Origanum syriacum'']]
'''Ezov''' ({{lang-he|אזוב}}) is the [[Classical Hebrew]] name of a plant mentioned in the [[Bible]] in the context of religious rituals. In some English-language Bibles, the word is transliterated as ''ezob.'' 

The [[Septuagint]] translates the name as ὕσσωπος ''hyssop'', and [[English translations of the Bible]] often follow this rendering. The Hebrew word אזוב and the Greek word ὕσσωπος probably share a common (unknown) origin.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd Edition, 1989, ''s.v.'' hyssop&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bible, ''ezov'' is described as a small plant found on or near walls,&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 4:33&lt;/ref&gt; with an aromatic odour.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 19:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Maimonides]], [[Saadia Gaon]] and earlier Jewish commentators identified ''ezov'' with  ''[[za'atar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[Judeo-Arabic]] translation of the word in the works of Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]] (in his ''Tafsir'', a translation of the Pentateuch, Exo. 12:22), [[David ben Abraham al-Fasi]] (in his Hebrew-Arabic Dictionary of the Bible, known as ''`Kitāb Jāmiʿ al-Alfāẓ`'', vol. 1, s.v. אזוב), Rabbi [[Jonah ibn Janah]] (''Sefer HaShorashim'' - Book of the Roots, s.v. אזב - ''aleph'', ''zayn'', ''bet''), [[Maimonides]] (in his ''Mishnah'' Commentary, ''Nega'im'' 14:6) and [[Nathan ben Abraham I]] in Mishnah ''Uktzin'' 2:2. The problems with identification arise from Jewish oral tradition where it expressly prohibits Greek hyssop, and where the biblical plant is said to have been identical to the Arabic word, ''zaatar'' ([[Origanum syriacum]]), and which word is not to be associated with other ''ezobs'' that often bear an additional epithet, such as ''zaatar farsi'' = Persian-hyssop ([[Thymbra capitata]]) and ''zaatar rumi'' = Roman-hyssop ([[Satureja|Satureja thymbra]]). See: ''[[The Mishnah]]'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. ''Negai'im'' 14:6 (p. 696); ''Parah'' 11:7 (p. 711).&lt;/ref&gt; which  may refer to various local herbs, including [[marjoram]], [[oregano]] and [[thyme]], which have aromatic and cleansing properties, grow wild in Israel, and can easily be bunched together to be used for sprinkling.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

The book of John in the [[New Testament]] (written in [[Koine Greek]]) mentions that ''hyssop'' was used, along with vinegar, to alleviate the thirst of [[Jesus]], during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. Matthew and Mark mention the occasion but refer to the plant using the general term κάλαμος (''kálamos''), which is translated as "reed" or "stick." ''Origanum'' has short stems and some scholars say it would have been too short to reach the mouth of Jesus during [[crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars have proposed that ''ezov'' is the [[caper]] plant (''Capparis spinosa''), which the Arabs call ''azaf.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/h/hyssop48.html A modern herbal: Hyssop]&lt;/ref&gt; The caper is native throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and considered to have cleansing properties.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Ritual use==
[[File:Capparis zoharyi 4.jpg|thumb|200px|Caper plant]]
The Israelites used ezov in the [[Passover]] ritual when they were enslaved in Egypt, according to the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament, to sprinkle lamb's blood on the door posts and [[lintel]]s of the slaves' quarters in which they lived, so that God&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 12:23&lt;/ref&gt; would pass over them as he slew the first-born of the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 12:22&lt;/ref&gt; The Israelites used ezov more regularly for other rituals when they had settled in Israel. It was used in the [[tzaraath|ritual for cleansing from leprosy]]&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 14:4-7, 14:49-51&lt;/ref&gt; and for ritual purification.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 19&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Psalms]], the sprinkling of ezov is used metaphorically to refer to purification of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 50 (septuagint numbering), Psalm 51 (masoretic numbering)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] and some sects interpret ''ezov'' as ''hyssop'' and have adopted the biblical practice of sprinkling with water to ritually cleanse objects, including churches and people, in a ritual termed ''[[aspersion]]'' during the [[Asperges]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">'''Fidyah''' ({{lang-ar|الفدية}}) and '''Kaffara''' ({{lang-ar|links=no|كفارة}}) are religious donations made in [[Islam]] when a fast (notably in [[Ramadan]]) is broken. The donations can be of food, or money, and it is used to feed those in need. They are mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] which distinguishes the two, but unifies them into one idea. Some organizations have online Fidyah and Kaffara options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irusa.org/campaigns/fidya-and-kaffara/|title=Ramadan - Islamic Relief USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fidyah==
Fidyah (also [[romanized]] as ''Fidya'') is a religious donation of money or food made to help those in need. Fidyah is made when someone is ill or of extreme age (old or young), cannot fast for the required number of days, and will not be able to make up for the fast.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/ramadan/fidyah-and-kaffarah/|title=Fidyah &amp; Kaffarah {{!}} Islamic Relief UK|work=Islamic Relief UK|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ramadan, the Fidyah must be paid for each fast missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irusa.org/campaigns/fidya-and-kaffara/|title=Ramadan - Islamic Relief USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, one misses their fast due to being sick or on a journey, but will be healthy enough to make up for it, they should preferably make up for the fast at a later date, as prescribed in the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;verse=184|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Translation|website=corpus.quran.com|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kaffara==
Kaffara (also romanized as ''Kaffarah'') like Fidyah, is a religious donation of money or food made to help those in need. Kaffara is made when someone deliberately misses a fast or intentionally breaks their fast, such as by having intercourse, or eating.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==In the Qur'an==
Fidyah and Kaffara are mentioned in the Qur'an in the selection below:
{{Quote|"[Observing Saum (fasts)] for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man, etc.), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. And that you fast, it is better for you if only you know."|Quran: 2:184&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|184|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

'''''Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions''''' is a 1980 book by magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] about [[paranormal]], [[occult]], and [[pseudoscience]] claims. The foreword is by science fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]]. Randi explores topics which he says that scientists and the media are too willing to promote without [[Scientific skepticism|skepticism]] and proper expertise.

==Content==
[[Timothy Ferris]] wrote that ''Flim Flam!'' "will enlighten any reader who does not clearly understand that not one shard of evidence exists to prove that the [[Bermuda Triangle]] poses any special menace to ships and planes, that earth is being [[Alien visitation|visited by alien spacecraft]], that the unassisted [[Clairvoyance|power of the mind can read closed books]], [[Divination|predict our future]] or induce [[levitation]], or that the '[[Psychic surgery|psychic surgeons]]' of the Philippines have relieved their patients of any burden more troublesome than their money."&lt;ref name= "Ferris1980"/&gt; Randi levels criticism at the [[Pathological science|sloppy study designs and faulty controls]] of the investigations into [[remote viewing]] by [[Russell Targ]] and [[Harold Puthoff]].&lt;ref name= "Kirkus"&gt;{{cite news |title= FLIM-FLAM! by James Randi |type= book review |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-randi-3/flim-flam/ |magazine= [[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate= 2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Richman |first1= H |last2= Bell |first2= C |date= March 2012 |title= Paranormal beliefs then and now |journal= [[North American Journal of Psychology]] |volume= 14 |issue= 1 |pages= 197–206 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/927903920 |via= [[ProQuest]] |accessdate= 2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One anecdote in the book is Randi's experience as a newspaper [[astrologer]] in Montreal under the name Zo-ran where he cut [[horoscope]]s from old [[astrology]] magazines and randomly assigned them to the [[Astrological sign|twelve signs]] of the [[zodiac]], publishing the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Star crazy: Is your sign out of order? |newspaper= [[The Irish Times]] |date= 1996-01-20 |accessdate= 2014-08-11 |via= [[HighBeam Research]] |subscription= yes |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24948476.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi also [[Debunker|debunks]] the book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' noting, among other things, the author's [[eurocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Achenbach |first= Joel |authorlink= Joel Achenbach |date= 1989-12-24 |title= Tale of outer-space ancestors is literary fraud |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] |agency= [[Knight Ridder]] |page= S2 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E9cqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2YQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4246%2C3613796 |accessdate= 2014-08-11 |via= [[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transcendental Meditation]] movement and [[Edgar Cayce]]'s [[Mysticism|mystic]] medical practice are subjected to Randi's skeptical scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Transcendental Meditation and Edgar Cayce:

==Reception==
Timothy Ferris wrote in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' it is "a healthy and often hilarious book."&lt;ref name= "Ferris1980"&gt;{{cite news |last= Ferris |first= Timothy |authorlink= Timothy Ferris |title= Nonfiction in brief § ''FLIM-FLAM!

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' states ''Flim Flam!'' has a brisk pace and clear message.&lt;ref name= "Kirkus"/&gt; They were also critical of Randi's "abrasive style" but state that after, "Randi has set forth the shameless frauds and money-making schemes, the outrageous misstatements and falsifications of data in respected scientific journals, the righteous harangue seems warranted."&lt;ref name= "Kirkus"/&gt; The magazine describes the anecdotes about cases Randi was involved in as a judge or expert as absorbing and states they go far to make the point, "if you design the experiment adequately, no extraordinary powers are demonstrated." concluding, "By the end of the book, Randi's personal offer of $10,000 to be paid to anyone who successfully demonstrates paranormal abilities under proper test conditions seems safe beyond a doubt."&lt;ref name= "Kirkus"/&gt;

Jack Kirwan writing in the ''[[National Review]]'' embraced the tone of the book describing the writing as "a juicy knock-'em-down style" and stating, "Randi takes on the heavies of the paranormal scene - von Däniken, UFOs, Uri Geller, TM - and feeds them into the meat grinder of critical investigation."&lt;ref name= "Kirwan1982"/&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated, "''Flim-Flam!'' is an excellent overview of paranormal claims that analyzes medical humbugs, psychic photography, Transcendental Meditation, ancient astronauts, UFOs, etc. Plentiful photographs catch hoaxers in the act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Truth or fiction: Science and the paranormal |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= 1986-10-01 |page= A8 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/302102282 |accessdate= 2014-08-12 |via= [[ProQuest]] |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the audiotape edition in the ''Journal of College Science Teaching'' George Kauffman wrote of Randi's analysis of the failures of paranormal "researchers", "In clearly pointing out their errors and misrepresentations, he provides a compelling and convincing case that will startle and enlighten the listener, especially one unable to distinguish between genuine scientific research and the pseudoscientific nonsense that results in fantastic theories and fallacies.&lt;ref name= "Kauffman1997"/&gt; The ''[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]'' stated ''Flim Flam!'' succeeds in discrediting the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Inside Info: UFOs viewed in library books |newspaper= [[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |date= 1980-12-19 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bMIzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5694%2C6564225 |accessdate= 2014-08-11 |via= [[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{Nihongo|'''''Hadaka Matsuri'''''|裸祭り|"Naked Festival"}} is a type of [[Japanese festival]], or ''[[matsuri]]'', in which participants wear a minimum amount of clothing; usually just a Japanese loincloth (called ''[[fundoshi]]''), sometimes with a short [[happi coat]], and rarely completely naked.

Naked festivals are held in dozens of places throughout Japan every year, usually in the summer or winter. The most famous festival is the Saidai-ji Eyo Hadaka Matsuri held at [[Saidaiji Temple]] in [[Okayama]], where the festival originated. Every year, over 9,000 men participate in this festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/indepth/history/traditionalevents/a11_fes_eyo.html Saidai-ji Eyo Hadaka Matsuri]&lt;/ref&gt;
in hopes of gaining luck for the entire year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5279">[[Image:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1784), by [[Jacques-Louis David]] and his pupil [[Girodet]]]]
In the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] legend of the [[Roman kingdom|kingdom era]], the '''Horatii'''  were [[Multiple birth|triplet]] warriors who lived during the reign of [[Tullus Hostilius]].  The accounts of their [[Champion warfare|epic clash]] with the Curiatii and the murder of their sister by Publius, the sole survivor of the battle, appear in the writings of [[Livy]].&lt;ref&gt;The names ''Horatii'' and ''Curiatii'' are derived from the plural of their surnames: "''[[Horatia (gens)|Horatius]]''", and "''[[Curiatia (gens)|Curiatius]]''".  The English equivalents could be "the Horatius Brothers" and "The Curiatius Brothers".&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Alba Longa==

Livy recounts this tale in the first book of his History of Rome.  During the [[Roman King|Roman king]] [[Tullus Hostilius|Tullus Hostilius']] war with the neighboring city of [[Alba Longa]], it was agreed that rather than fighting a costly war between their armies, the conflict would be settled by a [[Champion warfare|fight to the death]] between the Horatii and the three triplets from Alba Longa, known as the ''Curiatii''.  They met on the battlefield between the lines as the two armies and their countrymen looked on.

With so much at stake, both sides fought bravely.  The Horatii had wounded all three Curiatii, but two of the Romans were killed in the process.  That left their brother Publius alone and surrounded by the three Albans.  Though he was uninjured, Publius realized he stood no chance against all three of his enemies together.  So he began to run across the battlefield instead.  The Albans pursued him, each as fast as their individual injuries permitted.  This was exactly what he had hoped they would do, and after they had gone far enough, he saw that the Curiatii had become staggered and were separated from each another.  His plan had worked perfectly.  He turned and launched a furious attack on the first, least-injured Curiatius and slew him.

The Roman spectators, who, moments before, had been sure of defeat, began cheering wildly as the Albans began shouting at the Curiatii to regroup in the face of Publius' onslaught.  But before they could, the Horatius caught up to the second Curiatius and killed him as his brother, helpless, looked on.  The final Curiatius was physically spent from his wounds and the chase.  His hope had been crushed by watching both of his brothers die. He managed to unsteadily stand his ground and faced the Horatius, who was heartened by his wildly successful strategy and confident of his imminent victory.  Publius declared that he had killed the first two Curiatii for his fallen brothers.  He would kill this last one for the Roman cause and their rule over the Albans.  He thrust his sword down the Alban's throat and took the armor of his slain enemies as the spoils of his victory.

Afterwards, King Mettus honored the treaty and the Albans accepted Roman rule.

==Homecoming of Publius==
[[File:Lagrenée Horace venant de frapper sa soeur.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Publius Horatius after killing his sister]]
The victorious Horatius returned to a hero's welcome.  Before the war had broken out, Publius' sister, Camilla, had been engaged to one of the Alban triplets.  When she saw the cloak that she herself had woven and given to the Curiatius on her brother's shoulder, now stained with his blood, she realized that her betrothed had been slain.  Camilla was overcome with grief and began wailing and crying out his name.  Proclaiming that no Roman woman should mourn Rome's fallen enemies, Publius [[sororicide|killed his sister]] on the spot.

For his crime, he was condemned to death.  On the advice of a jurist named Tullus, Publius appealed to one of the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom|popular assemblies]].  In defense of his son, the Horatius' father, also Publius, spoke of the recent victory and entreated them to spare his last surviving son (his fourth son, a brother of the Horatii, had also died).  The assembly was persuaded and Publius' sentence was commuted.  This may be the source of the Roman tradition of allowing the condemned to appeal their sentences to the populace.  

Publius the elder was required to offer a sacrifice to atone for his son's crime and from that time forward, [[Horatia (gens)|the Horatia family]] made it a tradition to offer the same.  The spoils of the victory were hung in a place that became known as Pila Horatia.  A wooden beam was erected on the slope of the [[Oppian Hill]], which was called the [[Sororium Tigillum]] (Sister's Beam).  It symbolized a yoke, under which Publius the younger was made to pass.  It remained standing long after his death.

The '''Icelandic National Front''' ({{lang-is|Íslenska þjóðfylkingin}}) is a [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[List of political parties in Iceland|political party in Iceland]].

==History==
On 27 February 2016, the [[Right-Green People's Party]] was disbanded and merged into the party.&lt;ref name="mbl_feb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visir.is/haegri-graenir-ganga-til-lids-vid-islensku-thjodfylkinguna/article/2016160228918|title=Hægri grænir ganga til liðs við Íslensku þjóðfylkinguna|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2016, the National Front reached out to controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visir.is/segir-asmund-hafa-skipad-ser-i-flokk-med-populistum-og-donald-trump/article/2016160309705|title=Segir Ásmund hafa skipað sér í flokk með popúlistum og Donald Trump|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dv.is/frettir/2015/12/18/ritstjori-kjarnans-segir-asmund-fridriksson-rasista/|title=Ritstjóri Kjarnans segir Ásmundur Friðriksson rasista|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] member [[Ásmund Friðriksson]], asking him to join the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyjan.pressan.is/frettir/2016/03/03/islenska-thjodfylkingin-komdu-til-okkar-asmundur/|date=3 March 2016|title=Íslenska þjóðfylkingin: Komdu til okkar Ásmundur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2016, the party organized a protest against revisions to Iceland's immigration laws at Austurvöllur square in front of the Parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visir.is/olikar-fylkingar-maettust-a-austurvelli-i-dag/article/2016160819284|date=15 August 2016|title=Ólíkar fylkingar mættust á Austurvelli í dag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They participated in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]], only running candidates in the [[South Constituency|South]] and [[Northwest Constituency|Northwest]] constituencies after failing to obtain ballot access for the remaining four; in part due to two of their senior members, [[Gústaf Níelsson]] and Gunnlaugur Ingvarsson, defecting shortly before the election and taking the lists of signatures for the two Reykjavík constituencies with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/thjodfylkingin-bydur-ekki-fram-i-reykjavik/|date=14 October 2016|title=Þjóðfylkingin býður ekki fram í Reykjavík}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was due to take part in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2017|2017 election]] and had planned on running in the three constituencies in the [[Greater Reykjavik|capital area]] and the [[South Constituency|South]], but withdrew all its lists after false signatures had been discovered on two of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/thjodfylkingin-dregur-alla-lista-sina-til-baka|date=14 October 2017|title=Þjóðfylkingin dregur alla lista sína til bak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 Gústaf Níelsson and Gunnlaugur Ingvarssons launched a new party Frelsisfokkurinn (the Freedom Party), which attracted members from the Icelandic National Front,&lt;ref&gt;http://eyjan.pressan.is/frettir/2017/08/11/stofna-nyjan-stjornmalaflokk-frelsisflokkinn/&lt;/ref&gt; although Níelsson shortly thereafter quit politics and moved to Spain. 

==Policies==
The Icelandic National Front aims to defend Iceland’s sovereignty and independence and national culture, language and customs. The party is wholly opposed to multiculturalism and wants Iceland out of the [[Schengen Area]]. They are in favour of [[debt adjustment]]. The party also wishes to introduce a new currency in Iceland that is linked to the [[United States dollar]] and it wants to eliminate [[indexation]]. Furthermore, they want to focus on the interests of the elderly and disabled. Other proposals from the party program include introducing a [[Voting in Switzerland#Legislative referendums|Swiss-style referendum system]].&lt;ref name="mbl_feb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2016/02/27/haegri_graenir_heyra_sogunni_til/|title=Hægri grænir heyra sögunni til|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unnið að stofnun flokks sem leggst gegn fjölmenningu og byggingu mosku á Íslandi|date=27 February 2016|url=http://www.visir.is/unnid-ad-stofnun-flokks-sem-leggst-gegn-fjolmenningu-og-byggingu-mosku-a-islandi/article/2016160228905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[mosque]]s, [[burqa]]s, [[female genital mutilation]] and [[Madrasa|Islamic schools]] are opposed by the party, although the party claims that the religious freedom as stated in the [[Icelandic constitution]] is not opposed. [[Christian culture|Christian]] and Nordic culture is supported by the party.&lt;ref name="mbl_feb"/&gt; The founder and first chairman of the party, [[Helgi Helgason]], said that his opposition against [[Islam]] is inspired by [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dv.is/frettir/2016/2/29/thess-vegna-er-islenska-thjodfylkingin-moti-islam/|title=Þess vegna er Íslenska Þjóðfylkingin á móti íslam|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Imperial Preceptor''', or '''Dishi''' ({{zh |s = 帝师 |t = 帝師 |p = Dìshī}}, lit. "Teacher of the Emperor") was a high [[Title of honor|title]] and powerful post created by [[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art''. By John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, Robert A. F. Thurman, p45&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as part of [[Mongol]] patronage of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Tibet under Yuan rule|Yuan administrive rule of Tibet]].

The title was originally created as the '''State Preceptor''' or '''Guoshi''' ({{zh |s = 国师 |t  =國師 |p = Guóshī}}, lit. "Teacher of the State") in 1260, the first year of Kublai Khan's enthronement. In that year he appointed the [[Sakya]] lama [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] to this post and soon placed him in charge of all Buddhist clergy. In 1264, he founded the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] and appointed Phagpa as the first director of this important new agency. The lama was offered nominal rule over all Tibet and also supervised Mongol relations with the Buddhist clergy. In 1270, Phagpa became Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) when the title was renamed. As Imperial Preceptor, he was authorized to issue letters and proclamations to the temples and institutions of Tibet, and he advised the Emperor regarding official appointments in Tibet. Kublai Khan dispatched the lama to Tibet in 1264 to help persuade his people to accept Mongol rule.

A member of the Sakya sect, acting as Imperial Preceptor and residing in [[China]], supervised the Buddhist clergy throughout the empire. The Mongols also selected a Tibetan official titled ''[[dpon-chen]]'' to live in and administer Tibet. This pattern of religio-political relations prevailed for the remainder of the Yuan period. After the overthrow of the Mongol Yuan dynasty by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], Yuan titles such as Imperial Preceptor were revoked, replaced with titles of lesser status.

== Introduction to the Yuan Dynasty and Beginnings of the Imperial Preceptor ==
=== The Creation of the Imperial Preceptor ===

The Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368) was founded by [[Kublai Khan]] after the fall of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279). During the last century of the [[Song Dynasty]], a new state referred to as the Great [[Western Xia|Hsia]] state came into existence. The Hsia were a Tibetan people.&lt;ref name="Journal Article"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dunnell |first1=Ruth |title=Asia Major |journal=The Hsia Origins of the Yüan Institution of Imperial Preceptor |date=1992 |volume=Fifth |issue= 1 |pages=85–111 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41645478?newaccount=true&amp;read-now=1&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tangut monarch [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia|Jen-tsung]] (1139-1193) resisted the Mongolian conquest of Tibet by fighting with the Northern Steppe Tribes. He formed a close relationship between the [[Buddhist]] prelates and Tibetan priests, which led to the creation of the Hsia Institution of the Imperial Preceptorship. The role the Imperial Preceptor carried would later emerge in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and be largely influential to the [[Buddhist]] religion during Yuan rule.

=== The Rise of the Yuan Dynasty ===

[[Kublai Khan]], leader of the [[Mongols|Mongolian]] [[Borjigin]] clan, established the [[Yuan Dynasty]] eight years before he took over all of China. He proclaimed himself the first non-Han Emperor of China in 1279 after conquering the [[Song Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bawden R. |first1=Charles |title=Kublai Khan |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kublai-Khan |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yuan Dynasty]] was the first Chinese dynasty to be ruled by a foreign people. Under [[Kublai Khan]], the [[Yuan Dynasty]] was structurally divided in a similar manner as the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yuan Dynasty |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty |website=Wikipedia |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also established his rule under the [[Mandate of Heaven]] (1272), which was a Chinese political and religious doctrine used to justify kingship over China. This doctrine helped [[Kublai Khan]] establish his legitimate rule as he was considered to have the [[Divine right of kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mandate of Heaven |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven |website=Wikipedia |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did he establish religious and political rule over China, he kept his ancestral roots as a Mongolian leader by following [[Confucianism]]. [[Kublai Khan]] expanded the Chinese commercial, scientific, and cultural industries. He improved the [[Silk Road]], created better infrastructure, circulated paper banknotes, and spread Mongol peace, leading to a prosperous and flourishing period.

=== The Influence of Buddhism on Tibetan Rule During Mongolian Patronage ===

The [[Buddhist]] influence on [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rule under [[Kublai Khan]] was heavily dependent on the Tibetan Buddhist Imperial Preceptors. In twelfth century Asia, [[Western Xia|Hsia]] [[Buddhism]] was vigorously promoted and there were religious scriptures translated to Chinese and Tangut in order to spread the religion. Use of these [[Buddhist]] scriptures continued even during the [[Mongol]] conquest for the [[Western Xia|Hsia]] state in 1227. By the mid-twelfth century onward shows a special relationship between the [[Western Xia|Tangut]] throne and the [[Sangha]] that is distinct from the [[Song Dynasty]] courts.&lt;ref name="Journal Article"/&gt; Before the [[Yuan Dynasty]], the role of the Imperial Preceptor had already been established during the early rule of [[Renzong Emperor]] in 1139-1193. During the Mongol rule over the [[Yuan Dynasty]], the Imperial Preceptor's position was continued in response to overseeing the political situation in Central Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tuttle |first1=Gray |title=Imperial Preceptor |url=https://lamas-and-emperors.wikischolars.columbia.edu/Imperial+Preceptor |website=Lamas-and-emperors |publisher=Wiki Scholars |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the Imperial Preceptor was to coordinate all of the Buddhist activities and establishments in the [[Yuan Empire]] and promoting [[Buddhism]].

== Roles of the Imperial Preceptor ==
In the 12th century, under the [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]], the role of the imperial preceptor was serving as the emperor's chaplain, teacher and consecrator and, more generally, teaching, writing, translating and editing. Later, under the Yuan Dynasty, this post had also the added responsibility of overseeing the political situation in Central Tibet. [[Chogyal Phagpa|Phagpa]] was a State Preceptor ([[guoshi]]), that eventually became Mongol Imperial Preceptor. The Mongol imperial preceptor resided within the precincts of the imperial palace, in order to serve the imperial family.  The role of the imperial preceptors was to issue decrees, under the emperor's authority to both protect and command monasteries in Tibet. At some point, the imperial preceptor's decrees began to be equally effective as the emperor's in Tibet, as the Yuan court had begun tending to leave Tibet politically under the supervision of the imperial preceptor. He also advised the Emperor regarding official appointments in Tibet. Moreover, being members of the [[Sakya]] sect, they directed all Buddhist establishments in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan empire]] and were charged with promoting [[Buddhism]] in the empire. They also oversaw routine Buddhist ceremonies and special rituals upon the enthronement and funerals of the emperors. They held rituals and dedicated [[stupa]]s to the protection of the state and its subjects, in general terms or in specific instances, such as to prevent flooding or thunderstorms. Nevertheless, the roles of the dishi focused on religious matters rather than political ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=lamas-and-emperors - Imperial Preceptor |url=https://lamas-and-emperors.wikischolars.columbia.edu/Imperial+Preceptor |website=lamas-and-emperors.wikischolars.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imperial Preceptors in the Yuan Dynasty ==

=== Drogon Chogyal Phagpa (1235 - 1280) ===

[[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa|Drogon Chogyal Phagpa]] was born is 1235 – 15 December 1280 as the son of Sönam Gyeltsen, in Ngari (West Tibet). Phagpa was the first Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty, division of the Mongol Empire, and was simultaneously named the director of the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. He was the fifth leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan ordered Phagpa to create a new writing system, for which he received a title of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) in 1270. To design the script, Chogyal Phagpa made modifications to the Tibetan alphabet and made the Phags-pa script. The scripts was completed in 1268. Although the script was made into the official writing system of the empire there was a lot of opposition by the people and not many texts were written in that script. Although due to his important political role, he was to always stay close to the emperor and had a supreme authority over the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, he apparently did not meet with the emperor that often and mostly lived in Lintao in Gansu. He gave up his position and passed it on to his brother ([[Rinchen Gyaltsen]] - the second perceptor of the Yuan Dynasty) in 1274.

In his last years, Phagpa spent his time  trying to built up the power of the Sakya-Yuan, in Tibet. Later in 1280, he died in Sakya (the Lhakhang palace). There were rumours that his death was a murder by Kunga Zangpo, who was a past ''pönchen'' (whom Phagpa had dismissed for arrogant demeanor). Kunga Zangpo was then executed by the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huntington |first1=John C. |last2=Ohio |first2=Dina Bangdel.

=== Rinchen Gyaltsen (1238 - 1279 or 1282) ===

[[Rinchen Gyaltsen]] was born in 1238 as the son of Zangtsa Sonam Gyaltsen. He was the second preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty. Rinchen Gyaltsen’s family members were very important members in the Mongol government. His older half-brother had the title of the Dishi (Imperial Perceptor) and had a close relation with the emperor. His other brother (Chakna Dorje) was the viceroy of Tibet from the period 1264 to 1267. Also, Rinchen Gyaltsen’s father belonged to the Khon family who were hereditary rulers of the Sakya monastery in Western Tibet.

When Rinchen Gyaltsen’s older half-brother (Phagpa - the first preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty) left Sakya, he became the “somewhat” abbot of the monastery of Sakya. Although his brother Phagpa was given the title of the Imperial Preceptor, he gave up the post in 1274 (to return to Sakya) and it was passed on to Rinchen Gyaltsen.

The year of the death of Rinchen Gyaltsen seems to be uncertain. It is said to be either 1279 or 1282 (most probably 12 March 1279). His death occurred in Shingkun (Lintao) and his post was passed on to his nephew and a son of Chakna Dorje (Dharmapala Raksita - the third preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=Jiunn Yih |title=A Study of the Relationship Between the Mongol Yuan Dynasty and the Tibetan Sa-skya Sect |date=1984 |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/A_Study_of_the_Relationship_Between_the.html?id=uRMRnQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |publisher=Indiana University |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dharmapala Raksita (1269 - 1287) ===

[[Dharmapala Raksita]] was born after the death of his father (Chakna Dojre - brother Phagpa), in 1268. In addition to the title of the Imperial Preceptor, he was also the head of the Sakya School. Since birth, because he was born fatherless, his care was assigned to the lord of Zhalu. At the age of 14 in 1892, he succeeded his uncles title and was appointed as Dishi (imperial preceptor). Although he was given the title, he did not have much experience and knowledge about the position and he never became the abbot. After receiving the title he stayed close to the great Khan. During his period of being Dishi, he mostly participated in building activities. He had a stupa built in the memory of Phagpa (the first imperial preceptor). Also, he built the Metog Raba which then became an official residence for the imperial preceptors till the end of the Yuan Dynasty. Dharmapala married two women, Palden, a granddaughter of Köden, and to Jowo Tagibum, a lady from Zhalu. He had a son with the latter, who died at the age of 5, this is why his part of the Khon family died out and the next Dishi or Sakya abbot were not part of the Khon lineage.

Dharmapala gave up his position as the imperial preceptor in 1286 and left the court to visit Sakya and Tibet. However, he died before getting there on 24 December 1287, at Tre Mandala.&lt;ref&gt;Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa (1967). Tibet: A Political History. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9611474-1-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yeshe Rinchen (1248 - 1294) ===

[[Yeshe Rinchen]] was born in 1248 as the son of Chukpo Jetsun Kya and was from Sakya in Tibet. Unlike the first three imperial preceptors of the Yuan dynasty, Yeshe Rinchen was not from the Khon lineage. Yeshe Rinchen was from the Sharpa lineage. There were three divisions within the disciples of the abbots, Sakya Pandita and Phagpa. The three disciples were; eastern (Shar), western (Nub) and middle (Gun). The Shar (eastern) was headed by a family of Zhangzhung origins, known as Sharpa. When he was younger, Yeshe Rinchen was a follower of Phagpa. The Dishi before Yeshe Rinchen was Dharmapala Raksita and because he had no heirs to succeed his position at the time he vacancied his position as Dishi, the position was handed to the Sharpa family and Yeshe Rinchen was appointed imperial preceptor. At the same time, Yeshe Rinchen’s brother Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen became the ruling abbot of Sakya. There is a possibility that the Sharpa brothers were both guided and supported by an older and more experienced or influential person (imperial minister Sangge). However Sangge fell from power and was executed in 1291, which presumably made Yeshe Rinchen’s position, difficult to protect. After this, Yeshe Rinchen vaccated his position as Dishi in the same year. His position was succeeded by Drakpa Odzer. After stepping down from his position as Dishi, Yeshe Rinchen retired to the sacred Buddhist site Mount Wutai in present-day Shanxi. He died there in 1294.&lt;ref&gt;Coblin, W. South (2007). A Handbook of 'Phags-Pa Chinese. University of Hawaii Press. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drakpa Odzer (1246 - 1303) ===

[[Drakpa Odzer]] was born in 1246 as the son of Sumpa Drakpa Gyaltsen, he was from Sakya in Tibet. Up to 1286 the position of the imperial preceptor was filled by members of the Khon family who were also usually hereditary abbots of Sakya. However, due to the lack of fully ordained members of the lineage after the death of the third preceptor (Dharmapala Raksita), persons from other clerical elite families of Sakya origins were appointed. Drakpa Odzer was from one of those clerical elite families called Khangsarpa. Drakpa Odzer was the general administrator in charge of Phagpa's property. After which he followed Phagpa's nephew Dharmapala Raksita when he moved to Beijing to take up the Dishi dignity in 1282. Drakpa Odzer was appointed as the Dishi after Yeshe Rinchen (the Dishi after Dharmapala Raksita) vaccated his position as Dishi. He held the post from 1291 until he died at the imperial court in 1303. He was succeeded by the ex-abbot Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen. After Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen, his younger brother Sanggye Pal became Dishi, in 1309.&lt;ref name="Shoju Inaba 1963"&gt;Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', ''Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko'' 22 1963, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen (1257 - 1305) ===

[[Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen]] was born as the son of Chukpo Jetsun Kyab in 1257, he was from Sakya in Tibet. Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen was the brother of Yeshe Rinchen, they both had another brother called Kunga Senge.

There were three divisions within the disciples of the abbots, Sakya Pandita and Phagpa. The three disciples were; eastern (Shar), western (Nub) and middle (Gun). The Shar (eastern) was headed by a family of Zhangzhung origins, known as Sharpa. Just as Yeshe Rinchen, Jamyan Rinchen Gyaltsen also belonged to the Sharpa family. After the young Sakya Dishi Dharmapala Raksita vacated his position in 1286 and died in 1287, Khagan Kublai Khan suspended the influence of the Khön family. Instead the Shar or Sharpa family came to the fore. This was possibly due to their good relations with the influential Yuan minister Sangge. Yeshe Rinchen was appointed Dishi by orders of Kublai Khan, while his youngest brother Jamyang Rinchen Gyeltsen became the acting abbot (Wylie: bla chos) of the Sakya school. The appointments gave the Sharpa brothers influence in Tibet.

At the time when Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen was the ruler of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, After the death of Kublai Khan in 1294 the dpon-chen Aglen suggested that a scion of the old Khön family should be allowed to rule Sakya instead of Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen. This would be Zangpo Pal, a nephew of Phagpa, who presently stayed in South China. As a matter of fact the new great khan Temür acknowledged Zangpo Pal as the right heir and let him return to Sakya in 1298. Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen nominally handed over the abbot-ship, but continued to direct Sakya affairs from the official abbot's palace Zhitog. Later in 1303, he was summoned to Beijing by the great khan. Being a loyal and experienced man, he was ordered to take up the position of Dishi after the death of the former title-holder. However, he died in 1305, and the position was succeeded by Drakpa Odzer’s younger brother Sanggye Pal.&lt;ref&gt;Mote, Frederick W. (2003). Imperial China 900-1800. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01212-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanggye Pal (1267 - 1314) ===

[[Sanggye Pal]] was born in 1267 as the son of Sumpa Drakpa Gyaltsen, he was from Sakya in Tibet. He was the younger brother of Drakpa Odzer, who was the fifth Dishi of the Yuan dynasty. Sanggye Pal belonged to the Khangsarpa family (a clerical elite family of Sakya origins). According to the Yuan shi (History of the Yuan Dynasty), the old Dishi Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen (d. 1305) was followed first by a Duoerjibale (Dorje Pal) in 1305-13, and then Sangjiayizhashi (Sanggye Tashi) in 1313-14. However, a document sent to the Tibetan myriarchy Zhalu in 1307 is issued by Sanggye Pal. Therefore, there is a possibility that Sanggye Pal took over the Dishi dignity in 1305 and kept it until 1314, and that he was also known as Dorje Pal.

There is not much documentation on Sanggye Pal and not much is known of his activities. In the period of his position as the Dishi, Tibet was relatively stable under the administration of the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref name="Shoju Inaba 1963"/&gt;

=== Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen (1299 - 1327) ===

[[Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen]], born in 1299 and deceased in 1327, was the eighth [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Imperial Preceptor of the Yuan dynasty. He came from a very prominent aristocratic family called the Khon of [[Sakya]]. His father, Zangpo Pal, is the ruler of a monastery while his mother, Jomo Kunga Bumphulwa, was a widow of a Tibetan administrator. He served under the title of the Imperial Preceptor from 1314 until his death. As the Preceptor Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen has mass influence over the department of Buddhist affairs. For example, he once wrote a letter and started the letter by saying: “By the king's order, the words of Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen Palzangpo, Imperial Preceptor: To the officials of ''Pacification Commissioner'' rank, to generals, soldiers, administrators of the ''nang so'', to judges, holders of golden letters, chiefs of districts, laymen and monks who collect taxes and go and come, to myriarchs, to dignitaries, a command.” This shows how much power and authority he commanded during his year as the Imperial Preceptor. In 1326, Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen decided to return to Tibet from the Imperial Capital due to health declination. However, he never actually went back, because his homeland was unsafe at that time due to a rebellion. Eventually, he stayed in the Yuan capital until his death (March 6, 1327).&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan painted scrolls, Rome 1949, Vol. I, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wangchug Gyeltshen (? - 1323 or 1325) ===

There is neither records of Wangchug Gyeltshen’s year of birth nor that of his family background. Even the year of his death has proven to be very controversial. For example, according to the ''Yuanshi'' (also known as ''The History Of Yuan''), Wangchug Gyeltshen deceased in 1323, while on the other hand, according to another unknown source, he died in 1325. Another controversial debate around Wangchug Gyeltshen is whether he had actually been assigned as the Imperial Preceptor or not. The reason for this controversy is that he actually died earlier than the last Preceptor, Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen, who deceased in 1327. This seemed like a rather odd situation because Preceptors usually continue their role until their death. As a result, some scholars tend to believe that even if Wangchug Gyeltshen had been appointed as the Preceptor, he was merely a temporary substitute for Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen when he was away in Tibet and not around the Yuan capital.&lt;ref name="白壽彝，中國通史（14），上海人民出版社，1989年"&gt;白壽彝，中國通史（14），上海人民出版社，1989年&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen (1308 - 1330) ===

Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen was born in 1308 and died in 1330. He was the younger brother of the eighth Imperial Preceptor, Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen. When Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen was the Imperial Preceptor, he divided up his siblings into four different groups, each of which lived in a different palace (Zhitog, Lhakhang, Rinchengang, and Ducho). And Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen lived in the Lhakhang. About two months after his brother’s death in 1327, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen got appointed by emperor Yesün Temür as the new Imperial Preceptor. However, he only arrived in the Yuan Capital a year after his appointment. Like his brother, he worked as the Imperial Preceptor until he died. Nevertheless, multiple sources show controversies over his year of death. However, according to the most reliable one, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen died in 1330. A common practice among his family was to get married and have kids before fully turning into a monk; Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen showed no difference. He had five children and one of them, Sonam Lotro, eventually became the thirteenth Imperial Preceptor, while another, Drakpa Gyaltsen, also became a very powerful government official in Tibet.&lt;ref name="Shoju Inaba 1963"/&gt;

=== Rinchen Trashi (? - ?) ===

Rinchen Trashi’s family background, year of birth and death are all unknown. Furthermore, this is the last Preceptor that was recorded in the ''Yuanshi'' (also known as ''The History Of Yuan''). On the other hand, no records of him in the Tibetan language can be found. According to a very limited Wikipedia page in the Chinese Language, Rinchen Trashi was appointed by Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür, the 12th Khagan of the Mongol empire, as the Imperial Preceptor in 1329.&lt;ref&gt;張羽新、劉麗楣、王紅，帝師和一大批喇嘛僧為元大都帶來了藏族文化，載 張羽新、劉麗楣、王紅，藏族文化在北京，中國藏學出版社，2008年&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kunga Gyaltsen (1310 - 1358) ===

[[Kunga Gyaltsen (Imperial Preceptor)|Kunga Gyaltsen]] was born in 1310 and died in 1358. He was the twelfth Imperial Preceptor of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. Like many other previous Imperial Preceptors, Kunga Gyaltsen belonged to the Khon family, a group of monastery leaders with fairly high political authority in certain regions of Tibet. Kunga Gyaltsen served under this title from 1331 to his death, making him a raw exception that held the title for a very long period of time. Also, he was the last Imperial Preceptor before the coming of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty in Tibet. During his early career as the Imperial Preceptor, Kunga Gyaltsen’s authority and power were recognized and respected in Tibet. He came up with several new religious rules and people followed them with respect. The appointment of his son, [[Lotro Gyaltsen]], as a monastery leader in the year 1347 further strengthened his place. However, his stay in Dadu during the Tibertan civil war period meant that he could not really do anything significant to help, despite having so much authority as the Imperial Preceptor. Eventually, when the Phagmodrus took over, the leader of this dynasty severely weakened the authorities of the Sakyas (the group which Kunga Gyaltsen and many other previous Imperial Preceptors belonged in). In 1358, the leader of the Phagmodrupas, Changchub Gyaltsen, arranged a meeting in which he officially claimed rule over Central Tibet under the regime of Phagmodrupa. Kunga Gyaltsen died the same year and there were not any appointments of a new successor for 3 years until his nephew, Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen, eventually replaced him in 1361.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Petech]], Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Yüan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen (1332 - 1362) ===

Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen was born in 1332 and deceased in 1362. No information about him can be found in any records in the Chinese language. According to records of Tibetan history published in 2005 by the official Chinese government, this Imperial Preceptor came from one of the six ancient aristocratic families in Tibet. His aristocratic background, in particular, was located in Sa’gya, a county in the city of Shigatse. His father is the 10th Imperial Preceptor of the Yuan Dynasty, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen, while his mother also came from an aristocratic family of the Ü-Tsang region, one of the three traditional provinces of Tibet. Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen replaced his uncle, Kunga Gyaltsen, as the Imperial Preceptor. However, he served under this title for only a year, from 1361 until his eventual death in 1362.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtis Schaeffer et al. (eds), ''Sources of Tibetan tradition''.

== The End of the Imperial Preceptor ==
[[File:Hongwu.jpg|thumb|254x254px|Zhu Yuanzhang (The Hongwu Emperor)]]
The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] ended in 1368, after the armies of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] captured the Capital city, [[Khanbaliq]]. This followed decades of struggle for the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]], including natural disasters, like flooding and droughts, and a rebellion. The [[Red Turban Rebellion]] (1351) was the result of a lack of faith shown in the government.

Due to the weakening of the government and the Yuan Emperor's ([[Toghon Temür|Emperor Huizong]]) reliance on local Warlords' armies, it led to his desire of keeping his seat of power to vanish. Emperor Huizong eventually fled North to the city of [[Shangdu]], leaving the Capital open, to be captured by the armies of the Ming Dynasty.

At their capture of Khanbaliq in 1368, it led to the formation of the Ming Dynasty, led by Zhu Yuanzhang, otherwise called the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. As the Yuan Dynasty were Mongol people, the Hongwu Emperor passed many edicts that were intended to purify China of their influence whilst also forbidding many Mongolian practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ming dynasty|date=2018-06-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ming_dynasty&amp;oldid=844956349|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hongwu Emperor changed the basic structure of the government which was used by the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] after them, lasting up until 1911/12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ming-dynasty-Chinese-history|title=Ming dynasty {{!}} Dates, Achievements, Culture, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the changes that was made was the revoking of the Imperial Preceptor title. When Zhu came to power and the Ming Dynasty was established, the role of the Imperial Preceptor was abolished, and their responsibilities and roles were divided. Titles of lesser importance were created and the people that carried these new titles were given the Imperial Preceptor's previous responsibilities. However, these new titles were granted to very few people, mainly due to political reasons.

During the reign of the second Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, the [[Yongle Emperor]], the ties between China and Tibet were brought closer together, especially through religious teachings. The Yongle Emperor hosted many Tibetan teachers with the most famous and highest regarded being [[Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama|Dezhin Shekpa]]. Shekpa was the only one to be recognised as the Emperor's personal preceptor. Because of this, Shekpa was granted a lengthy title often shortened to ''Rulai dabao fawang'', meaning "Tathagata Great Precious Dharma King". The highest title to be granted to a Tibetan teacher during the Ming period, it was the equivalent of being granted the title of Imperial Preceptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art|last=Huntington|first=John C.|publisher=Serindia Pubns|year=2003|isbn=978-1932476019|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam and other religions}}
The definition and application of [[secularism]], especially the place of religion in society, varies among Muslim countries as it does among western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Asad, Talal. Formation of Secular: Christianity, Islam, Modernity. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Secularism is often used to describe the separation of public life and civil/government matters from religious teachings and commandments, or simply the [[Separation of church and state|separation of religion and politics]]. Secularism in Muslim countries is often contrasted with [[Islamism]], and secularists tend to seek to promote secular political and social values as opposed to Islamic ones. Among western scholars and Muslim intellectuals, there are some debates over secularism which include the understanding of political and religious authorities in the Islamic world and the means and degree of application of ''[[sharia]]'' in legal system of the state.

As the concept of secularism varies among secularists in the Muslim world, reactions of Muslim intellectuals to the pressure of [[secularization]] also varies. On the one hand, secularism is condemned by some Muslim intellectuals who do not feel that religious influence should be removed from the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2130?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1|title=From the article on secularism in Oxford Islamic Studies Online|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, secularism is claimed by others to be compatible with Islam. The quest for secularism has inspired some Muslim scholars to argue that secular government is the best way to observe ''sharia'', as "enforcing [sharia] through coercive power of the state negates its religious nature".&lt;ref&gt;Naʻīm, ʻAbd Allāh Aḥmad. Islam and the secular state : negotiating the future of Shariʻa. Cambridge:Harvard University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|9780674027763}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they did not adhere to the modern concept of a nation with no official religion or religion-based laws, a number of Muslim-majority states in the [[Middle Ages]] demonstrated some level of separation between religious and political authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). "The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363-385&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, some Muslim-majority countries define themselves as or are regarded as secular, and many of them have a dual system in which Muslims can bring familial and financial disputes to ''sharia'' courts. The exact jurisdiction of these courts varies from country to country, but usually includes marriage, divorce, inheritance, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034/ "Islam: Governing Under Sharia"], Author:Tony Johnson, November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
{{Main|Secularism}}

The etymology of the Arabic word for secularism can be controversial in itself. Some scholars pointed out that originally there was no Arabic term to describe the secular and secularism and therefore some neologisms were spawned. Secularism was translated into Arabic either as "‘alamaniyah", which is derived from "‘alam (world or universe)", or as "‘ilmaniyah", which is derived from "‘ilm (science or knowledge)". The term "‘alamaniyah" first appeared at the end of the nineteenth century in the dictionary Muhit al-Muhit&lt;ref&gt;Bustānī, Buṭrus ibn Būlus. Muḥīṭ al-Muḥīṭ:qāmūs muṭawwal al-lughah al-ʻArabīyah/taʼlīf Buṭrus al-Bustānī. Beirut:Maktabat Lubnān, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; written by the Christian Lebanese scholar Butrus al-Bustani. It has been suggested that the use of other translations, such as "la diniyah (non-religious)", that implied the exclusion or marginalisation of religion, would have met with outright rejection by Muslims, for whom (according to the principle al-Islam din wa-dawlah, Islam is religion and state) the division between the temporal and the spiritual is literally unthinkable.&lt;ref name="Tamimi, Azzam 2000"&gt;Tamimi, Azzam. "The Origins of Arab Secularism." In Islam and Secularism in the Middle East, edited by Espasito, Jon L. and Tamimi, Azzam. 13-28. New York: New York University Press, 2000. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keane, John. "The Limits of Secularism." In Islam and Secularism in the Middle East, edited by Espasito, Jon L. and Tamimi, Azzam. 29-37. New York: New York University Press, 2000. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, some refer to "‘almaniyyah" which is derived from the word "‘alam", and others prefer "dunyawiyyah", which is derived from "dunya (temporal)", in contrast to "dini (religious)". {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Overview ==
The concept of secularism was imported along with many of the ideas of post-enlightenment modernity from Europe into the Muslim world, namely Middle East and North Africa. Among Muslim intellectuals, the early debate on secularism centered mainly on the relationship between religion and state, and how this relationship was related to European successes in science, technology and governance.&lt;ref name="Tamimi, Azzam 2000"/&gt; In the debate on the relationship between religion and state, (in)separability of religious and political authorities in the Islamic world, or status of the [[Caliph]], was one of the biggest issues.&lt;ref&gt;Ardic, Nurullah. Islam and the Politics of Secularism: The Caliphate and Middle Eastern modernization in the early 20th century. New York: Routledge, 2012. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Islamism sidebar|Fundamentals}}
[[John Esposito|John L. Esposito]], a professor of international affairs and Islamic studies, points out: "the post-independent period witnessed the emergence of modern Muslim states whose pattern of development was heavily influenced by and indebted to Western secular paradigms or models. Saudi Arabia and Turkey reflected the two polar positions. [...] The majority of Muslim states chose a middle ground in nation building, borrowing heavily from the West and relying on foreign advisers and Western-educated elites.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John L. "Islam and Secularism in the Twenty-First Century." In Islam and Secularism in the Middle East, edited by Esposito, Jon L. and Tamimi, Azzam. 1-12. New York: New York University Press, 2000.2.&lt;/ref&gt;"

Esposito also argues that in many modern Muslim countries the role of Islam in state and society as a source of legitimation for rulers, state, and government institutions was greatly decreased though the separation of religion and politics was not total. However while most Muslim governments replaced Islamic law with legal systems inspired by western secular codes, Muslim family law (marriage, divorce, and inheritance) remained in force.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John L. "Islam and Secularism in the Twenty-First Century." In Islam and Secularism in the Middle East, edited by Esposito, Jon L. and Tamimi, Azzam. 1-12. New York: New York University Press, 2000. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many Muslims argue that, unlike Christianity, Islam does not separate religion from the state and many Muslims around the world welcome a significant role for Islam in their countries' political life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/12/hamas-hezbollah-islam-sharia-public-opinion-muslim-countries.html/ "MUSLIM WORLD: Poll shows majority want Islam in politics; feelings mixed on Hamas, Hezbollah"]" LA Times", December 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is apolitical Islam, not political Islam, that requires explanation and that is an historical fluke of the "shortlived heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970."&lt;ref name="ICGUnderstandingIslam"&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=3301 Understanding Islamism] Middle East/North Africa Report N°37 2 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the resurgence of Islam, beginning with the Iranian revolution of 1978-9, defied the illusions of advocates of secularization theory. The resurgence of Islam in politics in the most modernizing of Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Algeria and Turkey, betrayed expectations of those who believed religion should be at the margins not the center of public life. Furthermore, in most cases, it was not rural but urban phenomena, and its leaders and supporters were educated professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John L. "Islam and Secularism in the Twenty-First Century." In Islam and Secularism in the Middle East, edited by Esposito, Jon L. and Tamimi, Azzam. 1-12. New York: New York University Press, 2000. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a more historical perspective, scholar [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] argues that "a defacto separation between political power" of sultans and emirs and religious power of the caliph was "created and institutionalized ... as early as the end of the first century of [[Islamic calendar|the hegira]]" and what has been lacking in the Muslim world is "political thought regarding the autonomy of this space." No positive law was developed outside of sharia. The sovereign's religious function was to defend the Islamic community against its enemies, institute the [[sharia]], ensure the public good (''maslaha''). The state was an instrument to enable Muslims to live as good Muslims and Muslims were to obey the [[sultan]] if he did so. The legitimacy of the ruler was "symbolized by the right to coin money and to have the Friday prayer (''[[Jumu'ah]] [[khutba]]'') said in his name."&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''The Failure of Political Islam'' by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
{{See also|Constitution of Medina}}
[[Ira M. Lapidus]], an Emeritus Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic History at The University of California at Berkeley, notes that religious and political power was united while the Prophet Muhammad was leading the [[ummah]], resulting in a non-secular state. But Lapidus states that by the 10th century, some governments in the [[Muslim world]] had developed an effective separation of religion and politics, due to political control passing "into the hands of generals, administrators, governors, and local provincial lords; the Caliphs had lost all effective political power". These governments were still officially Islamic and committed to the religion, but religious authorities had developed their own hierarchies and bases of power separate from the political institutions governing them:

{{quote|In the same period, religious communities developed independently of the states or empires that ruled them. The ''ulama'' regulated local communal and religious life by serving as judges, administrators, teachers, and religious advisers to Muslims. The religious elites were organized according to religious affiliation into Sunni schools of law, Shi'ite sects, or Sufi ''tariqas''. [...] In the wide range of matters arising from the Shari'a - the Muslim law - the 'ulama' of the schools formed a local administrative and social elite whose authority was based upon religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). "The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363-385 [364-5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lapidus argues that the religious and political aspects of Muslim communal life came to be separated by Arab rebellions against the Caliphate, the emergence of religious activity independent of the actual authority of the Caliphs, and the emergence of the [[Hanbali]] school of law.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus. "The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society", International Journal of Middle East Studies 6 (4) (October 1975): 363-385. 366-370&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Umayyad caliphate]] was seen as a secular state by many Muslims at the time, some of whom disapproved of the lack of integration of politics and religion. This perception was offset by a steady stream of wars that aimed to expand Muslim rule past the caliphate's borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Umayyad-dynasty-Islamic-history|title=Umayyad dynasty {{!}} Islamic history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Averroes]] presented an argument in ''The Decisive Treatise'' providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official [[Ash'ari]] theology. Because of this, some consider [[Averroism]] a precursor to modern secularism.&lt;ref&gt;Fauzi M. Najjar (Spring, 1996). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_n2_v18/ai_18627295/pg_13 The debate on Islam and secularism in Egypt], ''Arab Studies Quarterly (ASQ)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that this reflects an incorrect view of his philosophy, stripped of its inherent Islamic dimensions by European philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Wahab El Messeri. [http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/tvtk/ch21.htm Episode 21: Ibn Rushd], ''Everything you wanted to know about Islam but was afraid to Ask'', ''Philosophia Islamica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
Many of the early supporters of Secularist principles in [[Middle Eastern]] countries were [[Baath Party|Baathist]] and non-Muslim [[Arabs]], seeking a solution to a multi-confessional population and an ongoing drive to modernism.&lt;ref&gt;such as Faris Nimr and Ya’qub Sarruf, intellectuals and journalists from Lebanon who relocated to Egypt in the 1880s and Salama Musa, who is a Coptic Christian Egyptian and founder of the Egyptian socialist Party in 1920 - Fauzi Najjar: ''the debate on islam and secularism'', Arab Studies Quarterly; 1996, Vol.18 Issue2&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Islam and modernity|Islamic modernist thinkers]] argued against the inseparability of religious and political authorities in the Islamic world, and described the system of separation between religion and state within their ideal Islamic world.

[[Muhammad Abduh|Muhammad ʿAbduh]], a prominent Muslim modernist thinker, claimed in his book "Al-Idtihad fi Al-Nasraniyya wa Al-Islam&lt;ref&gt;ʿAbduh, Muhammad. "al-Idtihad fi al-Nasraniyya wa al-Islam." In al-A'mal al-Kamila li al-Imam Muhammad ʿAbduh. edited by Muhammad ʿAmara. Cairo: Dar al-Shuruk, 1993. 257-368.&lt;/ref&gt;" that no one had exclusive religious authority in the Islamic world. He argued that the Caliph did not represent religious authority, because he was not infallible nor was the Caliph the person whom the revelation was given to; therefore, according to Abduh, the Caliph and other Muslims are equal. ʿAbduh argued that the Caliph should have the respect of the umma but not rule it; the unity of the umma is a moral unity which does not prevent its division into national states.&lt;ref&gt;Hourani, Albert. Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798-1939. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdel Rahman Al-Kawakibi, in his book "Taba'i' Al-Istibdad (The Characteristics of Tyranny)", discussed the relationship between religion and despotism,&lt;ref&gt;Tamimi, Azzam. "The Origins of Arab Secularism." In Islam and Secularism in the Middle East, edited by Espasito, Jon L. and Tamimi, Azzam. 13-28. New York: New York University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that "while most religions tried to enslave the people to the holders of religious office who exploited them, the original Islam was built on foundations of political freedom standing between democracy and aristocracy."&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, Eliezer. "Three Approaches, One Idea: Religion and State in the Thought of 'Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi, Najib 'Azuri and Rashid Rida." In British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Vol.21. 190-198. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Kawakibi suggested that people can achieve a non-religious national unity, saying:"Let us take care of our lives in this world and let the religions rule in the next world."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in his second book "Umm Al-Qura (The Mother of Villages)" his most explicit statement with regard to the question of religion and state appeared in an appendix to the book, where he presented a dialogue between the Muslim scholar from India and an amir. The amir expressed his opinion that "religion is one thing and the government is another ... The administration of religion and the administration of the government were never united in Islam."

[[Rashid Rida]]'s thoughts about the separation of religion and state had some similarities with ʿAbduh and Al-Kawakibi. According to the scholar, Eliezer Tauber:
{{quote|He was of the opinion that according to Islam 'the rule over the nation is in its own hands ... and its government is a sort of a republic. The caliph has no superiority in law over the lowest of the congregation; he only executes the religious law and the will of the nation.' And he added: 'For the Muslims, the caliph is not infallible (ma'sum) and not the source of revelation.' And therefore, 'the nation has the right to depose the imam-caliph, if it finds a reason for doing so'.&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, Eliezer. "Three Approaches, One Idea: Religion and State in the Thought of 'Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi, Najib 'Azuri and Rashid Rida." In British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Vol.21. 190-198. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
What is unique in Rida's thought is that he provided details of his ideas about the future Arab empire in a document, which he called the "General Organic Law of the Arab Empire". Rida argued that the general administrative policy of the future empire would be managed by a president, a council of deputies to be elected from the entire empire, and a council of ministers to be chosen by the president from among the deputies. There, the caliph must recognize the 'General Organic Law' and abide by it. He would manage all the religious matters of the empire. Rida's ideal Islamic empire would be administered in practice by a president, while the caliph would administer only religious affairs and would be obliged to recognize the organic law of the empire and abide by it.&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, Eliezer. "Three Approaches, One Idea: Religion and State in the Thought of 'Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi, Najib 'Azuri and Rashid Rida." In British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Vol.21. 190-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen above, these arguments about separability of religious and political authorities in the Islamic world were greatly connected with the presence of the [[Caliphate]]. Therefore, the abolishment of the Caliphate by Turkish government in 1924 had considerable influence on such arguments among Muslim intellectuals.

The most controversial work is that of [[Ali Abdel Raziq|Ali Abd al-Raziq]], an Islamic Scholar and [[Shari’a]] judge who caused a sensation with his work "Islam and the Foundations of Governance (Al-Islam Wa Usul Al-Hukm&lt;ref&gt;ʻAbd al-Rāziq, ʻAlī. al-Islām wa-uṣūl al-ḥukm : baḥth fī al-khilāfah wa-al-ḥukūmah fī al-Islām. Sūsah:Dār al-Maʻārif lil-Ṭibāʻah wa-al-Nashr,1999?.&lt;/ref&gt;)" in 1925. He argued that there were no clear evidence in the [[Quran]] and the [[hadith]], which justify a common assumption: to accept the authority of the caliph is an obligation. Furthermore, he claimed that it was not even necessary that the [[ummah]] should be politically united and religion has nothing to do with one form of government rather than another. He argued that there is nothing in Islam which forbids Muslims to destroy their old political system and build a new one on the basis or the newest conceptions of the human spirit and the experience of nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hourani, Albert. Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798-1939. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983. 183-188.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication caused a fierce debate especially as he recommended that religion can be separated from government and politics. He was later removed from his position. Rosenthall commented on him saying: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"we meet for the first time a consistent, unequivocal theoretical assertion of the purely and exclusively religious character of Islam".&lt;ref&gt;Black, A, "The history of Islamic Political Thought", Edinburgh University Press, 2001, pp. 316-319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Taha Hussein]], an Egyptian writer, was also an advocate for the separation of religion and politics from a viewpoint of [[Egyptian nationalism]]. Hussein believed that Egypt always had been part of [[Western civilization]] and that Egypt had its renaissance in the nineteenth century and had re-Europeanized itself. For him, the distinguishing mark of the modern world is that it has brought about a virtual separation of religion and civilization, each in its own sphere. It is therefore quite possible to take the bases of civilization from Europe without its religion, Christianity. Moreover, he believed that it is easier for Muslims than for Christian, since Islam has no priesthood, and so there has grown up no vested interest in the control of religion over society.&lt;ref&gt;Hourani, Albert. Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798-1939. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983. 330-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Secular women ====
It was suggested that secular oriented women do not support [[sharia]] as the main source of legislation, rather they refer to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and the resolution of [[human rights]] conventions, as adopted by the [[United Nations]], as frames for reference for their struggle. Azza Karam (1998:13), for example, describes secular feminists as follows: "Secular feminists firmly believe in grounding their discourse outside the realm of any religion, whether Muslim or Christian, and placing it, instead within the international human rights discourse. They do not ‘waste their time’ attempting to harmonize religious discourses with the concept and declarations pertinent to human rights. To them religion is respected as a private matter for each individual, but it is totally rejected as a basis from which to formulate any agenda on women’s emancipation. By so doing, they avoid being caught up in interminable debates on the position of women with religion."&lt;ref&gt;Nadje Al-Ali, ''Secularism Gender and the State'', p140&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, secular feminist activists call for total equality between the sexes, attempt to ground their ideas on women’s rights outside religious frameworks, perceive Islamism as an obstacle to their equality and a linkage to patriarchal values. They argue that secularism was important for protecting civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/jb_religion.htm: March 2, 2006 Conflicting Ideas of Secularism Cloud “Ideal” of Secular Democracy in Middle East&lt;/ref&gt;

{{coatrack|date=June 2017}}

=== Colonial influence ===
In many former colonised Middle East countries, the ''[[Maktab|kuttab]]'' or the ''[[Madrasa|madrassas]]'' (the Quranic schools) were moved to the western format. The French colonial government in the protectorates of the [[Maghreb]] changed the education system into a secular model closely modeled on their own. The colonialists firmly believed that their secular system was more modern, efficient, and progressive than the incumbent practices.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These changes had far-reaching social consequences and laid the foundation {{citation needed|date=May 2017}} of ''Arab Secularism'' by separating the [[Islam]] from government affairs, education, and justice.

In consequence, "perception of the public, political, and social domain through the prism of religion became marginal and was replaced by a new perception, a perception that was modern, temporal, ideological, ethical, evolutionary, and political."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aziz Al-Azmeh]], ''Islams and Modernities'', p48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communist influence ===
In 1918 the Soviet Union opened the [[Commissariat]] for Muslim Affairs, which actively opposed the colonial powers in the Middle East and their system of Mandates.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Pratt, ''Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab World'', p 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s the formation of the first communist parties in the Middle East started playing a key role in the anti-colonial struggle and promoting their ethos regarding workers rights. During the [[Second World War]] they also played a role fighting against [[fascism]] and participating in the international peace movement.

A key element of the Communism movement was the well organized network of parties in different countries that provided support to each other and enabled communist organizations to become an effective outlet against oppression.

Communism went on to become one of the key components of [[Arab Nationalism]] and was particularly prominent during the rule of [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]] in [[Egypt]] in which Egyptian communists stood aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/communism-in-the-middle-east|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; And even though communism was often a prominent supporter of Arab nationalism, the international relationships which allowed it to be such a potent force were also used by opposition regimes, and to some extent third parties during the [[Cold War]].

=== Secularist movements by state===

==== Turkey ====
{{Main|Secularism in Turkey}}

Secularism in [[Turkey]] was both dramatic and far reaching as it filled the vacuum of the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] after [[World War I]]. With the country getting down [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] led a political and cultural revolution. "Official Turkish modernity took shape basically through a negation of the Islamic Ottoman system and the adoption of a west-oriented mode of modernization."&lt;ref&gt;Alev Cinar, ''Modernity, Islam and Secularism in Turkey'', p 14&lt;/ref&gt;

* The temporary abolition of the Caliphate.
* Religious lodges and Sufi orders were banned.
* A secular civil code based on Swiss civil code was adopted to replace the previous codes based on Islamic law (shari’a) outlawing all forms of polygamy, annulled religious marriages, granted equal rights to men and women, in matters of inheritance, marriage and divorce.
* The religious court system and institutions of religious education were abolished.
* The use of religion for political purposes was banned.
*
* A separate institution was created that dealt with the religious matters of the people. 
* The alphabet was changed from Arabic to Latin.
* A portion of religious activity was moved to the Turkish language, including the ''Adhan'' (call to prayer) which lasted until 1950. This was done by the second president of the republic of Turkey.

Throughout the 20th century [[secularism]] was continuously challenged by [[Islamists]]. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, political [[Islamist]]s and [[Islamic democracy|Islamic democrats]] such as the [[Welfare Party]] and [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) gained in influence, with the AKP in the 2002 elections acquiring government and holding on to it ever since with increasingly authoritarian methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2016/11/08/commentary/world-commentary/erdogan-derailing-turkeys-promising-future/|title=Erdogan derailing Turkey’s promising future|date=8 November 2016|publisher=Japan Times|author=Gwynne Dyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/michael-rubin-turkey-headed-bloodbath-515787|title=Turkey is Headed for a Bloodbath|date=3 November 2016|publisher=Newsweek|author=Michael Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lebanon ====
{{Main|Secularism in Lebanon}}

[[Lebanon]] is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within the overall framework of [[Confessionalism (politics)|Confessionalism]], a form of [[consociationalism]] in which the highest offices are proportionately reserved for representatives from certain religious communities.

A growing number of Lebanese, however, have organized against the confessionalist system, advocating for an installation of [[laïcité]] in the national government. The most recent expression of this secularist advocacy was the [[Laïque Pride]] march held in [[Beirut]] on April 26, 2010, as a response to [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]'s growing appeal in Beirut and its call to re-establish the Islamic caliphate.

==== Tunisia ====
{{Main|Secularism in Tunisia}}

Under the leadership of [[Habib Bourguiba]] (1956–1987), Tunisia’s post independence government pursued a program of secularization.&lt;ref&gt;''Secularism and Democracy in the Middle East''; http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-shakman-Hurd_paper.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220053302/http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-Shakman-Hurd_paper.asp |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba modified laws regarding habous (religious endowments), secularized education and unified the legal system so that all Tunisians, regardless of religion, were subject to the state courts. He restricted the influence of the religious [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] and replaced it with a faculty of theology integrated into the University of Tunis, banned the headscarf for women, made members of the religious hierarchy state employees and ordered that the expenses for the upkeep of mosques and the salaries of preachers to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Nazih N. Ayubi, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, his best known legal innovations was the ‘Code du Statut Personel’ (CSP) the laws governs issues related to the family: marriage, guardianship of children, inheritance and most importantly the abolishing of polygamy and making divorce subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie A.Brand, ''Women, the State and Political Liberalization: Middle East and North Africa Experiences'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba clearly{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} wanted to undercut the religious establishment’s ability to prevent his secularization program, and although he was careful to locate these changes within the framework of a modernist reading of Islam and presented them as the product of ''ijtihad'' (independent interpretation) and not a break with Islam, he became well known for his secularism. [[John Esposito]] says that "For Bourguiba, Islam represented the past; the west was Tunisia's only hope for a modern future, but he was mistaken, Islam is modernization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-shakman-Hurd_paper.asp|title=Paper: "Secularism and Democracy in the Middle East" by Elizabeth Shakman Hurd - May 16, 2003 - Center for the Study of Islam &amp; Democracy (CSID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220053302/http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-Shakman-Hurd_paper.asp|archive-date=2008-02-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following increasing economic problems, Islamist movements came about in 1970 with the revival of religious teaching in Ez-Zitouna University and the influence which came from Arab religious leaders like Syrian and Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nazih N.Ayubi, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; There is also influence by [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], whose members issue a magazine in Tunis named ''Azeytouna''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azeytouna.net Azeytouna Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, the struggle between Bourguiba and Islamists became uncontrolled and in order to repress the opposition the Islamist leaderships were exiled, arrested and interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;John L.Esposito, ''The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?,'' p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ennahda Movement]], also known as Renaissance Party or simply Ennahda, is a moderate Islamist political party in [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12611609 |title=Tunisia legalises Islamist group Ennahda |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Since then it has become the biggest and most well-organized party in Tunisia, so far outdistancing its more secular competitors. In the [[Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011]], the first honest election in the country's history with a turn out of 51.1% of all eligible voters, the party won 37.04% of the popular vote and 89 (41%) of the 217 assembly seats, far more than any other party.&lt;ref name=isie-report&gt;{{Citation

==== Egypt ====
{{Main|Secularism in Egypt}}

Secularism in [[Egypt]] has had a very important role to play in both the history of Egypt and that of the Middle East. Egypt’s first experience of secularism started with the British Occupation (1882–1952), the atmosphere which allowed propagation of western ideas. In this environment, pro-secularist intellectuals like Ya'qub Sarruf, Faris Nimr, Nicola Haddad who sought political asylum from Ottoman Rule were able to publish their work. This debate had then become a burning issue with the work of Egyptian Shaykh [[Ali abd al-Raziq]] (1888–1966), "The most momentous document in the crucial intellectual and religious debate of modern Islamic history"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Fauzi Najjar, ''The debate on Islam and Secularism'', Arab Studies Quarterly; 1996, Vol. 18 Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1919 Egypt had its first political secular entity called the ''Hizb 'Almani'' (Secular Party) this name was later changed to the [[Wafd party]]. It combined secular policies with a nationalist agenda and had the majority support in the following years against both the rule of the king and the British influence. The Wafd party supported the allies during [[World War II]] and then proceeded to win the 1952 parliamentary elections, following these elections the prime minister was overthrown by the King leading to riots. These riots precipitated a military coup after which all political parties were banned including the [[Wafd]] and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The government of [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]] was secularist-nationalist in nature which at the time gathers a great deal of support both in Egypt and other Arab states. Key elements of [[Nasserism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict-middle_east_politics/egypt_mahfouz_4025.jsp|title=Mahfouz's grave, Arab liberalism's deathbed|website=openDemocracy|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Secularist-Nationalist dictatorship: No religious or other political movements allowed to impact government.
*Modernization, Industrialization and Nationalization; [[Socialist economy]]
*Concentration on [[Arab Nationalism|Arab values, identity and nationalism]] rather than [[Pan-Islamism|Muslim values, identity and nationalism]] .

Secular legacy of Nasser's dictatorship influenced dictatorial periods of [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] and secularists ruled [[Egypt]] until [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]. Nevertheless, the Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] has become one of the most influential movements in the [[Islamic world]], particularly in the [[Arab world]]. For many years it was 
described as "semi-legal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193396891&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Free Republic.

Translated from the German by Phyllis Anderson&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012]], the political parties identified as "Islamist" (the Brotherhood's [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]], Salafi [[Al-Nour Party]] and liberal Islamist [[Al-Wasat Party]]) won 75% of the total seats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/world/middleeast/muslim-brotherhood-wins-47-of-egypt-assembly-seats.html Islamists Win 70% of Seats in the Egyptian Parliament] The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohamed Morsi]], an Islamist democrat of [[Muslim Brotherhood]] was the first democratically elected president of [[Egypt]]. Nowadays, most Egyptian proponents of secularism emphasize the link between secularism and ‘national unity’ between [[Coptic Christians]] and [[Muslims]].

==== Syria ====
{{Main|Secularism in Syria}}

The process of secularization in [[Syria]] began under the [[French Mandate of Syria|French mandate]] in the 1920s and went on continuously under different governments since the independence. Syria has been governed by the Arab nationalist [[Ba'ath Party]] since 1963. The Ba'ath government combined [[Arab socialism]] with secular ideology and an authoritarian political system. The constitution guarantees religious freedom for every recognized religious communities, including many Christian denominations. All schools are government-run and non-sectarian, although there is mandatory religious instruction, provided in Islam and/or Christianity. [[Political aspects of Islam|Political forms of Islam]] are not tolerated by the government. The Syrian legal system is primarily based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and was heavily influenced by the period of French rule. It is also drawn in part from Egyptian law of Abdel Nasser, quite from the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system and very little from [[Sharia]]. Syria has separate secular and religious courts. Civil and criminal cases are heard in secular courts, while the Sharia courts handle personal, family, and religious matters in cases between Muslims or between Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2007/syria|title=Syria|date=11 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslim communities have their own religious courts using their own religious law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/31.htm|title=Syria - Islam|website=countrystudies.us|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iran ====
{{Main|Secularism in Iran}}

Following the military coup of 21 February 1921, Reza Khan had established himself as the dominant political personality in the country. Fearing that their influence might be diminished, the clergy of Iran proposed their support and persuaded him to assume the role of the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;Homa Omid, ''Theocracy of democracy? The critics of `westoxification' and the politics of fundamentalism in Iran'': Third World Quarterly; Dec92, Vol. 13 Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1925–1941''': [[Reza Shah]] began to make some dramatic changes to Iranian society with the specific intention of westernization and removing religion from public sphere. He changed religious schools to secular schools, built Iran’s first secular university and banned the hijab in public. Nevertheless, the regime became totally undemocratic and authoritarian with the removal of Majles power (the first parliament in 1906) and the clampdown on free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Halliday, ''Iran: Dictatorship and Development'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1951–1953''': During the early 1950s the Prime Minister Dr [[Mossadeq]] was again forming a secular government with a socialist agenda with the specific aim of reducing the power held by the clergy. However his plans for nationalization the oil industry were a step too far for Britain, and the legislature became increasingly wary of his concentration of power. So with the help of the CIA, the [[United Kingdom]] supported a coup which replaced the government of Mossadeq with [[Mohammad Reza Shah]].

'''1962–1963''': Using the mandate of westernization, Mohammad Reza Shah introduced [[White Revolution]], aiming to transform Iran into a [[Westernization|Westernized]] secular [[Capitalism|capitalist]] country.

'''1963–1973''': Opposition rallied united behind [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] and by the end of the 1970s the Shah was overthrown in an [[Islamic Revolution]] (1979).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
{{Main|Secularism in Pakistan}}

Early in the history of the state of Pakistan (12 March 1949), a parliamentary resolution (the [[Objectives Resolution]]) was adopted, just a year after the death of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of Pakistan, in accordance with the [[Two nation theory|vision]] of other founding fathers of [[Pakistan Movement|Pakistan]] ([[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]).&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|url=http://therepublicofrumi.com/archives/liaquat19490309.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107131744/http://therepublicofrumi.com/archives/liaquat19490309.html |archivedate=2014-11-07 |df= }}"Objectives Resolution, Republic of Rumi&lt;/ref&gt; proclaiming:

{{Quote|[[Sovereignty]] belongs to [[Allah]] alone but He has delegated it to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him as a sacred trust.
*The State shall exercise its powers and authority through the elected representatives of the people.
*The principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed.
*Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings of Islam as set out in the Quran and Sunnah.
*Provision shall be made for the religious minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures.}}

According to Pakistani secularists, this resolution differed from the [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah's 11th August Speech]] that he made in the Constitutive Assembly, but however, this resolution was passed by the rest of members in the assembly after [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s death in 1948. This resolution later became key source of inspiration for writers of [[Constitution of Pakistan]] and is included in constitution as preamble. However, [[Pakistan]] is an Islamic republic, with Islam as the state religion; it has aspects of [[secular]]ism inherited from its colonial past. [[Islamist]]s and Islamic democratic parties in [[Pakistan]] are relatively less influential than democratic Islamists of other Muslim democracies however they do enjoy considerable street power.

The [[Council of Islamic Ideology]] is a body that is supposed to advise the [[Parliament of Pakistan]] on bringing laws and legislation in alignment with the principles of the [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]], though it has no enforcement powers. The [[Federal Shariat Court]] can strike down any law deemed un-Islamic, though its decisions can be overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Constitution of Pakistan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan|date=1973|publisher=Parliament of Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition and critique==

=== Secularism and religion ===
[[Islamists]] believe that Islam fuses religion and politics, with normative political values determined by the divine texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, R, “Jihad: From Qur’an to Bin Laden”, Palgrave Macmillan, Hampshire, 2004, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that this has historically been the case and the secularist/modernist efforts at secularizing politics are little more than ''[[jahiliyyah]]'' (ignorance), ''[[kafir]]'' (unbelief/infidelity), ''[[irtidad]]'' (apostasy) and [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nabhani, T, "The Islamic State", al-Khilafah Publications&lt;/ref&gt; "Those who participated in secular politics were raising the flag of revolt against Allah and his messenger."&lt;ref&gt;1948, Mawlana Mawdudi founder of Jamaat e-Islami&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi scholars denounce secularism as strictly prohibited in Islamic tradition. The Saudi Arabian Directorate of Ifta', Preaching and Guidance, has issued a directive decreeing that whoever believes that there is a guidance (''huda'') more perfect than that of the Prophet, or that someone else's rule is better than his is a ''kafir''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim M. Abu-Rabi, ''Contemporary Islamic Thought'', p 338&lt;/ref&gt;

It lists a number of specific tenets which would be regarded as a serious departure from the precepts of Islam, punishable according to Islamic law. For example:

* The belief that human made laws and constitutions are superior to the Shari'a.
* The opinion that Islam is limited to one's relation with God, and has nothing to do with the daily affairs of life.
* To disapprove of the application of the ''[[hudud]]'' (legal punishments decreed by God) that they are incompatible in the modern age.
* And whoever allows what God has prohibited is a ''kafir''.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Ibrahim Mabruk, al-‘almaniyyun (Cairo, 1990), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of [[Tariq al-Bishri]], "secularism and Islam cannot agree except by means of talfiq [combining the doctrines of more than one school, i.e., falsification], or by each turning away from its true meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ahram, 12 December 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secularism and authoritarianism ===
{{POV|date=May 2017}}
A number of scholars believe that secular governments in Muslim countries have become more repressive and authoritarian to combat the spread of [[Islamism]], but this increased repression may have made many Muslim societies more opposed to secularism and increased the popularity of Islamism the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Zakaria, F 2007"&gt;Zakaria, F.	2007, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad. W Norton &amp; Co Inc, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Authoritarianism]] has left in many countries the mosque as the only place to voice political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Halliday, ''Two Hours That Shook the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Vali Nasr]] argue that the secular elites in the Muslim world were imposed by colonial powers to maintain hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, J, "The Oxford History of Islam", Oxford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism is also associated with military regimes, such as those in [[Turkey]] and [[Algeria]]. The [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) succeeded in December 1991 elections in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binghamton.edu/cdp/era/elections/alg91par.html|title=Algeria 1991 Legislative Election|website=www.binghamton.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Welfare Party]] succeeded in the Turkish 1995 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konrad.org.tr/secim/ayrinti.php?yil_id=12|title=Türkiye Seçimleri|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these parties were eliminated through military coups in order to protect secularism.&lt;ref name="Norton, A. R. 1996"&gt;Norton, A. R. (ed), 1996. Civil Society in the Middle East, 2nd volume. Brill, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; While Welfare Party government in Turkey was forced to resign from the office by Turkish military in February 1997 with a military intervention which is called as "post modern coup",&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz, M. H. (2006) The Emergence of a New Turkey: Democracy and the Ak Parti. Utah: Utah University Press&lt;/ref&gt; FIS in Algeria lived an austere military coup which carried the country in to a civil war in 1992.&lt;ref name="Norton, A. R. 1996"/&gt; Military forces in those countries could use their power in undemocratic ways in order to ‘protect secularism’.

In some countries, the fear of [[Islamism|Islamist]] takeover via democratic processes has led to [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] measures against Islamist political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Garon2003&lt;/ref&gt; 
"The Syrian regime was able to capitalize on the fear of Islamist coming to power to justify the massive clampdown on the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood."&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Pratt, ''Democracy and Authoritarianism in the Arab World'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; When American diplomats asked [[Hosni Mubarak]] to give more rights to the press and stop arresting the intellectuals, Mubarak rejected it and said, "If I do what you ask, the fundamentalists will take over the government in Egypt. Do you want that?" Or when President Bill Clinton asked [[Yasser Arafat]] to establish [[democracy]] in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] in 2001, Yasser Arafat also replied similarly. "He said that in a democratic system Islamist [[Hamas]] will surely take control of the government in Palestine".&lt;ref name="Zakaria, F 2007"/&gt; Most secularist autocrats in the Middle East drew upon the risk of [[Islamism]] in order to justify their autocratic rule of government in the international arena.

'''Islamic extremism''' has been defined by the British government as any form of [[Islam]] that opposes "democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs."&lt;ref name=Casciani-10-6-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Casciani|first1=Dominic|title=How do you define Islamist extremism?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27777892|accessdate=27 January 2016|agency=BBC News|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related terms include "'''Islamist extremism'''" and [[Islamism]].&lt;ref name=Pankhurst-30-5-13&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pankhurst|first1=Reza|title=Woolwich, "Islamism" and the "Conveyor Belt to Terrorism" Theory|url=http://www.hurstpublishers.com/woolwich-islamism-and-the-conveyor-belt-to-terrorism-theory/|website=Hurst Publishers|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many oppose the use of the term, fearing it could "de-legitimize" the Islamic faith in general.&lt;ref name=npr-25-11-15&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jessica|title=Should The Phrase 'Islamic Extremism' Be Used?

== Definition ==
The UK High Courts have ruled in two cases on Islamic extremism, and provided definition.

Aside from those, two major definitions have been offered for Islamic extremism, sometimes using overlapping but also distinct aspects of extreme interpretations and pursuits of [[Islam]]ic ideology:

* The use of violent tactics such as bombing and assassinations for achieving perceived Islamic goals (see [[Jihadism]] [ [[Zeyno Baran]], Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Eurasian Policy at the [[Hudson Institute]], prefers the term ''[[Islamism|Islamist]] extremism''])&lt;ref name='Baran' /&gt;
* An extremely conservative view of Islam,&lt;ref name="Farmer2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian R. Farmer|title=Understanding radical Islam: medieval ideology in the twenty-first century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIQ0hhu8l7IC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-8843-1|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not necessarily entail violence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason F.

== UK High Court rulings==
There are two UK High Court cases that explicitly address the issue of Islamic extremism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judiciary.gov.uk website repository of UK High Court rulings&lt;/ref&gt;

* May 2016: An Appeal from the Crown Court and Central Criminal Court: several individuals' cases considered together.&lt;ref name="judiciary.gov.uk"&gt;https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/r-v-kahar-and-others.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* October 2016:  In which the Judge concluded that Imam [[Shakeel Begg]] is an Islamic Extremist, and does not uphold Begg's claim that the BBC had libelled him by saying so.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shakeel-begg-v-bbc-judgment-final-20161028.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== May 2016 appeal case ===
The judge refers to several grounds: section 20 of the 2006 Act; the definition of "terrorism" in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and the decision of the Supreme Court in ''R v Gul''.&lt;ref name="judiciary.gov.uk"/&gt;

=== October 2016 Shakeel Begg case ===
Begg, a prominent Muslim public figure and Imam at Lewisham Islamic Centre since 1998 lost his 2016 court case of [[Libel]] against the [[BBC]]. This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:

In [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Extremist Islamic positions 
118. In my view, the following constitute "extremist" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). 
* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the "right kind" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the "wrong kind" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the "wrong kind" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are "mete for the sword" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates" with them...
* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...
* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...
* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...
* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...
* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...
* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...
* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...
* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...
* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Connection to Kharijites ==
{{Main|Khawarij}}
According to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{visible anchor|Active Islamic extremist groups|Active_Islamic_Extremist_Groups}} ==
Some of the proponents of [[Islam]] emphasise peaceful political processes, whereas [[Sayyid Qutb]] in particular called for violence, and those followers are generally considered '''Islamic extremists''' and their stated goal is [[Islamic revolution]] with the intent to force implementation of [[Sharia law]] and/or an [[Islamic state|Islamic State Caliphate]].

There are over 120 such groups active today.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Below is a list of major groups active.

The '''Jewish Northern Cemetery''' in [[Nørrebro]] was formerly the principal [[Jewish cemetery]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It has an area of 13,500 square metres and contains some 5,500 burials.

==History==
The Jewish congregation in Copenhagen purchased a 900 square metre site outside the city for use as a burial site in the early 1690s. The oldest burial in the cemetery is from 1694. Further acquisitions of land had brought the cemetery up to its current size by 1854 but it was still passed out of use when a new Jewish cemetery opened in connection with the new [[Vestre Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/noerrebros-joediske-kirkegaard-aabnes-for-offentligheden|title=Nørrebros jødiske kirkegård åbnes for offentligheden|language=Danish|publisher=AOK|accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The brick wall which today surrounds the cemetery on three sides, along Møllegade, Guldbergsgade and Birkegade, was built in 1873 to a design by   Vilhelm Tvede. The entrance is on Møllegade. The cemetery was listed in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=3100085|title=Mosarisk Begravelsesplads|language=Danish|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3526">'''Jewish geography''' is a popular "[[game]]" sometimes played when [[Jews]] meet each other for the first time and try to identify people they know in common. The game has become something of an informal social [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] in the Jewish community, and it is often surprisingly easy for strangers who play it to discover mutual acquaintances and establish instant context and connection.

As Etan Diamond observes in his [[book]] ''And I Will Dwell in Their Midst: Orthodox Jews in Suburbia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This "game" of "Jewish geography" follows a simple pattern. One person asks, "You're from [insert name of city here]? Do you know  [insert person's name here]?" The other one usually responds something like, "Sure, he sits behind my uncle in synagogue," or "I met her once at a youth group convention," or "She is really good friends with my sister's college roommate." Non-Jews often find it astonishing that such links are made so easily, but given both the relative smallness of the Jewish community—and the even smaller size of the Orthodox Jewish community—and the extensive overlapping social circles within these communities, it should not surprise too much. [p. xv].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://uncpress.unc.edu/chapters/diamond_and.html|title=And I Will Dwell in Their Midst: Orthodox Jews in Suburbia|author=Etan Diamond|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Similar versions==
An Israeli version of the game, ''pitsuchim'', has been a common pastime among young Israeli backpackers traveling the world, taking its name from a 1980s television quiz show.&lt;ref name="Caitlin Yoshiko Kandil and Niv Elis"&gt;{{cite news|author=Caitlin Yoshiko Kandil and Niv Elis|title=The New (Old) Game of Jewish Geography|work=Moment Magazine|date=November–December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar social game called "The rule of communicated Datis" (Hebrew for religious orthodox Jews) is used by Zionist religious orthodox Jews, and a movie mocking the game called by that name has been produced by students of the Ma'ale school for video and media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6YRPvqm5rc Hok Hadatiyim Hasheluvim] The rule of communicating Datis (YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is a form of testing the [[Small-world experiment]].

==Origins==
The origins of "Jewish geography" are unclear. Sarah Benor, a linguist and professor of Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College has noted "Sometimes that kind of thing is really impossible to find."&lt;ref name="Caitlin Yoshiko Kandil and Niv Elis"/&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Synthesis|date=October 2007}}
The term "Jewish geography" not only functions as the name of the game, but also describes the unique smallness and closeness of the worldwide Jewish [[population]]. The Jewish population's "Jewish geography," therefore, is what makes the game possible and lets Jews from different cities, regions, and countries easily discover people they know in common.

Both the game and the concept are Jewish-specific examples of the [[six degrees of separation]] [[theory]] proposed by Hungarian writer [[Frigyes Karinthy]] in 1929 and the [[small world phenomenon]] hypothesized by social scientist [[Stanley Milgram]] in 1967.

While the accuracy of these theories have been questioned by some, few Jews doubt the validity of "Jewish geography," having observed its connective power firsthand.

{{About||the name '''Kazimierz'''|Casimir|other uses}}

'''Kazimierz''' ({{IPA-pl|kaˈʑimʲɛʂ}}; {{lang-la|Casimiria}}; {{lang-yi|קוזמיר}} ''Kuzimyr'') is a historical district of [[Kraków]] and [[Kraków Old Town]], [[Poland]]. Since its inception in the fourteenth century to the early nineteenth century, Kazimierz has been an independent city, a [[royal city]] of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, a location south of the Old Town of Kraków Old Town, separated from it by a branch of the [[Vistula]] river. For many centuries, Kazimierz was a place of coexistence and interpenetration of ethnic Polish and Jewish cultures. Its northeastern part of the district was historic Jewish, whose Jewish inhabitants were forcibly relocated in 1941 by the German occupying forces into the [[Krakow ghetto]] just across the river in [[Podgórze]]. Today Kazimierz is one of the major tourist attractions of Krakow and an important center of cultural life of the city.

The boundaries of Kazimierz are defined by an old island in the [[Vistula]] river. The northern branch of the river (''Stara Wisła'' – Old Vistula) was filled-in at the end of the 19th century during the [[partitions of Poland]] and made into an extension of ul. Stradomska Street connecting Kazimierz district with Kraków Old Town.&lt;ref name="Stradomska PWN"&gt;{{cite book | title=Stradomska, ulica (in) Encyklopedia Krakowa | publisher=Wydawnictwo Naukowe [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]] | year=2000 | location=Warszawa – Kraków | pages=929 | isbn=83-01-13325-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|thumb|right|250px|''Casmirvs'' (left) in a 1493 woodcut from [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (view facing west).]]

Three [[History of Poland in the Middle Ages|early medieval]] settlements are known to have existed on the island defining Kazimierz.  The most important of these was the [[Slavic mythology|pre-Christian Slavic]] shrine at [[Skałka]] (“the little rock”) at the western, upstream tip of the island.  This site, with its sacred pool, was later Christianised as the Church of St. [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] in the 11th century and was the legendary site of the martyrdom of [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|St. Stanisław]]. There was a nearby noble manor complex to the southeast and an important cattle-market town of Bawół, possibly based on an old tribal Slavic [[gord (Slavic settlement)|gród]], at the edges of the habitable land near the swamps that composed the eastern, downstream end of the island.  There was also a much smaller island upstream of Kazimierz known as the “Tatar Island” after the [[Tatars|Tatar]] cemetery there. This smaller island has since washed away.

On 27 March 1335, King [[Casimir III of Poland]] (''Kazimierz Wielki'') declared the two western suburbs of Kraków to be a new town named after him, Kazimierz (''Casimiria'' in Latin). Shortly thereafter, in 1340, Bawół was also added to it, making the boundaries of new city the same as the whole island. King Casimir granted his ''Casimiria'' location privilege in accordance with [[Magdeburg Law]] and, in 1362, ordered defensive walls to be built. He settled the newly built central section primarily with burghers, with a plot set aside for the [[Augustinian]] order next to Skałka. He also began work on a campus for the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]] which he founded in 1364, but Casimir died in 1370 and the campus was never completed.

Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the ''Pons Regalis'', the only major, permanent bridge across the [[Vistula]] ({{lang-pl|Wisła}}) for several centuries. This bridge connected Kraków via Kazimierz to the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last bridge at this location (at the end of modern Stradomska Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the filling-in of the ''Old Vistula'' river bed under Mayor [[Mikołaj Zyblikiewicz]] made it obsolete.

Jews had played an important role in the Kraków regional economy since the end of the 13th century, granted the freedom of worship, trade and travel by [[Bolesław the Pious]] in his [[Statute of Kalisz|General Charter of Jewish Liberties]] issued already in 1264. The Jewish community in Kraków had lived undisturbed alongside their ethnic Polish neighbours under the protective King [[Casimir III the Great]], the last king of the [[Piast dynasty]]. Nevertheless, in early 15th century pressured by the [[Jan Hus#Council of Constance|Synod of Constance]] some dogmatic clergy began to push for less official tolerance. Accusations of [[blood libel]] by a fanatic priest in Kraków led to riots against the Jews in 1407 even though the royal guard hastened to the rescue.&lt;ref name="Dubnow-3"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vL60sEf7OPoC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22in+the+name+of+his+cousin,+the+Polish+King+Yaghello.+In+1388%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XZTzTaWaAomztweFmfCUBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20the%20name%20of%20his%20cousin%2C%20the%20Polish%20King%20Yaghello.%20In%201388%22&amp;f=false | title=''History of the Jews in Russia and Poland,'' Volume 1| publisher=Avotaynu Inc | date=2000|others=translated by Israel Friedlaender | accessdate=June 11, 2011 | author=S.

As part of the re-founding of the Kraków university, starting in 1400, the Academy began to buy out buildings in the Old Town. Some Jews moved to the area around modern Plac Szczepański.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Francis William Carter, ''Trade and Urban Development in Poland: An Economic Geography of Cracow, from Its Origins to 1795,'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1994, p.71. {{vs|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest synagogue building standing in Poland was built in Kazimierz at around that time, either in 1407 or 1492 (the date varies with several sources). It is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[fortress synagogue]] called the [[Old Synagogue, Kraków|Old Synagogue]].&lt;ref name="SD"&gt;Sacred Destinations , [http://www.sacred-destinations.com/poland/krakow-old-synagogue.htm  Old Synagogue, Krakow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JK"&gt;The Jewish Krakow, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080214052721/http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/synagogues/old The Old Synagogue: ul.

In 1495 the Polish king [[Jan I Olbracht]] transferred the Jews from the ravaged [[Old Town, Kraków|Old Town]] to the Bawół district of Kazimierz.&lt;ref name="J-K"&gt;Jewish Krakow, A Visual and Virtual Tour, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080214052711/http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/synagogues/kupa The Kupa Synagogue: ul. Miodowa 27] from the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Kehilla (modern)|Qahal]] petitioned the Kazimierz town council for the right to build its own interior walls, cutting across the western end of the older defensive walls in 1553. Due to the growth of the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia, the walls were expanded again in 1608. Later requests to expand the walls were turned down as redundant.&lt;ref name="Kazimierz.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kazimierz.com |url=http://www.kazimierz.com/index.php?t=historia |title=Kazimierz wczoraj. Introduction |publisher=Stowarzyszenie Twórców ''Kazimierz.com'' |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between the walls was known as the ''Oppidum Judaeorum'', the Jewish City, which represented only about one fifth of the geographical area of Kazimierz, but nearly half of its inhabitants. The Oppidum became the main spiritual and cultural centre of Polish Jewry, hosting many of Poland’s finest Jewish scholars, artists and craftsmen. Among its famous inhabitants were the [[Talmudist]] [[Moses Isserles]], the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] Natan Szpiro, and the royal physician Shmuel bar Meshulam.

[[File:Kazimierz Alte Schul 07799.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Old Synagogue of Kazimierz before 1939.]]

The golden age of the Oppidum came to an end in 1782, when the Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] disbanded the kahal. In 1822, the walls were torn down, removing any physical reminder of the old borders between Jewish and ethnic Polish Kazimierz.

When after 1795 (in the Third Partition of Poland) Austria acquired the city of Kraków, Kazimierz lost its status as a separate city and became a district of Kraków. The richer Jewish families quickly moved out of the overcrowded streets of eastern Kazimierz. Because of the injunction against travel on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], however, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues in the old Oppidum, maintaining Kazimierz’s reputation as a “Jewish district” long after the concept ceased to have any administrative meaning.  By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses scattered across the city and much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like [[Podgórze]].

[[File:Kazimierz 07797.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish children in front of Corpus Christi church sometime before 1939.]]

In a tourist guide that was published in 1935, [[Meir Balaban]], a [[Reform Judaism|Reform rabbi]] and professor of History at the University of Warsaw, lamented that the Jews who remained in the once vibrant Oppidum were “only the poor and the ultraconservative.” However, this same exodus was the reason why most of the buildings in the Oppidum are preserved today in something close to their 18th century shape.

During the Second World War, the Jews of Krakow, including those in Kazimierz, were forced by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] into a crowded [[ghetto]] in Podgórze, across the river. Most of them were later killed during the liquidation of the ghetto or in [[death camp]]s.

After the Second World War, devoid of Jews, Kazimierz was neglected by the communist authorities.&lt;ref name="jewishkrakow" /&gt; However, since 1988, now a popular annual [[Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków|Jewish Cultural Festival]] has drawn Cracovians back to the heart of the Oppidum and re-introduced Jewish culture to a generation of Poles who have grown up without Poland’s historic Jewish community. In 1993, [[Steven Spielberg]] shot his film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' largely in Kazimierz (in spite of the fact that very little of the action historically took place there) and this drew international attention to Kazimierz. Since 1993, there have been parallel developments in the restoration of important historic sites in Kazimierz and a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops. Not only that, there are also some Jews moving to Kazimierz from Israel and America. Kazimierz with Krakow, is having a small growth in Jewish population recently.&lt;ref name="jewishkrakow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/ | title=Welcome to Kazimierz! | publisher=''Jewish Krakow.net'' | work=A visual and virtual tour | year=2011 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220125823/http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/ | archivedate=December 20, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jewish youth group now meets weekly in Kazimierz and the [[Remuh Synagogue]], which actively serves a small congregation of mostly elderly Cracovian Jews.

Each year at the end of June, the [[Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków|Jewish Culture Festival]] takes place in Kazimierz. It is Europe's largest Jewish festival of culture and music and attracts visitors from around the world. Music at the festival is very diverse and played by bands from the Middle East, USA and Africa, amongst others.

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''King Noah''' was a wicked monarch best known for burning the prophet [[Abinadi]] at the stake. King Noah, described in the [[Book of Mosiah]], is said to have presided over a wicked kingdom guided by false [[priest]]s.  Noah succeeds his father [[Zeniff]], and is succeeded by his son [[Limhi]].

{{familytree/end}}

==Noah's father Zeniff==
Noah's father, [[Zeniff]], led a group of Nephites into the land of their 'first inheritance' (the land originally settled by [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]] and his descendants upon their arrival in the Americas).  Zeniff had made an agreement with the Lamanites in the area, but wars between the two peoples inevitably ensued.  Upon his death Zeniff conferred the kingdom on Noah, who seems to have been far less diligent in preparing and protecting his people against their enemies than his father.  Noah was an extremely wicked man and he taxed his people heavily, spending the money on extravagances and wickedness.  Possibly the greatest wrong he did his subjects, however, was to teach them to follow his own wicked ways.  He deposed the righteous priests who had been appointed by his father and replaced them with prideful ones.  Through vanity and flattery they led the people to commit the same sins that they themselves did.  Some of the sins that are listed are pride, laziness, idolatry, whoredoms, adultery, drunkenness, and riotous living.

==The prophet Abinadi==
The prophet Abinadi was sent to preach repentance to Noah's people, but was not immediately successful.  He was imprisoned and taken before King Noah and his priests.  They attempted to "cross him" (or prove him a liar) by asking difficult questions concerning the interpretation of scriptures, including an excerpt from [[Isaiah]], but were unable to do so.  Abinadi began to teach them the [[Ten Commandments]] and they attempted to "do away with him" but were unable to touch him because he was protected by the power of God.  He continued to teach them the rest of the Ten Commandments, as well as to interpret further writings of Isaiah and teach them about Jesus Christ.  He finished by testifying that redemption comes through Christ.
Abinadi, having delivered his message, was executed by fire.  As he was dying he prophesied that Noah and his priests would suffer death in a similar manner.

==The priest Alma==
One of the priests of Noah, a young man named [[Alma the Elder|Alma]], believed Abinadi's words and pleaded with the king to spare the prophet's life.  Alma was cast out, and was forced to hide so that the servants of the king would not kill him.  He taught the words of Abinadi to more of the people, and many believed him.  He also became a great prophet and religious leader among the rest of the Nephites later in his life.  Hence, Abinadi was successful in his mission although he died a martyr and only one man believed his teachings.
King Noah's wickedness and oppression of his people continued.  Alma and his followers left Noah's people and the king's army were unable to follow them.  A minority of Noah's people became angry with him, including a man named Gideon who swore to kill the king.  They fought, and Noah saw that he was about to lose so he fled to a tower.  From the top of the tower he saw an army of Lamanites about to attack and convinced Gideon to spare him so that he could lead the people to safety.

==Limhi becomes king==
Noah and his people fled, but were unable to escape the Lamanites.  He ordered them to leave their wives and children behind.  Some did, while others did not.  They were captured by the Lamanites and returned to their lands, where they were taxed one half of all they owned and produced.  They made Noah's son, [[Limhi]], their king.  Those who abandoned their families and stayed with Noah were sorry for their choice.  They turned on Noah and his priests.  They burned Noah to death but his priests ran away and hid in the wilderness.  The men then returned, determined to find out what had happened to their families and to avenge them or die with them.  They rejoined Limhi's people.

Limhi ruled over his people in captivity for some time.  Eventually they escaped and rejoined the main body of the Nephites in [[Zarahemla]], as did Alma and his followers.  Their story of the wickedness of King Noah and the consequences for his people was most likely a great motivation for the people in accepting King Mosiah's proposition that kingship be done away with among the Nephites.  At the death of Mosiah, kings were replaced with a system of lesser and chief judges.  The first chief judge was Alma (known as [[Alma the Younger]]), the son of that Alma who had been a priest of King Noah.

This is a '''list of [[Hindu temple]]s in [[Pakistan]]''', sorted by [[Administrative units of Pakistan|administrative unit]].

A survey carried out by All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement Pakistan's revealed that out of 428 Hindu temples in Pakistan only around 20 survive today and they remain neglected by the [[Evacuee Trust Property Board]] which controls those while the rest had been converted for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/686952/95-of-worship-places-put-to-commercial-use-survey/ |title=95% of worship places put to commercial use: Survey |last=Gishkori |first=Zahid  |access-date=13 October 2017 |work=The Express Tribune |publication-date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 1000 active and former Hindu temples were attacked in retaliation following the destruction of the [[Babri Masjid]] in [[Ayodhya]], [[India]] by Hindu extremists there in 1992.&lt;ref name=islamshit5&gt;[http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-hindus-of-pakistan/ The Hindus of Pakistan], Friday Times,  Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Idols in some temples in Pakistan have gone missing and the ponds outside those temples that are considered necessary for a holy dip are drying up due to neglect which has irked the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/pakistan/absence-of-lord-ram-hanuman-statues-in-katas-raj-temple-irks-pakistan-supreme-court-4979705|title=Absence of Lord Ram, Hanuman statues in Katas Raj temple irks Pakistan Supreme Court|publisher=[[Indian Express (newspaper)|Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hinglaj Mata]] cave temple at [[Hinglaj]], [[Hingol National Park]].  The shrine of the Goddess Hinglaj is located in the desert of Balochistan, Pakistan, about 215 kilometers west of the city of Karachi. Notwithstanding its ancient Hindu and Muslim history, the establishment of an annual festival at Hinglaj took place only recently in the mid-1980s. after the Makran Coastal Highway connected the formerly distant shrine with urban Pakistan. Pakistan's minority Hindu community claim Hinglaj as their main religious center. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008771979|title=Hinglaj Devi : identity, change, and solidification at a Hindu temple in Pakistan|last=Schaflechner|first=Jürgen,|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780190850555|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=1008771979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">'''Liturgical [[dance]]''' is a type of dance movement sometimes incorporated into liturgies or worship services as an expression of [[worship]].

Some liturgical dance had been common in ancient times or non-western settings, with precedents in the Hebrew religion back to accounts of dancing in the [[Old Testament]]. An example is the episode when [[David|King David]] danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=david+danced&amp;qs_version=DRA 2 Sam 6:14]), but this dancing is often cited outside of [[Jewish]] norms and Rabbinic rituals prescribed at the time.

Its identity as an Islamic cemetery is noted by [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] writers as early as the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; It was used as a burial site up until 1927 when the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] decided to preserve it as a historic site.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt; Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the cemetery and other [[waqf]] properties in [[West Jerusalem]] fell under the control of [[Israel]]i governmental bodies.&lt;ref name=Dumperp168&gt;{{cite book|title=The politics of Jerusalem since 1967|author=Michael Dumper|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1997|ISBN= 9780231106405|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Os3pePtpyUwC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=mamilla+cemetery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BMcdTs2bFsfLswbC9dWyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mamilla%20cemetery&amp;f=false|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs stated in 1948 that the cemetery is: "one of the most prominent Muslim cemeteries, where seventy thousand Muslim warriors of [Saladin’s] armies are interred along with many Muslim scholars... Israel, will always know to protect and respect this site."&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-visit-jerusalem-s-new-museum-of-tolerance-feel-your-blood-boil-1.5172082 Visit Jerusalem's New Museum of Tolerance.

A number of buildings, a road and other public facilities, such as a park, a parking lot and public lavatories have since been constructed on the cemetery grounds, destroying grave markers and tombs. A plan to build a [[Center for Human Dignity|Museum of Tolerance]] on part of the cemetery grounds, announced in 2004, aroused much controversy and faced several stop work orders before being given final approval in July 2011.

==Name==
[[File:Mamilla Cemetery.jpg|225px|right|thumb|Partial view of Mamilla Cemetery]]
The name ''Mamilla'' is used to refer to the cemetery and the [[Mamilla Pool]] located at its center.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt; It was also the name of a church dedicated to St Mamilla located at the same site in the early Byzantine and Islamic periods.&lt;ref name=tawfiq/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilp442/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ciggaarp90/&gt;

Mamilla is mentioned as an Islamic cemetery as early as the 11th century in ''Concerning the (religious) status of Jerusalem'', a treatise penned by Abu Bakr b. Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Wasiti, the preacher of [[Al Aqsa Mosque]] in 1019-1020 (AH 410).&lt;ref name=Gil&gt;{{cite book|pages=422, 634|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tSM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA634&amp;dq=mamilla+cemetery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F9AdTsSKFsbSsgbL36WyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=wasiti&amp;f=false|title=A history of Palestine, 634-1099|author=Moshe Gil|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1992|ISBN=9780521404372}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives its name as ''zaytun al-milla'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "the olive trees of the religion", which [[Moshe Gil]] says was "a commonly used distortion of the name Māmillā," along with ''bab al-milla'' (meaning, "the door of the religion").&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt;

[[Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi]] writes in ''al-Haqiqa'', based on his travels to the region in 1693-4, that, "It is said that its original name is Ma'man Illah and sometimes it was called Bab Illah [Gate to God]. It is also called 'Zeitun il-Milla'. Its name, according to the Jews, is Beit Milo and to the Christians, Babilla. But it is known to the common people as Mamilla."&lt;ref name=JQF&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jerusalem quarterly file|issue=17-21|publisher=Institute of Jerusalem Studies|year=2003|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=BR0XAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=ma'man+illah&amp;dq=ma'man+illah&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YOcdTo7uEJCy8QOiw4X9Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khalidi"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=o51FWqrYp84C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=nabulsi+haqiqa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KOodTuiTC4Os8QPWuvm2CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nabulsi%20haqiqa&amp;f=false|title=Transformed landscapes: essays on Palestine and the Middle East in honor of Walid Khalidi|author1=Abdul-Karim Rafeq|first=|author2=|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|year=2009|ISBN=9789774162473|editor=Kamīl Manṣūr &amp; Leila Tarazi Fawaz|location=|page=14|pages=|lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This book of 2009 doesn't talk about Mamilla !  --&gt; A similar description appears in James Turner Barclay's ''The city of the Great King'' (1857) and he gives the meaning of ''Ma'man Illah'' (or ''Ma-min-ullah'', as he transcribes it) as "What is from God!"&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;{{Cite book|page=404|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kdRAAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA404&amp;dq=mamilla+name&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdwdTq7BMIOh8QPY6oWgCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=mamilla%20name&amp;f=false|title=The city of the Great King: or, Jerusalem as it was, as it is, and as it is to be|author=James Turner Barclay|publisher=Challen|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Islamic period===
Prior to the Islamic period, early on during the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]] over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (c. 4th-6th centuries), a church dedicated to St Mamilla was established on the same site and it appears to have been used for burials at this time as well.&lt;ref name=tawfiq/&gt; An account of the aftermath of the Persian capture of Jerusalem in 614 by [[Strategius]], a monk of [[Mar Saba]], says that the bodies of thousands of Christians killed by the Persian forces of the [[Sassanid Empire]] - 4,518 according to Gregorian translations of the lost Greek original, and 24,518 according to Arabic translations of the same - were found in the Mamilla Pool and buried in caves in and around it.&lt;ref name=Howardp167&gt;{{cite book|page=167|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=GQup_FGN7qsC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=mamilla+614&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-2EkTrjLFcX2sga-1-z5AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDgK#v=snippet&amp;q=mamilla&amp;f=false|title=Witnesses to a World Crisis: Historians and Histories of the Middle East in the Seventh Century|author=James Howard-Johnston|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|ISBN=9780199208593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pringle&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=X0jH6VPi4-gC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=mamilla+614&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B2YkTpjcA8jxsgbz9tWVAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mamilla%20614&amp;f=false|page=217|title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: The city of Jerusalem|author=Denys Pringle|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|ISBN=9780521390385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic rule over [[Jerusalem]] began in 638 under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and persisted for some 1,400 years, interrupted only by the Crusader invasions of 1099-1187 and 1229-1244.&lt;ref name=Dumper2/&gt; Throughout much of this period, Mamilla cemetery was the largest Islamic cemetery in the city, containing the remains of [[emir]]s, [[mufti]]s, Arab and [[Sufi]] mystics, soldiers of [[Saladin]] and numerous Jerusalem notables.&lt;ref name=tawfiq/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumper2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conflictincities.org/PDFs/WorkingPaper12_10.11.09.pdf|title=Political Islam in Contested Jerusalem: The Emerging Role of Islamists from within Israel|author1=Mick Dumper  |author2=Craig Larkin |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Conflict in Cities|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harel/&gt; The cemetery is said to be the burial site of several of the first Muslims, the [[Sahabah]], companions or disciples of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam.&lt;ref name=Dumper2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auld&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-2VOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mamilla%22companions+of+the+Prophet%22&amp;dq=mamilla%22companions+of+the+Prophet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4RIeTpDIMsrVsgaihaCyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA|page=67|title=Ottoman Jerusalem: the living city, 1517-1917, Part 1| author=Abdul-Karim Rafeq|chapter=Ottoman Jerusalem in the writings of Arab travellers|editor=Sylvia Auld, Robert Hillenbrand|publisher=Published on behalf of the British School of Archaeology In Jerusalem in co-operation with the Administration of Auqaf and Islamic Affairs, Jerusalem, by Altajir World of Islam Trust|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, ''[[The Palestine Post]]'' said it covered an area of over 450 dunams (111 acres),&lt;ref name="ppost"/&gt; while ''[[Haaretz]]'' in 2010 said that at its peak, it covered an area of 200 dunams (some 50 acres).&lt;ref name=haaretzpt1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/2.278/museum-of-tolerance-special-report-part-i-holes-holiness-and-hollywood-1.290924|title=Museum of Tolerance Special Report / Part I: Holes, Holiness and Hollywood|author=Nir Hasson|date=18 May 2010|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=Ha'aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1938 deed issued by the British mandatory authorities to the Islamic waqf outlined the size of the plot as 134.5 dunams (33 acres).&lt;ref name=KhalidiH/&gt;&lt;ref name=KhalidiA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcri.org/files/khalidi.html|title=Mamilla and the Museum of Intolerance|date=January 2009|author=Asem Khalidi|publisher=Israel Palestine Crnter for Research and Information (IPCRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1020, al-Wasiti writes that the Muslim cemetery situated in ''zaytun al-milla'' and outlines the advantages of being buried in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; [[Ibn al-Adim]], the Syrian historian, recounts visiting the cemetery several times, and on one visit in 1239-40 recalls going to the graves of Rabi' al-Mardini (d. 1205-6), a shaykh from Mardin renowned for performing miracles, and al-'Iwaqi (d. 1232), a pious Sufi who lived in the compound of al-Aqsa mosque.&lt;ref name=Morray&gt;{{cite book|title=An Ayyubid notable and his world: Ibn al-ʻAdīm and Aleppo as portrayed in his biographical dictionary of people associated with the city|author=D.

During Crusader rule over Jerusalem, the cemetery appears to have once again served as a burial place for Christians.

In the 14th century work ''A'lam'', a collection of traditions on the value of prayer in Jerusalem, [[al-Zarkashi]] says those buried in the city will avoid ''fitnat al qabr'' or "purgatory of the tomb," and for those buried in ''zaytun al-milla'' itself, it would be as if they were buried in heaven.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt;

[[Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi]] in ''al-Uns al-Jalil'' (c. 1496)  says, "Who ever invokes God's name while standing between the graves of Ibn Arslān and al-Quraishī [in Māmilā cemetery], God will grant all his wishes."&lt;ref name=Ephratp129&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual wayfarers, leaders in piety: Sufis and the dissemination of Islam in medieval Palestine|author=Daphna Ephrat|pages=129, 141–2|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Harvard CMES|year=2008|ISBN=9780674032019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Quraishi, a famous Sufi mystic said to have miraculous healing powers, immigrated to Jerusalem from [[Andulasia]] by way of [[Fustat]] and garnered a school of disciples in his new home that numbered some 600 people before his death and burial in 1194.

During the period of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman imperial]] rule from the early 16th to early 20th centuries, the cemetery continued to serve as a burial site, and in 1847, it was demarcated by a 2 meter high fence.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt;

===Mandate Palestine period===
[[File:MamillaDistrict1946.jpg|thumb|Mamilla region of Jerusalem in 1946]]
Burials in the cemetery ceased early in the period of British rule over [[Mandate Palestine]] (1918–1948), following the 1927 decision by the Supreme Muslim Council, who oversaw the administration of [[waqf]] properties, to preserve it as a historic site.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt; By this decision, the cemetery, its tombs, and its grounds were maintained.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt;

In 1929, [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the Mufti of Jerusalem, decided to build the Palace Hotel on what was assumed to be outside the border of the cemetery. While the foundations were being laid, Arab workers uncovered Muslim graves. Baruch Katinka, a Jewish contractor hired to oversee the project, wrote in his memoirs that when the Mufti was informed of the discovery, he said to quietly rebury the bones elsewhere, as he feared [[Raghib al-Nashashibi]], his political rival and the mayor of Jerusalem, would issue a cease work order. As Shari'a law permits the transfer of graves in special cases with the approval of a qadi (Muslim judge), Husayni, acting as head of the Supreme Muslim Council, the highest body in charge of Muslim community affairs in [[Mandate Palestine]], authorized the disinterment. When it was discovered what had happened, rival factions filed a suit against Husayni in the Muslim courts, arguing that he had desecrated ancient graves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=150355 The Jerusalem Post Grand Hotel 30 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/IsraelGuide/JerusalemAreaTours/Article.aspx?id=166754 A guide to buildings in Jerusalem 25 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic waqf continued to control the cemetery and in 1944, the cemetery was designated an antiquities site by the British mandatory authorities.&lt;ref name=KhalidiH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/2052/human-dignity-in-jerusalem|title=Human Dignity in Jerusalem|author=[[Rashid Khalidi]]|publisher=''[[Jadaliyya]]''|date=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 1945 article in ''[[The Palestine Post]]'' reported on plans of the Supreme Muslim Council (SMC) and the Government Town Planning Adviser to build a commercial center on cemetery grounds and to transfer remains buried in the areas to be developed to a "40 dunams walled reserve" centered around the tomb of al Sayid al Kurashi, ancestor of the Dajani family.&lt;ref name=HierJJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/mamilla_cemetery_chutzpah_and_the_museum_of_tolerance_20100219/|date=19 February 2010|title=Mamilla Cemetery Chutzpah and the Museum of Tolerance|author=Rabbi Marvin Hier|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the SMC told the newspaper that, "the use of Muslim cemeteries in the public interest had many precedents both in Palestine and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="ppost"/&gt; The SMC's plan, however, was never implemented.

===Israeli control===
[[File:Mamilla graveyard.jpg|thumb|Mamilla graveyard 1948]]
At the time of Israel's assertion of control over West Jerusalem in 1948, the cemetery, which contained thousands of grave markers, came under the administration of the Israeli [[Custodian of Absentee Property]] and the Muslim Affairs Department of Israel's [[Ministry of Religious Services|Ministry of Religious Affairs]].&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumperp168/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peledp91&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating Islam in the Jewish state: the development of policy toward Islamic institutions in Israel|author=Alisa Rubin Peled|edition=Illustrated|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2001|ISBN= 9780791450789|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=SRAs5BgF70AC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=mamilla+cemetery&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3MUdTt-cGMfKsgau8qiyDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mamilla%20cemetery&amp;f=false|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] that resulted in the Israeli occupation of [[East Jerusalem]], only a handful of broken grave markers remained standing.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"/&gt; A large part of the cemetery was bulldozed and converted into a parking lot in 1964 and a public lavatory was also built on the cemetery grounds.&lt;ref name=KhalidiH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cattan&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LQcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=parking+lot+mamillah&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=apYgTr_ZIY7Hswbv1KitAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=parking%20lot%20mamillah&amp;f=false|title=The Palestine question|author=Henry Cattan|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1988|ISBN= 9780709948605|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=A7tVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=parking+lot+mamillah&amp;dq=parking+lot+mamillah&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=apYgTr_ZIY7Hswbv1KitAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg|title=Journal of Palestine studies, Volume 7, Issues 25-28|publisher=Institute for Palestine Studies and Kuwait University|year=1978|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sensitive to how the treatment of waqf properties would be viewed internationally, criticized government policy towards the cemetery.&lt;ref name=Peledp91/&gt; A ministry representative described the vandalism to tombstones, including their use by the guard appointed by the Religious Ministry to build a henhouse beside his shelter in the cemetery, and the destruction of ancient tombs by bulldozers cleaning the Mamilla Pool.&lt;ref name=Peledp91/&gt; Noting the site constituted waqf property and lay within sight of the American Consulate, the ministry said it viewed the situation, which included plans for new roads and the parceling out of portions to private landowners as compensation for other properties confiscated by the state, with deep regret.&lt;ref name=Peledp91/&gt;

Israeli authorities bulldozed several tombs in the cemetery, including some of those identified as Frankish by Clermont-Ganneau, to establish Mamilla Park (or [[Independence Park (Jerusalem)|Independence Park]]) in 1955.&lt;ref name=Boasp288&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crusader archaeology: the material culture of the Latin East|author=Adrian J.

The SWC's plan also elicited considerable outcry from some Israeli academics and archaeologists, and work was stayed several times by the courts. After the Supreme Court rejected the Islamic Movement's petition in October 2008, work resumed.&lt;ref name=haaretzpt1/&gt; Between November 2008 and April 2009, crews of 40 to 70 people per shift worked in 8-hour stints, 24-hours a day to remove an estimated 1,000 skeletons from the site slated for construction.&lt;ref name=haaretzpt1/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretzpt2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/museum-of-tolerance-special-report-part-ii-secrets-from-the-grave-1.290941|title=Museum of Tolerance Special Report / Part II: Secrets from the grave|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=Ha'aretz|author=Nir Hasson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Marvin Hier]], rabbi and founder and dean of the SWC, said "Our opponents would have you believe our bulldozers are preparing to desecrate ancient Muslim tombstones and historic markers. Let me be clear: The Museum of Tolerance is not being built on the Mamilla Cemetery, but on an adjacent 3-acre site where, for a half-century, hundreds of people of all faiths have parked in a three-level underground structure without any protest."&lt;ref name="oped"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hypocrisy and lies fuel enemies of a Jerusalem museum |author=Rabbin Marvin Hier |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=19 February 2010 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/02/19/2010-02-19_hypocrisy_and_lies_fuel_enemies_of_a_jerusalem_museum.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hier also accused opponents of the SWC's building plans of "sheer hypocrisy,"&lt;ref name="ppost"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Muslims planned Mamilla project in '45 |author=Abe Selig |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=17 February 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=168899}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the plans of the Supreme Muslim Council to build a commercial center in 1945 was evidence that substantiated the Supreme Court's ruling, "That the Mamilla Cemetery was regarded by many Muslim religious leaders as 'mundras,' or abandoned and without sanctity."&lt;ref name="oped"/&gt;

[[Rashid Khalidi]], a professor of Arab studies at [[Columbia University]], said that, "contrary to what Rabbi Hier said, that parking lot was built over a cemetery, part of it. And so, the Israeli authorities are basically pushing ahead with the desecration of a cemetery that they have been, unfortunately, slowly nibbling away at for over three decades. We and other families are taking action as a group of families to try and stop this, after other families failed in the Israeli Supreme Court." He also said that "What they have now done is to dig down and disinter four layers, according to the chief archaeologist for the Israeli Archaeological Authority, four layers of graves. There are more probably beneath those, according to his report, which was suppressed in the submissions to the Israeli Supreme Court."  &lt;ref name= "Democracy Now"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/2/10/palestinian_families_appeal_to_un_over |title=Palestinian families appeal to un |date= 10 February 2010|author =Democracy Now |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, eighty-four archaeologists called on the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Jerusalem municipality and the Israel Antiquities Authority to end construction of the Museum of Tolerance. In a letter sent to the three bodies, the archaeologists argued that the establishment of the museum on the site of the Mamilla Muslim cemetery contradicted ethical standards in the archaeological world, as well as Israeli law.  "The bulldozing of historic cemeteries is the ultimate act of territorial aggrandizement: the erasure of prior residents," said Professor [[Harvey Weiss]] of Yale University, adding that "Desecration of Jerusalem's Mamilla cemetery is a continuing cultural and historical tragedy." The Simon Wiesenthal Center responded  that "the arguments in the letter are old, of a mistaken nature and contain factual errors."&lt;ref name= "haaretz"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/grave-concerns-1.391852 |title= Grave concerns International archaeologists are calling for work to stop at the Museum of Tolerance |date= 2011-10-25 |author = Noam Dvir |accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other developments====
Plans to build new buildings to house the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court and the Jerusalem District Court on the cemetery grounds were cancelled by Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch in January 2010. The decision followed the discovery of human remains at the site, supporting critics' claims that construction in the area was offensive to Muslims.&lt;ref name=haaretzgehry/&gt;

The Jerusalem city council issued its first official response in a written statement on 12 August, saying that, "The municipality and the (Israel Lands) Authority destroyed around 300 dummy gravestones which were set up illegally in Independence Park on public land." It said these "fake" gravestones were not erected over any human remains and were placed in the park in an effort to "illegally take over state land."&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;

Mahmud Abu Atta, a spokesman for the Al-Aqsa Foundation, denied the city council's claim that new tombs were added illegally.

'''Marek Jurek''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈmarɛk ˈjurɛk}}; 28 June 1960 in [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]], Poland) is a right-wing politician and a [[Member of the European Parliament]]. Since 20 April 2007 he has been the leader of the aspirant party [[Right of the Republic]]. Politically, he is most known for being a [[Marshal of the Sejm]] in the years 2005-2007.

==Biography==
He is a graduate in history from [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań]]. In the 1980s he was an activist in the [[anti-communist]] movement in Poland. After the fall of the communism in 1989, he was one of the founders of the now defunct political party [[Christian National Union]]. He was a deputy in the [[Contract Sejm]] and later in the [[Sejm]] of the Republic of Poland from 1991 to 1993.

From 1995 to 2001 he was a member of the National Broadcasting Council.

In 2001, he was elected a deputy of the [[Sejm]] again, this time as a member of the [[Law and Justice]] party. On 26 October 2005 he was elected a Sejm [[Marszałek sejmu|marshal]] (parliament speaker) nominated by [[Law and Justice]] with 265 votes (133 votes were given to [[Bronisław Komorowski]] from [[Civic Platform]]). On 13 April 2007 he resigned from the post, following the Sejm's failure to amend the [[Constitution of Poland|Constitution]] to protect prenatal life. On the following day, he left Law and Justice to found his own party, now known as the Right of the Republic. His resignation was accepted on 27 April 2007.

In the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary election in 2007]] his party did not win any seats in the Parliament as it found itself below the [[election threshold]]. On 22 June 2008 Marek Jurek took part in a by-election to the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senate]], held in [[Krosno]]-constituency following the death of Senator Andrzej Mazurkiewicz. With 10 751 votes, he gained the third place after the winner [[Stanisław Zając]] ([[Law and Justice]]) and Maciej Lewicki (Civic Platform). As there was only one seat available in the Senate, Marek Jurek remains outside the Parliament.

On 27 September 2009, Jurek was awarded the Commander's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] for outstanding contribution to the independence of Polish Republic, for activities on behalf of democratic change, for achievements in undertaken for the benefit of the country and social work.

He was one of the candidates in the [[Polish presidential election, 2010|2010 Polish presidential election]], but received only 1.06% of votes and failed to get into the second round.

==Political positions==
Marek Jurek declared full support for the teaching of the Catholic Church as he opposes abortion, euthanasia, same sex unions and in vitro. He supports the traditional family model.  He supports the [[Creighton Model FertilityCare System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/196087/Zapytaj-wprost-Najwazniejsze-jest-prawo-do-zycia/?O=196087&amp;pg=1|title=''Marek Jurek za naprotechnologią''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurek is in favor of bringing the future back to the Polish{{vague|date=March 2014}} and European traditions, cultivating a [[Christian civilization]] and Latin culture. He is a supporter of the "[[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Rite]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/99741/Schizma-trydencka/?O=99741&amp;pg=1|author=[[Kazimierz Sowa]]|title=''Schizma trydencka''|date=14 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mien Shiang''' is a 3,000-year-old [[Taoist]] practice that means literally face (mien) reading (shiang). In just moments, one can supposedly determine anyone’s ''"[[Wu Xing]]"'' — Five Element personality type — their character, behavior, and health potential — by analyzing their face. The Taoist Five Elements, [[Tree (Wu Xing)|Wood]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] and [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], are metaphors devised by the ancient Taoist philosophers to explain the relationship, interaction, and ongoing change of everything in the Universe.&lt;ref name="mien" /&gt; In recent times the art of Face Reading is becoming more and more popular. Schools that teach Mien Shiang are becoming more wide spread.&lt;ref name="classes" /&gt;

[[File:North French Hebrew Miscellany folio 117b118a.l.jpg|thumb|Left, scenes with [[Abraham]] from Genesis, ch 18; right, David]]
The '''North French Hebrew Miscellany''' or "French Miscellany" or "London Miscellany" ([[British Library]] Add. MS 11639) is an important [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[illuminated manuscript]] from 13th-century [[Capetian France|France]], created c. 1278-98.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan's c. 1278-98 is here preferred to BM's 1277-1286, see below.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[miscellany]] is a manuscript containing texts of different types and by different authors, and this volume contains a wide range of [[Hebrew language]] texts, mostly religious but many secular.  The manuscript is exceptional among medieval Hebrew manuscripts both for its size and the diversity of the texts and the quality and lavishness of its illuminations, which as was often the case were added by Christian specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 10-11; BM&lt;/ref&gt;

This manuscript was digitized by the British Library's Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/projects/hebrew-manuscripts-digitisation-project|title=Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_11639|title=Digitised Manuscripts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The manuscript (excluding paper flyleaves) has 746 folios (so 1,492 pages), which include a [[Units of paper quantity#Quire|quire]] of six illuminated pages added at the end; the page dimensions are 16 x 12&amp;nbsp;cm. The manuscript includes "eighty-four different groups of texts, including hundreds of poems".  The Biblical and liturgical texts include the [[Pentateuch]], the  ''[[Haftarot]]'' prophetical readings, ''[[Tiqqun soferim]]'', [[Five Scrolls]], and the full annual cycle of the [[liturgy]], as well as the [[Haggadah]] ([[Passover]] ritual) and the earliest complete Hebrew text of the [[Book of Tobit]], which is not included in the [[Tanakh]] or canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 121; BM&lt;/ref&gt;  Other texts include the ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'', prayers, [[gematria]], legal texts and calendars.  The poetry includes a large group of poems by [[Moses ibn Ezra]], the great Spanish [[Sephardic]] poet of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile has the fullest list; BM&lt;/ref&gt; The single scribe of the texts is named (in four places) as "Benjamin", who may have compiled the book for his own use; there is no "proper [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]" as might be expected in a commissioned manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 121&lt;/ref&gt;   Another suggestion is that the unusual number of illustrations including the biblical figure of [[Aaron]] indicate a patron with this name.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North French Hebrew Miscellany 260b.l Esther before Ahasuerus.jpg|thumb|[[Esther]] before [[Ahasuerus]].]]
The manuscript is illustrated with a total of 49 full-page miniatures, mostly of Biblical subjects, "which were executed by Christian illuminators attached to three major contemporary Parisian workshops", and probably also worked on at [[Amiens]] or another north French city,&lt;ref&gt;Still a matter of some discussion, see Tahan, 119 (quoted); Facsimile, which is more open to the possibility of some of the artists being Jewish;BM&lt;/ref&gt; and reflect the latest Gothic styles, though the execution of the various artists is uneven, and one scholar complains that "broad, flat expanses of crudely painted, often runny pigment; angular, etiolated figures, and unusual colours place it well outside the orbit of the Parisian de luxe book, although its painters were undoubtedly influenced by the Parisian style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolinski, 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects include Jewish mythical beasts whose depiction draws on Christian [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 119-122&lt;/ref&gt; These are mostly illustrated in [[roundel]]s with a text caption beneath, while the narrative scenes from the Pentateuch are in rectangular miniatures (the scene with [[Noah's Ark]] illustrated here is an exception).  There are 2 full-page diagrams in ink of the stars and planets and the [[signs of the zodiac]] (ff. 542, 542v) and "numerous inhabited initial-word panels, and inhabited and decorated panels in colours and gold attached to initial words and numerous decorated initial-word panels with gold letters".&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;BM&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The relatively precise dating comes from aspects of the text including the inclusion of [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]]'s legal compendium the ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'', a text known to have been finished in 1277, mentions of [[Yehiel of Paris]], who died in 1286, as still alive, and "a table of [[molad]]ot (lunation-commencements) for the period 1279/80 - 1295/95 (f. 444)".&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;  The style of the miniatures accords with this date range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Provenance==
Inscriptions record various points in the manuscript's history, though many gaps remain.  It perhaps left France for Germany in the persecutions of 1306. A loan of the book is noted in 1426, and in 1431 it was sold to an Abraham ben Moses of [[Coburg]].  By 1479 it was in Italy at [[Mestre]] on the coast opposite [[Venice]], where it went next, followed by [[Padua]] in 1480 and [[Iesi]] near [[Ancona]] in 1481.  The 16th century [[bookbinding]] has the arms of the Jewish [[Abraham Rovigo|Rovigo]] family, but in the 17th century the manuscript passed into Christian hands, including the [[Barberini]] family. It was examined by the [[Christian Hebraist]] [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]] and published in his work ''Variae lectionis veteris testamenti'' ([[Parma]], 1784).  It was bought by a Paris bookseller from a [[Milan]] collection for the [[British Museum]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile; BM&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14414">'''Peter's Pence''' (or '''''Denarii Sancti Petri''''' and '''"Alms of St Peter"''')&lt;ref name="Vatican" /&gt; are donations or payments made directly to the [[Holy See]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The practice began under the [[Saxons]] in [[England]] and spread through Europe. Both before and after the [[Norman conquest]] the practice varied by time and place; initially, it was done as a pious contribution, whereas later it was required by various rulers, and collected, more like a [[Church tax|tax]]. Though formally discontinued in England at the time of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], a post-Reformation payment of uncertain characteristics is seen in some English [[manorialism|manors]] into the 19th century. In 1871, [[Pope Pius IX]] formalized the practice of lay members of the church "other persons of good will" providing financial support to the [[Roman See]]. Modern "Peter's Pence" proceeds are used by the [[Pope]] for philanthropic works throughout the world.

== Ancient payment (1031–1555)==
The term Peter's pence, in its Latin form, first appeared in writing in 1031. However, the payment may not have had a single origin under the [[Saxons]].  It was applied by the [[Normans]] to Ireland as a 'penny per hearth' annual tax in the later part of the twelfth century under the Papal Bull ''[[Laudabiliter]]''. The traditional scholarly view is summarized in Jacob's ''Law Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;quoting from 1762 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise called by Saxons the ''Romefeoh'' (the fee due to Rome), it was a tribute, or rather an alms, given by [[Ine of Wessex|Ina]], King of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]], on his pilgrimage to Rome in 725. A similar "contribution" was also collected by [[Offa]], King of the [[Mercia]]ns, throughout his dominions, in 794. However, it was said to be not a tribute to the pope, but for the maintenance of the English School or College at Rome. It was called Peter's pence because a penny from every house (subject to a means test) was collected on 1 August, the feast day of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|St. Peter ad Vincula]].  The penny of Offa was a [[Penny#England|small silver coin]].  King [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]]’s laws contained a sharp Constitution&lt;ref&gt;sic, meaning as yet unclear.[end original footnote] March 10, 2017 – Re clarification needed: What is not clear? "sharp Constitution"? Relevant text should be included in a quote. Full citation needed.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017|reason=What is not clear? "sharp Constitution"? The unclear text should be included as a quote, or one can't tell what is writer vs what is source. Full citation needed.}} touching this money (Leg. Edg 78 c 4){{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Some sources give the Anglo-Saxon term ''Romescot'' instead of ''Romefeoh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|title=Peterspence|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11774a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Offa story is elaborated in later accounts of unknown reliability:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Aethelberht II of East Anglia|Ethelbert]], king of the [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Angles]], having reigned single some time, thought fit to take a wife; for this purpose he came to the court of [[Offa]], king of [[Mercia]], to desire his daughter in marriage. Cynethryth, consort of Offa, a cruel, ambitious, and blood-thirsty woman, who envied the retinue and splendor of the unsuspicious king, resolved in some manner to have him murdered, before he left their court, hoping by that to gain his immense riches; for this purpose she, with her malicious and fascinating arts, overcame the king–her husband, which she most cunningly effected, and, under deep disguises, laid open to him her portentous design; a villain was therefore hired, named Gimberd, who was to murder the innocent prince.

The manner in which the heinous crime was effected was as cowardly as it was fatal: under the chair of state in which Ethelbert sat, a deep pit was dug; at the bottom of it was placed the murderer; the unfortunate king was then let through a trap-door into the pit; his fear overcame him so much, that he did not attempt resistance. Three months after this, Queenrid died, when circumstances convinced Offa of the innocence of Ethelbert; he therefore, to appease his guilt, built St. Alban's monastery, gave one-tenth part of his goods to the poor, and went in penance to Rome, where he gave to the Pope a penny for every house in his dominions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/1/3/4/11341/11341-h/11341-h.htm ''The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction''. Volume 10, No. 282, November 10, 1827.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest documentary evidence concerning these payments is found in a letter written from Rome by King [[Canute]] to the English clergy in 1031. At that time, Canute was collecting a levy of one penny on each hearth or household, using a means test requiring that the household have an annual rental cost of thirty pence or more; households paying less than that in rent were exempt. 

Over time, the payment came to be regarded as a tax rather than an offering, and payment was apt to be avoided, if possible, the more so as time went on. Indeed, in the 13th century, the revenue arising from it had been stabilized, on the basis of the assessment of a much earlier day, at the annual sum of £20 1s. 9d for the whole of England. [[Pope Clement V]] pressed to return to the more rewarding ancient basis of a penny from each sufficient household. By the 14th century, a standard sum, typically 5[[shilling|s.]] per manor or parish, was being given to local church authorities for forwarding. It appears that new tenants entering on a property which had historically been subject to a Peter's Pence levy did not always accept the obligation to pay.&lt;ref&gt;The Minchinhampton Custumal, in Transactions of the [[Bristol &amp; Gloucestershire Archaeological Society]], 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

Older sources are often unclear in their references to Peter's Pence, and there was (and remains) a degree of local confusion between it, various hearth taxes (sometimes called [[smoke-money]] or [[smoke-farthings]]), and other ancient payments.

By the end of the 12th century, the English population had increased, so the ecclesiastical authorities were collecting more than the stabilized sum, and keeping the surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E Rodes, quoted in Clegg, ''Economic Decline of the Church in Medieval England'', Simon Fraser University thesis, 1991 [http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/bitstream/1892/6278/1/b14500735.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

It ceased to be remitted to the pope after 1320,&lt;ref&gt;M.McKisack, ''The Fourteenth Century'' (1959) p. 283-4.&lt;/ref&gt; but seemingly this was not permanent. The exact reason for the 'prohibition' by Edward III is unknown, but the threat of withholding payment of Peter's Pence proved more than once a useful weapon against uncooperative popes in the hands of English kings. In 1366 and for some years after, it was refused on the grounds of the pope's obstinacy&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1911 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, however, the payment survived or was revived in some localities, because it was one of many payments abolished by Act of Parliament in the 25th year of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign. The 1534 Act, "An Act for the exoneration of exactions paid to the See of Rome", specifically mentions Peter's Pence. Along with other payments, it was "never more to be levied … to any person", indicating that the payment was to be extinguished completely and not diverted to crown use. This occurred just prior to Henry's permanent break from the Church, which occurred in 1536, making England part of the Protestant [[Reformation]]. 

However, under the Catholic [[Queen Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], Henry VIII's reformation legislation was overturned. On 16 Jan 1555, royal assent was given to "An Act, repealing all Statutes, Articles, and Provisions, made against the See of Rome, sithence the 20th Year of King Henry the Eighth; and for the Establishment of Ecclesiastical Possessions conveyed to the Laity" (1 &amp; 2 Philip &amp; Mary c.8){{full citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, this act did not mention Peter's Pence specifically. There is isolated evidence that in some parishes, payment of Peter's Pence did indeed resume during Mary's reign, for instance in [[Rowington]], Warwickshire, where the church accounts for 1556 record the collection of 54s. 4[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d.]], a considerable sum.&lt;ref&gt;'From Hroca to Anne: being 1000 years in the life of Rowington', Joy Woodall (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's Act was in turn repealed by the 1559 [[Act of Supremacy]], under the Protestant [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]].

== Post-Reformation practice in England ==

Despite the unequivocal abolition called for by the 1559 Act, payments termed Peter's Pence undoubtedly continued in England in the succeeding centuries. In one [[Devon]] parish, there is a record regarding 1609–1610 that states "besides 2s. for Peter's farthings there is a payment of 2s. for Peter's pence".&lt;ref&gt;Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science [etc], 1906, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gloucestershire]], a survey of the then royal manor of [[Cheltenham]] in 1617 asked tenants, "whether there is not duly continued and paid certain moneys called peter pence; if not when did they discontinue and what was the sum of them and to whom was it paid?" This question indicates that at the least, Gloucester recognized that practices varied. The reply given was that, "the moneys called Peter Pence are commonly every year paid unto the [[Bailiff]] and are not discontinued to their knowledge, and the sum of them by the year is 5s. or thereabouts, as they think".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gloucestershire Archives]] D855/M50&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that originally some 60 households contributed annually. The survey makes no mention of when in the year the payment was made, and whether the bailiff passed the money on or retained it on the lord's behalf. (Pre-Reformation practice in Cheltenham had called for payment—invariably of 5s.—on the accustomed date of 1 August, as above.)&lt;ref&gt;e.g. National Archives SC6 852/19, bailiff's accounts for Cheltenham manor, 1438-39&lt;/ref&gt; In Cheltenham manorial records, occasional references to properties being liable for Peter's pence are seen until as late as 1802,&lt;ref&gt;Gloucestershire Archives D855/M20&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no direct evidence of any actual payment.

An Act of Parliament obtained in 1625 to clarify manorial customs in Cheltenham acknowledges the continued existence of Peter Pence: "And be it enacted … that the said copyholders … shall … hold the said customary messuages and lands of the said manors severally and respectively, by copies of court-roll to them and their heirs, by suit of court, and by the yearly rents, [[worksilver]], Peter-pence, and [[Bead Reap]]-money, to be paid severally and respectively as heretofore…"&lt;ref&gt;Gloucestershire Archives, D855/M79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain how exceptional the situation in Cheltenham may have been. It is possible that the label Peter's Pence had been transferred to some other type of household or [[hearth tax]]. Some evidence for this comes from references in [[Minchinhampton]] (Gloucestershire) churchwardens' accounts of 1575 to "Peter-pence or smoke-farthings" expended at the time of the bishop’s visitation in the summer. Smoke-farthings are glossed as a composition for offerings made in [[Whitsun]] week by every man who occupied a house with a chimney, to the cathedral of the diocese in which he lived; and that though Peter's pence was abolished in 1534, "on the grant of those monasteries to whom they had by custom become payable, they continued payable as appendant to the manors etc of the persons to whom granted".&lt;ref&gt;[[Notes and Queries]], 2nd Series, VII, 19 Feb. 1859&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Reformation, the lordship of the manor of Cheltenham had been held by the Abbess of Syon. It is plausible therefore that as both the pious payment of Peter's Pence and the secular manorial fees had once gone to the same institution, the former came over time to be regarded as part of the latter.

== Revived custom ==
In 1871, [[Pope Pius IX]] formalized the practice of lay members of Church and "other persons of good will" – providing financial support directly to the [[Roman See]].  In general, contributions go to the local parish or diocese, who then provide contributions to support higher level offices. Collections for Peter's Pence go directly to Rome. Pius IX approved this practice in the encyclical ''Saepe venerabilis'', issued on 5 August 1871.&lt;ref name = "Vatican"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/obolo_spietro/documents/history_en.html Vatican: "An ancient custom still alive today".]&lt;/ref&gt; The money collected is today used by the pope for philanthropic purposes.&lt;ref name="USCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/ppc/ |title=Peter's Pence |publisher=[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, this collection is taken each year on the Sunday closest to 29 June, the [[Solemnity]] of the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] in the liturgical calendar. {{As of|2012}}, the United States has donated the largest amounts, giving some 28% of the total, followed by Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Brazil and South Korea. US donations totaled $75.8 million in 2008, $82,529,417 in 2009, $67,704,416.41 in 2010 and $69,711,722.76 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cotterill, [http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/07/05/1073191/ "Angels and debtors"] ''Financial Times'', July 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9307">'''Samuel Wells Stagg''' (1897-1956) was a Methodist missionary who traveled to the Philippines as the "Special Field Scout Commissioner" of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] to assist in organizing the [[Boy Scouts of America Philippine Islands Council No. 545]] which was set up on 5 October 1923 through the initiative of the [[Rotary Club of Manila]], with Stagg as one of the 22 Charter Members.&lt;ref&gt;''Diamond Jubilee Yearbook'', Manila: [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], 1996, p 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Samuel Stagg was born in California to William Tinsley Stagg (1867-1947) and Annie Eleanor Wells (1868-1949). Stagg graduated from [[Turlock High School]] in 1915 and the [[University of Southern California]]. He married Mary Litt Boyd in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jovito Salonga|Salonga, Jovito]], ''Journey of Struggle and Hope'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Manila]], [[Insular Government|Philippine Islands]] in 1923, and became the pastor of the [[Central United Methodist Church (Manila)|Central Church]] on San Luis Street (now [[Kalaw Avenue]], [[Malate, Manila]]), affiliated with the General Conference of the Methodist Church of America. In 1933, Stagg and other church members left the Central Church and the GCMCA, and formed the Cosmopolitan Student Church (now the [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines|Cosmopolitan Church]]) and the General Conference of the Methodist Church of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Unfortunately, the Cosmopolitan Church has no library usable for research.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Philippines Free Press'', July 2, 1938, reports that Rev. Samuel Stagg defended [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]]'s veto of a Catholic-supported [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] [[National Assembly of the Philippines|Assembly]] bill to provide religious instruction in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philippines Free Press'': Meanwhile, "fighting" Rev. Samuel W. Stagg, Protestant pastor, defended the chief executive in a radio speech over KZIB, and at the same time accused the Catholic hierarchy of being "the sworn enemy of all democracy." He lauded the President for his "great courage in taking issues with the hierarchy in defense of the hard-won liberties of the Filipino people."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary Litt Boyd Stagg===
Just before the [[Second World War]], Samuel Stagg was recruited into U.S. Navy intelligence; none of his work in this job, however, has come to light. His wife Mary Boyd Stagg (1893-1944) then took over as pastor of the Cosmopolitan Church, becoming the first female ordained a Protestant minister in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fidel V. Ramos|Ramos, Fidel]], "A Heroic Church" in ''The [[Manila Bulletin]]'', April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "Mother" Stagg and members of the church were active in humanitarian relief work, distributing food and medicine, and performing welfare activities for displaced persons, fugitives from the Japanese (Chinese business and community leaders), and resistance fighters. 

Betrayed by a Japanese double-agent, Franco Vera Reyes, Mary and her friends were arrested by the Japanese in January 1944. They were interrogated and tortured at [[Fort Santiago]] in Manila by the [[Kempeitai]]. On 25, 28, 29, or probably 30 August 1944, Dr. Hawthorne Darby,&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne Darby (13 Sep 1894, Colfax, Indiana–Aug 1944, Cemetery, Manila): Pediatrician, missionary, and humanitarian.

Nurse and business manager of Emmanuel Cooperative Hospital, Tondo.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Boyd Stagg, Blanche Jurika,&lt;ref&gt;Blanche Anna Walker Jurika (1885-1944): mother of naval officer [[Stephen Jurika]] and guerrilla Thomas Walker Jurika, and mother-in-law of [[Chick Parsons|Charles Thomas "Chick" Parsons]]&lt;/ref&gt; and another woman named Sybil were taken to the [[Manila North Cemetery|Cementerio del Norte]] where they were beheaded and buried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippine-scouts.org/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1085282222]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Blanche was dead, executed in late August, 1944, hands tied behind her, blindfolded and kneeling over a newly-dug trench somewhere in Manila’s North Cemetery, killed with over two dozen other civilians accused of various acts of conspiracy by the Japanese. For Blanche and the few other American women, death was by beheading by Samurai sword. For the men, it had been a single shot to the back of the head." —Louis Jurika 
[http://corregidor.org/crypto/intel_01/A%20Philippine%20Odyssey%20-%20Louis%20Jurika.pdf] 
Their common grave was found in 1945 by guerrilla leader Thomas Walker Jurika (1914-1997) who threatened and forced the double-agent [[Richard Sakakida]] to reluctantly reveal the grave's location.[http://corregidor.org/crypto/intel_01/sakakida_01.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 Darby, Wilk, and Mary Stagg were posthumously conferred the [[Philippine Legion of Honor]], and were also awarded the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] by the United States government. Their remains have been exhumed and re-interred at Cosmopolitan Church.

===Samuel Boyd Stagg===
Samuel and Mary Stagg's son Samuel Boyd Stagg (d. 2008) was arrested with his mother 28 January 1944,&lt;ref&gt;"During the house arrest period, Mary Boyd Stagg, pastor of the Cosmopolitan Church and others in the congregation, were helping the Filipino guerrillas. Somebody infiltrated their number and the Japanese came suddenly to pick her up. It happened that young Sam Boyd Stagg, Mary's son, was out with his bicycle at the time the Japanese came to pick up his family. He was visiting Paul, who was a good friend. Sam was at our house several blocks from the Church when he heard the news of it. We advised him to go back and be with his family. We felt that if they caught him later and knew who he was, it would be harder on him. He went home, and was picked up with his family. Sometime later the soldiers tortured and beheaded his mother along with several others. But he survived." — Smith, Donald, 2007, ''We Survived War's Crucible'', Bloomington: AuthorHouse, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and imprisoned first at [[Fort Santiago]], then at the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]],&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Santo Tomas|Universidad de Santo Tomas]]: At that time, the oldest university under the American flag, founded 1611; older than Harvard University, founded 1636.&lt;/ref&gt; Manila.

===Mary Ruth Stagg Webb===
Samuel and Mary Stagg's daughter Mary Ruth Stagg married Glenn Watson Webb, had a daughter, Constance Webb Clear (1949-2003), and authored ''Not My Will'', a biography of her mother.

==Later life==
Samuel Stagg worked as a farmer, educator, and writer of the ''Philippines Free Press'' under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' Jungle Philosopher. He was married a second time to Martha, a Filipina with whom he had a child. Stagg died of a heart attack in [[Palawan]] in November 1956.

==Scouting legacy==
Both sons, Lionel Paul Stagg and Samuel Boyd Stagg were active Scouts in Manila. Lionel made Life Scout before leaving to attend college in the United States. Samuel had completed work for [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], but the war interrupted and all his records were lost.

Mary Stagg founded the [[Campfire Girls]] (sister organization of the Boy Scouts of America) in the Philippines. In 1925, the Camp Fire Girls of Manila received the Grace Carley Medal.

'''Sandro Magister''' (born 1943) is an [[Italy|Italian]] journalist who writes for the magazine ''[[L'espresso]]''.

Magister specializes in religious news, in particular on the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. He has written two books on the political history of the Italian episcopate: "''Italian Church: Vatican Politics and Italy 1943-1978''" and "''Extraparliamentary Church: The Triumph of the Pulpit''".

{{essay-like|date=September 2018}}
Some controversies exist over the relationship of '''[[scientific method]]''' to '''[[religion]]'''. For example, some{{who|date=September 2016}} dispute to what degree scientific method had its origins in [[Christian theism]], or to what degree the scientific method as understood in the 21st century is compatible with religion.

In the 18th century, the birth of the scientific method was largely credited{{by whom|date=September 2016}} to the work of [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[John Locke]]. Modern history suggests that much earlier figures such as [[Roger Bacon]] and Islamic scientists also played an important role in shaping the experimental method.{{vague&lt;!-- or better yet, something like "clumsy": my first thot is that juxtaposing "scientific method" and "experimental method" *sounds* like a distinction w/o a difference, while "experimentalISM" says no less and is *at least* less distracting. But maybe a colleague can do better --&gt;|date=May 2018}} [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote "Bacon, Locke and Newton... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Explorer | url = http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |title= Jefferson called Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who had so indelibly shaped his ideas, "my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced" |publisher = Monticello | accessdate= 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these men were Christian{{dubious|reason = Bacon only, no?|date=May 2018}} theists who nonetheless rejected medieval [[Scholasticism]] with its synthesis of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[theology]]. Furthermore, Locke and Newton both espoused [[Unitarianism]]—disbelieving in the divinity of Christ.{{Dubious|I'm hardly a theology expert, but aren't "denying the", and either "Christhood" or "divinity"   "of Jesus"  clearer and less likely to  be offensive and cause for argument? Some{{quantify|date=September 2015}} historians{{which|date=September 2015}} speculate{{original research inline|date=September 2015}} that Francis Bacon dabbled in esoteric beliefs such as Rosicrucianism or Freemasonry. [[Religious views of Isaac Newton|Newton saw God]] as a masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of creation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1925 book ''Science and the Modern World'' [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued strongly for the idea that Christianity gave the modern scientific method a boost. Whitehead also writes: "faith in the possibility of science, generated antecedently to the development of modern scientific theory, is an unconscious derivative from medieval theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Whitehead | first= Alfred North | year= 1925 | title= Science and the Modern World | url = | location= |page=19| publisher= | isbn= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Bertrand Russell]] in his 1931 book ''The Scientific Outlook'' portrayed scientific method and theology as in conflict from the beginning, arguing that science introduced induction and therefore reasoning about the past into Western thought, and that because Galileo "questioned both Aristotle and the Scriptures, [he] thereby destroyed the whole edifice of medieval knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Bertrand |year= 1931 |title= The Scientific Outlook |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-0415249966 |page=19 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar contrast of views appears in more recent publications. Christian apologist [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote in [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles'']] in 1947:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men became scientific because they expected Law in Nature, and they expected Law in Nature because they believed in a Legislator. In most modern scientists this belief has died: it will be interesting to see how long their confidence in uniformity survives it. Two significant developments have already appeared—the hypothesis of a lawless sub-nature, and the surrender of the claim that science is true. We may be living nearer than we suppose to the end of the Scientific Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Clive Staples Lewis |author= Lewis, C.S. |title= Miracles : a preliminary study |publisher= Collins |location= London |pages= 110 |year= 1947 |oclc= 692296780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christian philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] has echoed{{citation needed|date= September 2015}} Whitehead in writing "It is important to see that our notion of the laws of nature, crucial for contemporary science, has this origin in Christian theism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Plantinga |first= Alvin |year= 2011 |title= Where the Conflict Really Lies |location= |publisher= Oxford |oclc= 5105636417 |pages= 276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga has argued that belief in God is a "properly basic belief". Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] argues that scientific inquiry presupposes belief in God—required to explain why the universe is intelligible or lawful.

On the other hand, philosophers such as [[Quentin Smith]] have defended the idea that the intelligibility of the universe does not need God to be explained, a position known{{by whom|date=September 2015}} as [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Quentin Smith |title= The Metaphysical Necessity of Natural Law |journal= Philosophica |volume= 67 |year= 2001 |issue= 1 |pages= 31–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] (largely quoting [[Sidney Hook]]) states that what unites philosophers who call themselves "naturalists" is that they agree that the scientific method is the proper way of fixing beliefs, that it is the ''only'' reliable method of arriving at truth, given its dependence on public verifiability of its finding. The scientific method does not need to presuppose any transcendent reality (sometimes called "skyhooks") to validate itself. It is justified by the expectations set by its known successes. Nielsen says that "metaphysics" can be left to "spirit-seers and other crazies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nielsen |first= Kai |date= |title= Naturalism and Religion |url= |location= |publisher= Prometheus Books |isbn= 9781615927579|pages=145–49 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptic philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has argued in his 2006 book ''Breaking the Spell'' that a full extension of the scientific method to all knowledge leads ultimately to a naturalistic understanding of the [[origins of religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dennett |first= Daniel |year= 2007 |title= Breaking the Spell |url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Books |isbn= 9780143038337 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing Bertrand Russell's dictum "what science cannot discover, mankind cannot know". C. S. Lewis' friend and fellow science-fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] viewed religion as antithetical to the scientific method, because religion consists of premature conclusions concerning the ultimate truth, thus substituting [[faith]] for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McAleer |first= Neil |date= |title= Sir Arthur C. Clarke: Odyssey of a Visionary: The Biography |location= |publisher= RosettaBooks |isbn= 9780984811809 |accessdate= |chapter=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Hook (the philosopher quoted by Nielsen) did not limit knowable truth to what is found in the laboratory. However, he regarded science as providing a general paradigm for all rational inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cotter |first= Matthew |date=2004 |title= Sidney Hook Reconsidered |url= |location= |publisher= Prometheus Books |page=27 |id= {{ISBN|1616140828}} |isbn= 9781616140823 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hook|first= Sidney |date=1995 |title= Letters of Sidney Hook: Democracy, Communism, and the Cold War |url= |location= |publisher= M.E. Sharpe |page=230 |id= {{ISBN|156324487X}} |isbn= 9781563244872 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regarded religion as metaphysical speculation.  Science provided a model of verifiability and "critical intelligence" that was in some ways generalizable to other areas of inquiry, including (up to a point) public-policy issues. However, for Hook, asserting the primacy of scientific method required no foundational metaphysical beliefs, but was justified by its empirical success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sidney-hook/ |title= Sidney Hook  |last1= Sidorsky |first1= David |last2= |first2= |date= May 8, 2008 |website= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= Stanford University |accessdate= 26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,{{When?|date=May 2018}} biologist [[Jerry Coyne]] (1949– ) has emerged as a strong advocate of the view that science and religion cannot be reconciled because they have conflicting methodologies of what constitutes [[evidence]]. He describes religion as the most "venerable superstition", which is honored simply for its power and influence. Coyne has listed three ways that science and religion are not compatible:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://newrepublic.com/article/117071/elaine-ecklund-says-science-religion-are-compatible-why-theyre-not |title= Another Vapid Effort to Claim that Science and Religion Can Get Along  |last= Coyne|first= Jerry|date= March 2014 |website= The New Republic |publisher= |accessdate= April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Only science has a reliable way to settle truth claims.
# Scientific investigation often produces outcomes contrary to religion, and they have different philosophical bases.
# Religion venerates faith as a virtue, while science no longer has the need for God as a hypothesis to explain anything.
Both critics of philosophical naturalism and champions of scientific method often decry positions like this{{vague|date=May 2018}} as "[[scientism]]", a frequent target of C.S. Lewis, especially in his book ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'' (1943), often{{quantify|date=September 2015}} cited by Christian apologists today{{when|date=September 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last= Aeschliman |first= Michael |year= 1983 |title= The Restitution of Man: C.S. Lewis and the Case Against Scientism |url= |location= |publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans |isbn= 9780802819505 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis regards the position of scientism as dehumanizing and [[reductionism|reductionistic]]. Scientism has been similarly criticized by William Lane Craig,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Craig &amp; J.P. Moreland |first= William Lane |date= |title= Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview |url= |location= |publisher= InterVarsity Press|page=357 |isbn= 9780830826940 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Craig |first= William Lane |date= |title= Naturalism: A Critical Analysis |page=13 |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 9780203186138 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who regards it as self-refuting in the sense that the validity of science cannot itself be proven scientifically. Even non-religious [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[H. Allen Orr]] (a frequent critic of [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] writers) has commended [[Stephen Jay Gould]] for opposing the view that "all truths are ultimately scientific". Orr writes "The world is not all science and there are places where science cannot and even should not go. But this lesson has come surprisingly hard to many philosophers and scientists.... Scientism is naive and it is [[hubristic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Orr |first= H. Allen |date= November 1999 |title= Review of Stephen Jay Gould's Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life |url= http://new.bostonreview.net/BR24.5/orr.html |newspaper= Boston Review |location= Boston, MA |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticisms, Daniel Dennett has said that "when someone puts forward a scientific theory that [religious critics] really don't like, they just try to discredit it as 'scientism{{'"}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | first = Sholto | last = Byrnes | title = When it comes to facts, and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town | newspaper = New Statesman | date = 10 April 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while his fellow skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] has embraced the label on the grounds that cosmology and evolutionary theory now answer the questions once posed by theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Michael Shermer |title= The Shamans of Scientism|journal= Scientific American|date= June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also disputed is the extent of the contribution of ancient non-[[Christian civilization]]s (especially medieval Islam) to the growth of scientific method. The oldest natural science is astronomy,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  developed independently by Chinese, Indians, Mayans, Egyptians, Greeks, and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pedersen, Olaf|title= Early Physics and Astronomy: A Historical Introduction |edition=revised |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |isbn=9780521408998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=September 2015}} Science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke has noted that during medieval times, Muslims made great strides in astronomy and algebra while scientific development in the Christian West languished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arthurcclarke.net/?interview=4 |title= Science, God and Delution |last1= Clarke |first1= Arthur C. |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= arthurcclarke.net|accessdate= 19 November 2013}} Reprinted from interview in ''Free Inquiry'' 19(2) 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Briffault]], in ''The Making of Humanity'', asserted that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during this time.&lt;ref name="Robert Briffault 1928 p. 190-202"&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Briffault |year= 1919|title= The Making of Humanity|pages= 190–202|publisher= G. Allen &amp; Unwin |ol= 4465714W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist and priest [[Stanley Jaki]] has argued that the source of the Arab difficulty in getting beyond Aristotle lay in the Islamic worldview, which often saw natural phenomenon as a direct product of the unpredictable will of Allah&lt;ref&gt;Jaki, Science and Creation, pp. 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the belief that nature was alive and divine&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. "George Sarton and the Spanish Arabists", 1985, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "The Study of Astrology" section in {{cite web |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/astr/hd_astr.htm |title= Astronomy and Astrology in the Medieval Islamic World|publisher= The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate= July 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in their pursuit of astrology and adherence to folk traditions. However, other historians have argued that the approach of [[Ibn Al-Haytham]] (Alhazen, c. 965 – c. 1040) to testing and experimentation was a critical contribution to scientific method. [[Robert Briffault]], in ''The Making of Humanity'', asserts that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during the medieval era.&lt;ref name="Robert Briffault 1928 p. 190-202"/&gt; According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen
&lt;blockquote&gt;was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[apertures]] onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.&lt;ref name=Toomer-463-4&gt;{{Harv|Toomer|1964|pp=463–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

G. J. Toomer has expressed skepticism regarding this view, arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's work, and while acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, argued that he should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Toomer|1964|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen viewed all men as prone to error, and only God as not, wherefor
{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[wikt:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It may be simultaneously true both that Christian thinking played an important role in the rise of modern science (given theology's commitment to an intelligible universe—as Alfred Whitehead and Alvin Plantinga have argued), while at the same time Christians have periodically been repelled by the actual findings of science—in part causing{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} the modern [[scientific community]] to abandon whatever Christian roots early modern science had.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}} Studies have shown that in the [[United States of America]] scientists are less likely to believe in God than the rest of the population. Precise statistics vary, but generally about 1/3 of scientists are atheists, 1/3 agnostic, and 1/3 have some belief in God (although some might be [[deistic]], for example).&lt;ref name=east1997&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Science |date= 15 August 1997|volume= 277|issue= 5328|pages= 890–93|title= Scientific Community: Science and God: A Warming Trend?|author= Gregg Easterbrook |doi= 10.1126/science.277.5328.890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

A '''''sha'ir''''' was a [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arab]] poet believed to have magical powers.

==History==
The origin of the term ''sha'ir'' is unknown.&lt;ref name=warner/&gt;  The ancient Arab culture viewed the ''sha'ir'' as a type of [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], able to commune with [[supernatural]] forces, or ''[[djinni]]'', for both knowledge and power.&lt;ref name=warner/&gt;  Members of the tribe treated ''sha'ir'' as [[oracle]]s and [[wisemen]].&lt;ref name=warner/&gt;&lt;ref name=kuiper/&gt;  The poems and songs of the ''sha'ir'' inspired tribe members during war, and were considered powerful weapons.&lt;ref name=warner/&gt; ''Sha'ir'' also served as advisors to rulers.&lt;ref name=qadim/&gt;

==Modern adaptation==
In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy role-playing game]], a type of kit, or variation on a [[character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character class]], called the ''sha'ir'' was created for the ''[[Al-Qadim]]'' [[campaign setting]].  In the game, however, ''sha'ir'' have actual magical powers, and can communicate with [[genie]]s.  In addition to being advisors, ''sha'ir'' can also be found wandering alone in the desert, something the real ''sha'ir'' were not known for.&lt;ref name=qadim/&gt;

The '''''Sibylline Books''''' ({{lang-la|Libri Sibyllini}}) were a collection of [[oracle|oracular]] utterances, set out in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[hexameter]]s, that according to tradition were  purchased from a [[sibyl]] by the last king of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Tarquinius Superbus]], and were consulted at momentous crises through the history of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Only fragments have survived, the rest being lost or [[book burning|deliberately destroyed]].

The ''Sibylline Books'' should not be confused with the so-called ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', twelve books of prophecies thought to be of Judaeo-Christian origin.

==History==
[[image:Erythraeansibylbymichelangelo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Michelangelo]]'s rendering of the [[Erythraean Sibyl]]]]

According to the Roman tradition, the oldest collection of Sibylline books appears to have been made about the time of [[Solon]] and [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] at [[Gergis, Troad|Gergis]] on [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]] in the [[Troad]]; it was attributed to the [[Hellespontine Sibyl]] and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. From Gergis the collection passed to [[Erythrae]], where it became famous as the oracles of the [[Erythraean Sibyl]]. It would appear to have been this very collection that found its way to [[Cumae]] (see the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]) and from Cumae to Rome.

The story of the acquisition of the Sibylline Books by Tarquinius is one of the famous [[legend]]ary elements of Roman history. The [[Cumaean Sibyl]] offered to Tarquinius nine books of these prophecies; and as the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquinius at the same stiff price, which he again refused, whereupon she burned three more and repeated her offer. Tarquinius then relented and purchased the last three at the full original price and had them preserved in a vault beneath the Capitoline temple of Jupiter. The story is alluded to in [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]'s lost books quoted in [[Lactantius]] ''Institutiones Divinae'' (I: 6) and by [[Origen]], and told by [[Aulus Gellius]] (''Noctes Atticae'' 1, 19)&lt;ref&gt; Gell. I 19 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/1*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[Roman Senate]] kept tight control over the Sibylline Books;&lt;ref&gt;Orlin 2002;97.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sibylline Books'' were entrusted to the care of two [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]s; after 367 BC ten custodians were appointed, five patricians and five [[plebeians]], who were called the ''decemviri sacris faciundis''; subsequently (probably in the time of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]) their number was increased to fifteen, the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]''. They were usually ex-consuls or ex-[[praetors]]. They held office for life, and were exempt from all other public duties. They had the responsibility of keeping the books in safety and secrecy. These officials, at the command of the Senate, consulted the ''Sibylline Books'' in order to discover not exact predictions of definite future events in the form of [[prophecy]] but the religious observances necessary to avert extraordinary calamities and to expiate ominous prodigies (comets and earthquakes, showers of stones, plague, and the like). It was only the rites of expiation prescribed by the Sibylline Books, according to the interpretation of the oracle that were communicated to the public, and not the oracles themselves, which left ample opportunity for abuses.

In particular, the keepers of the ''Sibylline Books'' had the superintendence of the worship of [[Apollo]], of the "Great Mother" [[Cybele]] or Magna Mater, and of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], which had been introduced upon recommendations as interpreted from the ''Sibylline Books''. The Sibylline Books motivated the construction of eight temples in ancient Rome, aside from those cults that have been interpreted as mediated by the Sibylline Books simply by the Greek nature of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;See Orlin 2002:97f.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one important effect of the ''Sibylline Books'' was their influence on applying Greek cult practice and Greek conceptions of deities to indigenous Roman religion, which was already indirectly influenced through [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] religion. As the ''Sibylline Books'' had been collected in [[Anatolia]], in the neighborhood of [[Troy]], they recognized the gods and goddesses and the rites observed there and helped introduce them into Roman state worship, a [[syncretism|syncretic]] amalgamation of national deities with the corresponding deities of Greece, and a general modification of the Roman religion.

Since they were written in [[wiktionary:hexameter|hexameter]] verse and in Greek, the college of curators was always assisted by two Greek interpreters. The books were kept in the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] on the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], and, when the temple burned in 83 BC, they were lost. The Roman Senate sent envoys in 76 BC to replace them with a collection of similar oracular sayings, in particular collected from [[Troy|Ilium]], Erythrae, [[Samos]], Sicily, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;"after the burning of the Capitol during the Social War... the verses of the Sibyl, or Sibyls, as the case may be, were collected from Samos, Ilium, and Erythrae, and even in Africa, Sicily, and the Graeco-Italian colonies; the priests being entrusted with the task of sifting out the genuine specimens, so far as should have been possible by human means. " ([[Tacitus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/6A*.html ''Annals'', VI.12].&lt;/ref&gt; This new Sibylline collection was deposited in the restored temple, together with similar sayings of native origin, e.g. those of the Sibyl at [[Tibur]] (the '[[Tiburtine Sibyl]]') of the brothers Marcius, and others, which had been circulating in private hands but which were called in, to be delivered to the Urban Praetor, private ownership of such works being declared illicit,  and to be evaluated by the Quindecimviri, who then sorted them, retaining only those that appeared true to them.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', ''eo. loc''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the Capitol they were transferred by Augustus as ''pontifex maximus'' in 12 BC, to the temple of ''Apollo Patrous'' on the Palatine, after they had been examined and copied; there they remained until about AD 405. According to the poet [[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus]], the general [[Flavius Stilicho]] (died AD 408) burned them, as they were being used to attack his government.

Some genuine Sibylline verses are preserved in the ''Book of Marvels'' or ''Memorabilia'' of [[Phlegon of Tralles]] (2nd century AD). These represent an oracle, or a combination of two oracles, of seventy hexameters in all. They report the birth of an [[androgyny|androgyne]], and prescribe a long list of rituals and offerings to the gods.{{Citation needed|reason=No source claiming authenticity|date=September 2017}}

===Relationship with the "Sibylline Oracles"===
The ''Sibylline Oracles'' were quoted by the Roman-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] (late 1st century) as well as by numerous Christian writers of the second century, including [[Athenagoras of Athens]] who, in a letter addressed to [[Marcus Aurelius]] in ca. AD 176, quoted ''verbatim'' a section of the extant ''Oracles'', in the midst of a lengthy series of other classical and pagan references such as [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], stating several times that all these works should already be familiar to the Roman Emperor.  Copies of the actual ''Sibylline Books'' (as reconstituted in 76 BC) were still in the Roman Temple at this time. The ''Oracles'' are nevertheless thought by modern scholars to be anonymous compilations that assumed their final form in the fifth century, after the ''Sibylline Books'' perished. They are a miscellaneous collection of Jewish and Christian portents of future disasters, that may illustrate the confusions about sibyls that were accumulating among Christians of [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/sib/sib15.htm Terry, 1899].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consultations of the Books cited in history==
An incomplete list of consultations of the ''Sibylline Books'' recorded by historians: &lt;!--these were mostly taken from fr: version of article--&gt;

*399 BC: The books were consulted following a pestilence, resulting in the institution of the ''[[lectisternium]]'' ceremony. ([[Livy]] 5,13)
*348 BC: A plague struck Rome after a brief skirmish with the Gauls and Greeks. Another lectisternium was ordered.  (Livy 7,27)
*345 BC: The books were consulted when a "shower of stones rained down and darkness filled the sky during daylight". Publius Valerius Publicola was appointed dictator to arrange a public holiday for religious observances.  (Livy 7, 28)
*295 BC: They were consulted again following a pestilence, and reports that large numbers of [[Appius Claudius]]' army had been struck by lightning. A Temple was built to Venus near the ''Circus Maximus''. (Livy 10,31)
*293 BC: After yet another plague, the books were consulted, with the prescription being 'that [[Aesculapius]] must be brought to Rome from [[Epidaurus]]'; however, the Senate, being preoccupied with the [[Samnite wars]], took no steps beyond performing one day of public prayers to Aesculapius. (Livy 10,47)
*240/238 BC: The ''[[Religious festival|Ludi Florales]]'', or "Flower Games", were instituted after consulting the books.
*216 BC: When [[Hannibal]] annihilated the Roman Legions at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the books were consulted, and on their recommendation, two Gauls and two Greeks were buried alive in the city's marketplace.
*205-204 BC: During the [[Second Punic War]], upon consultation of the Sibylline Books, an image of [[Cybele]] was transferred from [[Pessinos]] (Pessinous or [[Pergamon]]) to Rome. An embassy was sent to [[Attalus I]] of Pergamon to negotiate the transfer. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica]] and [[Claudia Quinta]] were said to have received the image of [[Cybele]] at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] on her arrival in 204 BC. [[Cybele]]'s image was placed within the [[Temple of Victory]] on the [[Palatine]]. In honour of Cybele a lectisternium was performed and her games, the [[Megalesia]], were held.&lt;ref&gt;For attestations see: Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responsis'' 24-28; Varro ''Lingua Latina'' 6.15; Diodorus Siculus 34.33.1-6; Livy 29.10.4-11.8, 29.14.1-14; [Verrius Flaccus] ''Fasti Praenestini'' April 4; Strabo ''Geography'' 12.5.3; Ovid ''Fasti'' 4.180-372; Valerius Maximus 8.15.3; Pliny ''Natural History'' 7.120; Silius Italicus ''Punica'' 17.1-45; Appian ''The Hannibalic War'' 56; Festus ''De verborum significatu'' S. 51-52 M, P. 237 M; Dio Cassius 17.61; Herodian 1.11.1-5; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' 7.49-50; Lactantius ''Divinae institutiones'' 2.7.12; Julian ''Hymn to the Mother of the Gods (Oration V)'' 159c-161b; Ammianus Marcellinus 22.9.5; Augustine ''De civitate Dei'' 2.5, 10.16. Other minor sources exist but these are the major attestations.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Cybele was moved to the Temple of the [[Magna Mater]] in 191 BC when the temple was dedicated by Marcus Junius Brutus in the consulship of [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica]].&lt;ref&gt;For attestations see: Livy 36.36.3; Tacitus ''Annales'' 4.65; Valerius Maximus 1.8.11.&lt;/ref&gt; A fragment of [[Valerius Antias]] from [[Livy]]'s ''Ab Urbe Condita'' 36.36.4 records that [[Megalesia]] were again held in 191 BC and that "[they] were the first to be held with dramatic performances."&lt;ref&gt;Livy 36.36.3, trans. Sage, E. (Cambridge, MI: Harvard University Press, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;
*143 BC:  Frontinus relates a story in which the Decemvirs consulted the books on another matter and found that a proposed project for the Marcia Aqueduct was improper, along with the Anio.  After a debate in the Senate the project was resumed, presumably the necessity for water outweighed the oracle. Sextus Julius Frontinus, Aqueducts of Rome, Book I, Ch 7.
*63 BC: Believing in a prediction of the books that 'three Cornelii' would dominate Rome, [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]] took part in the conspiracy of [[Catiline]] (Plutarch, ''Life of Cicero'', XVII)
*ca. 55 BC: As Romans deliberated sending a force to restore [[Ptolemy XII]] to the throne of Egypt, lightning struck the statue of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] on the [[Alban Hills|Alban Mount]]; the oracles were consulted, and one was found to read "If the King of Egypt comes to you asking for assistance, refuse him not your friendship, yet do not grant him any army, or else you will have toil and danger". This considerably delayed Ptolemy's return. ([[Dio Cassius]] ''History of Rome'' 39:15)
*44 BC: According to [[Suetonius]], a sibylline prediction that only a king could triumph over [[Parthia]] fueled rumors that [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], leader of the then republic, was aspiring to kingship. (''Caesar'', 79)
*15 AD: When the [[Tiber river]] flooded the lower parts of Rome, one of the priests suggested consulting the books, but Emperor [[Tiberius]] refused, preferring to keep the divine things secret. (Tacitus, ''Annales'' I, 76)
*64 AD: The Emperor [[Nero]] consulted them following the [[Great Fire of Rome]].(Tacitus, ''Annales'' XV, 44)
*271: The books were consulted following the Roman defeat at [[Battle of Placentia (271)|Placentia]] by the [[Alamanni]].
*312: [[Maxentius]] consulted the ''Sibylline Books'' in preparation for combat with [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], who had just taken all of Maxentius' northern Italian cities and was marching on Rome.
*363: [[Julian the Apostate]] consulted the books in preparation for marching against the Sassanids.  The response mailed from Rome "in plain terms warned him not to quit his own territories that year." ([[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''History of Rome'', XXIII 1, 7)
*405: [[Stilicho]] ordered the destruction of the ''Sibylline Books'', possibly because Sibylline prophecies were being used to attack his government in the face of the attack of [[Alaric I]].

'''''The Jewish Chronicle''''' ('''''The JC''''') is a [[London]]-based [[Jewish]] [[weekly newspaper]]. Founded in 1841, it is the oldest continuously published Jewish [[newspaper]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521019133 The Jewish Chronicle and Anglo-Jewry, 1841–1991] Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper is published every Friday (except on days which are [[Jewish holidays]], when it appears earlier in the week) providing news, views, social, cultural and sports reports, as well as editorials and a spectrum of readers' opinions on the letter page.  It is independent and owned by the Kessler Foundation (UK), a charitable trust in the [[United Kingdom]] which has overall control of the newspaper and its assets.

==History==
The Jewish Chronicle first appeared on 12 November 1841. Its first editors were D. Meldola and M. Angel. It was first issued as a weekly until May 1842, when it was suspended. From October 1844 it was resumed as a fortnightly, with Joseph Mitchell as its editor. In 1847 it became again a weekly newspaper. A. Benisch, who became the proprietor and editor in 1855, bequeathed the paper to the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] in 1878, who sold it to its new editor and anti-Zionist Asher I. Myers, Sydney M. Samuel and Israel David.&lt;ref name="encycl"&gt; [https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jewish-chronicle ''Jewish Chronicle''] . Encyclopedia.com, accessed October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 the leaders of the Jewish community in London were being criticised for not campaigning against the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms that were taking place in the Russian Empire]]. Under the leadership of [[Francis Goldsmid|Francis Henry Goldsmid]] the pogroms were missed by the newspaper, and it was only after the feminist [[Louisa Goldsmid]] gave her support following calls to arms by an anonymous writer named "Juriscontalus" and [[Asher Myers]] of ''The Jewish Chronicle'' that action was taken. Public meetings were then held across the country and Jewish and Christian leaders in Britain spoke out against the atrocities.&lt;ref name="Monaco2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. S. Monaco|title=The Rise of Modern Jewish Politics: Extraordinary Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6OiFO2crdgC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-65983-3|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1906, [[Leopold J. Greenberg|L. J. Greenberg]], a successful advertising agent and English Zionist leader, contacted the Dutch banker Jacobus Kann with the idea to buy the Jewish Chronicle for promoting Zionism. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/news-features/how-the-jc-helped-shape-the-debate-1.448157 ''How the JC helped shape the debate'']. David Cesarani, Jewish Chronicle, 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Greenberg, together with David Wolffsohn, Joseph Cowen, Jacobus H. Kahn, and Leopold Kessler, bought the shares. Greenberg himself became its editor.&lt;ref name="encycl" /&gt;

The JC obtained a near monopoly in the Jewish press, taking over its principal competitors, ''The Hebrew Observer'' and ''The Jewish World''. Only in October 1919, the JC got a strong opposing voice by [[The Jewish Guardian]], who counterbalanced the dominant Zionist propaganda of the  Chronicle, until it disappeared in 1931. After Greenberg's death, the same year, the JC remained moderate pro-Zionist under the leadership of Leopold Kessler.&lt;ref name="encycl" /&gt;

The weekly newspaper ''The Jewish World'' was taken over in 1913. It published articles by various Zionist leaders, as well as early non-Jewish pro-Zionists. In 1934, it was merged with the Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-world Jewish World]. JVL, accessed October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; After 1948, the paper maintained a pro-Israel attitude.

==Editorial position==

Particularly  under Leopold Greenberg, the JC was hostile to the Reform and Liberal movements in Britain. Over the years, attention shifted from Orthodoxy in Anglo-Jewry to developments in Progressive Judaism, while increasingly becoming more critical of the Orthodox position on halakhic issues.&lt;ref name="encycl" /&gt;

Under the ownership of Asher Myers and Israel Davis, from 1878, the paper was hostile to Zionism in line with the official positions of the religious and lay leaders of the community. After Leopold Greenberg had taken over the paper in 1906, it became strongly Zionist and it was made into "a firm and influential champion of Zionism".&lt;ref name="Cesarani1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Cesarani|title=The Jewish Chronicle and Anglo-Jewry, 1841–1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tR8ozMMF4MgC&amp;pg=PA130|date=3 March 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43434-8|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JC supported the [[Balfour Declaration]], the publication of which was postponed for a week in order to allow the Chronicle to publish it in time. After the Declaration was issued, however, the paper became critical of [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Greenberg was discontented with the too vague definition of the Zionist goals and wanted him to state clearly that Palestine must be politically Jewish. He wanted to define "National Home" as a Jewish Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Cesarani 1994, p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Although JC's support to Zionism somewhat decreased after Greenberg's death, it consistently devoted considerable space to Israel and Zionism.&lt;ref name="encycl" /&gt;

==Libel lawsuits==
Dr Othman Moqbel, Dr Hussein Nagi and Mr Mohamad Yousef of [[Human Appeal International]] received an apology and substantial damages from ''The Jewish Chronicle'' following articles published in February 2012 in the newspaper and on its website, suggesting that Human Appeal International, a British charity, had been designated as a [[terrorist organisation]] by the [[US government]] and had diverted donations to fund terror and to support the families of [[suicide bomber]]s. An apology was published in the newspaper on 31 May and on its website on 30 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/108080/human-appeal-international-apology |title=Human Appeal International: an apology |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |date= 30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elijah ben Solomon Zalman''',&lt;ref&gt;Within recent decades he has been given the [[surname]] Kremer. However neither the Vilna Gaon nor his descendants apparently used this surname, which means [[shopkeeper]].  It was possibly mistakenly derived from a nickname of his ancestor Rabbi Moshe Kremer. [http://seforim.blogspot.co.il/2014/02/the-vilna-gaon-part-3-review-of-eliyahu.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-he |ר' אליהו בן שלמה זלמן}} ''Rabbi Eliyahu ben Shlomo Zalman'') known as the '''Vilna [[Gaon (Hebrew) |Gaon]]'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt;&lt;ref name= "biu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/yomatz/yani.html | title=The Vilna Gaon and his Vision of Redemption | publisher= [[Bar Ilan University]] | date=April 17, 2010 | accessdate= May 19, 2012 | last = Yaniv | first = Samuel (Rabbi)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-yi |דער װילנער גאון}}, {{lang-pl |Gaon z Wilna}}, {{lang-lt |Vilniaus Gaonas}}) or '''Elijah of Vilna''', or by his Hebrew [[acronym]] '''HaGra''' ("'''H'''a'''G'''aon '''R'''abbenu '''E'''liyahu") or Elijah Ben Solomon ([[Sialiec, Biaroza raion|Sialiec]], April 23, 1720 – Vilnius October 9, 1797), was a [[Talmud]]ist, [[Halakha |halakhist]], [[Kabbalah |kabbalist]], and the foremost leader of [[Misnagdim |misnagdic]] (non-[[Hasidic Judaism|hasidic]]) [[Jewry]] of the past few centuries. He is commonly referred to in Hebrew as ''ha-Gaon he-Chasid mi-Vilna'', "the pious genius from Vilnius".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Threefold step of Academia Europeana: a case of Universitas Vilnensis | year = 2009 | page = 24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his annotations and emendations of Talmudic and other texts he became one of the most familiar and influential names in rabbinic study since the [[Middle Ages]], counted by many among the sages known as the ''[[Acharonim]]'', and ranked by some with the even more revered ''[[Rishonim]]'' of the Middle Ages. Large groups of people, including many ''[[yeshiva]]s'', uphold the set of [[Judaism|Jewish]] customs and rites (''[[minhag]]''), the "''minhag ha-Gra''", which is named for him, and which is also considered by many to be the prevailing [[Ashkenazi]] ''minhag'' in [[Jerusalem]].

Born in Sielec in the [[Brest Litovsk Voivodeship]] (today [[Sialiec, Biaroza raion|Sialiec]], Belarus), the Gaon displayed extraordinary talent while still a child. By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' problems to him for legal rulings. He was a prolific author, writing such works as [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es on the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' known as ''Bi'urei ha-Gra'' ("Elaborations by the Gra"), a running commentary on the [[Mishnah]], ''Shenoth Eliyahu'' ("The Years of Elijah"), and insights on the [[Torah |Pentateuch]] entitled ''Adereth Eliyahu'' ("The Splendor of Elijah"), published by his son.  Various Kabbalistic works have commentaries in his name, and he wrote commentaries on the [[Book of Proverbs |Proverbs]] and other books of the [[Tanakh]] later on in his life.  None of his manuscripts were published in his lifetime.

When [[Hasidic Judaism]] became influential in his native town, the Vilna Gaon joined the "opposers" or ''[[Misnagdim]]'', rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, to curb Hasidic influence. In 1777, one of the first excommunications against the nascent Hasidic movement was launched in Vilna.

He encouraged his students to study natural sciences, and even translated geometry books to Yiddish and Hebrew.

==Youth and education==
Legend has it that by the age of four he had committed the [[Tanakh]] to memory. At the age of seven he was taught [[Talmud]] by [[Moses Margolies|Moses Margalit]], rabbi of [[Kėdainiai]] and the author of a commentary to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], entitled ''Pnei Moshe'' ("The Face of Moses"). The young Eliyahu was said to have already known several of the Talmudic tractates by heart. He is known for having possessed an [[eidetic memory]]. By eight, he was studying [[astronomy]] during his free time. From the age of ten he continued his studies without the aid of a teacher due to his knowledge already surpassing all his teachers, and by the age of eleven he had committed the entire Talmud to memory.

When he reached a more mature age, Elijah decided to go into "exile" and he wandered in various parts of Europe including [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], as was the custom of the pious of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/1797-the-vilna-gaon-dies.premium-1.468827|title=This Day in Jewish History 1797: The Vilna Gaon Dies|last=Green|first=David B.|date=2012-10-09|work=Haaretz|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' problems to him. Scholars, Jewish and non-Jewish, sought his insights into mathematics and astronomy. He returned to his native city in 1748, having by then acquired considerable renown.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Solomon; Seligsohn, M. {{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5673-elijah-ben-solomon|title=ELIJAH BEN SOLOMON (also called Elijah Wilna, Elijah Gaon, and Der Wilner Gaon)|website=Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of study==
The Gaon applied to the [[Talmud]] and rabbinic literature proper philological methods. He made an attempt toward a critical examination of the text; thus, very often with a single reference to a parallel passage, or with a textual emendation, he overthrew tenuous decisions made by his rabbinic predecessors.

He devoted much time to the [[Torah study|study of the Torah]] and [[Hebrew grammar]], and was knowledgeable in the secular sciences, enriching the latter by his original contributions. His pupils and friends had to pursue the same plain and simple methods of study that he followed. He also exhorted them not to neglect the secular sciences, maintaining that [[Judaism]] could only gain by their studying them. The Gaon was also attracted to the study of [[Kabbalah]]; his controversy with [[Hasidic Judaism]] thus stems not from a rejection of mysticism ''per se'', but from a profoundly different understanding of its teachings, in particular regarding its relationship to [[halakha]] and the [[Ashkenazic]] ''[[minhag]]''.

The Vilna Gaon was modest; he declined to accept the office of rabbi, though it was often offered to him on the most flattering terms. In his later years he also refused to give [[Imprimatur|approbations]], though this was the privilege of great rabbis; he thought too humbly of himself to assume such authority. He led a retiring life, only lecturing from time to time to a few chosen pupils.

In 1755, when the Gaon was thirty-five, Rabbi [[Jonathan Eybeschütz]], then sixty-five years old, applied to him for an examination of and decision concerning his [[amulet]]s, which were a subject of discord between himself and Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]]. The Vilna Gaon, in a letter to Eybeschütz, stated his support of Eybeschutz but that he did not believe that words coming from a stranger like himself, who had not even the advantage of old age, would be of any weight with the contending parties. Already at that age, however, the Gaon was considered the greatest of the generation, despite the many older Torah luminaries alive at the time.

==Antagonism to Hasidism==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] --&gt;
[[Image:Gaon-V.jpg|thumb|229px|right|Vilna Gaon (Zalkind, Ber)]]
When [[Hasidic Judaism]] became influential in [[Vilna]], the Vilna Gaon, joining the rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, took steps to check the Hasidic influence. In 1777 one of the first excommunications by the ''[[Misnagdim]]'' was launched in Vilna against the Hasidim, while a letter was also addressed to all of the large communities, exhorting them to deal with the Hasidim following the example of Vilna, and to watch them until they had recanted. The letter was acted upon by several communities; and in [[Brody]], during the trade fair, the ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (ban of excommunication) was pronounced against the Hasidim.

In 1781, when the Hasidim renewed their proselytizing work under the leadership of their Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (the "Ba'al Ha'tanya"), the Gaon excommunicated them again, declaring them to be heretics with whom no pious [[Jew]] might intermarry. However, the excommunications did not stop the tide of Hasidism.

==Other work==
Except for the conflict with the Hasidim, the Vilna Gaon almost never took part in public affairs and, so far as is known, did not preside over any school in [[Vilna]]. He was satisfied with lecturing in his ''[[bet ha-midrash]]'' to a few chosen pupils, whom he initiated into his methods. He taught them [[Hebrew grammar]], [[Hebrew Bible]], and [[Mishna]], subjects that were largely neglected by the [[Talmud]]ists of that time. He was especially anxious to introduce them to the study of [[midrash]] literature, and the [[Minor Treatises]] of the Talmud, which were very little known by the scholars of his time.

He laid special stress on the study of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], which had been almost entirely neglected for centuries. As the [[Mishnah|Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Peah]]'' ([[s:Translation:Mishnah/Seder Zeraim/Tractate Peah/Chapter 1|1]]:[[s:Translation:Mishnah/Seder Zeraim/Tractate Peah/Chapter 1/1|1]]) states: "The [[Torah study|study of Torah]] is equal to all of the mitzvos", and being convinced that the study of the Torah is the very life of Judaism, and that this study must be conducted in a scientific and not in a merely scholastic manner, the Gaon encouraged his chief pupil, Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin|Chaim]] of [[Volozhin]], to found a ''[[yeshiva]]'' (rabbinic academy) in which rabbinic literature should be taught. Rabbi Chaim Volozhin opened the [[Volozhin yeshiva]] in 1803, a few years after the Gaon's death, and revolutionized Torah study, with resulting impact on all of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewry]].

==Asceticism==
[[Image:Vilna Gaon portrait.gif|right|framed|Elijah Ben Solomon, the ''Vilna Gaon'']]
The Vilna Gaon led an [[ascetic]] life. He interpreted literally the words of the Jewish sages, that the [[Torah]] can be acquired only by abandoning all pleasures and by cheerfully accepting suffering. He was revered by his countrymen as a saint due to his ascetic practices, being called by some of his contemporaries "the ''Hasid''". While he was an opponent to the [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] movement, the term itself means "pious person" and is used here without reference to the movement.

The Gaon once started on a trip to the [[Land of Israel]], but for unknown reasons did not get beyond [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]]. (In the early nineteenth century, three groups of his students, known as [[Perushim]], did manage the trip, settling mostly in [[Safed]] and [[Jerusalem]]). While at [[Königsberg]] he wrote to his family a famous letter that was published under the title ''Alim li-Terufah,'' [[Minsk]], 1836.

==Works==
The Vilna Gaon was a copious annotator; there is hardly an ancient Hebrew book of any importance to which he did not provide marginal glosses and notes, or write a brief commentary, which were mostly dictated to his pupils. (Many maintain that it was his disciples who recorded his comments, if not his editorial notes.) However, nothing of his was published in his lifetime. The "Gra" was very precise in the wording of his commentaries, because he maintained that he was obligated by Torah Law that only the "''[[Tanakh|Torah shebichtav]]''" (the written law) is permitted to be written down - the rest of "''[[Oral Torah|Torah sheb'al peh]]''" (oral law) cannot be, unless circumstances require. (This further supports the view that it was his disciples who wrote his comments.) So the Vilna Gaon abided by this view of law by reducing his extensive explanations that are largely inscrutable to any but advanced talmudists. Glosses on the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' are known as ''Bi'urei ha-Gra'' ("Elaborations by the Gra"). His running commentary on the [[Mishnah]] is titled ''Shenoth Eliyahu'' ("The Years of Elijah"). Various [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] works have commentaries in his name. His insights on the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] are titled ''Adereth Eliyahu'' ("The Splendor of Elijah"). Commentaries on the [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and other books of the [[Tanakh]] were written later on in his life.

He also wrote on mathematics, being well versed in the works of [[Euclid]] and encouraging his pupil Rabbi {{Interlanguage link multi|Baruch of Shklov|he|3=ברוך משקלוב|lt=Baruch}} of [[Shklov]] to translate the great mathematician's works into [[Hebrew]]. A mathematical work titled ''Ayil Meshulash'' ("A Ram in Three Parts", a reference to Abraham's "Covenant Between the Parts" in Genesis 15:9) is generally attributed to him.

==Influence==
[[Image:Vilnius Synagogue.jpg|thumb|The Vilna Gaon monument at the site of the [[Great Synagogue of Vilna]]]]
[[File:Vilna Gaon synagogue.JPG|thumb|The Vilna Gaon synagogue in [[Sha'arei Hesed]], [[Jerusalem]]]]
He was one of the most influential rabbinic authorities since the [[Middle Ages]], and—although he is properly an [[Acharonim|Acharon]]—he is held by many authorities after him as belonging to the [[Rishonim]] (rabbinic authorities of the Middle Ages).

His main student Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]], founded the first [[yeshiva]] in his home town of [[Volozhin]], [[Belarus]]. The results of this move is claimed to have revolutionized [[Torah study]], by departing from the centuries of 'informal' study. Youth and scholars would congregate in local synagogues and study freely, although it was customary to migrate to towns possessing great scholars as the local rabbi. The Volozhin Yeshivah created a formal structure of study, by providing qualified faculty, meals, and accommodation. The results of this process are currently the norm in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewry]].

Somewhat ironically, viewed from a traditional light, the leaders of the [[Haskalah]] movement used the study methods of the Vilna Gaon to gain adherents to their movement. Maskilim valued and adapted his emphasis on [[peshat]] over [[pilpul]], his engagement with and mastery of Hebrew grammar and Bible, and his interest in textual criticism of rabbinic texts, further developing the philosophy of their movement.

As for the Vilna Gaon's own community, in accordance with the Vilna Gaon's wishes, three groups of his disciples and their families, numbering over 500, made [[aliyah]] to the [[Eretz Yisrael|Land of Israel]] between 1808 and 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, Arie.''[[Hastening Redemption]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This immigration was one of the first modern Jewish migrations to Palestine, although Hasidic immigration was already active in the 1780s (even by the [[Rebbe (Hasidism)|rebbes]] themselves, such as the elderly [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]]). The disciples of the Vilna Gaon, known as ''[[Perushim]]'' due to how they isolated themselves from worldly concerns to study Torah, originally settled in [[Safed]] because the Muslim authorities in Jerusalem prevented Ashkenazi Jews from settling there. However, after numerous devastating calamities in the region, including plague and earthquake, most of the disciples moved to Jerusalem. Their arrival in Jerusalem, which for over 100 years had been mainly [[Sephardi]], revived the presence of [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry in Jerusalem, and resulted in a dominance of the customs of the Vilna Gaon.

The impact of the Perushim is still apparent today in the religious practices of the Israeli Jewish community, even among non-Ashkenazim. For example, the institution of the priestly blessing by the Kohanim known as ''[[duchaning]]'' during the weekdays (rather than only during festivals, as practiced in the Diaspora), and the accepted time for the onset of [[Shabbat]] in Jerusalem and other cities can both be traced to the custom of the Vilna Gaon.  However, the teachings and traditions of the Vilna Gaon have been passed down most directly to the [[Litvaks]] in Israel.  The Perushim also set up several [[Kollel]]s, founded the Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Mea Shearim]], and were instrumental in rebuilding the Yehudah HeChassid Synagogue (also known as the [[Hurba Synagogue]], or "The Ruins"), which had lain in ruins for 140 years. 

There is a statue of the Vilna Gaon and a street named after him in Vilnius, the place of both his birth and his death. His brother Avraham authored the revered work, "Maalos Hatorah". His son [[Abraham ben Elijah of Vilna|Abraham]] was also a scholar of note.

==Death==
The Vilna Gaon died in 1797, aged 77, and was subsequently buried in the Šnipiškės cemetery in Vilnius, now in [[Žirmūnai elderate]]. The cemetery was closed by the Tsarist Russian authorities in 1831 and partly built over.

In the 1950s, Soviet authorities planned to build a stadium and concert hall on the site. They allowed the remains of the Vilna Gaon to be removed and re-interred at the new cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
