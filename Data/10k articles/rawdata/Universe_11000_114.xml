      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[topology]], an '''ambient isotopy''', also called an ''h-isotopy'', is a kind of continuous distortion of an [[ambient space]], for example a [[manifold]], taking a [[submanifold]] to another submanifold. For example in [[knot theory]], one considers two [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy.  More precisely, let ''N'' and ''M'' be manifolds and ''g'' and ''h'' be [[embedding]]s of ''N'' in ''M''.  A [[continuous map]] 
:&lt;math&gt;F:M \times [0,1] \rightarrow M &lt;/math&gt; 
is defined to be an ambient isotopy taking ''g'' to ''h'' if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity function|identity map]], each map ''F&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[homeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g'' = ''h''. This implies that the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] must be preserved by ambient isotopies. For example, two knots which are [[mirror image]]s of each other are in general not equivalent.

The '''Association of Registered Gas Installers''' (ARGI) is a free web-based association.  Registration (membership) is open to gas installers who are already registered with [[Gas Safe Register]]. It was formed in 2004 to enable Registered Gas Installers to communicate effectively with each other, discuss matters affecting the industry and to make representations on their behalf, none of which was possible through CORGI (the register holder at that time)itself.

== Background ==
In recent years, there has been controversy over some aspects of the expanding role of CORGI. Some gas installers feel the organization is overbearing and an excessive financial burden, and that little is being done to stop unregistered installers operating. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} ARGI formed mainly as a consequence of this.

Registration (free web membership)[full membership is NOT free), with ARGI is increasing rapidly{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Membership figures are not published. In total there are around 55,000 CORGI registered businesses in the UK employing nearly 110,000 gas operatives, so there remains scope for the expansion of ARGI.

During 2006 ARGI gained credibility and was invited by CORGI to join the CORGI Principal Representative Body (formerly the CORGI Council) and was represented during the latest Fundamental Review of Gas Safety conducted by the HSE.
Many in the Industry have never had contact Argi until this time, though its name is put on lists of attendees by those wishing to be seen.

The committee members are elected. There are regular meetings held and full members may vote on the resolutions. There is a published mission statement, [[articles of association]], statement of association policies, [[code of conduct]].  Argi aims to benefit the gas industry and the public.

==ARGI and CORGI - the issues==

===The real danger of CO poisoning===

Notwithstanding [[gas explosion]]s, the greatest danger to the public from gas is [[Carbon Monoxide]] (CO), which is a toxic byproduct of the combustion process, in increased volume if combustion is incomplete. Most of the concern for gas safety focuses on safe CO dispersal through ventilation and flue systems, and prevention of incomplete combustion by regular service and maintenance of heat producing appliances, especially open-flued appliances. Modern gas appliances, especially those with fan assisted flues, are safer in this respect and the number of fatalities from CO poisoning has greatly declined.

Around 30 people a year die from CO poisoning, though not all of these involve gas-fired appliances. Compare this to over 3,000 killed each year by motor vehicles and 30,000 extra winter deaths each year due partly to lack of affordable heating. Lord Hunt, at the recent Parliamentary Review, raised the issue of "proportionality," and "not the only problem in the world."

However those who survive CO poisoning may experience brain damage, organ failure, loss of memory, blindness, induced epilepsy, peripheral palsy, personality change, and loss of mobility.  They may also encounter skepticism from [[medical practitioners]], who may believe their symptoms are psychosomatic. One victim had arm surgery to relieve a trapped nerve, but the neurosurgeon found none.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Dealing with unregistered installers===
Registered installers must spend time and money on training and assessments to maintain their level of competence and CORGI registration. This adds substantially to overhead and charges to the public reflect that.

However, there are many unregistered installers who do not carry these overheads, and who typically offer cheaper service. Consequently, ARGI views the RGIs increasing overheads as increasing the price differential and therefore a boost to the unregistered installer with whom they must compete.

One often proposed means of tackling this is to allow gas appliances sales only through RGIs. The identified RGI would be responsible for installation (or disposal/resale). However, the Government appears unwilling to pursue this strategy.

In a public poll, consumers felt the denial of right to purchase your own cooker or other appliance represented too much state interference.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} As it is not illegal, per se, to install your own appliance in your own home as long as you are competent to do so, the denial of right to buy the appliance is an infringement of personal liberty.

The '''banana industry''' is an important part of the global [[agroindustry|industrial]] [[agrobusiness]].
Most bananas go into [[export]] and [[international trade]] for consumption in [[Western countries]]. They are grown on [[banana plantation]]s primarily in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] as well as [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

==Ecological impact==
{{further|Environmental impact of agriculture|Dirty dozen (Stockholm Convention)}}
As is the case with all [[monoculture]]s, the intensive [[agroindustrial]] methods - bananas require large amounts of [[pesticides]] (estimate: {{convert|35|lb}} / {{convert|1|acre}}) - for banana production have considerable environmental impact up to [[ecosystem destruction]] through [[deforestation]]. Moreover, global [[transport]] and [[plastic]] [[packaging]] leaves a large [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2012|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/the-human-and-environmental-impact-of-bananas/|title=The Human and Environmental Impact of Bananas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://business-ethics.com/2010/06/19/2440-banana-industrys-impact-on-rainforests/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.plu.edu/~bananas/environmental/home.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618073831/http://community.plu.edu/~bananas/environmental/home.html |archivedate=2015-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2014|title=Banana Cultivation Is Pesticide-Intensive|author=Sonya Lunder|publisher=ewg.org|url=http://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/04/bananas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cash crop==
In 2012 the volume of global gross banana exports reached a record high of [[orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|{{convert|16.5|e6MT|lb}}]], 1.1 million tonnes (or 7.3 percent) above 2011 level.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FAO Intergovernmental Group on Bananas and Tropical Fruits|title=BANANA MARKET REVIEW and BANANA STATISTICS 2012-2013|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3627e/i3627e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bananas are the most popular [[fruit]] in the United States, with more consumed annually than apples and oranges combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Chiquita|year=2014|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Bananas. |url=http://www.chiquitabananas.com/Worlds-Favorite-Fruit/banana-answers-information-faqs.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of the multitude of banana species across the world, even only taking into account the [[List of banana cultivars|cultivated ones]], industrial production is dominated by the [[Cavendish banana]].

{{further|List of banana cultivars}}

==Spread of plant disease==
[[Tropical Race 4]] is thought to be distributed globally by soil-contaminated equipment from the [[multinational corporation|multinational]] plantantion owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/164029/tropical-race-4-global-banana-industry-is-killing-the-worlds-favorite-fruit/|publisher=Quartz|title=Tally me banana - How the global banana industry is killing the world’s favorite fruit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|List of banana and plantain diseases}}

==Companies==
In 2013, five [[multinational corporation|multinational]] fruit companies alone controlled 44% of the international banana trade:&lt;ref name=bananalink&gt;http://www.bananalink.org.uk/the-problem-with-bananas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Changing Role of Multinational Companies in the Global Banana Trade|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3746e/i3746e.pdf|publisher=FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market share of the above players decreased from 70% in 2002 to about 44% in 2013. This decline in market power has been attributed to a couple of reasons. In the past, multinational companies owned a large number of plantations in Central and South America and other banana-producing regions. Since the 1980s they have divested a large share of their own production, replacing it with greater purchases from independent producers. For example, Chiquita has decreased the number of its plantations in Central America. Fyffes used to own plantations in Jamaica, Belize and the Windward Islands, but withdrew from production and switched to purchasing its bananas through contracts with producers.The disengagement from production was partly caused by legal and economic problems at the plantation level, but also reflects the change in market power along the banana value chain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3746e/i3746e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the global banana [[supply chain]] major supermarket chains in the US and EU have gained [[market power]] over the big producers in the 21st century as they dominate the retail market and increasingly purchase from smaller wholesalers or directly from growers.

In 2016, world production of bananas and plantains was 148 million tonnes, led by [[India]] and [[China]] with a combined total (only for bananas) of 28% of global production (table). Other major producers were the [[Philippines]], [[Ecuador]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Brazil]], together accounting for 20% of the world total of bananas and plantains (table). 

As reported for 2013, total world exports were 20 million tonnes of bananas and 859,000 tonnes of plantains.&lt;ref name="faostat13exp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TP |title= Banana and plantain exports in 2013, Crops and livestock products/Regions/World list/Export quantity (pick lists)|date=2017|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecuador and the Philippines were the leading exporters with 5.4 and 3.3 million tonnes, respectively, and the [[Dominican Republic]] was the leading exporter of plantains with 210,350 tonnes.&lt;ref name=faostat13exp/&gt;

First demonstrated by Prof Edwin Henry Barton [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (1858&amp;ndash;1925), Professor of Physics at [[University College, Nottingham]], who had a particular interest in the movement and behavior of spherical bodies, the '''Barton's pendulums''' experiment demonstrates the physical phenomenon of [[resonance]] and the response of [[pendulum]]s to vibration at, below and above their resonant frequencies. In its simplest construction, approximately 10 different pendulums are hung from one common string. This system vibrates at the resonance frequency of a driver pendulum, causing the target pendulum to swing with the maximum [[amplitude]]. The other pendulums to the side do not move as well, thus demonstrating how torquing a pendulum at its resonance frequency is most efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/OscillationsWaves/BartonsPendulum/BartonsPendulum.html|title= Harvard Natural Sciences Lecture Demonstrations: Coupled Oscillations and Resonance: Barton's Pendulum|accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/lecdem/services/demos/demosg2/g2-12.htm |title=G2-12: BARTON'S PENDULUMS |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204062124/http://www.physics.umd.edu/lecdem/services/demos/demosg2/g2-12.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driver may be a very heavy pendulum also attached to this common string; the driver is set to swing and move the whole system.

'''[[People's Republic of China|China]]''' has set the goal of attaining one percent of its [[renewable energy]] generation through '''[[bioenergy]]''' in 2020.

The development of bioenergy in China is needed to meet the rising energy demand.{{whom|date=January 2014}}

Several institutions are involved in this development, most notably the [[Asian Development Bank]] and [[China's Ministry of Agriculture]]. There is also an added incentive to develop the bioenergy sector which is to increase the development of the rural agricultural sector. 

As of 2005, bioenergy use has reached more than 20 million households in the rural areas, with [[methane gas]] as the main biofuel. Also more than 4000 bioenergy facilities produce 8 billion cubic metres every year of methane gas. By 2006 20% of "gasoline" consumed was actually a 10% ethanol-gasoline blend.&lt;small&gt; ('''[http://english.people.com.cn/200611/13/eng20061113_321020.html People's Daily Online]''') &lt;/small&gt; As of 2010, electricity generation by bioenergy is expected to reach 5 GW, and 30 GW by 2020. The annual use of methane gas is expected to be 19 cubic kilometers by 2010, and 40 cubic kilometers by 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25712">In [[structural engineering]], the '''Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis''' is used to describe non-linear [[Hysteresis|hysteretic]] systems. It was introduced by Robert Bouc&lt;ref name="Bouc67"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Bouc |year=1967 |title=Forced vibration of mechanical systems with hysteresis |booktitle=Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Nonlinear Oscillation |location=Prague, Czechoslovakia |pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouc71"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=Bouc |year=1971 |title=Modèle mathématique d'hystérésis:  application aux systèmes à un degré de liberté |journal=Acustica  |volume=24 |pages=16&amp;ndash;25 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended by Yi-Kwei Wen,&lt;ref name="Wen76"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y. K. |last1=Wen |year=1976  |title=Method for random vibration of hysteretic systems |journal=Journal of Engineering  Mechanics |publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] |volume=102 |number=2 |pages=249&amp;ndash;263}}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns.
This model is able to capture, in analytical form, a range of hysteretic cycle shapes matching the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems. Due to its versatility and mathematical tractability, the Bouc–Wen model has gained popularity. It has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and torsional response of hysteretic systems, two- and three-dimensional continua, [[soil liquefaction]] and [[base isolation]] systems. The Bouc–Wen model, its variants and extensions have been used in structural control—in particular, in the modeling of behaviour of magneto-rheological dampers, base-isolation devices for buildings and other kinds of [[Shock absorber#Structures|damping devices]]. It has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of [[reinforced concrete]], [[steel]], [[masonry]], and timber.

==Model formulation==

Consider the equation of motion of a single-degree-of-freedom (sdof) system:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; m\ddot{u}(t) + c\dot{u}(t) + F(t) = f(t)  &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

here, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m&lt;/math&gt; represents the mass, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle c&lt;/math&gt; the linear viscous damping coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle F(t)&lt;/math&gt; the restoring force and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(t)&lt;/math&gt; the excitation force while the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to time.

According to the Bouc–Wen model, the restoring force is expressed as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; F(t) = a k_i u(t) + (1-a) k_i z(t)  &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a:=\frac{k_f}{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of post-yield &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k_f&lt;/math&gt; to pre-yield (elastic) &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k_i:=\frac{F_y}{u_y}&lt;/math&gt; stiffness, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle F_y&lt;/math&gt; is the yield force, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle u_y&lt;/math&gt; the yield displacement, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle z(t)&lt;/math&gt; a non-observable hysteretic parameter (usually called the ''hysteretic displacement'') that obeys the following nonlinear differential equation with zero initial condition (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle z(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;), and that has dimensions of length:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \dot{z}(t) = A\dot{u}(t) - \beta|\dot{u}(t)||z(t)|^{n-1} z(t) - \gamma\dot{u}(t)|z(t)|^n  &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}

or simply as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \dot{z}(t) = \dot{u}(t) \left\{A - \left[\beta\operatorname{sign}(z(t)\dot{u}(t)) + \gamma \right]|z(t)|^n \right\} &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.4}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \operatorname{sign}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Signum function|signum]] function, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; are dimensionless quantities controlling the behaviour of the model (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle n=\infty&lt;/math&gt; retrieves the elastoplastic hysteresis). Take into account that in the original paper of Wen (1976),&lt;ref name="Wen76"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt;. Nowadays the notation varies from paper to paper and very often the places of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt; are exchanged. Here the notation used by Ref.&lt;ref name="Song06"&gt;Song J. and Der Kiureghian A. (2006) Generalized Bouc–Wen model for highly asymmetric hysteresis. Journal of Engineering Mechanics. ASCE. Vol 132, No. 6 pp. 610-618&lt;/ref&gt; is implemented. The restoring force &lt;math&gt;\textstyle F(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be decomposed into an elastic and a hysteretic part as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; F^{el}(t) = a k_i u(t) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.5}}}}

and

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; F^{h}(t) = (1-a) k_i z(t) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.6}}}}

therefore, the restoring force can be visualized as two springs connected in parallel.

For small values of the positive exponential parameter &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; the transition from elastic to the post-elastic branch is smooth, while for large values that transition is abrupt. Parameters &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt; control the size and shape of the hysteretic loop. It has been found&lt;ref name="MaZhang04"&gt;Ma F., Zhang H., Bockstedte A., Foliente G.C. and  Paevere P. (2004). Parameter analysis of the differential model of hysteresis. Journal of applied mechanics ASME, 71, pp. 342–349&lt;/ref&gt; that the parameters of the Bouc–Wen model are functionally redundant. Removing this redundancy is best achieved by setting &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Wen&lt;ref name="Wen76"/&gt; assumed integer values for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;; however, all real positive values of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; are admissible. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; is positive by assumption, while the admissible values for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma\in[-\beta,\beta]&lt;/math&gt;, can be derived from a thermodynamical analysis (Baber and Wen (1981)&lt;ref name="BaberWen81"&gt;Baber T.T. and Wen Y.K. (1981). Random vibrations of hysteretic degrading systems. Journal of Engineering Mechanics. ASCE. 107(EM6), pp. 1069–1089&lt;/ref&gt;).

=={{anchor|Softening, hardening, pinching, strength degradation and stiffness degradation}}Definitions==

Some terms are defined below: 
* '''Softening''': Slope of hysteresis loop ''decreases'' with displacement
* '''Hardening''': Slope of hysteresis loop ''increases'' with displacement
* '''Pinched hysteresis loops''': Thinner loops in the middle than at the ends. Pinching is a sudden loss of stiffness, primarily caused by damage and interaction of structural components under a large deformation. It is caused by closing (or unclosed) cracks and yielding of compression reinforcement before closing the cracks in reinforced concrete members, slipping at bolted joints (in steel construction) and loosening and slipping of the joints caused by previous cyclic loadings in timber structures with dowel-type fasteners (e.g. nails and bolts).
* '''Stiffness degradation''': Progressive loss of stiffness in each loading cycle
* '''Strength degradation''': Degradation of strength when cyclically loaded to the same displacement level. The term "strength degradation" is somewhat misleading, since strength degradation can only be modeled if displacement is the input function.

=={{anchor|The absorved hysteretic energy}}Absorbed hysteretic energy==

Absorbed hysteretic energy represents the energy dissipated by the hysteretic system, and is quantified as the area of the hysteretic force under total displacement; therefore, the absorbed hysteretic energy (per unit of [[Matter|mass]]) can be quantified as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon(t) = \int_{u(0)}^{u(t)} \frac{F^{h}(u)}{m} \mathrm{d} u = (1-a)\frac{k_i}{m} \int_0^t z(\tau) \dot{u}(\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.7}}}}

that is,

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon(t) = (1-a) \omega^2 \int_0^t z(\tau) \dot{u}(\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.8}}}}

here &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \omega^2 := \frac{k_i}{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the squared pseudo-natural frequency of the non-linear system; the units of this energy are &lt;math&gt;\textstyle J/kg&lt;/math&gt;.

Energy dissipation is a good measure of cumulative damage under stress reversals; it mirrors the loading history, and parallels the process of damage evolution. In the Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model, this energy is used to quantify system degradation.

Modeling general hysteresis behaviour and random vibration applications. Journal of Vibration, Acoustics, Stress, and Reliability in Design. 108 (4) pp. 411–420&lt;/ref&gt;

This modification included strength, stiffness and pinching degradation effects, by means of suitable degradation functions:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;  \dot{z}(t) = \frac{h(z(t))}{\eta(\varepsilon)} \dot{u}(t) \left\{A(\varepsilon) - \nu(\varepsilon)\left[\beta\operatorname{sign}(\dot{u}(t))|z(t)|^{n-1} z(t) + \gamma |z(t)|^n \right] \right\}   &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.9}}}}

where the parameters &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \nu(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \eta(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(z)&lt;/math&gt; are associated (respectively) with the strength, stiffness and pinching degradation effects. The &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \nu(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \eta(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; are defined as linearly-increasing functions of absorbed hysteretic energy &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \nu(\varepsilon) = \nu_0 + \delta_\nu \varepsilon(t) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.10a}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; A(\varepsilon) = A_0 - \delta_A \varepsilon(t) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.10b}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \eta(\varepsilon) = \eta_0 + \delta_\eta \varepsilon(t) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.10c}}}}

The pinching function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(z)&lt;/math&gt; is specified as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; h(z) = 1 - \varsigma_1(\varepsilon) \exp\left(-\frac{\left(z(t) \operatorname{sign}(\dot{u}) - q z_u \right)^2}{(\varsigma_2(\varepsilon))^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.11}}}}

where:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \varsigma_1(\varepsilon) := (1 - \exp(-p \varepsilon(t))) \varsigma &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.12a}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \varsigma_2(\varepsilon) := \left(\psi_0+\delta_\psi \varepsilon(t)\right)\left(\lambda + \varsigma_1(\varepsilon)\right) &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.12b}}}}

and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle z_u&lt;/math&gt; is the ultimate value of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle z&lt;/math&gt;, given by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; z_u = \sqrt[n]{\frac{1}{\nu(\beta+\gamma)}} &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.13}}}}

Observe that the new parameters included in the model are: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta_\nu&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta_A&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta_\eta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \nu_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \eta_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \psi_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta_\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \varsigma&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta_\nu = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta_\eta = 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(z)=1&lt;/math&gt; no strength degradation, stiffness degradation or pinching effect is included in the model.

An example of a slack system is a wood structure where displacement occurs with stiffness seemingly null, as the bolt of the structure is pressed into the wood.

==={{anchor|Two-degree-of freedom generalization}}Two-degree-of-freedom generalization===

A two-degree-of-freedom generalization was defined by Park ''et al.'' (1986)&lt;ref name="Park86"&gt;Park Y.J., Ang A.H.S. and Wen Y.K. (1986). Random vibration of hysteretic systems under bi-directional ground motions. ''Earthquake Engineering Structural Dynamics'', 14, 543–557&lt;/ref&gt; to represent the behaviour of a system constituted of a single mass &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m&lt;/math&gt; subject to an excitation acting in two [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] (perpendicular) directions. For instance, this model is suited to reproduce the geometrically-linear, uncoupled behaviour of a biaxially-loaded, [[reinforced concrete column]].

Wang and Wen (2000)&lt;ref name="WaWe00"&gt;Wang C.H. and Wen Y.K. (2000). Evaluation of pre-Northridge low-rise steel buildings I: Modeling. ''Journal of Structural Engineering'' 126:1160–1168. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:10(1160)&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to extend the model of Park ''et al.'' (1986)&lt;ref name="Park86" /&gt; to include cases with varying 'knee' sharpness (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n\neq 2&lt;/math&gt;). However, in so doing, the proposed model was no longer rotationally invariant (isotropic). Harvey and Gavin (2014)&lt;ref name="HaGa14"&gt;Harvey P.S. Jr. and Gavin H.P. (2014). Truly isotropic biaxial hysteresis with arbitrary knee sharpness. ''Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics'' 43, 2051–2057. doi:[http://doi.org/10.1002/eqe.2436 10.1002/eqe.2436]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an alternative generalization of the Park-Wen model&lt;ref name="Park86" /&gt; that retained the isotropy and still allowed for &lt;math&gt;n\neq 2&lt;/math&gt;, viz.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \dot z_x  = A \dot u_x- z_x\left( \beta|\dot u_xz_x| + \gamma  \dot u_xz_x +\beta |\dot u_y z_y|+ \gamma \dot u_y z_y \right) \times \left( z_x^2 + z_y^2 \right)^{\tfrac{n-2}2}&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.14a}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \dot z_y  = A\dot u_y- z_y\left(\beta|\dot u_xz_x| + \gamma  \dot u_xz_x +\beta |\dot u_y z_y| + \gamma \dot u_y z_y \right) \times \left({z_x^2 + z_y^2}\right)^{\tfrac{2-2}2} &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.14b}}}}

===Wang and Wen modification===

Wang and Wen (1998)&lt;ref name="Wang98"&gt;Wang C.H. and  Wen Y.K. (1998)  Reliability and redundancy of pre-Northridge low-rise steel building under seismic action. Rep No. UILU-ENG-99-2002, Univ. Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the following expression to account for the asymmetric peak [[restoring force]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \dot{z}(t) = \dot{u}(t) \left\{A - \left[\gamma+\beta\operatorname{sign}(z(t)\dot{u}(t)) + \phi(\operatorname{sign}(\dot{u}(t))+\operatorname{sign}(z(t))) \right]|z(t)|^n \right\} &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.15}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \phi&lt;/math&gt; is an additional parameter, to be determined.

===Asymmetrical hysteresis===

Asymmetric hysteretical curves appear due to the asymmetry of the mechanical properties of the tested element, of the imposed cycle motion, or of both. Song and Der Kiureghian (2006)&lt;ref name="Song06"/&gt; proposed the following function for modelling those asymmetric curves:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \dot{z}(t) = \dot{u}(t) \left\{A - \left[
C_1(\dot{u}(t),u(t),z(t),\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3) 
+
C_2(\dot{u}(t),u(t),z(t),\beta_4,\beta_5,\beta_6)
\right]|z(t)|^n \right\} &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.16}}}}

where:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_1(\dot{u}(t),u(t),z(t),\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3) = \beta_1 \operatorname{sign}(\dot{u}(t)z(t)) + \beta_2 \operatorname{sign}(u(t)\dot{u}(t)) + \beta_3 \operatorname{sign}(u(t)z(t))&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.17a}}}}

and

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_2(\dot{u}(t),u(t),z(t),\beta_4,\beta_5,\beta_6) = \beta_4 \operatorname{sign}(\dot{u}(t)) + \beta_5 \operatorname{sign}(z(t)) + \beta_6 \operatorname{sign}(u(t))&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.17b}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i=1, 2,\ldots, 6&lt;/math&gt; are six parameters that have to be determined in the identification process. However, according to Ikhouane ''et al.'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Ikhouane2008"&gt;Ihkouane F. and Pozo F. and Acho L. Discussion of Generalized Bouc–Wen model for highly asymmetric hysteresis by Junho Song and Armen Der Kiureghian. Journal of Engineering Mechanics. ASCE. May 2008. pp. 438–439&lt;/ref&gt; the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta_6&lt;/math&gt; should be set to zero.

=={{anchor|Calculation of the hysteretic response}}Calculation of the response, based on the excitation time-histories==

In ''displacement-controlled experiments'', the time history of the displacement &lt;math&gt;\textstyle u(t)&lt;/math&gt; and its derivative &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \dot{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; are known; therefore, the calculation of the hysteretic variable and restoring force is performed directly using equations {{EquationNote|Eq. 2}} and {{EquationNote|Eq. 3}}.

In ''force-controlled experiments'', {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}, {{EquationNote|Eq. 2}} and {{EquationNote|Eq. 4}} can be transformed in [[State space (physics)|state space]] form, using the change of variables &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_1(t) = u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \dot{x}_1(t) = \dot{u}(t) = x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \dot{x}_2(t) = \ddot{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_3(t) = z(t)&lt;/math&gt; as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot{x}_1(t) \\ \dot{x}_2(t) \\ \dot{x}_3(t) \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_2(t) \\ m^{-1} \left[ f(t) - c x_2(t) - a k_i x_1(t) - (1-a) k_i x_3(t)\right]  \\ x_2(t) \left\{A - \left[\beta\operatorname{sign}(x_3(t)x_2(t)) + \gamma\right]|x_3(t)|^n \right\} \end{array} \right] &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.18}}}}

and solved using, for example, the Livermore predictor-corrector method, the [[Rosenbrock methods]] or the [[Runge–Kutta methods|4th/5th-order Runge–Kutta method]]. The latter method is more efficient in terms of computational time; the others are slower, but provide a more accurate answer.

The state-space form of the Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model is given by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot{x}_1(t) \\ \dot{x}_2(t) \\ \dot{x}_3(t) \\ \dot{x}_4(t) \end{array} \right] = 
\left[ \begin{array}{c} x_2(t) \\
 m^{-1} \left[ f(t) - c x_2(t) - a k_i x_1(t) - (1-a) k_i x_3(t)\right]  \\ 
 \frac{h(x_3(t))}{\eta(x_4(t))} x_2(t) \left\{A(x_4(t)) - \nu(x_4(t))\left[\beta\operatorname{sign}(x_3(t)x_2(t)) + \gamma \right]|x_3(t)|^n \right\} \\
 (1-a) \omega^2 x_3(t) x_2(t) \end{array} \right] &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.19}}}}

This is a [[stiff differential equation|stiff ordinary differential equation]] that can be solved, for example, using the function ''ode15'' of [[MATLAB]].

According to Heine (2001),&lt;ref name="Heine01"/&gt; computing time to solve the model and numeric noise is greatly reduced if both force and displacement are the same order of magnitude; for instance, the units ''kN'' and ''mm'' are good choices.

=={{Anchor|Analytical calculation of the hysteretic response}}Analytical calculation of the hysteretic response==

The hysteresis produced by the Bouc–Wen model is rate-independent. {{EquationNote|Eq. 4}} can be written as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; {\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}u}} = A - \left[\beta\operatorname{sign}(z(t)\dot{u}(t)) + \gamma \right]|z(t)|^n &lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.20}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; within the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sign}&lt;/math&gt; function serves only as an indicator of the direction of movement. The indefinite integral of {{EquationRef|Eq.19}} can be expressed analytically in terms of the [[Gauss hypergeometric function]] &lt;math&gt; _2F_1(a,b,c;w)&lt;/math&gt;. Accounting for initial conditions, the following relation holds:&lt;ref name=Charalampakis2008&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.E. |last1=Charalampakis |first2=V.K. |last2=Koumousis |year=2008  |title=On the response and dissipated energy of Bouc–Wen hysteretic model |journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration |volume=309 |issue=3-5 |pages=887&amp;ndash;895 |doi=10.1016/j.jsv.2007.07.080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; u-u_0 = [z [_2F_1(1,\frac{1}{n},1+\frac{1}{n};q|z|^n)]]|_{z_0}^{z}&lt;/math&gt; |{{EquationRef|Eq.21}}}}

where, &lt;math&gt; q = \beta\operatorname{sign}(z(t)\dot{u}(t))+\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is assumed constant for the (not necessarily small) transition under examination, &lt;math&gt;A=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; are the initial values of the displacement and the hysteretic parameter, respectively. {{EquationRef|Eq.20}} is solved analytically for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; for specific values of the exponential parameter &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Charalampakis2008"/&gt; For arbitrary values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, {{EquationRef|Eq.20}} can be solved efficiently using e.g. bisection – type methods, such as the [[Brent method|Brent’s method]].&lt;ref name="Charalampakis2008"/&gt;

=={{Anchor|Parameter constraints|Identification of parameters}}Parameter constraints and identification==

The parameters of the Bouc–Wen model have the following bounds &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a\in(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k_f&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma\in[-\beta,\beta]&lt;/math&gt;.

As noted above, Ma ''et al.''(2004)&lt;ref name="MaZhang04"/&gt; proved that the parameters of the Bouc–Wen model are functionally redundant; that is, there exist multiple parameter vectors that produce an identical response from a given excitation. Removing this redundancy is best achieved by setting &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Constantinou and Adnane (1987)&lt;ref name="Constantinou87"&gt;Constantinou M.C. and Adnane M.A. (1987). Dynamics of soil-base-isolated structure systems: evaluation of two models for yielding systems. Report to NSAF: Department of Civil Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt; suggested imposing the constraint &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{A}{\beta+\gamma} = 1&lt;/math&gt; in order to reduce the model to a formulation with well-defined properties.

Adopting those constraints, the unknown parameters become: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle k_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle c&lt;/math&gt;.

Determination of the model paremeters using experimental input and output data can be accomplished by [[system identification]] techniques. The procedures suggested in the literature include:  
* Optimization based on the least-squares method, (using Gauss–Newton methods, evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, etc.); in this case, the error difference between the time histories or between the short-time-Fourier transforms of the signals is minimized.
* Extended [[Kalman filter]], [[Kalman filter#Unscented Kalman filter|unscented Kalman filter]], [[particle filter]]s
* [[Differential evolution]]
* [[Genetic algorithms]]
* [[Particle Swarm Optimization]]
* Adaptive laws
* Hybrid methods&lt;ref name=Charalampakis2008b&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.E. |last1=Charalampakis |first2=V.K. |last2=Koumousis |year=2008  |title=Identification of Bouc–Wen hysteretic systems by a hybrid evolutionary algorithm |journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration |volume=314 |issue=3-5 |pages=571&amp;ndash;585 |doi=10.1016/j.jsv.2008.01.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an identification method has been applied to tune the Bouc–Wen model parameters, the resulting model is considered a good approximation of true hysteresis when the error between the experimental data and the output of the model is small enough (from a practical point of view).

=={{Anchor|Criticism}}Criticism==

The hysteretic Bouc–Wen model has received some criticism regarding its ability to accurately describe the phenomenon of hysteresis in materials. Ikhouane and Rodellar (2005)&lt;ref name=Ikhouane2005&gt;{{cite journal |first1=F. |last1=Ikhouane |first2=J. |last2=Rodellar |year=2005  |title=On the hysteretic Bouc–Wen model |journal=[[Nonlinear Dynamics (journal)|Nonlinear Dynamics]] |volume=42 |pages=63&amp;ndash;78|doi=10.1007/s11071-005-0069-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; give some insight regarding the behavior of the Bouc–Wen model and provide evidence that the response of the Bouc–Wen model under periodic input is asymptotically periodic.

Charalampakis and Koumousis (2009)&lt;ref name=Charalampakis2009&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.E. |last1=Charalampakis |first2=V.K. |last2=Koumousis |year=2009  |title=A Bouc–Wen model compatible with plasticity postulates |journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration |volume=322 |issue=4-5 |pages=954&amp;ndash;968 |doi=10.1016/j.jsv.2008.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a modification on the Bouc–Wen model to eliminate displacement drift, force relaxation and nonclosure of hysteretic loops when the material is subjected to short unloading reloading paths resulting to local violation of Drucker's or Ilyushin's postulate of plasticity.

The '''British Compressed Air Society (BCAS)''' is the compressed air and vacuum [[Industry trade group|trade association]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It has membership for Manufacturers, Distributors, Suppliers and End-Users of compressed air equipment and systems.

==History==
It was formed in 1930 and represents manufacturers, distributors and users of [[compressed air]] and [[vacuum]] equipment. It became a company on 1 July 1998.

==Organizational Structure==
The organization is situated near to [[Marylebone High Street]], south of [[Regent's Park]] in Marylebone.

Members include a diverse set of firms and organizations, including many of the following:
* Major Manufacturers based in the UK
* Major UK Distributors and Suppliers

==Function==
The BCAS plays a key role in setting standards and codes of practice within the industry.  BCAS also lobbies the [[UK government]] on behalf of UK industry and business, e.g. to outlaw non-compliant products.  It works with a range of organisations and government departments, including the [[Health and Safety Executive]], standards agencies, and training initiatives.   

It publishes statistical information on the state of the compressed air equipment UK market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10991">'''Carbon lock-in''' refers to the self-perpetuating [[inertia]] created by large [[fossil fuel]]-based [[Electric power system|energy systems]] that inhibits public and private efforts to introduce [[alternative energy]] technologies. Related to the concept of [[Lock-in (decision-making)|technological lock-in]], the concept is most used in relation to the challenge of altering the current [[energy infrastructure]] to respond to global [[climate change]].

The concept and term was first coined by Gregory C. Unruh in a 1999 [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy|Fletcher School]], [[Tufts University]] [[doctoral thesis]] entitled “Escaping Carbon Lock-In.” It has since gained popularity in climate change policy discussions, especially those focused on preventing the [[globalization]] of carbon lock-in to rapidly industrializing countries like [[China]] and [[India]].

The source of carbon lock-in inertia in energy systems arises from the co-evolution of large interdependent technological networks and the [[social institution]]s and [[cultural practice]]s that support and benefit from system growth. The growth of the system is fostered by increasing [[returns to scale]].

==Introduction==
According to Unruh:
{{Quote|text=…industrial economies have been locked into fossil fuel-based energy systems through a process of technological and institutional [[co-evolution]] driven by path-dependent increasing returns to scale. It is asserted that this condition, termed carbon lock-in, creates persistent [[Market (economics)|market]] and [[policy]] failures that can inhibit the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies despite their apparent environmental and economic advantages.|author=Gregory C. Unruh |source=Understanding carbon lock-in (2000)}}

The concept emerged in response to what is termed the “[[climate policy]] paradox,” which recognizes that there is substantial [[scientific consensus]] that climate change is a real and present threat to humans and other species uniquely adapted to current climatic conditions. Similarly there is evidence that technologies exist which can lower the [[carbon intensity]] of [[economic activity]] in a cost-effective manner, including [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] innovations as well as some [[renewable energy]] applications. The existence of these apparent “win-win” no-regrets opportunities for society to act on climate concerns creates a [[paradox]]. If such technologies exist, and they are cost effective and help minimize [[Climate forcing|climate-forcing]] emissions, why aren’t they diffusing more rapidly? The conjecture is that industrial economies have become locked into fossil fuel technologies by past [[investment]]s and policy decisions, the effects of positive feedback on increasing returns, and the economic growth of energy infrastructure.

==A Co-Evolutionary Process==
Carbon lock-in emerges over time as [[Energy development|energy]] and [[economic development]] in industrialized countries has proceeded. The carbon lock-in framework builds hierarchically from individual technological artifacts, usually manufactured by [[for-profit]] organizations, to technological systems of interdependent artifacts. As these systems grow, they begin to have important societal implications drawing in government regulation of the system’s growth and development. The government’s involvement with [[system management]], be it for safety, universal service or other national interests, institutionalizes the system and signals the emergence of a techno-institutional complex.

Over time [[consumer]]s and the public adapt their lifestyles to the capabilities of the technology and the system becomes embedded in society. Examples of this process can be seen in the growth of [[automobile]]-based [[transportation]] systems and fossil-fuel powered energy systems.

It is this co-evolutionary [[positive feedback]] development process that creates the lock-in condition and associated barriers to the diffusion of [[Alternative technology|alternative technologies]], even those with known superior environmental performance characteristics. A 2007 [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] report entitled “Carbon Lock-In: Barriers to Deploying Climate Change Mitigation Technologies” (sponsored by the [[U.S. Climate Change Technology Program]], CCTP) classifies three major types of carbon lock-in barriers: [[cost effectiveness]], financial/legal and [[intellectual property]] barriers. Escaping the lock-in condition requires overcoming these barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/policy/acsonthehill/briefings/solarenergy/report-carbon-lock-in.pdf |title=Carbon Lock-In: Barriers To Deploying Climate Change Mitigation Technologies |last=Brown |first=Marilyn C. |last2=Chandlers |first2=Jess |last3=Lapse |first3=Melissa V. |last4=Sovacool |first4=Benjamin K. |date=January 2008 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalizing Carbon Lock-In==
[[File:EricksonEtAl 2015 AssessingCarbonLockin EnvironmentalResearchLetters.jpg|thumb|upright=2|According to an assessment proposed by Erickson et al. (2015), coal power plants, because of long lifetime, gas power, which may soon be overbuilt, and vehicles with internal combustion engines, because of strong techno-institutional effects, over-commit the highest amounts of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Peter |last2=Kartha |first2=Sivan |last3=Lazarus |first3=Michael |last4=Tempest |first4=Kevin |date=25 August 2015 |title=Assessing carbon lock-in |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=10 |issue=8 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The carbon lock-in concept has gained more attention as China’s rapid [[Industrial economics|industrial economic development]] has progressed. The concern is that if China pursues the same fossil-fuel driven economic development models of established industrial counties, building out extensive automobile-based infrastructures and fossil-fuel powered energy systems, they will lock-in persistent and growing [[greenhouse gas emissions]] well into the future. The same arguments can be extended to all rapidly [[Industrialization|industrializing]] countries including India. This concern is arising as [[scientific evidence]] is indicating that current emission growth must be stopped and global emissions reduced by upwards of 60% if humanity is to prevent substantial unwanted climate disruption.

Recent studies by [[Steven J. Davis]] and co-authors have quantified the future CO2 emissions that can be expected to be produced by current energy infrastructure &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1188566 | volume=329 | title=Future CO2 Emissions and Climate Change from Existing Energy Infrastructure | journal=Science | pages=1330–1333}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the magnitude of lock-in related to power plants being built each year in China and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=Steven J. |last2=Socolow |first2=Robert H |date=2014 |title=Commitment accounting of CO2 emissions |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=1104–1114 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/9/8/084018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/accounting-for-the-expanding-carbon-shadow-from-coal-burning-plants |title=Accounting for the Expanding Carbon Shadow From Coal-Burning Plants |last=Revkin |first=Andrew C |date=28 August 2014 |website=Dot Earth |publisher=New York Times |access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="827">'''Conjunctive use''' is often used in discussing water supplies and [[water conservation]].  This phrase usually is used to describe the practice of storing [[surface water]] in a [[Groundwater|groundwater basin]] in wet years and withdrawing it from the basin in dry years. Conjunctive use consists of harmoniously combining the use of both surface water and groundwater in order to minimise the undesirable physical, environmental and economical effects of each solution and to optimise the water demand

'''CrossCharge''' is a device for charging [[electric vehicle]]s (EV) without driver intervention, using [[conductive charging]]. CrossCharge is the world’s first conductive charging system for an electric vehicle. It connects potentially any EV car battery to the electrical power source while the driver walks away; a true park and walk system.&lt;ref name=greendotcharging&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.green-dot-charging.com |title = Green Dot Transportation Company |publisher = Weblight Solutions | date =  September 27, 2010 |accessdate= 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of two halves (or rather, two bars referred as crossbars) – one installed on the vehicle and one installed on the floor of a garage or in a parking lot. The automated ground unit detects the car above it and brings the two pieces together instigating an [[electric current]] to flow into the cross point of vehicle side bar, charging the EV. As the vehicle is parked over the charger, the device remains seamlessly connected to the vehicle and brings it to fully charged state – ready for the next use. Some major benefits include maximizing user convenience to promote EV adoption. In addition, the device in particular has passed all safety regulations and thus is the safest hands-free charger to be available on the market. CrossCharge is expected to be available in the spring of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-dot-charging.com |title=Green Dot Charging Technology |publisher=Green-dot-charging.com |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Charging through conduction is based on the age-old technology of metal to metal connection. The technology involves contact between a charged object and a neutral object. In contrast to induction, where the charged object is brought near but never contacted to the object being charged, conduction charging involves making the physical connection of the charged object to the neutral object. Because charging by conduction involves contact, it is often called charging by contact and has the least transfer loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.te.com/documentation/whitepapers/pdf/3jot_9.pdf |title=Low-Level Contact Resistance Characterization, Edward M. Bock, Jr. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossCharge by GreenDot Transportation claims to be the world’s first conductive hands-free charging system for [[electric vehicles]], it is a product of Green Dot Transportation, founded in 2010 [United States Patent Application 20090011616].&lt;ref name=implupatents&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.implu.com/patent_agent/35589 |title = Implu |publisher = United States Patents | date =  January 8, 2009 |accessdate= 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The charger represents a new generation of clean energy (how is the electricity generated?) possibilities towards maximizing user satisfaction and convenience, the cornerstone for wide-scale adoption of electric vehicles. The EV industry is trying to develop an “inductive” charging solution. However, this approach has inherent issues of safety and efficiency due to accompanying stay magnetic fields. Up to 25% energy can be lost – potentially creating a hazard for pace makers and heating of ferromagnetic structures in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/publicmeetingmaterials/1106/7FNP3F4JZPH/E236437_NRE_Presentations.pdf |title=EPRI, June 22, 2011—NRE Meeting: Non-Road Electrification |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductive approach GreenDot has taken provides following benefits to the EV owners:
*Upwards of 99% efficiency
*Zero magnetic fields: safe for pets, pacemakers, passengers
*Automated, hands-free, and “sloppy parking” proof
*Half the cost of current inductive technology
*Little to no mechanical installation
*Ready for use on all electric vehicles &lt;ref name="greendotcharging"/&gt;

A '''dado rail''', also known as a '''chair rail''' or '''surbase''',&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Surbase}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[moulding (decorative)|moulding]] fixed horizontally to the wall around the perimeter of a room.

[[File:Wall.svg|thumb|right|alt=Wall.svg|Diagram of a wall illustrating the [[crown molding]] (top), dado rail (middle) and the [[skirting board]] (lower).]]

The dado rail is traditionally part of the [[dado (architecture)|dado]] or [[wainscot]] and, although the purpose of the dado is mainly aesthetic, the dado rail may provide the wall with protection from furniture and other contact. Traditionally, the height of the dado rail is derived from the height of the [[pedestal]] of a column of [[classical order]], &lt;ref&gt;The practical house carpenter, William Pain, London, 1792&lt;/ref&gt; typically 24 inches from the floor or about one-fifth the height of the room. Modern trends have been towards 36 inches or 900&amp;nbsp;mm,&lt;ref&gt;Trim Carpentry Techniques: Installing Doors, Windows, Base and Crown, Craig Savage, Taunton Press, 2002,
{{ISBN|1-56158-321-9}}, p.140&lt;/ref&gt; based on the assumption that its purpose is to protect the wall from chair backs. The term 'chair rail' is also used for this reason.

Dado rails are also sometimes applied to a wall without the full dado treatment. The purpose of the rail in these cases may be protective, and it is common in environments where walls are subject to a lot of wear and tear, such as shopping centres and hospitals. In such cases the height of the rail is often 1200&amp;nbsp;mm or even 1500&amp;nbsp;mm from the floor and serves a functional rather than aesthetic role.

[[Dark matter]] is defined as hypothetical matter that is undetectable by its emitted radiation, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter.

The '''Dos Cuadras Offshore Oil Field''' is a large oil and gas field underneath the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] about eight miles southeast of [[Santa Barbara, California]].  Discovered in 1968, and with a cumulative production of over 260 million barrels of oil, it is the 24th-largest oil field within California and the adjacent waters.&lt;ref Name="annual2007"&gt;{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Oil and Gas Statistics:  2007 Annual Report  | work = California Department of Conservation | publisher =   | date = December 31, 2007  | url = ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/annual_reports/2007/0102stats_07.pdf
  | format = PDF  | doi =   | accessdate = August 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As it is in the Pacific Ocean outside of the 3-mile [[tidelands]] limit, it is a federally leased field, regulated by the U.S. Department of the Interior rather than the California Department of Conservation.  It is entirely produced from four drilling platforms in the channel, which as of 2009 were operated by Dos Cuadras Offshore Resources (DCOR), LLC, a private firm based in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]].  A [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] near one of these platforms – [[Unocal]]'s Platform A – was responsible for the 1969 [[Santa Barbara oil spill]] that was formative for the modern environmental movement, and spurred the passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].

==Setting==
The Dos Cuadras field is one of many underneath the ocean bottom offshore of Southern California, most of which were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s.  All of the field is outside of the [[tidelands|3-mile geographic limit]], making it subject to U.S. government rather than California regulation.  The four platforms are arranged in a line running from east to west, spaced one-half mile apart, with Platform Hillhouse on the east, and Platforms "A", "B", and "C" in order to the west.

A pair of undersea pipelines, one for oil and one for gas, connect the four platforms to the shore near [[La Conchita, California|La Conchita]].  Oil and gas produced on the Dos Cuadras field are pumped about 12 miles east to the Rincon Oil &amp; Gas Processing Plant on a hilltop adjacent to the [[Rincon Oil Field]], about a mile southeast of La Conchita.  From there oil travels down to Ventura along [[Venoco, Inc.|Venoco's]] M-143 pipeline to the Ventura pump station, and then to Los Angeles area refineries by way of a TOSCO pipeline in the Santa Clara River Valley.&lt;ref Name="COOGER"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Hargis  | first = Dean  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = California Offshore Oil and Gas Energy Resources Study  | work = California Department of Conservation | publisher = Minerals Management Service, U.S. Department of the Interior  | date = January 26, 2000  | url = http://www.mms.gov/itd/pubs/2000/2000-008.pdf  | format = PDF  | doi =   | accessdate = December 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbcapcd.org/eng/titlev/files/p9110.pdf APCD Permit to Operate No. 9110-R3, p. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ocean bottom is relatively flat in the vicinity of the field, and all platforms are in a water depth of approximately 190 feet.&lt;ref name="vass16"&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree= MS |title= Evaluation of horizontal wells in an offshore reservoir in Southern California|url=http://itah.iphil.ru/distr/Books-Oil/papers/vassilieva699ms.pdf |author= |last= Vassilieva|first= Svetlana|year= 1999|publisher= Stanford University|accessdate= 31 December 2009|docket= |oclc= }} p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:DosCuadrasMap-USGS.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Map showing relation of the Dos Cuadras Field to the Rincon anticlinal trend.]]
The Dos Cuadras field is a [[geologic fault|faulted]] [[anticline|anticlinal]] structure which plunges at both ends, thereby forming an ideal trap for [[hydrocarbon]] accumulation.  It is part of the larger Rincon Anticlinal Trend, which includes the [[Carpinteria Offshore Oil Field]] to the east, as well as the [[Rincon Oil Field|Rincon]], [[San Miguelito Oil Field|San Miguelito]], and [[Ventura Oil Field|Ventura]] fields onshore.  Oil is found in two formations, the [[Pliocene]]-age [[Pico Formation]] and the underlying [[Miocene]] [[Santa Margarita Formation]].  By far the most productive unit is the Repetto Sands portion of the Pico Formation.  Only one well has produced from the Santa Margarita; all the others are in the Repetto Sands.&lt;ref name="vass17"&gt;Vassilieva, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Repetto Sands unit consists of layers of mudstone, siltstone, and shale, and due to its depositional environment the general grain size and [[porosity]] increase towards the east.&lt;ref name="vass15"&gt;Vassilieva, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same formation which is richly productive in the oil fields of the Los Angeles Basin, such as the [[Salt Lake Oil Field|Salt Lake]] and [[Beverly Hills Oil Field|Beverly Hills]] fields, where it is also folded into anticlinal traps.  In the Dos Cuadras field, the oil-bearing strata are at depths ranging from 500 to 4,200 feet below the sea floor, and individual strata are separated by impermeable layers of [[shale|shaly]] material.&lt;ref name="vass15"/&gt;

Oil from the field averages [[API gravity]] of 25, with a range from 18 to 34, which classifies as medium-grade crude.  Reservoir pressure began at 750 psi, sufficient for easy pumping in the early years of field development.&lt;ref name="vass16"/&gt;

==History and production==
Oil has been known in the Santa Barbara Channel since prehistoric times; the native Chumash people used tar from the numerous natural seeps as a sealant, and tar regularly washes up on the beaches from the offshore seeps.  The world's first offshore oil drilling took place at the [[Summerland Oil Field]] in 1896, only five miles north of the Dos Cuadras field.  Those wells were put in from piers in shallow water.  Technology for drilling in deeper water from platforms did not come about until the middle of the 20th century.

While the existence of the field was suspected in the 1950s, the field was not discovered until 1968.  Unocal and several other oil companies took out leases on the field in February 1968, and put in the first well, and the first platform, that same year.&lt;ref&gt;DOGGR, p. 614-615&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vassilieva, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Data regarding the four platforms are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mms.gov/omm/pacific/offshore/platforms/doscuadrasplatform.htm Minerals Management Service:  Dos Cuadras Field platform information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unocal succeeded in installing the first four wells from its Platform A by January 1969, but their attempt to install the fifth well was catastrophic, and resulted in one of the most notorious environmental disasters in United States history.  Because the drillers were using an insufficient length of protective casing, when the well hit a high-pressure zone in the field, it blew out, spewing enormous quantities of oil and gas into the water from the sea floor.  While crews were able to cap the wellhead and relieve the pressure there, the adjacent geologic formations were not strong enough to contain the pressure, and lacking a steel protective casing, the reservoir fluid and gas ripped through the sedimentary sand layers directly on the ocean floor; the result was the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]] of 80,000 to 100,000 barrels, which eventually coated over 40 miles of southern California coastline with oil, an ecological disaster which killed upward of 10,000 birds and numerous sea mammals and other creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countyofsb.org/energy/information/history.asp Brief oil and gas history of Santa Barbara County] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5y21hCCkz?url=http://www.countyofsb.org/energy/information/history.asp |date=2011-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haier-20050128"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.es.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.envs.d7/files/sitefiles/about/history/pdf/Nexus_69_Oil_Spill%20Leaves.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817093335/http://www.es.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.envs.d7/files/sitefiles/about/history/pdf/Nexus_69_Oil_Spill%20Leaves.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-08-17|title=69 Oil Spill Leaves Mark on SB Environmentalism|last=Haier|first=Daniel Haier|date=2005-01-28|publisher=Daily Nexus, UCSB|accessdate=2010-01-02}} &lt;/ref&gt;


Following the spill, the Secretary of the Interior ended all offshore oil drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) until measures for better oversight were put in place, which happened in 1970 with the passage of the federal [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), and in California, with the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA).  Opposition to oil drilling was nothing new in Santa Barbara – local residents, led by a newspaper publisher, objected enough to the expansion of the Summerland field in the 1890s to organize a late-night derrick-destroying party near the present-day Miramar Hotel&lt;ref name="Tompkins"&gt;{{cite book |title=Santa Barbara, Past and Present|last= Tompkins|first= Walker A.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1975|publisher= Tecolote Books|location= Santa Barbara, California|isbn= |page= 80|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – but the spill intensified the local hostility to oil drilling to the point that few new platforms were installed, and none at all within the 3-mile limit.

After the disaster and cleanup, Unocal continued drilling wells from the two platforms that were already in place ("A" and "B", began producing from them in March 1969, and installed two more platforms ("C" and "Hillhouse").  Production from the field peaked quickly, reaching a maximum in 1971, during which year almost 28 million barrels of oil were extracted.  The field experienced a gradual decline in production afterwards, approximately 8 percent per year, as is typical of fields when the reservoir pressure declines, and in the absence of [[secondary recovery]] technologies (such as water or gas injection).  In 1985, Unocal tried waterflooding, and then polymer flooding, to improve production rates, and then in 1990 they began a horizontal drilling program to reach reservoirs impractical to exploit any other way.&lt;ref name="vass17"/&gt;

Unocal continued to produce from the field until they sold all of their California production assets in 1996 to Nuevo Energy, as operated by Torch Energy Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/21/business/company-news-unocal-to-sell-oil-and-gas-fields-in-california.html?pagewanted=1 New York Times:  Unocal to sell oil and gas fields in California, February 21, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 Nuevo took over the operations of the four platforms directly, and in 2004 passed them on to [[Plains Exploration &amp; Production]] on that firm's acquisition of Nuevo.  Plains only ran the platforms for a little more than four months, selling the operation to DCOR in March 2005.  As of 2009, DCOR retains operational control of the Dos Cuadras field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mms.gov/omm/Pacific/lease/lease-unit-operatorship/lease-unit-operatorship-book.pdf Minerals Management Service:  Lease operatorship book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528031029/http://www.mms.gov/omm/pacific/lease/lease-unit-operatorship/lease-unit-operatorship-book.pdf |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Denver-based [[Venoco|Venoco, Inc.]] owns a 25% (non-operating) interest in the western two-thirds of the field, having acquired it from Chevron in 1999.&lt;ref Name="Ven"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Offshore California, Venoco, Inc. |publisher=Venoco |date= |url=http://venocoinc.com/offshore_cali.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217001620/http://venocoinc.com/offshore_cali.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 February 2013 |doi= |accessdate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Minerals Management Service (MMS), the field retains about 11.4 million barrels of oil in reserves recoverable with current technology.

In [[physics]], '''screening''' is the damping of [[electric field]]s caused by the presence of mobile [[electric charge|charge]] carriers. It is an important part of the behavior of charge-carrying [[fluid]]s, such as ionized gases (classical [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s), [[electrolyte]]s, and [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] in electronic conductors ([[semiconductor]]s, [[metal]]s).
In a fluid, with a given [[permittivity]] ''ε'', composed of electrically charged constituent particles, each pair of particles (with charges ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ) interact through the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon \left|\mathbf{r}\right|^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the vector '''r''' is the relative position between the charges. This interaction complicates the theoretical treatment of the fluid. For example, a naive quantum mechanical calculation of the ground-state energy density yields infinity, which is unreasonable. The difficulty lies in the fact that even though the Coulomb force diminishes with distance as 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the average number of particles at each distance ''r'' is proportional to ''r''², assuming the fluid is fairly [[isotropy|isotropic]]. As a result, a charge fluctuation at any one point has non-negligible effects at large distances.

In reality, these long-range effects are suppressed by the flow of particles in response to electric fields. This flow reduces the ''effective'' interaction between particles to a short-range "screened" Coulomb interaction. This system corresponds to the simplest example of a renormalized interaction (see sections 1.2.1 and 3.2 of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McComb|first1=W.D.|title=Renormalization methods : a guide for beginners|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199236527|edition=Reprinted with corrections, Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In [[solid-state physics]], especially for [[Metal|metals]] and [[semiconductor]]s, the '''screening effect''' describes the [[Electric field|electrostatic field]] and Coulomb potential of an [[ion]] inside the solid. Like the electric field of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] is reduced inside an atom or ion due to the [[shielding effect]], the electric fields of ions in conducting solids are further reduced by the cloud of [[Valence and conduction bands|conduction electrons]].

== Description ==
Consider a fluid composed of electrons moving in a uniform background of positive charge (one-component plasma). Each electron possesses a negative charge. According to Coulomb's interaction, negative charges repel each other. Consequently, this electron will repel other electrons creating a small region around itself in which there are fewer electrons. This region can be treated as a positively charged "screening hole". Viewed from a large distance, this screening hole has the effect of an overlaid positive charge which cancels the electric field produced by the electron. Only at short distances, inside the hole region, can the electron's field be detected. For a plasma, this effect can be made explicit by an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-body calculation (see section 5 of &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Escande|first1=D F|last2=Elskens|first2=Yves|last3=Doveil|first3=F|title=Direct path from microscopic mechanics to Debye shielding, Landau damping and wave-particle interaction|journal=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion|date=1 February 2015|volume=57|issue=2|pages=025017|doi=10.1088/0741-3335/57/2/025017|arxiv=1409.4323|bibcode=2015PPCF...57b5017E}}&lt;/ref&gt;). If the background is made up of positive ions, their attraction by the electron of interest reinforces the above screening mechanism. In atomic physics, a germane effect exists for atoms with more than one electron shell: the [[shielding effect]]. In plasma physics, electric-field screening is also called Debye screening or shielding. It manifests itself on macroscopic scales by a sheath ([[Debye sheath]]) next to a material with which the plasma is in contact.

The screened potential determines the inter atomic force and the [[phonon]] [[dispersion relation]] in metals. The screened potential is used to calculate the [[electronic band structure]] of a large variety of materials, often in combination with [[pseudopotential]] models. The screening effect leads to the [[independent electron approximation]], which explains the predictive power of introductory models of solids like the [[Drude model]], the [[free electron model]] and the [[nearly free electron model]].
== Theory and models ==
The first theoretical treatment of '''electrostatic screening,''' due to [[Peter Debye]] and [[Erich Hueckel|Erich Hückel]],&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite journal    | author=P. Debye and E. Hückel    | title=The theory of electrolytes. I. Lowering of freezing point and related phenomena    | journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]    | year=1923    | volume=24    | pages=185–206    | url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/estir/hist/hist-12-Debye-1.pdf    | format=PDF    | deadurl=yes    | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102204230/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/estir/hist/hist-12-Debye-1.pdf    | archivedate=2013-11-02    | df=    }}&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with a stationary point charge embedded in a fluid.

Consider a fluid of electrons in a background of heavy, positively charged ions. For simplicity, we ignore the motion and spatial distribution of the ions, approximating them as a uniform background charge. This simplification is permissible since the electrons are lighter and more mobile than the ions, provided we consider distances much larger than the ionic separation. In [[condensed matter physics]], this model is referred to as [[jellium]].

=== Screened Coulomb interactions ===
Let ''ρ'' denote the [[number density]] of electrons, and ''φ'' the [[electric potential]]. At first, the electrons are evenly distributed so that there is zero net charge at every point. Therefore, ''φ'' is initially a constant as well.

We now introduce a fixed point charge ''Q'' at the origin. The associated [[charge density]] is ''Qδ''(''r''), where ''δ''(''r'') is the [[Dirac delta function]]. After the system has returned to equilibrium, let the change in the electron density and electric potential be ''Δρ''(''r'') and ''Δφ''(''r'') respectively. The charge density and electric potential are related by [[Poisson's equation]], which gives

:&lt;math&gt;- \nabla^2 [\Delta\phi(r)] = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} [Q\delta(r) - e\Delta\rho(r)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]].

To proceed, we must find a second independent equation relating ''Δρ'' and ''Δφ''. We consider two possible approximations, under which the two quantities are proportional: the Debye-Hückel approximation, valid at high temperatures (e.g. classical plasmas), and the Fermi-Thomas approximation, valid at low temperatures (e.g. electrons in metals).

==== Debye–Hückel approximation ====

{{main|Debye–Hückel theory}}

In the Debye–Hückel approximation,&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt; we maintain the system in thermodynamic equilibrium, at a temperature ''T'' high enough that the fluid particles obey [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]]. At each point in space, the density of electrons with energy ''j'' has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_j (r) = \rho_j^{(0)}(r) \; \exp\!\left[\frac{e\phi(r)}{k_\mathrm{B} T}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]. Perturbing in ''φ'' and expanding the exponential to first order, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; e \Delta \rho \simeq  \varepsilon_0 k_0^2 \Delta \phi &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; k_0 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sqrt{\frac{\rho e^2}{\varepsilon_0 k_\mathrm{B} T}} &lt;/math&gt;

The associated length ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is called the [[Debye length]]. The Debye length is the fundamental length scale of a classical plasma.

==== Fermi-Thomas approximation ====

{{main|Thomas–Fermi screening| Lindhard theory}}

In the Fermi-Thomas approximation,&lt;ref name=Ashcroft&gt;N. W. Ashcroft and N. D. Mermin, ''Solid State Physics'' (Thomson Learning, Toronto, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Llewellyn Thomas]] and [[Enrico Fermi]], the system is maintained at a constant electron [[chemical potential]] ([[Fermi level]]) and at low temperature. The former condition corresponds, in a real experiment, to keeping the metal/fluid in electrical contact with a fixed [[potential difference]] with [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The chemical potential ''μ'' is, by definition, the energy of adding an extra electron to the fluid. This energy may be decomposed into a kinetic energy ''T'' part and the potential energy -''eφ'' part. Since the chemical potential is kept constant,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mu = \Delta T - e \Delta \phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If the temperature is extremely low, the behavior of the electrons comes close to the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of a [[Fermi gas]]. We thus approximate ''T'' by the kinetic energy of an additional electron in the Fermi gas model, which is simply the [[Fermi energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. The Fermi energy for a 3D system is related to the density of electrons (including spin degeneracy) by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = 2 \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3}\left( \frac{4}{3} \pi k_\mathrm{F}^3 \right)\quad , \quad E_\mathrm{F}  = \frac{\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the Fermi wavevector. Perturbing to first order, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\rho \simeq \frac{3\rho}{2E_\mathrm{F}} \Delta E_\mathrm{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting this into the above equation for ''Δμ'' yields

:&lt;math&gt;e \Delta\rho \simeq \varepsilon_0 k_0^2 \Delta\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;k_0 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sqrt{\frac{3e^2\rho}{2\varepsilon_0 E_\mathrm{F}}} = \sqrt{\frac{m e^{2} k_{\mathrm{F}}}{\varepsilon _{0} \pi ^{2} \hbar ^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the Fermi-Thomas screening wave vector.

This result follows from the equations of a Fermi gas, which is a model of non-interacting electrons, whereas the fluid, which we are studying, contains the Coulomb interaction. Therefore, the Fermi-Thomas approximation is only valid when the electron density is low, so that the particle interactions are relatively weak.

==== Result: Screened potential ====

Our results from the Debye-Hückel or Fermi-Thomas approximation may now be inserted into Poisson's equation. The result is

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \nabla^2 - k_0^2 \right] \phi(r) = - \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0} \delta(r)&lt;/math&gt;,

which is known as the [[screened Poisson equation]]. The solution is

:&lt;math&gt;\phi (r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r} e^{- k_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;,

which is called a screened Coulomb potential. It is a Coulomb potential multiplied by an exponential damping term, with the strength of the damping factor given by the magnitude of ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the Debye or Fermi-Thomas wave vector. Note that this potential has the same form as the [[Yukawa potential]]. This screening yields a [[dielectric function]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon (r)= \varepsilon_0 e^{k_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Many-body theory ==

=== Classical physics and linear response ===

A mechanical &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-body approach provides together the derivation of screening effect and of [[Landau damping]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Escande|first=D F|last2=Doveil|first2=F|last3=Elskens|first3=Yves|title=N -body description of Debye shielding and Landau damping|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0741-3335/58/i=1/a=014040?key=crossref.140ba36afa02dbfc77fd426a59013177|journal=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion|volume=58|issue=1|pages=014040|doi=10.1088/0741-3335/58/1/014040|arxiv=1506.06468|bibcode=2016PPCF...58a4040E|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with a single realization of a one-component plasma whose electrons have a velocity dispersion (for a thermal plasma, there must be many particles in a Debye sphere, a volume whose radius is the Debye length). On using the linearized motion of the electrons in their own electric field, it yields an equation of the type&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{E}} \Phi= S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{E}}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a source term due to the particles, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier-Laplace transform of the electrostatic potential. When substituting an integral over a smooth distribution function for the discrete sum over the particles in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal{E}}&lt;/math&gt;, one gets   &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\mathbf{k},\omega) \, \Phi(\mathbf{k},\omega) = S(\mathbf{k},\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\mathbf{k},\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the plasma permittivity, or dielectric function, classically obtained by a linearized [[Vlasov equation|Vlasov-Poisson equation]] (section 6.4 of &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=D. R.|title=Introduction to Plasma Theory|date=1983|publisher=John Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471090458}}&lt;/ref&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave vector, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency, and &lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{k},\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; source terms due to the particles (equation (20) of &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).

By inverse Fourier-Laplace transform, the potential due to each particle is the sum of two parts (section 4.1 of &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). One corresponds to the excitation of [[Plasma oscillation|Langmuir waves]] by the particle, and the other one is its screened potential, as classically obtained by a linearized Vlasovian calculation involving a test particle (section 9.2 of &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). The screened potential is the above screened Coulomb potential for a thermal plasma and a thermal particle. For a faster particle, the potential is modified (section 9.2 of &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;). Substituting an integral over a smooth distribution function for the discrete sum over the particles in &lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{k},\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, yields the Vlasovian expression enabling the calculation of Landau damping (section 6.4 of &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

===Quantum-mechanical approach===
In real metals, the screening effect is more complex than described above in the Fermi-Thomas theory. The assumption that the charge carriers (electrons) can respond at any wavevector is just an approximation. However, it is not energetically possible for an electron within or on a [[Fermi surface]] to respond at wavevectors shorter than the Fermi wavevector. This constraint is related to the [[Gibbs phenomenon]], where [[Fourier series]] for functions that vary rapidly in space are not good approximations unless a very large number of terms in the series are retained. In physics, this phenomenon is known as [[Friedel oscillation]]s, and applies both to surface and bulk screening. In each case the net electric field does not fall off exponentially in space, but rather as an inverse power law multiplied by an oscillatory term. Theoretical calculations can be obtained from [[quantum hydrodynamics]] and [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

'''Electrochemical engineering''' is the branch of chemical engineering dealing with the technological applications of electrochemical phenomena, such as electrosynthesis of chemicals, [[electrowinning]] and refining of metals,  flow batteries and [[fuel cells]], surface modification by electrodeposition, electrochemical separations and corrosion. This discipline is an overlap between [[electrochemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

According with the [[IUPAC]], the term ''electrochemical engineering'' is reserved for electricity intensive processes for industrial or energy storage applications, and should not be confused with ''applied electrochemistry'', which comprises small batteries, amperometric sensors, microfluidic devices, microelectrodes, solid-state devices, voltammetry at disc electrodes, etc. 

More than 6% of the electricity is consumed by large-scale electrochemical operations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bebelis|first1=S.|last2=Bouzek|first2=K.|last3=Cornell|first3=A.|last4=Ferreira|first4=M.G.S.|last5=Kelsall|first5=G.H.|last6=Lapicque|first6=F.|last7=Ponce de León|first7=C.|last8=Rodrigo|first8=M.A.|last9=Walsh|first9=F.C.|title=Highlights during the development of electrochemical engineering|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=October 2013|volume=91|issue=10|pages=1998–2020|doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2013.08.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Electrochemical engineering (corrected).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the relationship between electrochemical engineering and other disciplines.]]

Electrochemical engineering combines the study of heterogeneous charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interphases with the development of practical materials and processes. Fundamental  considerations include electrode materials and the kinetics of redox species. The development of the technology involves the study of the electrochemical reactors, their potential and current distribution, mass transport conditions, hydrodynamics, geometry and components as well as the quantification of its overall performance in terms of reaction yield, conversion efficiency, and energy efficiency. Industrial developments require further reactor and process design, fabrication methods, testing and product development.

Electrochemical engineering considers current distribution, fluid flow, mass transfer, and the kinetics of the electro reactions in order to design efficient electrochemical reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=John|title=Engineering design of electrochemical systems|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry|date=1968|volume=60|issue=4|pages=12–27|doi=10.1021/ie50700a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most electrochemical operations are performed in filter-press reactors with parallel plate electrodes or, less often, in stirred tanks with rotating cylinder electrodes. Fuel cell and flow battery stacks are types of filter-press reactors. Most of them are continuous operations.

==History==
[[File:Cell room of a chlorine-caustic soda plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920]]

This branch of engineering emerged gradually from chemical engineering as electrical power sources became available in the mid 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] described his laws of electrolysis in 1833, relating for the first time the amount of electrical charge and converted mass. In 1886 [[Charles Martin Hall]] developed a cheap electrochemical process for the extraction of aluminium from its ore in molten salts, constituting the first true large-scale electrochemical industry. Later, [[Hamilton Castner]] improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented filter-press type electrochemical cells in France. [[Charles Frederick Burgess]] developed the electrolytic refining of iron ca. 1904 and later ran a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920. During the first three decades of the 20th century, industrial electrochemistry followed an empirical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Electrochemistry Books Published Before 1950|url=http://knowledge.electrochem.org/estir/old-books.htm|publisher=The Electrochemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Second World War, interest focused towards the fundaments of electrochemical reactions. Among other developments, the [[potentiostat]] (1937) enabled such studies. A critical advance was provided by the work of [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Veniamin Levich]] in 1962 who linked the hydrodynamics of a flowing electrolyte towards a rotating disc electrode with the mass transport control of the electrochemical reaction through a rigorous mathematical treatment. The same year, Wagner described for the first time "The Scope of Electrochemical Engineering" as a separated discipline from a physicochemical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=C.|title=The scope of electrochemical engineering|journal=Advances in Electrochemistry and Electrochemical Engineering|volume=2|year=1962|pages=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 60s and 70s Charles W. Tobias, who is regarded as the "father of electrochemical engineering" by the [[Electrochemical Society]], was concerned with ionic transport by diffusion, migration, and convection, exact solutions of potential and current distribution problems, conductance in heterogeneous media, quantitative description of processes in porous electrodes. Also in the 60s, [[John Newman (scientist)|John Newman]] pioneered the study of many of the physicochemical laws that govern electrochemical systems, demonstrating how complex electrochemical processes could be analysed mathematically to correctly formulate and solve problems associated with batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers and related technologies. In Switzerland, Norbert Ibl contributed with experimental and theoretical studies of mass transfer and potential distribution in electrolyses, especially at porous electrodes. Fumio Hine carried out equivalent developments in Japan. Several individuals, including Kuhn, Kreysa, Rousar, Fleischmann, Alkire, Coeuret, Pletcher and Walsh established many other training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study. Currently, the main tasks of electrochemical engineering consist in the development of efficient, safe and sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals, metal recovery, remediation and decontamination technologies as well as the design of fuel cells, flow batteries and industrial electrochemical reactors.

The history of electrochemical engineering has been summarised by Wendt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendt|first1=H.|last2=Kreysa|first2=G.|title=The Scope and History of Electrochemical Engineering|journal=Electrochemical Engineering|pages=1-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03851-2_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lapicque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapicque|first1=F.|title=Electrochemical Engineering: An Overview of its Contributions and Promising Features|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=2004|volume=82|issue=12|pages=1571–1574|doi=10.1205/cerd.82.12.1571.58046}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stankovic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankovic|first1=V.|title=Electrochemical Engineering - its appearance, evolution and present status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13404">In car design, '''ground effect''' is a series of [[aerodynamic]] effects which have been exploited to create [[downforce]], particularly in racing cars. This has been the successor to the earlier dominant aerodynamic theory of streamlining. American racing [[IndyCar]]s employ ground effects in their engineering and designs, similarly they are also employed in other racing series to some extent; however [[Formula One]] and many other racing series, primarily across Europe, employ regulations (or complete bans) to limit its effectiveness on safety grounds.

==Theory==
In racing cars, a designer's aim is for increased downforce and grip to achieve higher cornering speeds. A substantial amount of downforce is available by understanding the ground to be part of the aerodynamic system in question, hence the name "ground effect". Starting in the mid-1960s, [[Wing (automotive)|'wings']] were routinely used in the design of race cars to increase downforce (this is ''not'' a type of ground effect). Designers shifted their efforts at understanding air flow around the perimeter, body skirts, and undersides of the vehicle to increase downforce with less drag than compared to using a wing.

This kind of ground effect is easily illustrated by taking a [[tarpaulin]] out on a windy day and holding it close to the ground: it can be observed that when close enough to the ground the tarp will be drawn towards the ground. This is due to [[Bernoulli's principle]]; as the tarp gets closer to the ground, the cross sectional area available for the air passing between it and the ground shrinks. This causes the air to accelerate and as a result pressure under the tarp drops while the pressure on top is unaffected, and together this results in a net downward force. The same principles apply to cars.

The Bernoulli principle is not the only mechanic in generating ground effect downforce. A large part of ground effect performance comes from taking advantage of [[viscosity]]. In the tarp example above neither the tarp nor the ground is moving. The [[boundary layer]] between the two surfaces works to slow down the air between them which lessens the Bernoulli effect. When a car moves over the ground the boundary layer on the ground becomes helpful. In the reference frame of the car, the ground is moving backwards at some speed. As the ground moves, it pulls on the air above it and causes it to move faster. This enhances the Bernoulli effect and increases downforce. It is an example of [[Couette flow]]. If a car were to get turned at a high enough speed, the car would generate lift and possibly make it take off, or "Blow-over".

While such downforce-producing aerodynamic techniques are often referred to with the catch-all term "ground effect", they are not strictly speaking a result of the same aerodynamic phenomenon as the [[Ground effect in aircraft|ground effect]] which is apparent in aircraft at very low [[altitude]]s.

==History==
American [[Jim Hall (race car driver)|Jim Hall]] built his developed [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] cars to both these principles, pioneering them. His 1961 car attempted to use the shaped underside method but there were too many other aerodynamic problems with the car for it to work properly. His 1966 cars used a dramatic high wing for their downforce. His [[Chaparral 2J]] "sucker car" of 1970 was revolutionary. It had two fans at the rear of the car driven by a dedicated [[two-stroke]] engine; it also had "skirts", which left only a minimal gap between car and ground, to seal the cavity from the atmosphere. Although it did not win a race, some competition had lobbied for its ban, which came into place at the end of that year. Movable aerodynamic devices were banned from most branches of the sport.&lt;ref name="Ground Effects"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formula One]] was the next setting for ground effect in racing cars. Several Formula One designs came close to the ground effect solution which would eventually be implemented by Lotus. In 1968 and 1969, [[Tony Rudd]] and [[Peter Wright (racing car designer)|Peter Wright]] at [[British Racing Motors]] (BRM) experimented on track and in the wind tunnel with long aerodynamic section side panniers to clean up the turbulent airflow between the front and rear wheels. Both left the team shortly after and the idea was not taken further. Robin Herd at [[March Engineering]], on a suggestion from Wright, used a similar concept on the 1970 March Formula One car. In both cars the sidepods were too far away from the ground for significant ground effect to be generated, and the idea of sealing the space under the wing section to the ground had not yet been developed.&lt;ref name="Ground Effects" /&gt;

At about the same time, Shawn Buckley began his work in 1969 at the Univ. of California - Berkeley on undercar aerodynamics sponsored by [[Colin Chapman]], founder of Formula One [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]. Buckley had previously designed the first high wing used in an [[IndyCar]], Jerry Eisert's "Bat Car" of the [[1966 Indianapolis 500]]. By proper shaping of the car's underside, the air speed there could be increased, lowering the pressure and pulling the car down onto the track. His test vehicles had a [[Venturi effect|Venturi]]-like channel beneath the cars sealed by flexible side skirts that separated the channel from above-car aerodynamics. He investigated how flow separation on the undersurface channel could be influenced by boundary layer suction and divergence parameters of the underbody surface.&lt;ref&gt;S. Buckley, "Vehicle Surface Interaction" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California - Berkeley, Sept., 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Shawn Buckley, "Road Test Aerodynamic Instrumentation", SAE paper 741030, 1974-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Shawn Buckley, Edmund V. Laitone, "Air Flow Beneath an Automobile", SAE paper 741028, 1974-02-01&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a mechanical engineering professor at MIT, Buckley worked with Lotus developing the [[Lotus 78]].

On a different tack, Brabham designer Gordon Murray used air dams at the front of his [[Brabham BT44]]s in 1974 to exclude air from flowing under the vehicle. Upon discovering that these tended to wear away with the pitching movement of the car, he placed them further back and discovered that a small area of negative pressure was formed under the car, generating a useful amount of downforce - around 150&amp;nbsp;lbs. McLaren produced similar underbody details for their McLaren M23 design.&lt;ref name="Ground Effects" /&gt;
[[Image:2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed Brabham BT46B Fan car.jpg|thumb|right|Brabham-Alfa's [[BT46|BT46B]] used a large fan to reduce underbody air pressure.]]
In 1977 Rudd and Wright, now at Lotus, developed the [[Lotus 78]] 'wing car', based on a concept from [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] owner and designer [[Colin Chapman]]. Its sidepods, bulky constructions between front and rear wheels, were shaped as inverted aerofoils and sealed with flexible "skirts" to the ground. The design of the radiators, embedded into the sidepods, was partly based on that of the [[de Havilland Mosquito]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team won 5 races that year, and 2 in 1978 while they developed the much improved [[Lotus 79]]. The most notable contender in 1978 was the [[Brabham]]-[[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] [[Brabham BT46|BT46B]] Fancar, designed by [[Gordon Murray]]. Its fan, spinning on a horizontal, longitudinal axis at the back of the car, took its power from the main gearbox. The car avoided the sporting ban by claims that the fan's main purpose was for engine cooling as less than 50% of the airflow was used to create a depression under the car. It raced just once, with [[Niki Lauda]] winning at the Swedish Grand Prix. The car's supreme advantage was proven after the track became oily. While other cars had to slow, Lauda was able to accelerate over the oil due to the tremendous downforce, which rose with engine speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was also observed to visibly squat when the engine was revved at a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forix.com/8w/fancar.html 8W - Why? - Brabham BT46B&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brabham's owner, [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who had recently become president of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], reached an agreement with other teams to withdraw the car after three races. However the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), governing body of Formula One and many other motor sports, decided to ban 'fan cars' with almost immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henry|1985|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lotus 79, on the other hand, went on to win six races and the world championship for [[Mario Andretti]] and gave teammate [[Ronnie Peterson]] a posthumous second place, demonstrating just how much of an advantage the cars had. In following years other teams copied and improved on the Lotus until cornering speeds became dangerously high, resulting in several severe accidents in 1982; flat undersides became mandatory for 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|1985|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the danger of relying on ground effects to corner at high speeds is the possibility of the sudden removal of this force; if the belly of the car contacts the ground, the flow is constricted too much, resulting in almost total loss of any ground effects.  If this occurs in a corner where the driver is relying on this force to stay on the track, its sudden removal can cause the car to abruptly lose most of its traction and skid off the track.

The effect was used in its most effective form in [[IndyCar]] designs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Racing series based in Europe and Australia have mainly followed the lead of Formula One and mandated flat undersides for their cars. This heavily constrains the degree to which ground effect can be generated. Nonetheless, as of 2007, Formula One cars still generate a proportion of their overall downforce by this effect: [[vortex|vortices]] generated at the front of the car are used to seal the gap between the sidepods and the track and a small diffuser is permitted behind the rear wheel centerline to slow down the high speed underbody airflow to free-flow conditions. High nose designs, starting with the [[Tyrrell 019]] of 1990, optimize the airflow conditions at the front of the car.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Porpoising==
Porpoising is a term that was commonly used to describe a particular fault encountered in ground effect racing cars.

Racing cars had only been using their bodywork to generate downforce for just over a decade when [[Colin Chapman]]'s [[Lotus 78]] and [[lotus 79|79]] cars demonstrated that ground effect was the future in Formula One, so, naturally, at this point, under-car aerodynamics were still very poorly-understood.  To compound this problem the teams that were keenest to pursue ground effects tended to be the more poorly-funded British "garagiste" teams, who had little money to spare for wind tunnel testing, and tended simply to mimic the front-running Lotuses (including the [[Kauhsen]] and [[Merzario]] teams).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

This led to a generation of cars that were designed as much by hunch as by any great knowledge of the finer details, making them extremely pitch-sensitive.  As the centre of pressure on the sidepod aerofoils moved about depending on the car's speed, attitude, and ground clearance, these forces interacted with the car's suspension systems, and the cars began to resonate, particularly at slow speeds, rocking back and forth - sometimes quite violently.  Some drivers were known to complain of sea-sickness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  This rocking motion, like a [[porpoise]] diving into and out of the sea as it swims at speed, gives the phenomenon its name.  These characteristics, combined with a rock-hard suspension, resulted in the cars giving an extremely unpleasant ride.  Ground effects were largely banned from Formula One in the early 1980s, but Group C sportscars and other racing cars continued to suffer from porpoising until better knowledge of ground effects allowed designers to minimise the problem.&lt;ref name="elleray"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mulsannescorner.com/bentleyelleray.html |title=Mulsanne's Corner: Peter Elleray on the Bentley LMGTP |last=Elleray |first=Peter |website=Mulsanne's Corner |access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Organic halide}}
{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}
A '''halide''' is a [[binary phase]], of which one part is a [[halogen]] [[atom]] and the other part is an [[chemical element|element]] or [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] that is less [[electronegative]] (or more electropositive) than the halogen, to make a [[fluoride]], [[chloride]], [[bromide]], [[iodide]], [[astatide]], or theoretically [[tennessine|tennesside]] compound. The alkali metals combine directly with halogens under appropriate conditions forming halides of the general formula, MX (X = F, Cl, Br or I). Many [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s are halides; the ''hal-'' syllable in ''halide'' and ''[[halite]]'' reflects [[Halogen#Etymology|this correlation]]. All [[Alkali metal|Group 1]] metals form halides that are white solids at room temperature.

A '''halide ion''' is a halogen atom bearing a negative charge. The halide [[anion]]s are [[fluoride]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[chloride]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[bromide]] (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[iodide]] (I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[astatide]] (At&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Such ions are present in all [[ionic bonding|ionic]] halide salts. [[Halide minerals]] contain halides.

All these halides are colourless, high melting crystalline solids having high negative enthalpies of formation.

==Tests==
Halide compounds such as [[Potassium chloride|KCl]], [[Potassium bromide|KBr]] and [[Potassium iodide|KI]] can be tested with [[silver nitrate]] solution, AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The halogen will react with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and form a [[precipitate]], with varying colour depending on the halogen:
* [[Silver(I) fluoride|AgF]]: no precipitate
* [[Silver chloride|AgCl]]: white
* [[Silver bromide|AgBr]]: creamy (pale yellow)
* [[Silver iodide|AgI]]: green (yellow)

For organic compounds containing halides, the [[Beilstein test]] is used.

==Uses==
[[:Category:Metal halides|Metal halides]] are used in [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s called [[metal halide lamp]]s, such as those used in  modern [[street light]]s.  These are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy-efficient]] than [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, and have much better [[colour rendition]] than [[orange (colour)|orange]] [[Sodium-vapor lamp|high-pressure sodium lamps]]. Metal halide lamps are also commonly used in [[greenhouse]]s or in rainy climates to supplement natural [[sunlight]].

[[Silver halide]]s are used in [[photographic film]]s and [[photographic paper|papers]]. When the film is [[photographic processing|developed]], the silver halides which have been exposed to light are reduced to metallic silver, forming an image.

Halides are also used in solder paste, commonly as a Cl or Br equivalent.&lt;ref name="indium"&gt;[http://www.indium.com/halogen-free/assets/PDF/Indium8_9HF_Overview.pdf Halogen-Free Solder Paste]&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic [[organic chemistry]] often incorporates halogens into [[organohalide]] compounds.

==Compounds==
Examples of halide compounds are:
* [[Sodium chloride]] (NaCl)
* [[Potassium chloride]] (KCl)
* [[Potassium iodide]] (KI)
* [[Lithium chloride]] (LiCl)
* [[Copper(II) chloride]] (CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Silver chloride]] (AgCl)
* [[Calcium chloride]] (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Chlorine fluoride]] (ClF)
* [[Organohalide]]s
** [[Bromomethane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br)
** [[Iodoform]] (CHI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl)

The '''Hantangang Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] currently under construction on the [[Hantan River]] in [[Yeoncheon County]], [[Gyeonggi]] Province, South Korea. Construction on the dam began in 2007 and it is expected to be completed in mid-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circumference including three dams promote the final decision in the second half|url=http://www.ecotiger.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=10388|publisher=Eco-Times|accessdate=22 February 2015|language=Korean|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of the dam will be [[flood control]] and it was proposed in 1998 after a series of deadly floods in the late 1990s. These floods killed 128 people, displaced over 31,000 and caused about US$900 million in property damage. Initially designed as a multi-purpose project, the design was changed solely to flood control in 2006 due to the concerns of residents upstream.&lt;ref name=USSD&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Un Il Baek, Wan Ho Lee, Tae Myoung Jeon|title=Flood Control Dam (Hantangang Dam)|journal=29th Annual USSD Conference|publisher=U.S. Society on Dams|date=April 2009|pages=1351–1362|url=http://ussdams.com/proceedings/2009Proc/1351-1364.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2015|location=Nashville, Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being implemented by [[Korea Water Resources Corporation]] (K-water).

==Construction==
Construction started in February 2007 and is expected to be complete in mid-2015. K-water is responsible for planning and supervision. [[Daelim]] is undertaking the construction as a leading contractor. Not only to secure the stability against overflow during the flood season but also to reduce the construction cost through the mechanized construction fitting for the mega construction, the roller-compacted concrete (RCC) method has been applied. About 300 families will be displaced when the reservoir is filled.&lt;ref name=USSD/&gt;&lt;ref name="K-Water, Hantan River Flood Prevention Dam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikld.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=17630|title=K-Water, Hantan River Flood Prevention Dam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Hantangang Dam will be a {{Convert|83.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|690|m|ft|abbr=on}} long gravity dam constructed of [[roller-compacted concrete]]. It will have four [[spillway]]s; a service, emergency, lower sediment discharge and eco-corridor. All four together will have a maximum discharge of {{Convert|1950|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}}. The water storage capacity for the reservoir is {{Convert|270000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=USSD/&gt;

[[image:Bismuth crystal macro.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Synthetic bismuth crystal]]
A '''hopper crystal''' is a form of [[crystal]], defined by its "[[Gravity wagon|hopper]]ed" shape.

The edges of hoppered crystals are fully developed, but the interior spaces are not filled in. This results in what appears to be a hollowed out step [[Crystal_structure|lattice]] formation, as if someone had removed interior sections of the individual crystals. In fact, the "removed" sections never filled in, because the crystal was growing so rapidly that there was not enough time (or material) to fill in the gaps. The interior edges of a hoppered crystal still show the crystal form characteristic to the specific [[mineral]], and so appear to be a series of smaller and smaller stepped down miniature versions of the original crystal.

Hoppering occurs when [[electricity|electrical attraction]] is higher along the edges of the crystal; this causes faster growth at the edges than near the face centers.  This attraction draws the mineral [[molecule]]s more strongly than the interior sections of the crystal, thus the edges develop more quickly.  However, the basic physics of this type of growth is the same as that of [[dendrite (crystal)|dendrite]]s but, because the anisotropy in the solid–liquid inter-facial energy is so large, the dendrite so produced exhibits a faceted morphology.

Hoppering is common in many minerals, including lab-grown [[bismuth]], [[galena]], [[quartz]] (called skeletal or fenster crystals), [[gold]], [[calcite]], [[halite]] (salt), and [[water]] (ice).

The '''Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant''' or '''Chin Shan Nuclear Power Plant'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/chin-san/ |title=Chin Shan Nuclear Power Plant |publisher=Power Technology |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (金山核能發電廠), '''First Nuclear Power Plant''' (第一核能發電廠 or 核一), is a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Shimen District|Shimen]], [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. Commissioned in 1978 for its first [[nuclear reactor]], the plant is Taiwan's first nuclear power plant as well as Taiwan's smallest nuclear power plant.

==Generation==
The power plant can generate 9 billion kWh of electricity per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/10/2003587711 |title=Taipower mulls extending use of three nuclear plants |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two [[spent fuel pool]]s at the plant have 3,074 and 3,076 [[control rod]]s respectively with a maximum storage of 3,083 rods per pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/05/28/2003647293|title=Nuclear power rotation plan mulled|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decommissioning plan==

Taipower, as the operator of the power plant, was required by the [[Radiation Monitoring Center]] of the [[Atomic Energy Council]] to hand in the 2018 decommissioning plans for the plant by December 2015 for the authority to review all of the plans before the decommissioning date. Once the reactors have been shut down,  the plant should be dismantled within 25 years.&lt;ref name="pimagazine-asia1"/&gt;

Taipower plans to allocate NT$18.2 billion for the disposal of nuclear waste from the decommissioned plant over the next 25 years. Currently Taipower is doing feasibility study of building a nuclear waste storage facility on an uninhabited island around Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201603010030.aspx|title=Taipower mulling plan for nuclear waste treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

===2013===
The '''July 2013''' [[Typhoon Soulik (2013)|Typhoon Soulik]] caused a trip to the generator and turbine of the power plant Unit-2 because one suspension ground line failed and hit the transmission line when the typhoon hit the island on 13–14 July. The typhoon also caused the seawater inlet to be blocked by large amount of debris and damaged three fine filters, traveling filter rake and the plant's switchyard. The damage caused the plant to be offline for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nucnet.org/all-the-news/2013/07/16/taiwan-s-chinshan-2-faces-repairs-after-typhoon-shutdown |title=Taiwan’s Chinshan-2 Faces Repairs After Typhoon Shutdown |publisher=Nucnet.org |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Taiwan_reactor_offline_after_typhoon_1607131.html |title=Taiwan reactor offline after typhoon |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''August 2013''', it was reported that there might have been radioactive water leaks for three years from the storage pools of the nuclear power plant's two reactors. Official from [[Taipower]] said that the water might come from different sources, such as condensation water or water used for cleaning up the floors. The water however has been collected in a reservoir next to the storage pools used for spent nuclear rods and has been recycled back into the storage pools, thus is claimed to pose no threat to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=08/09/2013 12:07 am EDT |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/09/taiwan-nuclear-power-plant-leak_n_3729659.html |title=Taiwan's First Nuclear Power Plant In Shihmen May Have Been Leaking Radioactive Water For 3 Years |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2013-08-09|accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''December 2013''', the circulating pump of the second reactor tripped due to the low lube oil pressure which caused a built-in lube oil pump. The [[Atomic Energy Council]] was criticized due to their very slow respond in giving answers to the public only 10 hours after the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/12/18/2003579283 |title=AEC criticized on Jinshan plant safety |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
On '''10 December 2014''', two reactors were deactivated for annual maintenance operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/04/29/434717/Natural-gas.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''28 December 2014''', the number 1 reactor of the plant was shutdown and went out of service due to a component failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201504270010.aspx|title=Reactor shut down after fire at 3rd nuclear power plant (update)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
On '''16 May 2015''', an air conditioning unit in the seawater pump house of the plant caught fire. The fire was put out immediately and did not cause any safety concern or affect the power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201505160027.aspx|title=Air conditioner at nuclear power plant catches fire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
On '''10 March 2016''', a reactor of the plant was shut down due to a higher than normal water level caused by negligence from the plant employees who inadvertently touched a power button. Safety inspection was completed on 14 March 2016 and the plant resumed its operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201603140029.aspx|title=Taipower apologizes over nuclear power plant mishap|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''4 August 2016''', smoke rose out from the power plant resulted from unstable voltage frequency which caused external [[circuit breaker]]s to trip and produced smoke.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2016/08/06/474618/Smoke-at.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
On '''2 June 2017''', a reactor of the plant tripped after a [[transmission tower]] on a nearby hilltop toppled due to heavy rain. The second reactor was subsequently shut down automatically as a safety measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201706020012.aspx|date=2 June 2017|first1=Li-yun|last1=Huang|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hsu|title=Nuclear reactor trips as electric pylon falls during rain|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
On '''11 June 2018''', the emergency backup generators were started unexpectedly due to the sudden voltage drop from an incoming high voltage transmission line. They were started at 6:42 a.m. and were shut down at 9:03 a.m. after the power line had returned to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3454425|date=11 June 2018|title=No threat from generator incident at nuclear plant: Taipower|publisher=Taiwan News|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Kohn anomaly''' is an anomaly in the dispersion relation of a [[phonon]] branch in a metal. For a specific [[wavevector]], the [[frequency]]—and thus the [[energy]]—of the associated phonon is considerably lowered, and there is a discontinuity in its [[derivative]]. They have been first proposed by [[Walter Kohn]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohn|first=W.|title=Image of the Fermi Surface in the Vibration Spectrum of a Metal|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume=2|pages=393–394|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.2.393}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases (that can happen in low-dimensional materials), the energy of this phonon is zero, meaning that a static distortion of the lattice appears. This is one explanation for [[Spin density wave|charge density waves]] in solids. The wavevectors at which a Kohn anomaly is possible are the nesting vectors of the [[Fermi surface]], that is vectors that connect a lot of points of the Fermi surface (for a one-dimensional chain of atoms this vector would be &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;).

In the phononic spectrum of a metal a Kohn anomaly is a discontinuity in the derivative of the dispersion relation that occurs at certain high symmetry points of the first [[Brillouin zone]], produced by the abrupt change in the screening of lattice vibrations by conduction electrons. 
Kohn anomalies arise together with [[Friedel oscillations]] when one considers the [[Lindhard approximation]] instead of the [[Thomas-Fermi approximation]] in order to find an expression for the [[dielectric function]] of a homogeneous electron gas. The expression for the [[real part]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \operatorname{Re}(\epsilon (\mathbf{q}, \omega)) &lt;/math&gt; of the [[Reciprocal lattice#Reciprocal space|reciprocal space]] [[dielectric function]] obtained following the [[Lindhard theory]] includes a logarithmic term that is singular at &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \mathbf{q} = 2\mathbf{k}_{\rm F} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \mathbf{k}_{\rm F} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi energy#Related quantities|Fermi wavevector]]. Although this singularity is quite small in reciprocal space, if one takes the [[Fourier transform]] and passes into real space, the [[Gibbs phenomenon]] causes a strong oscillation of &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \operatorname{Re}(\epsilon (\mathbf{r}, \omega)) &lt;/math&gt; in the proximity of the singularity mentioned above. In the context of phonon [[dispersion relation]]s, these oscillations appear as a vertical [[tangent]] in the plot of &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \omega ^2(\mathbf{q}) &lt;/math&gt;, called the Kohn anomalies.

Many different systems exhibit Kohn anomalies, including [[graphene]],&lt;ref name="kohngraphene_prl2004"&gt;S. Piscanec, M. Lazzeri, F. Mauri, A. C. Ferrari, and J. Robertson, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.185503 Kohn Anomalies and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Graphite], ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', '''93''', 185503 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; bulk metals,&lt;ref name="pdkohn"&gt;D. A. Stewart, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/10/4/043025 Ab initio investigation of phonon dispersion and anomalies in palladium], ''New J. Phys.'', '''10''', 043025 (2008) ''Open Access article''&lt;/ref&gt; and many low-dimensional systems (the reason involves the condition &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \mathbf{q} = 2 \mathbf{k}_{\rm F} &lt;/math&gt;, which depends on the [[topology]] of the [[Fermi surface]]). However, it is important to emphasize that only materials showing [[metal]]lic behaviour can exhibit a Kohn anomaly, as we are dealing with approximations that need a homogeneous electron gas.&lt;ref&gt;'''R. M. Martin''', ''Electronic Structure, Basic Theory and Practical Methods'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-78285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''load following power plant''', regarded as producing '''[[Merit order|mid-merit]]''' or mid-priced electricity, is a [[power plant]] that adjusts its power output as demand for [[electricity]] fluctuates throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems By Gilbert M. Masters p.&amp;nbsp;140&lt;/ref&gt; Load following plants are typically in-between [[base load power plant|base load]] and [[peaking power plant]]s in efficiency, speed of start up and shut down, construction cost, cost of electricity and [[capacity factor]].

==Base load and peaking power plants==

[[Base load power plant]]s operate at maximum output. They shut down or reduce power only to perform maintenance or repair.  Base load power plants include [[coal]], [[fuel oil]], almost all [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[biomass]] and [[combined cycle]] [[natural gas]] plants.

[[Peaking power plant]]s operate only during times of peak demand. In countries with widespread [[air conditioning]], demand peaks around the middle of the afternoon, so a typical peaking power plant may start up a couple of hours before this point and shut down a couple of hours after. However, the duration of operation for peaking plants varies from a good portion of the waking day to only a couple of dozen hours per year. Peaking power plants include hydroelectric and [[gas turbine]] power plants. Many gas turbine power plants can be fueled with natural gas, fuel oil, and/or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. While most gas turbine plants primarily burn natural gas, a supply of fuel oil and/or diesel is sometimes kept on hand in case the gas supply is interrupted. Other gas turbines can only burn a single fuel.

==Load following power plants==

Load following power plants run during the day and early evening. They either shut down or greatly curtail output during the night and early morning, when the demand for electricity is the lowest. The exact hours of operation depend on numerous factors. One of the most important factors for a particular plant is how efficiently it can convert fuel into electricity. The most efficient plants, which are almost invariably the least costly to run per [[kilowatt-hour]] produced, are brought online first. As demand increases, the next most efficient plants are brought on line and so on. The status of the [[electrical grid]] in that region, especially how much base load generating capacity it has, and the variation in demand are also very important. An additional factor for operational variability is that demand does not vary just between night and day. There are also significant variations in the time of year and day of the week. A region that has large variations in demand will require a large load following or peaking power plant capacity because base load power plants can only cover the capacity equal to that needed during times of lowest demand.

Load following power plants can be hydroelectric power plants, [[Diesel generator|diesel and gas engine]] power plants, combined cycle gas turbine power plants and steam turbine power plants that run on natural gas or heavy [[fuel oil]], although heavy fuel oil plants make up a very small portion of the energy mix. A relatively efficient model of gas turbine that runs on natural gas can also make a decent load following plant.

===Gas turbine power plants===
Gas turbine power plants are the most flexible in terms of adjusting power level, but are also among the most expensive to operate.  Therefore, they are generally used as "peaking" units at times of maximum power demand. Gas turbines find only limited application as prime movers for power generation; one such use is power generation at remote military facilities, mine sites and rural or isolated communities. This is because gas turbine generators typically have significantly higher heat loss rates than steam turbine or diesel power plants; their higher fuel costs quickly outweigh their initial advantages in most applications. Applications to be evaluated include:
# Supplying relatively large power requirements in a facility where space is at a significant premium, such as hardened structures.
# Mobile, temporary or difficult access site such as isolated communities, isolated mine sites, or troop support or line-of-sight stations.
# Peak shaving, in conjunction with a more-efficient generating station.
# Emergency power, where a gas turbine’s lightweight and relatively vibration-free operation are of greater importance than fuel consumption over short periods of operation. However, the starting time of gas turbines may not be suitable for a given application.
# [[Combined cycle]] or [[cogeneration]] power plants where turbine exhaust waste heat can be economically used to generate additional power and thermal energy for process or space heating.

===Diesel and gas engine power plants===
Diesel and gas engine power plants can be used for base load to stand-by power production due to their high overall flexibility. Such power plants can be started rapidly to meet the grid demands. These engines can be operated efficiently on a wide variety of fuels, adding to their flexibility.

Some applications are: base load power generation, wind-diesel, load following, cogeneration and trigeneration.

===Hydroelectric power plants===

[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] power plants can operate as base load, load following or peaking power plants. They have the ability to start within minutes, and in some cases seconds. How the plant operates depends heavily on its water supply as many plants do not have enough water to operate anywhere near their full capacity on a continuous basis.

Where [[hydroelectric dam]]s or associated reservoirs exist, these can often be backed up, reserving the hydro draw for a peak time, but this introduces ecological &amp; mechanical stress &amp; so is practiced less today than previously.  Lakes and man made reservoirs used for hydropower come in all sizes, holding enough water for as little as a one-day supply (a diurnal peak variance), or as much as a whole year's supply (allowing for seasonal peak variance). A plant with a reservoir that holds less than the annual river flow may change its operating style depending on the season of the year. For example, the plant may operate as a peaking plant during the dry season, as a base load plant during the wet season and as a load following plant between seasons. A plant with a large reservoir may operate independently of wet and dry seasons, such as operating at maximum capacity during peak heating or cooling seasons.

::When electrical generation supplying the grid and the consumption or load on the electrical grid are in balance, the frequency of the alternating current is at its normal rate (either 50 or 60 cycles per second). Hydro electric power plants can be utilized for making extra revenue in an electric grid with erratic grid frequency. When grid frequency is above normal (ex; Indian grid frequency is exceeding the rated 50&amp;nbsp;Hz for most of the duration in a month/day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=page 13, Operational Performance Report for the Month of March 2015, NLDC|url=http://www.nldc.in/attachments/article/265/Monthly%20Report%20March%202015.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524081145/http://www.nldc.in/attachments/article/265/Monthly%20Report%20March%202015.pdf|archivedate=24 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the extra power available can be consumed by adding extra load (say agriculture water pumps) to the grid and this new energy draw is available at nominal price or no price. However, there may not be a guarantee of continued supply at that price when the grid frequency falls below normal, which would then call for a higher price.

::To arrest the fall of frequency below normal, the available hydro power plants are kept in no load/nominal load operation and the load is automatically ramped up or down strictly following the grid frequency (i.e. the hydro units would run at no load condition when frequency is above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and generate power up to full load in case the grid frequency is below 50&amp;nbsp;Hz). Thus a utility can draw two or more times energy from the grid by loading the hydro units less than 50% of the duration and the effective use of available water is enhanced more than twice the conventional peak load operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Load acceptance criteria for hydro electric power plants, CEA, India |url=http://www.cea.nic.in/more_upload/load_acceptance_report.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coal based power plants ===
Large size coal fired thermal power plants can also be used as load following / variable load power stations to varying extents, with [[Anthracite|hard coal]] fueled plants typically being significantly more flexible than [[lignite]] fueled coal plants. Some of the features which may be found in coal plants that have been optimized for load following include:

* '''Sliding pressure operation:''' Sliding pressure operation of the steam generator allows the power plant to generate electricity without much deterioration in fuel efficiency at part load operation down to 75% of the [[nameplate capacity]].
* '''Over loading capability:''' The power plants are generally designed to run at 5 to 7% above the name plate rating for 5% duration in a year
* '''[[Utility frequency|Frequency]] follow governor controls:''' The load generation can be automatically varied to suit the grid frequency needs.
* '''Two shift daily operation for five days in a week:''' The needed warm and hot start up of these power stations are designed to take lesser time to achieve full load operation. Thus these power plants are not strictly base load power generation units.
* '''HP/LP steam bypass systems:''' This feature allows the steam [[turbo generator]] to reduce the load quickly and allows the [[Boiler|steam generator]] to adjust to the load requirement with a lag.

=== Nuclear power plants ===
Load following is the potential for a power plant to adjust its power output as demand and price for electricity fluctuates throughout the day. In nuclear power plants, this is done by inserting control rods into the reactor pressure vessel. This operation is very inefficient as nuclear power generation is composed almost entirely of fixed and sunk costs; therefore, lowering the power output doesn't significantly reduce generating costs. Moreover, the plant is thermo-mechanically stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Boarin|first2=Sara|last3=Pellegrino|first3=Francesco|last4=Ricotti|first4=Marco E.|date=2015-02-01|title=Load following with Small Modular Reactors (SMR): A real options analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421401295X|journal=Energy|volume=80|pages=41–54|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older nuclear (and coal) power plants may take many hours, if not days, to achieve a steady state power output.&lt;ref&gt;http://cip.management.dal.ca/publications/Ontario%20-%20US%20Power%20Outage%20-%20Impacts%20on%20Critical%20Infrastructure.pdf pg16&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern nuclear plants with light water reactors are designed to have strong maneuvering capabilities. Nuclear power plants in France and in Germany operate in load-following mode and so participate in the primary and secondary frequency control. Some units follow a variable load program with one or two large power changes per day. Some designs allow for rapid changes of power level around rated power, a capability that is usable for frequency regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Development, June 2011, page 10 from http://www.oecd-nea.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  A more efficient solution is to maintain the primary circuit at full power and to use the excess power for cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Boarin|first2=Sara|last3=Pellegrino|first3=Francesco|last4=Ricotti|first4=Marco E.|date=2015-02-01|title=Load following with Small Modular Reactors (SMR): A real options analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421401295X|journal=Energy|volume=80|pages=41–54|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Boiling water reactors====
[[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWRs) can vary the speed of recirculation water flow to quickly reduce their power level down to 60% of rated power (up to 10%/minute), making them useful for overnight load-following. They can also use control rod manipulation to achieve deeper reductions in power. A few BWR designs do not have recirculation pumps, and these designs must rely solely on control rod manipulation in order to load follow, which is possibly less ideal.&lt;ref name="LFNPP report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical and Economic Aspects of Load Following with Nuclear Power Plants|url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2011/load-following-npp.pdf|publisher=OECD Nuclear Energy Agency|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In markets such as [[Chicago, Illinois]] where half of the local utility's fleet is BWRs, it is common to load-follow (although potentially less economic to do so).

====Pressurized water reactors====
[[Pressurized water reactor]]s (PWRs) use a combination of a chemical shim (typically [[boron]]) in the moderator/coolant, control rod manipulation, and turbine speed control (see [[nuclear reactor technology]]) to modify power levels. For PWRs not explicitly designed with load following in mind, load following operation isn't quite as common as it is with BWRs. However, modern PWRs are generally designed to handle extensive regular load following, and both French and German PWRs in particular have historically been designed with varying degrees of enhanced load following capabilities.&lt;ref name="LFNPP report" /&gt;

France in particular has a long history of utilizing aggressive load following with their PWRs, which are capable of (and used for) both primary and secondary frequency control in addition to load following. French PWRs use "grey" and/or "black" control rods in order to maneuver power more rapidly than chemical shim control or conventional control rods allow. These reactors have the capability to regularly vary their output between 30–100% of rated power, to maneuver power up or down by 2–5%/minute during load following activities, and to participate in primary and secondary frequency control at ±2–3% (primary frequency control) and ±3–5% (secondary frequency control, ≥5% for N4 reactors in Mode X). Depending on the exact design and operating mode, their ability to handle low power operation or fast ramping may be partially limited during the very late stages of the fuel cycle.&lt;ref name="LFNPP report" /&gt;

====Pressurized heavy water reactors====
Modern CANDU designs have extensive steam bypass capabilities that allow for a different method of load following that does not necessarily involve changes in reactor power output. [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] is a CANDU pressurized heavy water reactor that regularly utilizes its ability to partially bypass steam to the condenser for extended periods of time while the turbine is operating to provide 300 MW per unit (2400 MW total for the eight-unit plant) of flexible (load following) operation capabilities. Reactor power is maintained at the same level during steam bypass operations, which completely avoids xenon poisoning and other concerns associated with maneuvering reactor power output.&lt;ref name="NECG NF"&gt;{{cite web|title=#12 - Nuclear Flexibility - Nuclear Economics Consulting Group|url=http://nuclear-economics.com/12-nuclear-flexibility/|website=Nuclear Economics Consulting Group|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSPE WEG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind and the Electrical Grid: Mitigating the Rise in Electricity Rates and Greenhouse Gas Emissions|url=https://www.ospe.on.ca/public/documents/advocacy/2012-wind-electrical-grid.pdf|publisher=Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE)|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BP BPRIA"&gt;{{cite web|title=BPRIA backgrounder|url=http://www.brucepower.com/bpria-backgrounder/|website=Bruce Power|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar PV and wind power plants==
{{See also|Availability-based tariff|Solar inverter|Tesla Powerwall}}

The variable power from renewable energy such as solar and wind power plants can be used to follow the load or stabilize the grid frequency with the help of various means of storage.  For countries that are trending [[Fossil fuel phase-out#Coal|away from coal fired]] baseload plants and towards [[intermittent energy source]]s such as wind and solar, that have not yet fully implemented [[smart grid]] measures such as [[demand side management]] to rapidly respond to changes in this supply, there may be a need for dedicated peaking or load following power plants and the use of a grid intertie, at least until the peak blunting &amp; load shifting mechanisms are implemented widely enough to match supply.  ''See smart grid alternatives below.''

[[Rechargeable battery]] storage units as of 2016, when custom-built new for this purpose without re-using [[electric vehicle]] batteries, could cost up to $450,000 per MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-10/news/70509643_1_storage-facility-storage-capacity-pwc-india |title=Big step for energy programme: Storage battery at 750-MW Andhra Pradesh solar plant likely |date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= stab/&gt; When the grid frequency is below the desired or rated value, the power being generated (if any) and the stored battery power is fed to the grid to raise the grid frequency. When the grid frequency is above the desired or rated value, the power being generated is fed or surplus grid power is drawn (in case cheaply available) to the battery units for energy storage. The grid frequency keeps on fluctuating 50 to 100 times in a day above and below the rated value depending on the type of load encountered and the type of generating plants in the electrical grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nldc.in/2013-03-12-10-34-42/frequency-profile|title= Frequency Profile, NLDC, GoI|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the cost of battery units, solar power plants, etc. have come down drastically to utilise secondary power for power grid stabilization as an on line [[Operating reserve|spinning reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Russell |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/30/tesla-powerwall-home-battery/#.uayvgx:LhV8 |title=Tesla’s $3,000 Powerwall Will Let Households Run Entirely On Solar Energy |date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= stab&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/05/18/3778623/new-economics-solar-plus-battery-storage/|title=Storing The Sun’s Energy Just Got A Whole Lot Cheaper |accessdate= 23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New studies have also evaluated of both wind and solar plant to follow fast load changes. A studies by Gevorgian et al have shown the ability of solar plants to provide load following and fast reserves in both island power system like Puerto Rico &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65368.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;and large power system in California&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67799.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Solar- &amp; wind-intensive grids &amp; smart grid approaches to following ===

The decentralized &amp; intermittent nature of solar &amp; wind generation entails building signalling networks across vast areas.  These include large consumers with discretionary uses, and increasingly include much smaller users. Collectively, these signalling &amp; communication technologies are called the "[[smart grid]]."  When these technologies reach into most grid-connected devices the term [[Energy Internet]] is sometimes used, though this is more commonly considered to be an aspect of the [[Internet of Things]].

In 2010, US [[FERC]] Chairman [[Jon Wellinghof]] outlined the [[Obama administration]]'s view that strongly preferred [[smart grid]] signalling over dedicated '''load following power plant''', describing following as inherently inefficient.  In [[Scientific American]] he listed some such measures:
*"turning off the defrost cycle on the refrigerator at a given time...the grid could signal...As long as that refrigerator got defrosted at the end of the day, you, as a consumer, wouldn't care but ultimately the grid could operate more efficiently."
*"...if you didn't do that with the refrigerator you would have do that with the coal plant or combustion turbine running up and down, and doing that makes that unit run much more inefficiently."

At the time, [[electric vehicle]] battery integration into the grid was beginning.  Wellinghof referred (ibid) to "these cars now getting paid in Delaware: $7 to $10 a day per car. They are getting paid over $3,000 a year to use these cars to simply control regulation service on the grid when they are charged".

== Electric vehicle batteries as distributed load following or storage ==

Due to the very high cost of dedicated battery storage, use of [[electric vehicle]] batteries both while charging in vehicles (see [[smart grid]]), and in stationary [[grid energy storage]] arrays as an end-of-life re-use once they no longer hold enough charge for road use, has become the preferred method of [[load following]] over dedicated power plants.  Such stationary arrays act as a true '''load following power plant''', and their deployment can "improve the affordability of purchasing such vehicles...Batteries that reach the end of their useful lifespan within the automotive industry can still be considered for other applications as between 70-80% of their original capacity still remains."&lt;ref&gt;https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=dubenrep&lt;/ref&gt;  Such batteries are also often repurposed in home arrays which primarily serve as backup, so can participate much more readily in grid stabilizing.  The number of such batteries doing nothing is increasing rapidly, e.g. in [[Australia]] where [[Tesla Powerwall]] demand rose 30x after major power outages &lt;ref&gt;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-powerwall-demand-after-australian-blackouts/&lt;/ref&gt;

Home &amp; vehicle batteries are always &amp; necessarily charged responsively when supply is available, meaning they all participate in a [[smart grid]], because the high load (one Japanese estimate was over 7GW for half the cars in Kanto &lt;ref&gt;https://www.intechopen.com/books/modeling-and-simulation-for-electric-vehicle-applications/load-leveling-utilizing-electric-vehicles-and-their-used-batteries&lt;/ref&gt;) simply cannot be managed on an analog grid, lest "The uncoordinated charging can result in creation of a new peak-load." (ibid).

Given the charging must be managed, there is no incremental cost to delay charging or discharge these batteries as required for [[load following]], merely a software change &amp; in some cases a payment for the inconvenience of less than complete charging or for battery wear (e.g. "$7 to $10 a day per car" paid in Delaware).

[[Rocky Mountain Institute]] in 2015 listed the applications of such distributed networks of batteries&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rmi.org/news/blog_2015_04_30_ten_things_likely_to_be_missing_from_teslas_stationary_storage_news/&lt;/ref&gt; as (for "ISOs / RTOs") including "energy storage can bid into wholesale electricity markets" or for utilities
*"[[Frequency regulation]]
*Spinning and non-spinning reserves
*[[Load following]] / [[energy arbitrage]]
*[[Black start]]
*[[Voltage support]]"

RMI claimed "batteries can provide these services more reliably and at a lower cost than the technology that currently provides a majority of them  thermal power plants (see above re coal &amp; gas)." Also that "storage systems installed behind the customer meter can be dispatched to provide deferral or adequacy services to utilities, such as:
*"Transmission and distribution upgrade deferral. When load forecasts indicate transmission or distribution nodes will exceed their rated load carrying capacity, incremental investments in energy storage can be used to effectively increase the node’s capacity and avoid large, overbuilt, expensive upgrades to the nodes themselves."
*Transmission congestion relief. At certain times of the day, ISOs charge utilities to use congested transmission lines. Discharging energy storage systems located downstream of congested lines can avoid these charges."
*"Resource adequacy. Instead of using or investing in combustion turbines to meet peak generation requirements, utilities can call upon other assets like energy storage instead."

==Solar thermal power plants==
[[Concentrated solar power|Solar thermal storage]] plants are emerging as cheaper and clean load following power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/dispatchable-solar-concentrated-solar-power-broke-price-records-in-2017/ |title=Dispatchable Concentrated Solar Power Broke Price Records in 2017 |accessdate= 22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/uaes-push-on-concentrated-solar-power-should-open-eyes-across-world/|title=UAE’s push on concentrated solar power should open eyes across world|accessdate= 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can cater the load demand perfectly and work as base load power plants when the  extracted solar energy is found excess in a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/aurora-what-you-should-know-about-port-augustas-solar-power-tower-86715/|title=Aurora: What you should know about Port Augusta’s solar power-tower |accessdate= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper mix of solar thermal storage and [[Photovoltaics|solar PV]] can fully match the load fluctuations without the need of costly battery storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/06/salt-silicon-or-graphite-energy-storage-goes-beyond-lithium-ion-batteries|title=Salt, silicon or graphite: energy storage goes beyond lithium ion batteries  |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-110/features/thermal-renewable-energy/commercializing-standalone-thermal-energy-storage.html|title=Commercializing Standalone Thermal Energy Storage |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marshall Major''' (Model 1967 &lt;ref name=doyle&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Michael|title=The History of Marshall: The Illustrated Story of "the Sound of Rock"|year=1993|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9780793525096|pages=43–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E90tMBs9_FEC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[guitar amplifier]] made by [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]]. It was introduced in 1967 as the "Marshall 200" (in reference to the wattage of the amplifier). It had a plexi panel and two inputs in one channel, but in contrast with the 100 watt heads made by Marshall, the first series had split tone controls similar to the Sound City amps. For the second series, in late 1968, Marshall reverted to ordinary [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|passive tone controls]], and was called "Marshall Major". Some authors claim the first version had active tone controls but this is incorrect, the schematics for all versions are available online.&lt;ref name=pittman&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittman|first=Aspen|title=The Tube Amp Book|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9780879307677|pages=75–76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT1I7Ld76YsC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amplifier was used by rock musicians who needed lots of volume. A notable user is [[Ritchie Blackmore]]; his Major had the two input channels cascaded into one, essentially creating the first Marshall with a master volume.&lt;ref name=pittman/&gt;

==Other versions==
The Major was also made as a PA amplifier, Model 1966 (from 1967 to 1971, with eight inputs in four channels; known in 1967 as the PA 200), and as a bass amplifier, Model 1978 (from 1967 to 1974).&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">The '''North Dakota Pipeline Company (NDPL) system''' is a 950-mile (1530&amp;nbsp;km) [[crude oil]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] system that collects oil from fields in the [[Williston Basin]] in [[Montana]] and [[North Dakota]] and transports it eastward to the [[Mandan Refinery]] in [[Mandan, North Dakota]] and to other pipeline systems that carry oil to other refineries in the [[Midwest]].  About 330 miles (530&amp;nbsp;km) of pipeline are used for collection from [[oil well]]s, and this connects to a 620-mile (1,000&amp;nbsp;km) main transportation line.

In addition to collecting oil from wells in the [[United States]], it also connects to a [[Canada|Canadian]] pipeline system owned by [[Enbridge]] at North Dakota's border with [[Saskatchewan]].  The American pipeline is owned by Enbridge Energy Partners, LP, an organization partly owned by the Canadian company.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The pipeline's eastern terminus is in [[Clearbrook, Minnesota]] where there is a junction with Enbridge's [[Lakehead System]] and the [[Minnesota Pipeline]] (ultimately owned by [[Koch Industries]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7162">'''Pultrusion''' is a continuous process for manufacture of [[composite material]]s with constant cross-section.  The term is a [[portmanteau]] word, combining "pull" and "[[extrusion]]".  As opposed to extrusion, which pushes the material, pultrusion works by pulling the material.

== History ==
A very early pultrusions type patent was filed by J.H. Watson in 1944. This was followed by M.J. Meek’s filing of 1950. The first commercial pultrusions were provided by Glastic Company of Cleveland, Ohio under the patent filed in 1952 by Rodger B. White. The patent issued to W. B. Goldsworthy in 1959 helped initiate the promotion and knowledge spread within the industry.  [[W. Brandt Goldsworthy]] is widely regarded as the inventor of pultrusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/brandt-goldsworthy-composites-visionary "Brandt Goldsworthy: Composites Visionary"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the work of Goldsworthy, who concentrated his work on unsaturated polyester resins, Ernst Kühne in Germany developed a quite similar process in 1954 based on epoxy resin.

Invention, development and the issuance of patents continue in the pultrusion field through today. A later innovation in this field has been developed and patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG in Germany 2008 and is described below.

== Process ==
[[Image:Pultrusion process 01.png|thumb|600px|center|Diagram of the pultrusion process.]]

1 - Continuous roll of reinforced fibers/woven fiber mat&lt;br /&gt;
2 - Tension roller&lt;br /&gt;
3 - Resin Impregnator&lt;br /&gt;
4 - Resin soaked fiber&lt;br /&gt;
5 - Die and heat source&lt;br /&gt;
6 - Pull mechanism&lt;br /&gt;
7 - Finished hardened fiber reinforced polymer

In the standard pultrusion process the reinforcement materials like [[fiber]]s or  woven or braided strands are impregnated with [[resin]], possibly followed by a separate preforming system, and pulled through a heated stationary [[die (manufacturing)|die]] where the resin undergoes [[polymerization]]. The impregnation is either done by pulling the reinforcement through a bath or by injecting the resin into an injection chamber which typically is connected to the die. Many resin types may be used in pultrusion including [[polyester]], [[polyurethane]], [[vinylester]] and [[epoxy]]. Resin provides the resistance to the environment, (i.e., the corrosion resistance, the UV resistance, the impact resistance, etc.) and the glass provides strength, in addition to safety from fire.

A surface veil can also be added to protect against erosion or “fiber bloom” and provide corrosion resistance and ultraviolet resistance. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertypultrusions.com/pultrusion-process/&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is not limited to [[thermosetting polymer]]s. More recently, pultrusion has been successfully used with [[Thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] matrices such as [[polybutylene terephthalate]] (PBT), [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) either by powder impregnation of the glass fiber or by surrounding it with sheet material of the thermoplastic matrix, which is then heated.

Ecological cleanness of manufactured products, in contrast to composites on thermosetting resins base, as well as practically unlimited possibilities of recycling (processing) after the resource depletion appear to be forcible arguments in favor of reinforced thermoplastics. For these reasons the industrial output and use of the given materials in highly industrialized countries have increased by 8-10% per year in recent decades. New developments (see process modifications) which enable the manufacturing not only of straight but also curved profiles are actually pushing the demand for this technology, especially in the automotive sector.

Pultrusion technology of manufacturing of fiber composites with polymer matrix appears to be energy-efficient and resource-saving.

Economic and environmental factors favor use of a thermoplastic matrix but due to the high viscosity of melts it is difficult to achieve high productivity and high quality of fiberfills impregnation with this type of matrix.

Products manufactured under this technology are widely used in the following industries:

- In the agriculture and chemical industries for manufacturing of chemically resistant to aggressive media slatted floors with enhanced strength characteristics used in the construction of livestock facilities, chemical plants, etc.;

- in the construction industry for the production of glass-fiber reinforcement, profiles, carcasses, stiffening bars for PVC-windows, etc.;

- in the aerospace industry for manufacturing of structure components of aircraft;

- in the sports and tourism industries for manufacturing of equipment exhibiting enhanced strength properties: skis, ski poles, golf course flagsticks, tent and hovel constructions, etc.;

- in electrical power engineering for manufacturing of dielectric structures, fiberglass rods used in composite insulators and as supporting structures for elements of signaling blocks, and fiberglass profiles used in manufacturing of transformers and electric motors;

- in commercial production, using grains of long-fiber molding material (LLM) as a raw material for subsequent manufacturing of structures and products with enhanced strength and chemical properties;

- in the automotive industry for the production of structural and complex parts of the vehicles with enhanced stiffness, rigidity and lightness;

- and in many other industries and plants, using mechanisms, structures and materials, which meet high standards of chemical, dielectric and strength stability.

== Process modifications ==
As the materials are pulled through a die in the standard pultrusion process the process is only suited to manufacture straight profiles.

In a recently developed modification of the process, developed and patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG, the die is no longer stationary but moving back and forth along the profile to be manufactured. This modified process, known as "Radius-Pultrusion" allows also to manufacture two- and three-dimensional curved profiles. It also is beneficiary for a number of tasks in the linear process especially if quite complex textile reinforcements with a low rate of distortion are needed.

[[File:Flexible pultruded profile.png|thumb|Flexible pultruded 3D-profile]]
[[File:Process Steps Radius-Pultrusion.png|Process Steps Radius-Pultrusion]]

== Equipment ==
The design of pultrusion machines varies.  Two often used types are reciprocating (hand-over-hand) and continuous (cat-track).

For the radius pultrusion process the layout of the machines has two moving stages similar to the hand over hand pulling unit, but as the process is intermittent with only one puller and the mould mounted on the stage of other one. Whether the stages are moving linear or circular depends on the type of profiles to be manufactured. The minimum radius for a linear machine with rotating stages is approx. 2 m. For smaller radii a circular movement of the mould and gripper stage is necessary.

[[File:R1 KTH.jpg|thumb|The R1 nuclear reactor in the 1960s.]]
'''R1''' was the first [[nuclear reactor]] of [[Sweden]]. It was a [[research reactor]] located at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (KTH) campus at Valhallavägen in central [[Stockholm]], in the rock beneath the current-day Q buildings. The reactor was active from July 13, 1954 to June 6, 1970. The reactor was dismantled, and there is nothing left of it today; the reactor hall however still exists.

The capacity of the reactor was originally 300 [[Watt|kW]] but was later increased to 1 MW.

In 2016, the reactor hall was used to film the music video for [[Alan Walker (artist)|Alan Walker]]'s song ''[[Faded (Alan Walker song)#Faded .28Restrung.29|Faded (Restrung)]]''. The video was released on 11 February 2016.&lt;ref name="YouTube_PBl8L9uEwPY"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alan Walker - Faded Restrung Video (Behind The Scenes) |publisher=Alan Walker / via YouTube |date=2016-04-05 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8L9uEwPY |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--note that cite video may apply better--&gt;{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Alan |title=Faded (Restrung) |publisher=Alan Walker &amp;amp; MER Musikk, Sony Music Entertainment Sweden AB / via YouTube |date=2016-02-11 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDmzGLrdjxQ |accessdate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15766">[[Image:reinforced solids cube.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: Small cube of a material with reinforcing bars. The cube is cracked and the material above the crack is removed to show the reinforcement that crosses the crack.]]

In [[solid mechanics]], a '''reinforced solid''' is a [[brittle]] material that is reinforced by [[ductile]] bars or fibres. A common application is [[reinforced concrete]]. When the concrete cracks the tensile force in a crack is not carried any more by the concrete but by the steel reinforcing bars only. The reinforced concrete will continue to carry the load provided that sufficient reinforcement is present. A typical design problem is to find the smallest amount of reinforcement that can carry the [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] on a small cube (Fig. 1). This can be formulated as an [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] problem.

==Optimization problem==

The reinforcement is directed in the x, y and z direction. The reinforcement ratio is defined in a cross-section of a reinforcing bar as the reinforcement area &lt;math&gt;A_{r}&lt;/math&gt; over the total area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, which is the brittle material area plus the reinforcement area.

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;A_{rx}&lt;/math&gt; / &lt;math&gt;A_{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{y}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;A_{ry}&lt;/math&gt; / &lt;math&gt;A_{y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{z}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;A_{rz}&lt;/math&gt; / &lt;math&gt;A_{z}&lt;/math&gt;

In case of reinforced concrete the reinforcement ratios are usually between 0.1% and 2%. The [[yield stress]] of the reinforcement is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f_{y}&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Stress (mechanics)|stress tensor]] of the brittle material is

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{xx} - \rho_{x} f_{y} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
\sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{yy} - \rho_{y} f_{y} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
\sigma _{xz} &amp; \sigma _{yz} &amp; \sigma _{zz} - \rho_{z} f_{y} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be interpreted as the stress tensor of the composite material minus the stresses carried by the reinforcement at yielding. This formulation is accurate for reinforcement ratio's smaller than 5%. It is assumed that the brittle material has no tensile strength. (In case of reinforced concrete this assumption is necessary because the concrete has small shrinkage cracks.) Therefore, the [[principal stresses]] of the brittle material need to be compression. The principal stresses of a stress tensor are its [[eigenvalues]].

The optimization problem is formulated as follows. Minimize &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\rho_{y}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\rho_{z}&lt;/math&gt; subject to all eigenvalues of the brittle material stress tensor are less than or equal to zero ([[Positive-definite matrix|negative-semidefinite]]). Additional constraints are &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 0, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{y}&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 0, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{z}&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 0.

==Solution==

The solution to this problem can be presented in a form most suitable for hand calculations.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N"/&gt; It can be presented in graphical form.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; It can also be presented in a form most suitable for computer implementation.&lt;ref name="H1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; In this article the latter method is shown.

There are 12 possible reinforcement solutions to this problem, which are shown in the table below. Every row contains a possible solution. The first column contains the number of a solution. The second column gives conditions for which a solution is valid. Columns 3, 4 and 5 give the formulas for calculating the reinforcement ratios.

&lt;math&gt;I_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{3}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress invariants]] of the composite material stress tensor.

The algorithm for obtaining the right solution is simple. Compute the reinforcement ratios of each possible solution that fulfills the conditions. Further ignore solutions with a reinforcement ratio less than zero. Compute the values of &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\rho_{y}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\rho_{z}&lt;/math&gt; and select the solution for which this value is smallest. The principal stresses in the brittle material can be computed as the eigenvalues of the brittle material stress tensor, for example by [[Jacobi method|Jacobi's method]].

The formulas can be simply checked by substituting the reinforcement ratios in the brittle material stress tensor and calculating the invariants. The first invariant needs to be less than or equal to zero. The second invariant needs to be greater than or equal to zero. These provide the conditions in column 2. For solution 2 to 12, the third invariant needs to be zero.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

==Examples==

The table below shows computed reinforcement ratios for 10 stress tensors. The applied reinforcement yield stress is &lt;math&gt;f_{y}&lt;/math&gt; = 500 N/mm². The [[Density|mass density]] of the reinforcing bars is 7800&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In the table &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the computed brittle material stress. &lt;math&gt;m_{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the optimised amount of reinforcement.

==Extension==

The above solution can be very useful to design reinforcement; however, it has some practical limitations. The following aspects can be included too if the problem is solved using [[convex optimization]]:
*Multiple stress tensors in one point due to multiple loads on the structure instead of only one stress tensor 
*A constraint imposed to crack widths at the surface of the structure 
*Shear stress in the crack (aggregate interlock) 
*Reinforcement in other directions than x, y and z 
*Reinforcing bars that already have been placed in the reinforcement design process 
*The whole structure instead of one small material cube in turn 
*Large reinforcement ratio's
*Compression reinforcement

==Bars in any direction==

Reinforcing bars can have other directions than the x, y and z direction. In case of bars in one direction the stress tensor of the brittle material is computed by

&lt;math&gt;
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{xx} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
\sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{yy} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
\sigma _{xz} &amp; \sigma _{yz} &amp; \sigma _{zz} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]

- \rho f_{y}

\left[{\begin{matrix}
\cos^2(\alpha) &amp; \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) &amp; \cos(\alpha)\cos(\gamma) \\
\cos(\beta)\cos(\alpha) &amp; \cos^2(\beta)  &amp; \cos(\beta)\cos(\gamma) \\
\cos(\gamma)\cos(\alpha) &amp; \cos(\gamma)\cos(\beta) &amp; \cos^2(\gamma) \\
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta, \gamma&lt;/math&gt; are the angles of the bars with the x, y and z axis. Bars in other directions can be added in the same way.

==Utilization==

Often, builders of reinforced concrete structures know, from experience, where to put reinforcing bars. Computer tools can support this by checking whether proposed reinforcement is sufficient. To this end the tension criterion,

The [[eigenvalues]] of &lt;math&gt;
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{xx} - \rho_{x} f_{y} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
\sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{yy} - \rho_{y} f_{y} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
\sigma _{xz} &amp; \sigma _{yz} &amp; \sigma _{zz} - \rho_{z} f_{y} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt; shall be less than or equal to zero.

is rewritten into,

The eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\frac{\sigma _{xx}}{\rho _{x} f _{y}}           &amp; \frac{\sigma _{xy}}{\sqrt{\rho _{x} \rho _{y}} f _{y}} &amp; \frac{\sigma _{xz}}{\sqrt{\rho _{x} \rho _{z}} f _{y}} \\
\frac{\sigma _{xy}}{\sqrt{\rho _{x} \rho _{y}} f _{y}} &amp; \frac{\sigma _{yy}}{\rho _{y} f _{y}}           &amp; \frac{\sigma _{yz}}{\sqrt{\rho _{y} \rho _{z}} f _{y}} \\
\frac{\sigma _{xz}}{\sqrt{\rho _{x} \rho _{z}} f _{y}} &amp; \frac{\sigma _{yz}}{\sqrt{\rho _{y} \rho _{z}} f _{y}} &amp; \frac{\sigma _{zz}}{\rho _{z} f _{y}} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt; shall be less than or equal to one.

The latter matrix is the utilization tensor. The largest eigenvalue of this tensor is the utilization (unity check), which can be displayed in a [[Contour line|contour plot]] of a structure for all [[Structural load|load combinations]] related to the [[Limit state design|ultimate limit state]].

For example, the stress at some location in a structure is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; = 4 N/mm², &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{yy}&lt;/math&gt; = -10 N/mm², &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{zz}&lt;/math&gt; = 3 N/mm², &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{yz}&lt;/math&gt; = 3 N/mm², &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xz}&lt;/math&gt; = -7 N/mm², &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; = 1 N/mm². The reinforcement yield stress is &lt;math&gt;f_{y}&lt;/math&gt; = 500 N/mm². The proposed reinforcement is &lt;math&gt;\rho_{x}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.4%, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{y}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.1%, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{z}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.9%. The eigenvalues of the utilization tensor are -20.11, -0.33 and 1.32. The utilization is 1.32. This shows that the bars are overloaded and 32% more reinforcement is required.

Combined compression and shear failure of the concrete can be checked with the [[Mohr-Coulomb theory|Mohr-Coulomb criterion]] applied to the eigenvalues of the stress tensor of the brittle material.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma_{1}}{f_{t}} + \frac{\sigma_{3}}{f_{c}} &lt;/math&gt; ≤ 1 ,

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the largest principal stress, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{3}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest principal stress, &lt;math&gt;f_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the uniaxial compressive strength (negative value) and &lt;math&gt;f_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is a fictitious tensile strength based on compression and shear experiments.

Cracks in the concrete can be checked by replacing the yield stress &lt;math&gt;f _{y}&lt;/math&gt; in the utilization tensor by the bar stress at which the maximum crack width occurs. (This bar stress depends also on the bar diameter, the bar spacing and the [[Concrete cover|bar cover]].) Clearly, crack widths need checking at the surface of a structure for stress states due to [[Structural load|load combinations]] related to the [[Limit state design|serviceability limit state]] only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2482">'''Richard Duncan''' is chief author of the [[Olduvai theory]], a prediction of rapidly declining world energy production. He has an MS in Electrical Engineering (1969) and a PhD in Systems Engineering (1973) from the [[University of Washington]].

The Olduvai theory holds that the ratio of [[world energy production]] per capita, which he denotes by the metric ''e'', will peak as the extraction rates of [[fossil fuel]]s fall increasingly behind demand, causing catastrophic social and [[economic collapse]], starting with massive [[power outage|electrical blackout]]s worldwide. He suggests that humans would eventually revert to a [[Stone Age|stone-age style]] of living after the majority of the [[World population|world's population]] dies off over the coming century. In 1996, Duncan claimed that ''e'' had peaked around 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duncan|first1=Richard|title=The Olduvai Theory: Sliding Towards a Post-Industrial Stone Age|url=http://jayhanson.org/page125.htm|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the theory was revised to hold that the ratio would begin to decline around 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dieoff.org/page224.htm The Peak Of World Oil Production And The Road To The Olduvai Gorge] by Dr Richard C. Duncan (2000). Retrieved 3 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The peak was again revised in 2013 to have occurred in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duncan|first1=Richard|title=The Olduvai Theory - Heading into the Gorge|url=http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_23_2/tsc_23_2_duncan.shtml|website=The Social Contract Press|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He bases his theory on the fact that a steep rise in global population and [[petroleum]] use almost parallel each other but population increases at a slightly faster rate than does energy use.

Duncan's research data, compiled in partnership with geologist Dr. Walter Youngquist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnforsustain.org/oil_duncan_and_youngquist_encircling_oil.htm Encircling the Peak of World Oil Production] - Richard C. Duncan and Walter Youngquist, June 1999, www.mnforsustain.org&lt;/ref&gt; have become widely used resources for those studying past and current trends in oil production and [[Oil depletion|depletion]].

'''S&amp;P Global Platts''' is a provider of energy and commodities information and a source of [[benchmark price]] assessments in the physical [[energy market]]s. The business was started with the foundation in 1909 of the magazine ''National Petroleum News'' by Warren C. Platt.&lt;ref name=plattshistory/&gt;

S&amp;P Global Platts and [[Argus Media]] are recognized as the two most significant price reporting agencies for the oil market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD364.pdf |title = Oil Price Reporting Agencies: Report by IEA, IEF, OPEC and IOSCO to G20 Finance Ministers | publisher=Jointly published by [[International Energy Agency]], [[International Energy Forum]], [[OPEC]] and [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] |date=October 2011| p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
From an original focus on the oil industry, S&amp;P Global Platts gradually expanded its purview to include [[metals]], shipping, and all energy-related markets – [[oil]], [[coal]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], [[nuclear power]], [[petrochemicals]], [[renewables]], and [[exhaust gas|emissions]].  S&amp;P Global Platts is a division of [[S&amp;P Global, Inc.]], ({{nyse|SPGI}}), a provider of ratings, benchmarks and analytics to the global capital and commodity markets. The firm is sister to brands like S&amp;P Global Ratings, [[S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence]] and [[S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices]]. It had been part of the Commodities &amp; Commercial group of S&amp;P Global, but that group saw all its assets, besides Platts, slowly sold off. It is now considered a stand-alone division of S&amp;P Global, though its President Martin Fraenkel reports into Mike Chinn, the head of S&amp;P Global's Market Intelligence group. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/martin-fraenkel-named-president-of-sp-global-platts-300336487.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Warren C. Platt (1883–1963) started the magazine ''National Petroleum News'' in [[Cleveland]], Ohio in 1909.  He expanded the business with the publication of the newsletter called ''Platts Oilgram'' in 1923, which went on to be recognized as an influential source for petroleum prices.  The companies founded by Platt that published prices and news were acquired in 1953 to become part of what was then known as McGraw-Hill group, which was later to become S&amp;P Global.  The publication activities that started with petroleum later expanded to cover energy and commodities, which were all undertaken by the division that became known as Platts.&lt;ref name="platts historical"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/AboutPlatts/Platts%20History-Full%20Summary_5-08-09Final_pdf.pdf| title=Platts – An Historical Perspective| publisher=S&amp;P Global| date=May 2009| accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 McGraw-Hill merged Platts with other like assets to turn the company into a provider of energy information.&lt;ref name="plattshistory"&gt;{{cite web| title=Platts History| url=http://www.platts.com/PlattsHistory.aspx| publisher=S&amp;P Global| accessdate=February 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2010, Platts' parent has made numerous acquisitions to significantly grow the Platts business. The acquired companies were Bentek&lt;ref&gt;https://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2010/121410&lt;/ref&gt;, Eclipse Energy &lt;ref&gt;https://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2014/071714&lt;/ref&gt;, Kingsman &lt;ref&gt;https://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2012/101112&lt;/ref&gt;, Minerals Value Service &lt;ref&gt;https://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2015/030315&lt;/ref&gt;, RigData &lt;ref&gt;https://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2016/060216&lt;/ref&gt; and PIRA &lt;ref&gt;https://www.platts.com/pressreleases/2016/080416&lt;/ref&gt;. An attempt to acquire OPIS in 2011 failed following market objections and Federal Trade Commission resistance. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-250826976.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Platts' first significant acquisition came in 2001, when it acquired FT Energy. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=wUIwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT56&amp;lpg=PT56&amp;dq=platts+to+acquire+FT+energy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mahEUGiibI&amp;sig=QHuj-8HjFOj0joXf4Ltt7yCxQ1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM7NqbmsbWAhVIsFQKHRknC4YQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=platts%20to%20acquire%20FT%20energy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; That acquisition gave it the Platts Global Energy Awards, considered one of the industry's biggest awards event, held every December in New York. &lt;ref&gt;https://geaweb.platts.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the company has held an annual Platts Global Metals Awards, modeled on the Platts Global Energy Awards. In 2015, these were held in London.&lt;ref name="finalistsannounced"&gt;{{cite web| title=Platts Global Metal Awards| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/finalists-announced-for-2015-platts-global-metals-awards-300051387.html | accessdate=April 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most if its territory is included in a natural park founded in 2002, covering an area of 17,257 ha.

It has a rectangular shape and altitudes higher than 1,000 metres, the highest peak being the [[Montcabrer]], at 1,389 metres high. To the north the Benicadell Mountain Range has a peak bearing the same name and is 1,104 metres high. The ''Serra'' is predominantly composed of [[limestone]]. The climate is largely [[mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]].

Covering these mountain ranges are some 200 or more different aromatic and medicinal plants with hundreds of different trees, which include a variety of [[Taxus baccata|yew]] unique to this area.

'''Sustainable biofuel''' is [[biofuel]] produced in a [[Sustainability|sustainable]] manner.

==Sustainability standards==
{{See also|Low-carbon fuel standard}}

In 2008, the Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels released its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels. This includes 12 principles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=1914 Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels releases proposed standards for review] ''[[Biomass Magazine]]'', August 18, 2008. Retrieved December 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#"Biofuel production shall follow international treaties and national laws regarding such things as air quality, water resources, agricultural practices, labor conditions, and more.
#Biofuels projects shall be designed and operated in participatory processes that involve all relevant stakeholders in planning and monitoring.
#Biofuels shall significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions as compared to fossil fuels. The principle seeks to establish a standard methodology for comparing greenhouse gases (GHG) benefits.
#Biofuel production shall not violate human rights or labor rights, and shall ensure decent work and the well-being of workers.
#Biofuel production shall contribute to the social and economic development of local, rural and indigenous peoples and communities.
#Biofuel production shall not impair food security.
#Biofuel production shall avoid [[biodiversity loss|negative impacts on biodiversity]], ecosystems and areas of high conservation value.
#Biofuel production shall promote practices that improve [[soil health]] and minimize degradation.
#Surface and groundwater use will be optimized and contamination or depletion of water resources minimized.
#[[Air pollution]] shall be minimized along the supply chain.
#Biofuels shall be produced in the most cost-effective way, with a commitment to improve production efficiency and social and environmental performance in all stages of the biofuel value chain.
#Biofuel production shall not violate land rights".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several countries and regions have introduced policies or adopted standards to promote sustainable biofuels production and use, most prominently the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. The 2009 [[Low-carbon fuel standard#EU low-carbon fuel standard|EU Renewable Energy Directive]], which requires 10 percent of transportation energy from [[renewable energy]] by 2020, is the most comprehensive mandatory sustainability standard in place as of 2010. 

''The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires that the lifecycle  [[greenhouse gas emission]]s of biofuels consumed be at least 50 percent less than the equivalent emissions from gasoline or diesel by 2017 (and 35 percent less starting in 2011). Also, the feedstocks for biofuels "should not be harvested from lands with high biodiversity value, from carbon-rich or forested land, or from wetlands".&lt;ref name=ren43&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;''
 
As with the EU, the [[Low-carbon fuel standard#EPA Renewable Fuel Standard|U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard]] (RFS) and the [[Low-carbon fuel standard#California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard|California Low Carbon Fuel Standard]] (LCFS) both require specific levels of lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions compared to equivalent fossil fuel consumption. The RFS requires that at least half of the biofuels production mandated by 2022 should reduce lifecycle emissions by 50 percent. The LCFS is a performance standard that calls for a minimum of 10 percent emissions reduction per unit of transport energy by 2020. Both the U.S. and California standards currently address only greenhouse gas emissions, but California plans to "expand its policy to address other sustainability issues associated with liquid biofuels in the future".&lt;ref name=ren43/&gt;

In 2009, [[Brazil]] also adopted new sustainability policies for [[sugarcane ethanol]], including "zoning regulation of sugarcane expansion and social protocols".&lt;ref name=ren43/&gt;

==Why it is needed?==
[[Biofuels]], in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]]. However, many of these first-generation biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

The challenge is to support second, third and fourth-generation biofuel development.
Second-generation biofuels include new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008).

Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of [[alternative energy]] sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, especially in the transport sector.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a [[sustainable transport]] strategy.

==Biofuel options==
Biofuel development and use is a complex issue because there are many biofuel options which are available.  Biofuels, such as [[ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]], are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[sugar cane]], [[palm oil]] and [[oilseed rape]]. Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct [[Food vs. fuel|competition with their use for food]] and animal feed, and claim that in some parts of the world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;The Royal Society (2008). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second generation biofuel]]s are now being produced from a much broader range of feedstocks including the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial grasses such as [[switchgrass]] and [[Miscanthus giganteus]]), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b822951c |author1=Oliver R.

In 2007, [[Ronald Oxburgh]] suggested in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' that production of biofuels could be either responsible or irresponsible and had several trade-offs: "Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none.  Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences.  In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Oxburgh, "Fuelling hope for the future." ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008 the Nobel prize-winning chemist [[Paul J. Crutzen]] published findings that the release of [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions in the production of [[biofuels]] means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A report commissioned by the United Nations, based on a detailed review of published research up to mid-2009 as well as the input of independent experts world-wide, found that ethanol from sugar cane as produced in Brazil  "''in some circumstances does better than just “zero emission”. If grown and processed correctly, it has negative emission, pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere, rather than adding it''. In contrast, the report found that U.S. use of [[maize]] for biofuel is less efficient, as sugarcane  can lead to emissions reductions of between 70% and well over 100% when substituted for gasoline.&lt;ref name=UNEP2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf|title=Towards Sustainable Production and Use of Resources: Assessing Biofuels|date=2009-10-16|accessdate=2009-10-24|publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other studies have shown that sugarcane-based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90% if there is no significant land use change.&lt;ref name="MLA_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethanol"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Goettemoeller, Jeffrey |author2=Adrian Goettemoeller |title=Sustainable Ethanol: Biofuels, Biorefineries, Cellulosic Biomass, Flex-Fuel Vehicles, and Sustainable Farming for Energy Independence|year=2007|publisher=Prairie Oak Publishing, Maryville, Missouri|page=42|isbn=978-0-9786293-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKRTFO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/govrecrfa.pdf|format=PDF|title=Carbon and Sustainability Reporting Within the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation|publisher=Department of Transport (UK)|date=January 2008|accessdate=2008-11-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625044948/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/govrecrfa.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study commissioned by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production.&lt;ref name="SusDutch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioenergytrade.org/downloads/sustainabilityofbrazilianbioethanol.pdf|title=Sustainability of Brazilian bio-ethanol|author1=Edward Smeets |author2=Martin Junginger |publisher=Copernicus Institute at [[Universiteit Utrecht]] and [[Universidade Estadual de Campinas]]|date=August 2006|accessdate=2008-11-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528051851/http://www.bioenergytrade.org/downloads/sustainabilityofbrazilianbioethanol.pdf |archivedate = May 28, 2008|display-authors=etal}} Report NWS-E-2006-110, {{ISBN|90-8672-012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping.

===Jatropha===

====India and Africa====
[[File:Bellyache Bush (Jatropha gossipifolia) in Hyderabad, AP W IMG 9219.jpg|thumb|''[[Jatropha gossipifolia]]'' in [[Hyderabad, India]]. ]]

Crops like [[Jatropha]], used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields.&lt;ref name=jat&gt;Ron Oxburgh. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/28/alternativeenergy.biofuels Through biofuels we can reap the fruits of our labours] ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 28, 2008.

[http://www.climateark.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=95429 As Biofuels Catch On, Next Task Is to Deal With Environmental, Economic Impact] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', March 24, 2008. Retrieved December 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too.&lt;ref name=jat/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Cambodia====

Cambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves, and is almost completely dependent on imported [[diesel fuel]] for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.&lt;ref name=cam&gt;Andrew Williamson. Cambodian Research Centre for Development (c2005). ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093603/https://www.nri.org/projects/biomass/conference_papers/biofuel_in_cambodia.pdf Biofuel: A Sustainable Solution for Cambodia?]'' Retrieved December 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price, independent of the international oil price. The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security, rural development opportunities and environmental benefits.  The [[Jatropha curcas]] species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia. Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia, based on the Jatropha or other sources, offers good potential benefits for the investors, the economy, rural communities and the environment.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

====Mexico====

Jatropha is native to Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors convinced it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE52A0JB20090311?pageNumber=1 Toxic jatropha Shrub Fuels Mexico's Biodiesel Push]&lt;/ref&gt; The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, in addition to being a corn producing region, also contains abandoned [[sisal]] plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/05/jatropha-planting-ycatan-mexico-biodiesel.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2011 [[Interjet]] completed the first Mexican aviation biofuels test flight on an [[Airbus A320]]. The fuel was a 70:30 traditional jet fuel biojet blend produced from Jatropha oil provided by three Mexican producers, Global Energías Renovables (a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S.-based [[Global Clean Energy Holdings]], Bencafser S.A. and Energy JH S.A. Honeywell's UOP processed the oil into Bio-SPK (Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) .&lt;ref&gt;[http://biodieselmagazine.com/articles/7702/mexico-hosts-successful-biofuels-test-flight Biodiesel Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Global Energías Renovables operates the largest Jatropha farm in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/04/04/interjet-airbus-complete-jatropha-aviation-biofuels-trial-in-mexico/ Biofuels Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2011 [[Aeromexico]], [[Boeing]], and the Mexican Government participated in the first biojet powered transcontinental flight in aviation  history. The flight from Mexico City to Madrid used a blend of 70 percent traditional fuel and 30 percent biofuel ([[aviation biofuel]]). The biojet was produced entirely from [[Jatropha oil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenaironline.com/news.php?viewStory=1308 GreenAir]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pongamia Pinnata in Australia and India ===
[[File:Pongamia Pinnata Seeds.jpg|thumb| ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' seeds in [[Brisbane, Australia]].]]
[[Pongamia pinnata]] is a legume native to Australia, India, Florida (USA) and most tropical regions, and is now being invested in as an alternative to Jatropha for areas such as Northern Australia, where Jatropha is classed as a noxious weed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24872142-36418,00.html More to noxious weed fuel than meets the sky] January 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweet sorghum in India===
[[Sweet sorghum]] overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops. With sweet sorghum, only the stalks are used for biofuel production, while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed. It is not in high demand in the global food market, and thus has little impact on food prices and food security. Sweet sorghum is grown on already-farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity, so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply.  Sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in India and does not require irrigation, an important consideration in dry areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Leahy. [http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42346 Can Sorghum Solve the Biofuels Dilemma?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515144450/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42346 |date=2008-05-15 }} ''[[IPS News]]'', May 13, 2008.

A study by researchers at the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf ''Sweet sorghum for food, feed and fuel''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904014010/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/8/4/0_6c06c9b61b19c20/840_be710da94740b90.pdf |date=2015-09-04 }} New Agriculturalist, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International collaboration on sustainable biofuels==

===Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials===

Public attitudes and the actions of key stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of sustainable biofuels. Informed discussion and dialogue, based both on scientific research and an understanding of public and stakeholder views, is important.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;The Royal Society (2008). p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable used meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions to develop a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production.&lt;ref&gt;EPFL Energy Center (2008). ''[http://cgse.epfl.ch/page65660.html  The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels: Ensuring Biofuels Deliver on their Promise of Sustainability]''  December 4, 2008. Retrieved December 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels launched a set of comprehensive sustainability criteria - the “RSB Certification System.” Biofuels producers that meet to these criteria are able to show buyers and regulators that their product has been obtained without harming the environment or violating human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ictsd.org/i/news/biores/103365/ |title=Sustainability Criteria for Biofuels Up and Running |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bridges Trade BioRes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable Biofuels Consensus===
The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to take decisive action to ensure the sustainable trade, production, and use of biofuels.  In this way biofuels may play a key role in energy sector transformation, climate stabilization, and resulting worldwide revitalisation of rural areas.&lt;ref name=consen&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/assets/documents/2008/FINAL%20SBC_April_16_2008.pdf Sustainable Biofuels Consensus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217093601/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/assets/documents/2008/FINAL%20SBC_April_16_2008.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }} hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center in [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]], Italy, March 24–28, 2008. Retrieved December 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus envisions a "landscape that provides food, fodder, fiber, and energy, which offers opportunities for rural development; that diversifies energy supply, restores ecosystems, protects [[biodiversity]], and [[carbon sequestration|sequesters carbon]]".&lt;ref name=consen/&gt;

===Better Sugarcane Initiative / Bonsucro===
{{See also|Bonsucro|l1=Bonsucro}}
In 2008, a multi-stakeholder process was initiated by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and the [[International Finance Corporation]], the private development arm of the [[World Bank]], bringing together industry, supply chain intermediaries, end-users, farmers and civil society organisations to develop standards for certifying the derivative products of [[sugar cane]], one of which is [[ethanol fuel]].&lt;ref name="SolomonBailis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christine Moser|author2=Tina Hildebrandt|author3=Robert Bailis|editor=Barry D.

The [[Bonsucro]] standard is based around a definition of sustainability which is founded on five principles:&lt;ref name="BonsucroGuide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonsucro.com/site/a-guide-to-bonsucro/ |title=A guide to Bonsucro |publisher=Bonsucro | accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Obey the law
# Respect human rights and labour standards
# Manage input, production and processing efficiencies to enhance sustainability
# Actively manage biodiversity and ecosystem services
# Continuously improve key areas of the business
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biofuel producers that wish to sell products marked with the Bonsucro standard must both ensure that they product to the Production Standard, and that their downstream buyers meet the Chain of Custody Standard. In addition, if they wish to sell to the European market and count against the [[Renewables Directive|EU Renewable Energy Directive]], then they must adhere to the Bonsucro EU standard, which includes specific greenhouse gas calculations following [[European Commission]] calculation guidelines.&lt;ref name="BonsucroGuide"/&gt;

==Oil price moderation==

Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price]] moderation. According to the [[Wall Street Journal]], crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;&lt;ref name=ark/&gt;

==Sustainable transport==
{{See also|BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport}}
Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a [[sustainable transport]] system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other [[renewable energy]] options and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.&lt;ref name=one&gt;The Royal Society (2008). pp.1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 an [[Air New Zealand]] jet completed the world's first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel.  More than a dozen performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from Auckland International Airport. A biofuel blend of 50:50 jatropha and Jet A1 fuel was used to power one of the Boeing 747-400's Rolls-Royce RB211 engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/30/biofuel-test-plane |title=Jatropha-fuelled plane touches down after successful test flight |author=Alok Jha  |date=30 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=3141 Boeing planes successfully fly with biofuels] ''Biodiesel magazine'', February 2009.

The company has also set general sustainability criteria, saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources, that they must be as good as traditional [[jet fuel]]s, and that they should be cost competitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/01/05/air-new-zealand-completes-biofuel-test Air New Zealand Completes Biofuel Test] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226222216/http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/01/05/air-new-zealand-completes-biofuel-test |date=2009-02-26 }} ''GreenBiz.com'', January 5, 2009.

In January 2009, [[Continental Airlines]] used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in North America. This demonstration flight marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a [[Boeing 737-800]], powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants. The algae oil was provided by [[Sapphire Energy]], and the jatropha oil by [[Terasol Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/Article.aspx?liArticleID=309553 Sustainable flight]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Engineer Online'', January 12, 2009.

In March 2011, [[Yale University]] research showed significant potential for [[sustainable aviation fuel]] based on jatropha-curcas. According to the research, if cultivated properly, "jatropha can deliver many benefits in Latin America and greenhouse gas reductions of up to 60 percent when compared to petroleum-based jet fuel". Actual farming conditions in Latin America were assessed using sustainability criteria developed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. Unlike previous research, which used theoretical inputs, the Yale team conducted many interviews with jatropha farmers and used "field measurements to develop the first comprehensive sustainability analysis of actual projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boeing-issues-first-latin-american-study-on-jatropha-sustainability-119013334.html |title=Boeing Issues First Latin American Study on Jatropha Sustainability |date=March 31, 2011 |work=PRNewswire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2011, revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to 50 percent biofuels. The renewable fuels "can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of ASTM D7566, Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/50-percent-biofuels-now-allowed-in-jet-fuel |title=50 Percent Biofuels Now Allowed in Jet Fuel |date=July 1, 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 million to eight companies to advance the development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting in the development of a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/12/faa-awards-7-7-million-for-advancement-of-aviation-biofuels |title=FAA Awards $7.7 Million for Advancement of Aviation Biofuels |author=Meg Cichon |date=2 December 2011  |work=Renewable Energy World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GreenSky London, a biofuels plant under construction in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/renewable-energy-biofuels-heat-up-1.15074 |title=Renewable energy: Biofuels heat up |author=Kim Krieger |date=23 April 2014 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the £340m scheme was mothballed in January 2016 following low crude oil prices, jittery investors and a lack of support from the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/06/ba-blames-uk-government-for-scrapping-of-340m-green-fuels-project |title=BA blames UK government for scrapping of £340m green fuels project |author=Arthur Neslen |date=6 January 2016  |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trikke''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|k}} {{respell|tr|EYE|k}}) is a chain-less, pedal-less, personal vehicle with a three-wheel frame. The rider stands on two foot platforms above the two rear wheels and steers the vehicle with handlebars attached to the lone front wheel. The patented cambering system is designed to provide a stable, three-point platform that lets the rider lean into turns while all three wheels remain in contact with the ground. There are several variations of the Trikke, from body-powered fitness machines, to battery-powered transportation and personal mobility vehicles. There are also Trikkes for children, as well as a version for snow-covered mountains called the Trikke Skki.

All Trikkes are designed and manufactured exclusively by Trikke Tech, Inc., based in Buellton, California.

A body-powered Trikke is propelled using a motion that moves the vehicle along a curved, S-shaped path (called “carving”). The rider moves the vehicle from side to side, turning the handlebars and leaning the front structure while moving one’s body weight toward the side one is turning into. The weight of the rider during a turn (or “carve”) is placed mainly on the foot at the outside of the turn. The inside foot will support very little weight and the rider will often lift the heel of this foot during the turn.

The resulting motion is similar to slalom skiing, a tic-tac move on a skateboard, or one’s leg movements during roller skating.

A Trikke can be propelled without the need to push off with one’s foot. There are many variations of Trikke-riding techniques as riders place different emphasis on the elements of the movement.

Using the carving motion, a body-powered Trikke can achieve speeds of nearly 30 km/h (19 mph), but more often, riders cruise around with average speeds in the 15 km/h (9.3 mph) range. A Trikke can be ridden uphill, albeit at a reduced speed.

Since 2009, Trikke Tech, Inc. has manufactured electric versions of the Trikke, which have been adopted by various law enforcement and security companies as an alternative to other personal electric vehicles. Additionally, many recreational riders now use electric Trikkes for personal transportation as well as hybrid fitness vehicles.


==History==
While similar three-wheel vehicles may have existed prior to the Trikke, the Trikke carving vehicle is the result of years of experimentation and development by Brazilian engineer Gildo Beleski. Starting in the late 1980s, Beleski began seeking different, more efficient ways for traveling downhill on early Trikke prototypes. That eventually lead to the revelation that his carving vehicles could also be used on flat surfaces and that they possessed the potential to provide a much more strenuous yet safe alternative to bikes, skateboards and other scooters.

Throughout the 1990s, Beleski continued to refine his design concepts, experimenting with geometric changes to the frame and wheels while adding features to improve body propulsion and the transfer of energy and movement from the rider to the road through the frame.

Simultaneously, the native Brazilian was working in the automotive industry and started his own business servicing high end cars. He also raced autos for fun and learned more about sheer performance and the importance of good handling.

By the late 90s, Beleski’s business brought him to the United States for several auto shows, and during one visit, a friend took him to Miami’s South Beach. There he was mesmerized by the sight of so many people enjoying recreation on wheels, be they in-line skates, skateboards or bicycles. Immediately he saw the potential for Trikkes.

After some soul searching, Beleski decided to dedicate his life to designing, developing and riding Trikkes as an entrepreneur in America. In 1999, he applied for a patent on an improved design for a three-wheel cambering vehicle with the US Patent Office. In 2000, he founded Trikke Tech, Inc., in Southern California, shipping 100 frames from Brazil and assembling Trikkes in his garage. Next, he took to the streets and begin demonstrating his Trikkes while talking to people and making friends.

Trikke three-wheel carving vehicles officially went on the market in 2002, and Time magazine named it one of the best inventions of that year.

Since then, over half a million body-powered Trikkes have been sold and Trikke riding groups have sprung up in the United States and many other countries.

Over the years, Trikke carving vehicles have been featured by numerous media outlets, including People magazine, Playboy, Men’s Health Magazine, the Los Angeles Times and the TV shows “Extra” and “The View.”

Additionally, many celebrities and public figures have been photographed riding Trikkes, including former President Jimmy Carter, NFL quarterback Cam Newton and actors Jennifer Aniston, Jim Belushi and Tori Spelling.

'''Tungsten''', or '''wolfram''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wolfram wolfram] on Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/wolfram wolfram] on Oxford Dictionaries.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''W''' and [[atomic number]] 74. The name ''tungsten'' comes from the former Swedish name for the [[tungstate]] [[mineral]] ''[[scheelite]]'', ''tung sten'' or "heavy stone".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Tungsten}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten is a [[rare metal]] found naturally on Earth almost exclusively combined with other elements in chemical compounds rather than alone. It was identified as a new element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important [[ore]]s include [[wolframite]] and [[scheelite]].

The [[free element]] is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest [[melting point]] of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422&amp;nbsp;°C (6192&amp;nbsp;°F, 3695&amp;nbsp;K). It also has the  highest [[boiling point]], at 5930&amp;nbsp;°C (10706&amp;nbsp;°F, 6203&amp;nbsp;K).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of [[uranium]] and [[gold]], and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of [[lead]].&lt;ref name="daintith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daintith |first=John |title=Facts on File Dictionary of Chemistry |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Checkmark Books |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-8160-5649-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically [[brittle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tungsten: properties, chemistry, technology of the element, alloys, and chemical compounds|first = Erik|last = Lassner|author2=Schubert, Wolf-Dieter | publisher = Springer|date = 1999|isbn = 978-0-306-45053-2|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=foLRISkt9gcC&amp;pg=PA20|chapter = low temperature brittleness|pages = 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gludovatz |first1=B. |last2=Wurster |first2=S. |last3=Weingärtner |first3=T. |last4=Hoffmann |first4=A. |last5=Pippan |first5=R. |title=Influence of impurities on the fracture behavior of tungsten |journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=2011 |volume=91 |issue=22 |pages=3006–3020 |doi=10.1080/14786435.2011.558861 |bibcode=2011PMag...91.3006G|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00688940 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardness|hard]] material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to [[metalworking|work]].

Tungsten's many alloys have numerous applications, including incandescent [[light bulb]] filaments, [[X-ray tube]]s (as both the filament and target), electrodes in [[gas tungsten arc welding]], [[superalloys]], and [[radiation protection|radiation shielding]]. Tungsten's hardness and high [[density]] give it military applications in penetrating [[projectile]]s. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial [[catalyst]]s.

Tungsten is the only metal from the third [[Transition metal|transition]] series that is known to occur in [[biomolecule]]s that are found in a few species of bacteria and [[archaea]].

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
In its raw form, tungsten is a hard steel-grey [[metal]] that is often [[brittle]] and hard to [[metalworking|work]]. If made very pure, tungsten retains its [[hardness]] (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes [[malleable]] enough that it can be worked easily.&lt;ref name="albert"/&gt; It is worked by [[forging]], [[drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]], or [[extrusion|extruding]]. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by [[sintering]].

Of all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest [[melting point]] (3422&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]], 6192&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]), lowest [[vapor pressure]] (at temperatures above 1650&amp;nbsp;°C, 3000&amp;nbsp;°F), and the highest [[tensile strength]].&lt;ref name="desu"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hammond, C. R. |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 81st| publisher =CRC press| isbn = 978-0-8493-0485-9| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[carbon]] remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimes]] at [[atmospheric pressure]] instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and [[tensile strength]] of tungsten originate from strong [[covalent bond]]s formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=foLRISkt9gcC&amp;pg=PA9|page=9|title=Tungsten: properties, chemistry, technology of the element, alloys, and chemical compounds|author=Lassner, Erik |author2=Schubert, Wolf-Dieter |publisher=Springer|date=1999|isbn=978-0-306-45053-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alloying small quantities of tungsten with [[steel]] greatly increases its [[toughness]].&lt;ref name="daintith"/&gt;

Tungsten exists in two major [[crystallinity|crystalline]] forms: α and β. The former has a [[body-centered cubic]] structure and is the more stable form. The structure of the β phase is called [[A15 phases|A15 cubic]]; it is [[metastable]], but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the β form exhibits a columnar [[Crystal habit|habit]]. The α phase has one third of the [[electrical resistivity]]&lt;ref&gt;Heather Bean [http://users.frii.com/bean/analysis.htm Material Properties and Analysis Techniques for Tungsten Thin Films] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023221423/http://users.frii.com/bean/analysis.htm |date=2011-10-23 }}. October 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and a much lower [[superconductivity|superconducting transition temperature]] T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; relative to the β phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1–4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tuning of Tungsten Thin Film Superconducting Transition Temperature for Fabrication of Photon Number Resolving Detectors|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~balzar/IEEE-Adriana%20-2005.pdf|author=Lita, A.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of tungsten}}
Naturally occurring tungsten consists of five [[isotope]]s whose [[half-life|half-lives]] are so long that they can be considered [[stable isotope|stable]]. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 ([[hafnium]]) by [[alpha emission]], but only &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;W has been observed to do so with a half-life of {{val|1.8e18|0.2}} years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Danevich, F.

Another 30 artificial [[radioisotope]]s of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are &lt;sup&gt;181&lt;/sup&gt;W with a half-life of 121.2&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;185&lt;/sup&gt;W with a half-life of 75.1&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;W with a half-life of 69.4&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;178&lt;/sup&gt;W with a half-life of 21.6&amp;nbsp;days, and &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;W with a half-life of 23.72 h.&lt;ref name=isotopes/&gt; All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than 3&amp;nbsp;hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=isotopes/&gt; Tungsten also has 4&amp;nbsp;[[meta state]]s, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;179m&lt;/sup&gt;W (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; 6.4&amp;nbsp;minutes).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow [[tungsten trioxide|tungstic oxide]], WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions, {{chem|WO|4|2-}}.

[[Tungsten carbide]]s (W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C and WC) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with [[carbon]]. W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with [[chlorine]] to form [[tungsten hexachloride]] (WCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="daintith"/&gt;

In aqueous solution, tungstate gives the [[heteropoly acid]]s and [[polyoxometalate]] [[anion]]s under neutral and acidic conditions. As [[tungstate]] is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, [[metastable]] "paratungstate A" [[anion]], {{chem|W}}{{su|b=7}}{{chem|O}}{{su|b=24|p=6–}}, which over time converts to the less soluble "paratungstate B" anion, {{chem|H}}{{su|b=2}}{{chem|W}}{{su|b=12}}{{chem|O}}{{su|b=42|p=10–}}.&lt;ref name="SmithBJ"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/CH00140|last=Smith|first=Bradley J.|last2=Patrick|date=2000|first2=Vincent A.|title=Quantitative Determination of Sodium Metatungstate Speciation by 183W N.M.R.

The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-[[oxygen]] [[octahedron|octahedra]] known as the [[Keggin structure|Keggin]] anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as [[phosphorus]] in place of the two central [[hydrogen]]s in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids, such as [[phosphotungstic acid]] H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;.

Tungsten trioxide can form [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] compounds with alkali metals. These are known as ''bronzes''; an example is [[sodium tungsten bronze]].

==History==
In 1781, [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] discovered that a new [[acid]], [[tungstic acid]], could be made from [[scheelite]] (at the time named tungsten).&lt;ref&gt;See:

The strategic value of tungsten came to notice in the early 20th century. British authorities acted in 1912 to free the Carrock mine from the German owned Cumbrian Mining Company and, during [[World War I]], restrict German access elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-25596167|title=Vital WW1 metal 'in enemy hands'|last=Watson|first=Greig|date=2014-06-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], tungsten played a more significant role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at [[Panasqueira]]. Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry,&lt;ref name="portugal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Donald G.|date=1999|title=World War II Economic Warfare: The United States, Britain, and Portuguese Wolfram|journal=The Historian|volume=61|issue=3|pages=539|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=LY1PyzmCc1D256Gvh5wpbhxKyTyvcm2FHpMwpcs2wW2XyytCh4pW!956463030?docId=5001286099|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628223506/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=LY1PyzmCc1D256Gvh5wpbhxKyTyvcm2FHpMwpcs2wW2XyytCh4pW!956463030?docId=5001286099|archivedate=2011-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Price of Neutrality: Portugal, the Wolfram Question, and World War II| author= Wheeler, L.

===Etymology===
The name "tungsten" (from the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''tung sten'', "heavy stone") is used in English, French, and many other languages as the name of the element, but not in the [[Nordic countries]]. "Tungsten" was the old Swedish name for the mineral [[scheelite]]. "Wolfram" (or "volfram") is used in most European (especially Germanic and Slavic) languages and is derived from the mineral [[wolframite]], which is the origin of the chemical symbol '''W'''.&lt;ref name="albert"/&gt; The name "wolframite" is derived from German "''wolf rahm''" ("wolf soot" or "wolf cream"), the name given to tungsten by [[Johan Gottschalk Wallerius]] in 1747. This, in turn, derives from "''lupi spuma''", the name [[Georg Agricola]] used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as "wolf's froth" and is a reference to the large amounts of [[tin]] consumed by the mineral during its extraction.&lt;ref name="sweetums"&gt;{{cite web

==Occurrence==
[[File:Wolframite from Portugal.jpg|thumb|right|Wolframite mineral, with a scale in cm.]]

Tungsten is found mainly in the minerals [[wolframite]] ([[iron]]–[[manganese]] tungstate (Fe,Mn)WO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a solid solution of the two minerals [[ferberite]] FeWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[hübnerite]] MnWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[scheelite]] ([[calcium]] tungstate (CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Other tungsten minerals range in their level of abundance from moderate to very rare, and have almost no economical value.

==Chemical compounds==
{{Category see also|Tungsten compounds}}
Tungsten forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from -II to VI.  Higher oxidation states, always as oxides, are relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with [[metal cluster]]s, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with [[metal carbonyl|CO complexes]].  Mo and W chemistry shows strong similarities.  The relative rarity of tungsten(III), for example, contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in [[tungsten(VI) oxide]] (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|edition=91–100 |pages=1110–1117|isbn=978-3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|author2=Wiberg, Egon|author3=Wiberg, Nils|language=German|chapter=Mangan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures, is the precursor to virtually all other Mo compounds as well as alloys. Molybdenum has several [[oxidation state]]s, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left).

Tungsten(VI) oxide is soluble in aqueous [[base (chemistry)|base]] , forming tungstate (WO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  This [[oxyanion]]  condenses at lower [[pH]] values, forming [[polyoxometalate|polyoxotungstate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume = 30|pages=34–48|date = 1997|title = Polyoxometalate Chemistry: An Old Field with New Dimensions in Several Disciplines|first1 = Michael T.|last1 = Pope|last2= Müller |first2 = Achim|doi = 10.1002/anie.199100341}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[image:JAFYAQ.png|thumb|144px|Structure of W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; ("tungsten trichloride").]]
The broad range of [[oxidation state]]s of tungsten is reflected in it various chlorides:&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;
* [[Tungsten(II) chloride]], which exists as the hexamer W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Tungsten(III) chloride]], which exists as the hexamer W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Tungsten(IV) chloride]], WCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a black solid, which adopts a polymeric structure.
* [[Tungsten(V) chloride]] WCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, a black solid which adopts a dimeric structure.
* [[Tungsten(VI) chloride]] WCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which contrasts with the instability of MoCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Organomolybdenum|Organotungsten compound]]s are numerous and also span a range of oxidation states.  Notable examples include the trigonal prismatic [[hexamethyltungsten|W(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and octahedral [[tungsten hexacarbonyl|W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]].

==Production==
[[File:Tungsten mined in 2013.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Tungsten mined in 2012]]
About 61,300 tonnes of tungsten concentrates were produced in the year 2009,&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/myb1-2009-tungs.pdf|title=Tungsten (table 15)|last=Shedd|first=Kim B.|date=2009|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2011-06-18|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028214122/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/myb1-2009-tungs.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, world production of tungsten was about 68,000 [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="IndexMundi 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=Tungsten: World Concentrate Production, By Country | website=IndexMundi | date=2014-09-03 | url=http://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/tungsten/tungsten_t15.html | accessdate=2015-08-30 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042422/http://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/tungsten/tungsten_t15.html | archivedate=2015-09-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main producers were as follows (data in tonnes):&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;

There is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of [[Dartmoor]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which was exploited during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] as the [[Hemerdon Mine]]. With recent increases in tungsten prices, as of 2014 this mine has been reactivated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-27754535 "Work starts on £130m Devon tungsten mine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205192524/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-27754535 |date=2014-12-05 }}. [[BBC News]], 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages. The ore is eventually converted to [[tungsten(VI) oxide]] (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is heated with [[hydrogen]] or [[carbon]] to produce powdered tungsten.&lt;ref name="SaundersN"&gt;{{cite book |last=Saunders |first=Nigel |title=Tungsten and the Elements of Groups 3 to 7 (The Periodic Table) |publisher=Heinemann Library |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-4034-3518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of tungsten's high melting point, it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten [[ingot]]s. Instead, powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals, and [[Sintering|sintered]].  During the sintering process, the nickel diffuses into the tungsten, producing an alloy.

Tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of [[Tungsten hexafluoride|WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

or [[pyrolysis|pyrolytic decomposition]]:&lt;ref name="manny"/&gt;

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[heat of reaction|Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]] = +)

Tungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the [[London Metal Exchange]]. The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If converted to the metal equivalent, they were about US$19 per kilogram in 2009.&lt;ref name="production"/&gt;

[[File:Tungsten cylinder 1kg.png|thumbnail|right|1 kilogram tungsten cylinder (scale shown below)]]
Approximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials – namely [[tungsten carbide]] – with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels. Less than 10% is used in other [[chemical compounds]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Lassner, Wolf-Dieter Schubert, Eberhard Lüderitz, Hans Uwe Wolf, "Tungsten, Tungsten Alloys, and Tungsten Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a27_229}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard materials===
Tungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide, one of the hardest [[carbide]]s, with a melting point of 2770&amp;nbsp;°C. WC is an efficient [[electrical conductor]], but W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C is less so. WC is used to make wear-resistant [[abrasive]]s, and "carbide" cutting tools such as knives, drills, [[circular saw]]s, [[Milling machine|milling]] and [[Lathe (metal)|turning]] tools used by the metalworking, woodworking, [[mining]], [[petroleum]] and construction industries.&lt;ref name="daintith"/&gt; Carbide tooling is actually a ceramic/metal composite, where metallic cobalt acts as a binding [[Metal matrix composite|(matrix) material]] to hold the WC particles in place. This type of industrial use accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Tungsten|work=The Canadian Encyclopaedia| url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008159http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/tungsten/| accessdate = 2009-05-05|author=Don Law-West|author2=Louis Perron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[jewelry]] industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide/metal composites, and also metallic tungsten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tungstenworld.com/Tungsten-The-Element-History-Uses-and-Wedding-Bands/ Tungsten: The Element, History, Uses and Wedding Bands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060802/http://www.tungstenworld.com/Tungsten-The-Element-History-Uses-and-Wedding-Bands/ |date=2013-09-21 }}. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; WC/metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished.

The hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal [[alloy]]s. A good example is [[high speed steel]], which can contain as much as 18% tungsten.&lt;ref name="w-apps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1264|title=Tungsten Applications – Steel|date=2000–2008|publisher=Azom|accessdate=2008-06-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815220037/http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1264|archivedate=2008-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like [[Rocket engine nozzle|rocket nozzles]], for example in the [[UGM-27 Polaris]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 38|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=9n-rX13bNsAC&amp;pg=PA38| chapter = Powder metallurgy for Aerospace Applications|isbn = 978-81-224-2030-2|title = Powder metallurgy: processing for automotive, electrical/electronic and engineering industry| first = P.|last = Ramakrishnan|publisher = New Age International|date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of different applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfmet.com/applications Tungsten Applications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901101650/http://www.wolfmet.com/applications |date=2013-09-01 }}. wolfmet.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Superalloy]]s containing tungsten, such as [[Hastelloy]] and [[Stellite]], are used in [[turbine]] blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings.

Quenched (martensitic) tungsten steel (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high [[remanence]] and [[coercivity]], as noted by [[John Hopkinson]] (1849 - 1898) as early as 1886.  The magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure.  For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but [[iron]] is), when present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the [[martensite]] phase, which has an enhanced ferromagnetism, as compared to the [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite (iron)]] phase, due to its greater resistance to [[Domain wall (magnetism)|magnetic domain wall motion]].

Tungsten's heat resistance makes it useful in [[arc welding]] applications when combined with another highly-conductive metal such as silver or copper.  The silver or copper provides the necessary conductivity and the tungsten allows the welding rod to withstand the high-temperatures of the arc welding environment.

[[Mallory metal]] is proprietary name for an alloy of tungsten, with other metallic elements added to improve machining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mallory.com/ MALLORY Alloys Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903143724/http://www.mallory.com/ |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armaments===
Tungsten, usually alloyed with [[nickel]] and [[iron]] or [[cobalt]] to form heavy alloys, is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s as an alternative to [[depleted uranium]], in applications where uranium's [[radioactivity]] is problematic even in depleted form, or where uranium's additional [[pyrophoric]] properties are not required (for example, in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor). Similarly, tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells, [[grenade]]s and [[missile]]s, to create supersonic shrapnel. Germany used tungsten during World War II to produce shells for anti-tank gun designs using the Gerlich [[squeeze bore]] principle to achieve very high muzzle velocity and enhanced armor penetration from comparatively small caliber and light weight field artillery. The weapons were highly effective but a shortage of tungsten used in the shell core limited that effectiveness.

Tungsten has also been used in [[Dense Inert Metal Explosive]]s, which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense-update.com/products/d/dime.htm Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828040248/http://www.defense-update.com/products/d/dime.htm |date=2008-08-28 }}.

===Chemical applications===
[[Tungsten(IV) sulfide]] is a high temperature [[lubricant]] and is a component of catalysts for [[hydrodesulfurization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Delmon, Bernard|author2=Froment, Gilbert F.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Hydrotreatment and hydrocracking of oil fractions: proceedings of the 2nd international symposium, 7th European workshop, Antwerpen, Belgium, November 14–17, 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RseZG0_4Ks4C&amp;pg=PA351|accessdate=18 December 2011|date=1999|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-50214-8|pages=351–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530024545/http://books.google.com/books?id=RseZG0_4Ks4C&amp;pg=PA351|archivedate=30 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is more commonly used for such applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mang, Theo|author2=Dresel, Wilfried|last-author-amp=yes|title=Lubricants and Lubrication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryKplDzZ_AoC&amp;pg=PA695|accessdate=18 December 2011|date=28 May 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-61033-4|pages=695–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530035711/http://books.google.com/books?id=ryKplDzZ_AoC&amp;pg=PA695|archivedate=30 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tungsten [[oxide]]s are used in [[ceramic]] glazes and [[calcium]]/[[magnesium]] tungstates are used widely in [[fluorescent lighting]]. Crystal [[tungstate]]s are used as [[scintillator|scintillation detectors]] in [[nuclear physics]] and [[nuclear medicine]]. Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industries.&lt;ref name="desu"/&gt;
Tungsten oxide (WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is incorporated into [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) catalysts found in coal-fired power plants. These catalysts convert [[nitrogen oxide]]s ([[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]]) to nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) using ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spivey, James J.|title=Catalysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wVXnmPGCVOMC&amp;pg=PA239|accessdate=18 December 2011|date=2002|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-85404-224-1|pages=239–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530050645/http://books.google.com/books?id=wVXnmPGCVOMC&amp;pg=PA239|archivedate=30 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===
Applications requiring its high density include weights, [[Mallory metal|counterweights]], ballast keels for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, and as ballast in race cars for [[NASCAR]] and [[Formula One]]; [[depleted uranium]] is also used for these purposes, due to similarly high density.  Seventy-five-kg blocks of tungsten were used as "cruise balance mass devices" on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 [[Mars Science Laboratory]] spacecraft.  It is an ideal material to use as a [[dolly (tool)|dolly]] for [[riveting]], where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality [[darts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QUyO7jgvOQUC&amp;pg=PA24|page=24|title=Tungsten|author=Turrell, Kerry|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|date=2004|isbn=978-0-7614-1548-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for [[fishing lure]]s (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly).

===Electronics===
Because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high [[melting point]], elemental tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = DeGarmo, E. Paul|title = Materials and Processes in Manufacturing|edition = 5th|publisher = New York: MacMillan Publishing|date = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[light bulb]], [[cathode-ray tube]], and [[vacuum tube]] filaments, [[heating element]]s, and [[rocket engine]] nozzles.&lt;ref name="albert"/&gt; Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high-temperature uses such as electrical, heating, and welding applications, notably in the [[gas tungsten arc welding]] process (also called tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding).
[[File:TIG torch breakdown.JPG|thumb|Tungsten electrode used in a [[gas tungsten arc welding]] torch]]

Because of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness, tungsten is also used in [[electrode]]s, and in the emitter tips in electron-beam instruments that use [[field emission gun]]s, such as [[electron microscope]]s. In electronics, tungsten is used as an interconnect material in [[integrated circuit]]s, between the [[silicon dioxide]] [[dielectric]] material and the transistors. It is used in metallic films, which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten (or [[molybdenum]]) on [[silicon]].&lt;ref name="manny"&gt;{{cite book| author = Schey, John A.|title = Introduction to Manufacturing Processes|edition = 2nd|publisher = McGraw-Hill, Inc.|date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made, due to its excellent shielding properties.  Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in [[plastic]] composites, which are used as a nontoxic substitute for [[lead]] in [[bullet]]s, [[lead shot|shot]], and radiation shields. Since this element's thermal expansion is similar to [[borosilicate glass]], it is used for making glass-to-metal seals.&lt;ref name="desu"/&gt; In addition to its high melting point, when tungsten is doped with potassium, it leads to an increased shape stability (compared to non-doped tungsten). This ensures that the filament does not sag, and no undesired changes occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ucfilament.com/nonsag-tungsten/|title=Non-Sag Doped Tungsten - Union City Filament|work=Union City Filament|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
Tungsten, at atomic number ''Z'' = 74, is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional.

Tungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]], in a role similar to the action of molybdenum.

===In archaea===
Tungsten is essential for some archaea. The following tungsten-utilizing enzymes are known:
* [[Aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase]] (AOR) in ''[[Thermococcus]]'' strain ES-1
* Formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (FOR) in ''[[Thermococcus litoralis]]''
* [[Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase]] (GAPOR) in ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]
A ''wtp'' system is known to selectively transport tungsten in archaea:
* WtpA is tungten-binding protein of [[ABC transporter|ABC family of transporters]]
* WptB is a [[permease]]
* WtpC is [[ATPase]]''&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Variable Capacitor.jpg|thumb|Rotary variable capacitor]]
[[File:Condensateur-variable-a-air 375x240.gif|thumb|Rotary variable capacitor: several rotor positions.]]

A '''variable capacitor'''  is a [[capacitor]] whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically.  Variable capacitors are often used in [[LC circuit|L/C circuits]] to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a '''tuning capacitor''' or '''tuning condenser'''), or as a variable [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], e.g. for [[impedance matching]] in [[antenna tuner]]s.

==Mechanically controlled capacitance==
[[File:Forgokondenzator rajz en.svg|thumb|Principle of the rotary variable capacitor]]
In mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed.

The most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis ("rotor") that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates ("stator") so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis.  Air or plastic foils can be used as [[dielectric]] material.
By choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale.  Various forms of reduction [[gear]] mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="Measurement of the capacitance of a rotary capacitor" widths="180"&gt;
File:Forgokondenzator1.jpg| ''C''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 pF
File:Forgokondenzator2.jpg| ''C'' = 269 pF 
File:Forgokondenzator3.jpg| ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 520 pF
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

A vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders{{ref|can}} (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high [[vacuum]]. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The [[vacuum]] not only increases the working [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] handling capacity of the [[capacitor]], it also greatly reduces the chance of [[Electric arc|arcing]] across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high-powered [[transmitter]]s such as those used for [[broadcasting]], [[military]] and [[amateur radio]], as well as high-powered [[Antenna tuner|RF tuning network]]s. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient; since the elements are under a vacuum, the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.

Very cheap variable capacitors are constructed from layered aluminium and plastic foils that are variably pressed together using a screw.  These so-called ''squeezers'' cannot provide a stable and reproducible capacitance, however. A variant of this structure that allows for linear movement of one set of plates to change the plate overlap area is also used and might be called a ''slider''. This has practical advantages for makeshift or home construction, and may be found in resonant-loop antennas or crystal radios.

Small variable capacitors operated by screwdriver (for instance, to precisely set a resonant frequency at the factory and then never be adjusted again) are called [[trimmer (electronics)|trimmer]] capacitors.  In addition to air and plastic, trimmers can also be made using a ceramic dielectric, such as [[mica]].

==Special forms of mechanically variable capacitors==
[[File:Variable-capacitors.agr.jpg|thumb|Various forms of variable capacitors]]

===Multiple sections===
Very often, multiple stator/rotor sections are arranged behind one another on the same axis, allowing for several tuned circuits to be adjusted using the same control, e.g. a preselector, an input filter and the corresponding oscillator in a receiver circuit.  The sections can have identical or different nominal capacitances, e.g. 2 &amp;times; 330 pF for AM filter and oscillator, plus 3 &amp;times; 45 pF for two filters and an oscillator in the FM section of the same receiver.  Capacitors with multiple sections often include trimmer capacitors in parallel to the variable sections, used to adjust all tuned circuits to the same frequency.

===Butterfly===
A '''butterfly capacitor''' is a form of rotary variable capacitor with two independent sets of stator plates opposing each other, and a [[butterfly]]-shaped rotor arranged so that turning the rotor will vary the capacitances between the rotor and either stator equally.

Butterfly capacitors are used in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. [[Radio frequency|RF]] power [[amplifier]] stages in [[push-pull output|push-pull]] configuration or symmetrical [[antenna tuner]]s where the rotor needs to be "cold", i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily [[Direct current|DC]]) [[ground (electricity)|ground]] potential.  Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in [[loop antenna|magnetic loop antennas]].

In a butterfly capacitor, the stators and each half of the rotor can only cover a maximum angle of 90° since there must be a position without rotor/stator overlap corresponding to minimum capacity, therefore a turn of only 90° covers the entire capacitance range.&lt;ref name="butterfly"&gt;[http://homepages.tesco.net/~a.wadsworth/capacitors.htm G3NPF and M1AIM Home Page Technical Section (Capacitors)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split stator===
The closely related '''split stator variable capacitor''' does not have the limitation of 90° angle since it uses two separate packs of rotor electrodes arranged axially behind one another.  Unlike in a capacitor with several sections, the rotor plates in a split stator capacitor are mounted on opposite sides of the rotor axis.  While the split stator capacitor benefits from larger electrodes compared to the butterfly capacitor, as well as a rotation angle of up to 180°, the separation of rotor plates incurs some losses since RF current has to pass the rotor axis instead of flowing straight through each rotor vane.

===Differential===
'''Differential variable capacitors''' also have two independent stators, but unlike in the butterfly capacitor where capacities on both sides increase equally as the rotor is turned, in a differential variable capacitor one section's capacity will increase while the other section's decreases, keeping the stator-to-stator capacitance constant.  Differential variable capacitors can therefore be used in capacitive [[potentiometer|potentiometric]] circuits.

==History==
The variable capacitor with air dielectric was invented by the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] engineer [[Dezső Korda]]. He received a [[German Empire|German]] patent for the invention on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1893.
&lt;ref&gt;George Washington Pierce: [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7089083M/Principles_of_wireless_telegraphy ''Principles of wireless telegraphy''], McGraw-Hill book company, New York, 1910, [https://archive.org/stream/principlesofwire00pierrich#page/114/mode/2up p. 114.] (Photo of rotary capacitor of Korda).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronically controlled capacitance==
=== Voltage tuned capacitance ===
The thickness of the depletion layer of a reverse-biased semiconductor [[diode]] varies with the DC voltage applied across the diode.  Any diode exhibits this effect (including p/n junctions in transistors), but devices specifically sold as variable capacitance diodes (also called varactors or [[varicap]]s) are designed with a large junction area and a doping profile specifically designed to maximize capacitance.

Their use is limited to low signal amplitudes to avoid obvious distortions as the capacitance would be affected by the change of signal voltage, precluding their use in the input stages of high-quality RF communications receivers, where they would add unacceptable levels of [[intermodulation]].  At [[VHF]]/[[UHF]] frequencies, e.g. in FM Radio or TV tuners, dynamic range is limited by noise rather than large signal handling requirements, and varicaps are commonly used in the signal path.

Varicaps are used for [[frequency modulation]] of oscillators, and to make high-frequency [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), the core component in [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL) [[frequency synthesizer]]s that are ubiquitous in modern communications equipment.

=== Digitally tuned capacitance ===
A '''digitally tuned capacitor''' is an [[Integrated circuit|IC]] variable capacitor based on several technologies.  MEMS, BST and SOI/SOS devices are available from a number of suppliers and vary in capacitance range, quality factor and resolution for different RF tuning applications.

MEMS devices have the highest quality factor and are highly linear, and therefore are suitable for antenna aperture tuning, dynamic impedance matching, power amplifier load matching and adjustable filters.  RF tuning MEMS are still a relatively new technology and has not yet been accepted broadly.

BST device are based on Barium Strontium Titanate and vary the capacitance by applying high voltage to the device.  The tuning accuracy is limited only by the accuracy of the D-A converter circuitry that generates the high voltage.  The limitations for BST are stability over temperature and linearity in demanding applications.

SOI/SOS tuning devices are constructed as solid state FET switches built on insulated CMOS wafers and use MIM caps arranged in binary-weighted values to achieve different capacitance values.  SOI/SOS switches have high lineary and are well suited to low power applications where high voltages are not present.  High voltage endurance requires multiple FET devices in series which adds series resistance and lowers the quality factor.

The capacitance values are designed for [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[impedance matching]] in multi-band [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[GSM]]/[[W-CDMA (UMTS)|WCDMA]] cellular handsets and mobile TV receivers that operate over wide frequency ranges, such as the European [[DVB-H]] and Japanese [[ISDB-T#ISDB-T|ISDB-T]] mobile TV systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frenzel|first1=Louis|title=Automatic Digital Antenna Tuning Fits Multiple Wireless Applications|url=http://electronicdesign.com/communications/automatic-digital-antenna-tuning-fits-multiple-wireless-applications|website=Electronic Design|accessdate=23 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803171705/http://electronicdesign.com/communications/automatic-digital-antenna-tuning-fits-multiple-wireless-applications|archivedate=3 August 2014|language=en|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transducers==
Variable capacitance is sometimes used to convert physical phenomena into electrical signals.

* In a capacitor [[microphone]] (commonly known as a [[condenser microphone]]), the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and vibrations produce changes in the distance between the diaphragm and a fixed plate, changing the voltage maintained across the capacitor plates.
* Some types of industrial sensors use a capacitor element to convert physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[relative humidity]] to an electrical signal for measurement purposes.
* Capacitive sensors can also be used in the place of [[switch]]es, e.g. in computer keyboards or "touch buttons" for elevators that have no user-movable parts.

==Notes==
#{{note|can}} A makeshift version of this design, using two tin cans with slightly different diameter isolated by cardboard, has been used to make variable capacitors in emergencies, e.g. by concentration camp inmates.
# While mechanical variable capacitors have been used and are still used extensively in electronics, their use in radios is diminishing. Radios now often use digital frequency synthesizers for tuning rather than analog (tank) oscillators.

Born in [[Swansea]], Wales, Grove was the only child of John, a [[magistrate]] and [[deputy lieutenant]] of [[Glamorgan]], and his wife, Anne ''née'' Bevan.

His early education was in the hands of private tutors, before he attended [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] to study [[classics]], though his scientific interests may have been cultivated by mathematician [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]]. Otherwise, his taste for science has no clear origin though his circle in Swansea was broadly educated. He graduated in 1832.

In 1835 he was [[called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]]. In the same year, Grove joined the [[Royal Institution]] and was a founder of the [[Swansea Literary and Philosophical Society]], an organisation with which he maintained close links.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Morus (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11685 Grove, Sir William Robert (1811–1896)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, online edn, May 2005, accessed 25 July 2007 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific work==

In 1829 at the Royal Institution Grove met Emma Maria Powles, and he married her in 1837. The couple embarked on a tour of the continent for their honeymoon. This sabbatical offered Grove an opportunity to pursue his scientific interests and resulted in his first [[scientific paper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Grove, W. R. | title=On a new voltaic combination | journal=Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science | year=1838 | volume=13 | issue=84 | pages=430–431 | doi=10.1080/14786443808649618}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting some novel constructions for [[Battery (electricity)|electric cells]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

During 1839, Grove developed a novel form of electric cell, the ''[[Grove cell]]'', which used [[zinc]] and [[platinum]] [[electrode]]s exposed to two [[acid]]s and separated by a porous ceramic pot. Grove announced the latter development to the ''[[Académie des Sciences]]'' in Paris in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2967c/f503.table Note sur une pile voltaïque d'une grande énergie, construite par M. Grove; communication de M. Becquerel]", ''[[Comptes Rendus]]'' (1839), '''8''' 497&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 Grove invented one of the first incandescent electric lights, which was later perfected by [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref&gt;"[An Encyclopedia of World History. William L.Langer. 1948.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he gave another account of his development at the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting in [[Birmingham]], where it aroused the interest of [[Michael Faraday]]. On Faraday's invitation Grove presented his discoveries at the prestigious Royal Institution Friday Discourse on 13 March 1840.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

Grove's presentation made his reputation, and he was soon proposed for Fellowship of the [[Royal Society]] by such distinguished men as [[William Thomas Brande]], [[William Snow Harris]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]]. Grove also attracted the attention of [[John Peter Gassiot]], a relationship that resulted in Grove's becoming the first professor of experimental philosophy at the [[London Institution]] in 1841. Grove's inaugural lecture in 1842 was the first announcement of what Grove called the ''correlation of physical forces'', in modern terms, the [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

In 1842, Grove developed the first [[fuel cell]] (which he called the ''gas voltaic battery''), which produced [[electrical energy]] by combining [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and described it using his correlation theory.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; In developing the cell and showing that [[steam]] could be disassociated into oxygen and hydrogen, and the process [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversed]], he was the first person to demonstrate the thermal dissociation of [[molecule]]s into their constituent [[atom]]s.&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt; The first demonstration of this effect, he gave privately to Faraday, Gassiot and [[Edward William Brayley]], his scientific editor.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, J.

In 1852 he discovered [[stria (electricity)|stria]]e, dark bands that occur in [[electrical breakdown]], and investigated their character, presenting his work in an 1858 Bakerian lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, W.

Iwan Rhys Morus, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, accessed 5 August 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''On the Correlation of Physical Forces''==
In 1846, Grove published ''On The Correlation of Physical Forces''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Grove, W. R. | title=The Correlation of Physical Forces | location=London | publisher=Longmans, Green | year=1874 | edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Early science terminology warning}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he anticipated the general theory of the [[conservation of energy]] that was more famously put forward in [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]' ''Über die Erhaltung der Kraft'' (''On the Conservation of Force'') published the following year.&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt; His 1846 [[Bakerian lecture]] relied heavily on his theory.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"On certain phenomena of voltaic ignition and the decomposition of water into its constituent gases by heat"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Prescott Joule]] had been inspired to his investigations into the [[mechanical equivalent of heat]] by comparing the [[mass]] of coal consumed in a [[steam engine]] with the mass of [[zinc]] consumed in a Grove battery in performing a common quantity of mechanical work. Grove was certainly familiar with [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s theoretical analysis of Joule's experimental results and Thomson's immature suggestions of conservation of energy. Thomson's public champion, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] was initially a supporter of Grove's ideas but later dismissed them with some coolness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Smith, C. | title=The Science of Energy: A Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | location=London | publisher=Heinemann | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-485-11431-7|pages=60, 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Groves's ideas were forerunners of the theory of the conservation of energy, they were qualitative, unlike the quantitative investigations of Joule or [[Julius Robert von Mayer]]. His ideas also shaded into broader speculation, such as the nature of [[Olbers's paradox]], which he may have discovered for himself rather than through a direct knowledge.&lt;ref name="crowtherA"&gt;Crowther (1965) pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | ... it is difficult to understand why we get so little light at night from the stellar universe, without assuming that some light is lost in its progress through space – not lost absolutely, for that would be an annihilation of force – but converted into some other mode of motion. | ''On the Correlation of Physical Forces'' (1874) }}

Grove also speculated that other forms of energy were yet to be discovered "as far certain as certain can be of any future event."&lt;ref name="crowtherA" /&gt;

{{quotation | The probability is that, if not all, the greater number of physical phenomena are, in one sense correlative, and that, without a duality of conception, the mind cannot form an idea of them: thus motion cannot be perceived or probably imagined without [[parallax]] or relative change of position ... in all physical phenomena, the effects produced by motion are all in proportion to the relative motion. ... The question of whether there can be absolute motion, or indeed any absolute isolated force, is purely the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] question of [[idealism]] or [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. | ''On the Correlation of Physical Forces'' (1874) }}

==Royal Society politics==
As soon as he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1840 Grove was a critic of the Society, deprecating its [[cronyism]] and the ''de facto'' rule of a few influential Council members. In 1843, he published an anonymous attack on the scientific establishment in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=[Anon. – Grove, W. R.] | title=Physical Science in England | journal=Blackwood's Magazine | volume=54 | year=1843 | pages=514–25 | url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=bm.1843.10.x.54.336.x.514}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for reform. In 1846 Grove was elected to the Council of the [[Royal Society]], and was heavily involved in the campaign to modernise its charter, in addition to campaigning for the public funding of science.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

A charter committee had already been established, and Grove joined it. Groves's fellow campaigners included Gassiot, [[Leonard Horner]] and [[Edward Sabine]].  Their principal objectives were for the number of new Fellows to be subject to an annual limit, and limitation of the power of nomination to the Council. The reformers' success in 1847 led to the resignation of several key conservatives and the establishment of Grove and his associates with domination of the Council. To celebrate, the reformers founded the [[Philosophical Club]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

Though the Philosophical Club succeeded in ensuring that [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] was appointed next President, they failed to get Grove appointed as Secretary. Grove continued to campaign for a single home for all the scientific institutions at [[Burlington House]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Legal career==
From 1846 Grove started to reduce his scientific work in favour of his professional practice at the bar, his young family providing the financial motivation; and in 1853 became a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; The bar provided him with the opportunity to combine his legal and scientific knowledge, in particular in [[patent law]]&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;[Anon.] (2001) "Grove, Sir William Robert", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Deluxe edition, CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt; and in the unsuccessful defence of [[poison]]er [[William Palmer (murderer)|William Palmer]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Knott, G. H. | title=The Trial of William Palmer | year=1912 | edition=Notable English Trials | location=Edinburgh | publisher=William Hodge &amp; Co. | page=319| isbn=978-0-665-85182-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially involved in the photography patent cases of ''[[Beard v. Egerton]]'' (1845–1849),&lt;ref&gt;(1849) 8 CB 165, 19 LJCP 36, 13 Jur 1004, 13 LTOS 426&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of Egerton, and of ''[[Talbot v. Laroche]]'' (1854). In the latter case Grove appeared for [[William Fox Talbot]] in his unsuccessful attempt to assert his [[calotype]] patent.&lt;ref name="wood" /&gt;

Grove served on a [[Royal Commission]] on [[patent law]] and on the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]].&lt;ref name="crowtherB"&gt;Crowther (1965) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 he was made judge of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and was appointed to the [[Queen's Bench]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He was to have presided at the [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] winter [[assizes]] of 1884, which would have entailed him trying the notorious [[survival cannibalism]] case of ''[[R v. Dudley and Stephens]]''. However, at the last minute he was substituted by [[Baron Huddleston]], possibly because Huddleston was seen as more reliable in ensuring the guilty verdict that the judiciary required. Grove did sit as one of five judges on the final determination of the case in the [[Divisional Court|Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book| title=Cannibalism and the Common Law: The Story of the Tragic Last Voyage of the Mignonette and the Strange Legal Proceedings to Which It Gave Rise | author=Simpson, A. W. B. | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1984 | isbn=978-0-226-75942-5 | page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove was a careful, painstaking and accurate judge, courageous and not afraid to assert an independent judicial opinion. However, he was fallible in patent cases, where he was prone to become over-interested in the technology in question and to be distracted by questioning the litigants as to potential improvements in their devices, even going so far as to suggest his own innovations.&lt;ref name="crowtherB" /&gt; He retired from the bench in 1887. His portrait was painted by [[Helen Donald-Smith]] in the 1890s.

==Family==
Groves's daughter, Imogen Emily (died 1886), married [[William Edward Hall]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, T. E. (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11997 Hall, William Edward (1835–1894)]", rev. Catherine Pease-Watkin, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, accessed 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Anna married Herbert Augustus Hills (1837–1907) and was mother to [[Edmond Herbert Grove-Hills]] ("Colonel Rivers")&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, R.

His health perpetually troubled, Grove died at home, 115 [[Harley Street]] in London, after a long illness.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He is buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.

==Honours==
Grove became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1840, and received their [[Royal Medal]] in 1847.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He was Vice-President of the [[Royal Institution]] in 1844.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Receiving a [[knighthood]] in 1872,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; he was given an honorary degree by [[Cambridge University]] in 1879&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GRV879WR|name=Grove, William Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Councillor]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

In [[particle physics]], '''W&amp;prime; and Z&amp;prime; bosons''' (or '''W-prime and Z-prime bosons''') refer to hypothetical [[gauge boson]]s that arise from extensions of the  [[electroweak interaction|electroweak symmetry]] of the [[Standard Model]]. They are named in analogy with the Standard Model [[W and Z bosons]].

==Types==

===Types of W&amp;prime; bosons===
W&amp;prime; bosons often arise in models with an extra [[SU(2)]] [[gauge group]]. {{nowrap|SU(2) × SU(2)}} is spontaneously broken to the [[diagonal subgroup]] SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;  which corresponds to the electroweak SU(2). More generally, we might have ''n'' copies of SU(2), which are then broken down to a diagonal SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;. This gives rise to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−1 &amp;nbsp; W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;prime;, W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;prime; and Z&amp;prime; bosons. Such models might arise from [[quiver diagram]], for example. In order for the W&amp;prime; bosons to couple to [[weak isospin]], the extra SU(2) and the Standard Model SU(2) must mix; one copy of SU(2) must break around the [[TeV]] scale (to get W&amp;prime; bosons with a TeV mass) leaving a second SU(2) for the Standard Model.  This happens in [[Little Higgs]] models that contain more than one copy of SU(2).  Because the W&amp;prime; comes from the breaking of an SU(2), it is generically accompanied by a Z&amp;prime; boson of (almost) the same mass and with couplings related to the W&amp;prime; couplings.

Another model with W&amp;prime; bosons but without an additional SU(2) factor is the so-called [[331 model]] with  {{nowrap| ''β'' {{=}} ± &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;{{sqrt|3}}&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;. The symmetry breaking chain {{nowrap|SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; × U(1)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; → SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; × U(1)&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}} leads to a pair of W&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; bosons and three Z&amp;prime; bosons.

W&amp;prime; bosons also arise in [[Kaluza–Klein]] theories with SU(2) in the [[Brane cosmology|bulk]].

===Types of Z&amp;prime; bosons===
Various models of physics [[beyond the Standard Model]] predict different kinds of Z&amp;prime; bosons.

* Models with a new [[U(1)]] gauge symmetry.  The Z&amp;prime; is the gauge boson of the (broken) U(1) symmetry.
* [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] models.  This type of model contains two Z&amp;prime; bosons, which can mix in general.
* [[Topcolor]] and Top Seesaw Models of Dynamical Electroweak Symmetry Breaking have Z&amp;prime; bosons to select the formation of particular condensates.
* [[Little Higgs]] models.  These models typically include an enlarged gauge sector, which is broken down to the Standard Model gauge symmetry around the TeV scale.  In addition to one or more Z&amp;prime; bosons, these models often contain W&amp;prime; bosons.
* [[Kaluza–Klein]] models. The Z&amp;prime; boson are the excited modes of a neutral bulk gauge symmetry.
* Stueckelberg Extensions (see [[Stueckelberg action]]). The Z&amp;prime; boson is sourced from couplings found in [[String (physics)|string]] theories with intersecting [[D-brane]]s.

==Searches==

===Direct searches===
A W&amp;prime;-boson could be detected at hadron colliders through its decay to [[lepton]] plus [[neutrino]] or [[top quark]] plus [[bottom quark]], after being produced in quark-antiquark [[annihilation]]. The [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] reach for W&amp;prime; discovery is expected to be a few [[TeV]].

Direct searches for Z&amp;prime;-bosons are carried out at [[hadron]] colliders, since these give access to the highest energies available. The search looks for high-mass dilepton [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]]: the Z&amp;prime;-boson would be produced by quark-antiquark annihilation and decay to an [[electron]]-[[positron]] pair or a pair of opposite-charged [[muon]]s. The most stringent current limits come from the [[Fermilab]] [[Tevatron]], and depend on the couplings of the Z&amp;prime;-boson (which control the production [[cross section (physics)|cross section]]); as of 2006, the [[Tevatron]] excludes Z&amp;prime;-bosons up to masses of about 800&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]] for "typical" cross sections predicted in various models.&lt;ref&gt;

The above statements apply to "wide [[resonance width|width]]" models. Recent classes of models have emerged that naturally provide cross section signatures that fall on the edge, or slightly below the 95%&amp;nbsp;confidence level limits set by the Tevatron, and hence can produce detectable cross section signals for a Z&amp;prime;-boson in a mass range much closer to the Z pole mass than the "wide width" models discussed above.

These "narrow width" models which fall into this category are those that predict a Stückelberg Z&amp;prime; as well as a Z&amp;prime; from a universal extra dimension (see the ''Z&amp;prime; Hunter's Guide'' for links to these papers).

On 7&amp;nbsp;April 2011, the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF collaboration]] at the Tevatron reported an excess in proton-[[antiproton]] collision [[event (particle physics)|events]] that produce a W-boson accompanied by two hadronic [[jet (particle physics)|jets]]. This could possibly be interpreted in terms of a Z&amp;prime;-boson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Woollacott|title=Tevatron data indicates unknown new particle|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/general-sciences-features/55233-tevatron-data-indicates-unknown-new-particle|publisher=TG Daily|date=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermilab’s data peak that causes excitement

On 2&amp;nbsp;June 2015, the [[ATLAS experiment]] at the LHC reported evidence for W&amp;prime;-bosons at significance 3.4&amp;nbsp;[[standard deviation|sigma]], still too low to claim a formal discovery.&lt;ref name="W'-NewScientist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730354-600-possible-new-particle-hints-that-universe-may-not-be-left-handed/|title=Possible new particle hints that universe may not be left-handed|author=Michael Slezak|date=22 August 2015|newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the [[CMS experiment]] also independently reported signals that corroborate ATLAS's findings.

===Indirect searches===
The most stringent limits on new W&amp;prime;-bosons are set by their indirect effects on low-energy processes like [[muon]] decay, where they can substitute for the Standard Model [[W boson exchange]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Indirect searches for Z&amp;prime;-bosons are carried out at electron-positron colliders, since these give access to high-precision measurements of the properties of the Standard Model Z-boson. The constraints come from [[quantum superposition|mixing]] between the Z&amp;prime; and the Z, and are model dependent because they depend not only on the Z&amp;prime; mass but also its mixing with the Z. The current most stringent limits are from the [[CERN]] [[LEP]] collider, which constrains Z&amp;prime;-bosons to be heavier than a few hundred GeV, for typical model parameters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The [[International Linear Collider|ILC]] will extend this reach up to 5&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;TeV depending on the model under consideration, providing complementarity with the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] because it will offer measurements of additional properties of the Z&amp;prime;-boson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Z&amp;prime;–Y mixings==
We might have gauge [[kinetic mixing]]s between the U(1)&amp;prime; of the Z&amp;prime; boson and U(1)&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; of [[hypercharge]]. This mixing leads to a [[Feynman diagram|tree level]] modification of the [[Peskin–Takeuchi parameter]]s.
