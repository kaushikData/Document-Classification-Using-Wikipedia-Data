'''211''' ('''two hundred [and] eleven''') is the [[natural number]] between [[210 (number)|210]] and [[212 (number)|212]]. It is also a [[prime number]].

==In mathematics==

211 is an [[Even and odd numbers|odd]] number.

211 is a [[primorial prime]], sum of three consecutive [[prime number|prime]]s (67 + 71 + 73), [[Chen prime]], [[centered decagonal number#Centered decagonal prime|centered decagonal prime]], and [[self prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A006378|title=Sloane's A006378 : Prime self numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

211 is a [[repdigit]] in [[base 14]] (111).

Multiplying its digits, it is still a prime (2), and adding its digits, it is square (4). Rearranging its digits, 211 becomes 121, which also is a square. Adding any two of its digits will be prime (2 or 3).

==In other fields==
[[2-1-1]] is special abbreviated telephone number reserved in Canada and the United States as an easy-to-remember three-digit telephone number meant to provide quick information and referrals to health and human service organizations for both services from charities and from governmental agencies.

211 is also associated with E211, the preservative [[sodium benzoate]]

211 is also the [[California Penal Code]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shouselaw.com/robbery.html] ''Shouse California Law Group''&lt;/ref&gt; section defining [[robbery]]. Sometimes it is paired with [[187 (number)|187]], California PC section for [[murder]].

211 is also an EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) document known as an Electronic Bill of Lading.

211 is also a nickname for [[Steel Reserve]], a [[malt liquor]] alcoholic beverage.

211 is also [[SMTP]] status code for system status.

[[+211]] is the code for international direct-dial phone calls to [[South Sudan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16224">In [[graph theory]] and [[computer science]], an '''adjacency matrix''' is a [[square matrix]] used to represent a finite [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.

In the special case of a finite [[simple graph]], the adjacency matrix is a [[(0,1)-matrix]] with zeros on its diagonal. If the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]]. 
The relationship between a graph and the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of its adjacency matrix is studied in [[spectral graph theory]].

The adjacency matrix should be distinguished from the [[incidence matrix]] for a graph, a different matrix representation whose elements indicate whether vertex–edge pairs are incident or not, and [[degree matrix]] which contains information about the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of each [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]].

==Definition==
For a simple graph with vertex set ''V'', the adjacency matrix is a square {{abs|''V''}}&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;{{abs|''V''}} matrix ''A'' such that its element ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is one when there is an edge from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'', and zero when there is no edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algebraic Graph Theory|edition=2nd|first=Norman|last=Biggs|series=Cambridge Mathematical Library|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|at=Definition 2.1, p.&amp;nbsp;7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagonal elements of the matrix are all zero, since edges from a vertex to itself ([[Loop (graph theory)|loops]]) are not allowed in simple graphs. It is also sometimes useful in [[algebraic graph theory]] to replace the nonzero elements with algebraic variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The same concept can be extended to [[multigraph]]s and graphs with loops by storing the number of edges between each two vertices in the corresponding matrix element, and by allowing nonzero diagonal elements. Loops may be counted either once (as a single edge) or twice (as two vertex-edge incidences), as long as a consistent convention is followed. Undirected graphs often use the latter convention of counting loops twice, whereas directed graphs typically use the former convention.

===Of a bipartite graph===
&lt;!-- [[Adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph]] &amp; [[Biadjacency matrix]] redirect here --&gt;
The adjacency matrix ''A'' of a [[bipartite graph]] whose two parts have ''r'' and ''s'' vertices can be written in the form 
: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix} 0_{r,r} &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0_{s,s} \end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''B'' is an {{nowrap|''r'' × ''s''}} matrix, and 0&lt;sub&gt;''r'',''r''&lt;/sub&gt; and 0&lt;sub&gt;''s'',''s''&lt;/sub&gt; represent the {{nowrap|''r'' × ''r''}} and {{nowrap|''s'' × ''s''}} zero matrices. In this case, the smaller matrix ''B'' uniquely represents the graph, and the remaining parts of ''A'' can be discarded as redundant. ''B'' is sometimes called the biadjacency matrix.

Formally, let {{nowrap|1=''G'' = (''U'', ''V'', ''E'')}} be a [[bipartite graph]] with parts {{nowrap|1=''U'' = {''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}}} and {{nowrap|1=''V'' = {''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}. The ''biadjacency matrix'' is the {{nowrap|''r'' × ''s''}} 0–1 matrix ''B'' in which {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}} if and only if {{nowrap|(''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} ∈ ''E''. 

If ''G'' is a bipartite [[multigraph]] or [[weighted graph]] then the elements ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are taken to be the number of edges between the vertices or the weight of the edge {{nowrap|(''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, respectively.

===Variations===
An {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}-''adjacency matrix'' ''A'' of a simple graph has ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' if (''i'', ''j'') is an edge, ''b'' if it is not, and ''c'' on the diagonal. The [[Seidel adjacency matrix]] is a {{nowrap|(−1, 1, 0)}}-''adjacency matrix''. This matrix is used in studying [[strongly regular graph]]s and [[two-graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidel |first=J. J. |title=Strongly Regular Graphs with (−1, 1, 0) Adjacency Matrix Having Eigenvalue 3 |journal=[[Linear Algebra and its Applications|Lin. Alg. Appl.]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=281–298 |year=1968 |doi=10.1016/0024-3795(68)90008-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[distance matrix]]''' has in position (''i'', ''j'') the distance between vertices ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The distance is the length of a shortest path connecting the vertices. Unless lengths of edges are explicitly provided, the length of a path is the number of edges in it. The distance matrix resembles a high power of the adjacency matrix, but instead of telling only whether or not two vertices are connected (i.e., the connection matrix, which contains boolean values), it gives the exact distance between them.

==Examples==
===Undirected graphs===
The convention followed here (for undirected graphs) is that each edge adds 1 to the appropriate cell in the matrix, and each loop adds 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wp7XsCAm_9EC&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Expander graphs and codes |last1=Shum |first1=Kenneth |last2=Blake |first2=Ian |date=2003-12-18 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |book-title=Volume 68 of DIMACS series in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science |pages=63 |conference=Algebraic Coding Theory and Information Theory: DIMACS Workshop, Algebraic Coding Theory and Information Theory |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the degree of a vertex to be easily found by taking the sum of the values in either its respective row or column in the adjacency matrix.

===Directed graphs===
In directed graphs, the [[Directed graph#Indegree and outdegree|in-degree]] of a vertex can be computed by summing the entries of the corresponding column, and the out-degree can be computed by summing the entries of the corresponding row.

&lt;br&gt;Coordinates are 0–23.
&lt;br&gt;As the graph is directed, the matrix is not [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]].
|}

===Trivial graphs===
The adjacency matrix of a [[complete graph]] contains all ones except along the diagonal where there are only zeros. The adjacency matrix of an [[empty graph]] is a [[zero matrix]].

==Properties==
===Spectrum===
The adjacency matrix of an undirected simple graph is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], and therefore has a complete set of [[real number|real]] [[eigenvalue]]s and an orthogonal [[eigenvector]] basis. The set of eigenvalues of a graph is the '''spectrum''' of the graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Biggs|1993}}, Chapter 2 ("The spectrum of a graph"), pp.&amp;nbsp;7–13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common to denote the eigenvalues by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The greatest eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by the maximum degree. This can be seen as result of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]], but it can be proved easily. Let ''v'' be one eigenvector associated to &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and ''x'' the component in which ''v'' has maximum absolute value. Without loss of generality assume ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive since otherwise you simply take the eigenvector &lt;math&gt;-v&lt;/math&gt;, also associated to &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda v_x=(A v)_x=\sum_{y=1}^n A_{x,y}v_y\leq \sum_{y=1}^n A_{x,y} v_x = v_x \deg(x).&lt;/math&gt;

For ''d''-regular graphs, ''d'' is the first eigenvalue of ''A'' for the vector {{nowrap|1=''v'' = (1, …, 1)}} (it is easy to check that it is an eigenvalue and it is the maximum because of the above bound). The multiplicity of this eigenvalue is the number of connected components of ''G'', in particular &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; for connected graphs. It can be shown that for each eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, its opposite &lt;math&gt;-\lambda_i=\lambda_{n+1-i}&lt;/math&gt; is also an eigenvalue of ''A'' if ''G'' is a [[bipartite graph]].{{cn|date=March 2015}} In particular −''d'' is an eigenvalue of bipartite graphs.

The difference &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1-\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[spectral gap]] and it is related to the [[Expander graph|expansion]] of ''G''. It is also useful to introduce the [[spectral radius]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G) = \max_{|\lambda_i| &lt; d} |\lambda_i|&lt;/math&gt;. This number is bounded by &lt;math&gt;\lambda(G)\geq 2\sqrt{d-1}-o(1)&lt;/math&gt;. This bound is tight in the [[Ramanujan graphs]], which have applications in many areas.

===Isomorphism and invariants===
Suppose two directed or undirected graphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with adjacency matrices ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are given. ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] if and only if there exists a [[permutation matrix]] ''P'' such that
: &lt;math&gt;P A_1 P^{-1} = A_2.&lt;/math&gt; 
In particular, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Similar (linear algebra)|similar]] and therefore have the same [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]], [[characteristic polynomial]], eigenvalues, [[determinant]] and [[Trace (matrix)|trace]]. These can therefore serve as isomorphism invariants of graphs. However, two graphs may possess the same set of eigenvalues but not be isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Godsil|Godsil, Chris]]; [[Gordon Royle|Royle, Gordon]] ''Algebraic Graph Theory'', Springer (2001), {{ISBN|0-387-95241-1}}, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[linear operator]]s are said to be [[isospectral]].

===Matrix powers===
If ''A'' is the adjacency matrix of the directed or undirected graph ''G'', then the matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., the [[matrix multiplication|matrix product]] of ''n'' copies of ''A'') has an interesting interpretation: the element {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')}} gives the number of (directed or undirected) [[Path (graph theory)|walks]] of length ''n'' from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j''. If ''n'' is the smallest nonnegative integer, such that for some ''i'', ''j'', the element {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')}} of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is positive, then ''n'' is the distance between vertex ''i'' and vertex ''j''. This implies, for example, that the number of triangles in an undirected graph ''G'' is exactly the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; divided by 6. Note that the adjacency matrix can be used to determine whether or not the graph is [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]].

==Data structures==
The adjacency matrix may be used as a [[data structure]] for the [[Graph (abstract data type)|representation of graphs]] in computer programs for manipulating graphs. The main alternative data structure, also in use for this application, is the [[adjacency list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Goodrich|Tamassia|2015}}, p.&amp;nbsp;361: "There are two data structures that people often use to represent graphs, the adjacency list and the adjacency matrix."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clrs"&gt;{{citation |authorlink=Thomas H. Cormen |first=Thomas H. |last=Cormen |authorlink2=Charles E. Leiserson |first2=Charles E. |last2=Leiserson |authorlink3=Ronald L. Rivest |first3=Ronald L. |last3=Rivest |authorlink4=Clifford Stein |first4=Clifford |last4=Stein |year=2001 |title=[[Introduction to Algorithms]] |edition=Second |publisher=MIT Press and McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-262-03293-7 |chapter=Section 22.1: Representations of graphs |pages=527–531 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because each entry in the adjacency matrix requires only one bit, it can be represented in a very compact way, occupying only {{abs|''V'' }}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/8 bytes to represent a directed graph, or (by using a packed triangular format and only storing the lower triangular part of the matrix) approximately {{abs|''V'' }}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/16 bytes to represent an undirected graph. Although slightly more succinct representations are possible, this method gets close to the information-theoretic lower bound for the minimum number of bits needed to represent all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 8
 | year = 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For storing graphs in [[text file]]s, fewer bits per byte can be used to ensure that all bytes are text characters, for instance by using a [[Base64]] representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Brendan | last1=McKay | authorlink = Brendan McKay |title=Description of graph6 and sparse6 encodings|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides avoiding wasted space, this compactness encourages [[locality of reference]].
However, for a large [[sparse graph]], adjacency lists require less storage space, because they do not waste any space to represent edges that are ''not'' present.&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gt"/&gt;

An alternative form of adjacency matrix (which, however, requires a larger amount of space) replaces the numbers in each element of the matrix with pointers to edge objects (when edges are present) or null pointers (when there is no edge).&lt;ref name="gt"/&gt;
It is also possible to store [[weighted graph|edge weights]] directly in the elements of an adjacency matrix.&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;

Besides the space tradeoff, the different data structures also facilitate different operations. Finding all vertices adjacent to a given vertex in an adjacency list is as simple as reading the list, and takes time proportional to the number of neighbors. With an adjacency matrix, an entire row must instead be scanned, which takes a larger amount of time, proportional to the number of vertices in the whole graph. On the other hand, testing whether there is an edge between two given vertices can be determined at once with an adjacency matrix, while requiring time proportional to the minimum degree of the two vertices with the adjacency list.&lt;ref name="clrs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gt"&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithm Design and Applications|first1=Michael T.|last1=Goodrich|author1-link=Michael T. Goodrich|first2=Roberto|last2=Tamassia|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|page=363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:dabco.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[DABCO]], a heterocyclic, bridged bicyclic compound, formally named 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.]]
A '''bicyclic molecule''' (''bi'' = two, ''cycle'' = ring) is a molecule that features two joined [[Cyclic compound|rings]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael. B. Smith, "Organic Chemistry: An Acid—Base Approach", Taylor &amp; Francis, 2011, Page 302, https://books.google.nl/books?id=gKPtYs0jyMcC&lt;/ref&gt; Bicyclic structures occur widely, for example in many biologically important molecules like [[Thujene|α-thujene]] and [[camphor]]. A bicyclic compound can be carbocyclic (all of the ring atoms are carbons), or [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] (the rings atoms consist of at least two different elements), like [[DABCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/H/H02798.html |title=heterocyclic compounds |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=IUPAC GOLD BOOK |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the two rings can both be aliphatic (''e.g.'' [[decalin]] and [[norbornane]]), or can be aromatic (''e.g.'' [[naphthalene]]), or a combination of aliphatic and aromatic (''e.g.'' [[tetralin]]).

There are three possible modes of ring junction for a bicyclic compound:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N. Sorrell, Organic Chemistry, University Science Books, 2006, Page 99, https://books.google.nl/books?id=txmp1aoCJp8C&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[spiro compounds|'''spirocyclic compounds''']], the two rings share only one single atom, the spiro atom, which is usually a quaternary carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05881.html|title=spiro compounds |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=IUPAC GOLD BOOK |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a spirocyclic compound is the [[photochromic]] switch [[spiropyran]]. 
* In '''fused bicyclic compounds''', two rings share two adjacent atoms. In other words, the rings share one covalent bond, ''i.e.'' the so-called [[Bridgehead (disambiguation)|bridgehead atoms]] are directly connected (''e.g.'' [[Thujene|α-thujene]]  and [[decalin]]).
* In [[bridged compounds|'''bridged bicyclic compounds''']], the two rings share three or more atoms, separating the two bridgehead atoms by a bridge containing at least one atom. For example, [[norbornane]], also known as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, can be thought of as a pair of [[cyclopentane]] rings each sharing three of their five carbon atoms. The structure of [[camphor]] has the same basis as norbornane, but with some substituents added.

==Nomenclature==
Bicyclic molecules have a strict [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry : IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 (Blue Book) | publisher = [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] | date = 2014 | location = Cambridge | pages = 155–157 | doi = 10.1039/9781849733069-FP001 | isbn = 978-0-85404-182-4 |url =

Numbering of the carbon chain always begins at one bridgehead atom (where the rings meet) and follows the carbon chain along the longest path, to the next bridgehead atom. Then numbering is continued along the second longest path and so on. Fused and [[bridged compounds|bridged bicyclic compounds]] get the [[prefix]] ''bicyclo'', whereas [[spiro compounds|spirocyclic compounds]] get the prefix ''spiro''. In between the prefix and the suffix, a pair of brackets with numerals denotes the number of carbon atoms between each of the bridgehead atoms. These numbers are arranged in descending order and are separated by periods.
For example, the carbon frame of [[norbornane]] contains a total of 7 atoms, hence the root name [[heptane]]. This molecule has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and a third path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the brackets are filled in descending order: [2.2.1]. Addition of the prefix ''bicyclo'' gives the total name bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

The carbon frame of [[camphor]] also counts 7 atoms, but is substituted with a [[Carbonyl group|carbonyl]] in this case, hence the suffix heptanone. We start with numbering the carbon frame at the bridgehead atom with the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|highest priority]] ([[Methyl group|methyl]] goes before [[Hydrogen atom|proton]]), hence the bridgehead carbon in front gets number 1, the carbonyl gets number 2 and numbering continues along the carbon chain
following the longest path, until the doubly substituted top carbon (number 7). Equal to norbornane, this molecule also has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and one path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the numbers within the brackets stay [2.2.1]. Combining the brackets and suffix (now filling in the position of the carbonyl as well) gives us [2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Besides ''bicyclo'', the prefix should also specify the positions of all [[Methyl group|methyl]] [[substituent]]s so the complete, official name becomes 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one.

When naming simple fused bicyclic compounds, the same method as for bridged bicyclic compounds is applied, except the third path between the two bridgehead atoms now consists of zero atoms. Therefore, fused bicyclic compounds have a "0" included in the brackets. For example, [[decalin]] is named bicyclo[4.4.0]decane.  The numbers are sometimes omitted when no ambiguity is created as there is no alternative possible &amp;ndash; for example, bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is typically called simply [[bicyclobutane]].

The [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] molecule [[DABCO]] has a total of 8 atoms in its bridged structure, hence the root name [[octane]]. Note that here the two bridgehead atoms are [[nitrogen atom|nitrogen]] instead of [[carbon]] atoms. Therefore, the official name gets the additional [[prefix]] ''1,4-diaza'' and the total name becomes 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6451">'''Cantor's intersection theorem''' refers to two closely related theorems in [[general topology]] and [[real analysis]], named after [[Georg Cantor]], about intersections of decreasing nested [[sequence|sequences]] of non-empty compact sets.

==Topological Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Topological Space|topological space]]. A decreasing nested sequence of non-empty compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has a non-empty intersection. In other words, supposing (''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence of non-empty, compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;C_0 \supseteq C_1 \supseteq \cdots C_k \supseteq C_{k+1} \cdots, &lt;/math&gt;

it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\bigcap_{k} C_k\right) \neq \emptyset. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
Assume, by way of contradiction, that &lt;math&gt;\bigcap C_n=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. For each n, let &lt;math&gt;U_n=C_0\setminus C_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\bigcup U_n=C_0\setminus\bigcap C_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bigcap C_n=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\bigcup U_n=C_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;⊂&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is compact and &lt;math&gt;(U_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover (on &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;) of &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;, we can extract a finite cover &lt;math&gt;\{U_{n_1}, U_{n_2}, \ldots, U_{n_m}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt; be the largest set of this cover, which exists by the ordering hypothesis on the collection &lt;math&gt; (C_n).&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;⊂&lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt;. But then &lt;math&gt;C_k=C_0\setminus U_k=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.

==Statement for Real Numbers==
The theorem in real analysis draws the same conclusion for [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] subsets of the set of [[real number]]s '''R'''. It states that a decreasing nested sequence (''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) of non-empty, closed and bounded subsets of '''R''' has a non-empty intersection.

This version follows from the general topological statement in light of the [[Heine&amp;ndash;Borel theorem]], which states that sets of real numbers are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. However, it is typically used as a lemma in proving said theorem, and therefore warrants a separate proof.

As an example, if ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1/''k''], the intersection over {''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} is&amp;nbsp;{0}. On the other hand, both the sequence of open bounded sets ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;1/''k'') and the sequence of unbounded closed sets ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;[''k'',&amp;nbsp;∞) have empty intersection. All these sequences are properly nested.

This version of the theorem generalizes to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the set of ''n''-element vectors of real numbers, but does not generalize to arbitrary [[metric space]]s. For example, in the space of [[rational number]]s, the sets

: &lt;math&gt;C_k = [\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}+1/k] = (\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}+1/k)&lt;/math&gt;

are closed and bounded, but their intersection is empty.

Note that this contradicts neither the topological statement, as the sets ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are not compact, nor the variant below, as the rational numbers are not complete with respect to the usual metric.

A simple corollary of the theorem is that the [[Cantor set]] is nonempty, since it is defined as the intersection of a decreasing nested sequence of sets, each of which is defined as the union of a finite number of closed intervals; hence each of these sets is non-empty, closed, and bounded. In fact, the Cantor set contains uncountably many points.

=== Proof ===

Each closed bounded non-empty subset ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''R''' admits a minimal element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since for each ''k'', we have 
:&lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} \in C_{k+1} \subseteq C_k&lt;/math&gt;,
it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;x_k \le x_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
so (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an increasing sequence contained in the bounded set ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[Monotone convergence theorem]] now guarantees the existence of a limit point
:&lt;math&gt;x=\lim_{k\to \infty} x_k.&lt;/math&gt;
For fixed ''k'', we have that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;∈''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''j''≥''k'' and since ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; was closed, it follows that ''x''∈''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.
Our choice of ''k'' was arbitrary, hence ''x'' belongs to the intersection of all ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and the proof is complete.

== Variant in complete metric spaces ==
In a [[complete metric space]], the following variant of Cantor's intersection theorem holds.  Suppose that ''X'' is a non-empty complete metric space, and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sequence of closed nested subsets of ''X'' whose [[diameter]]s tend to zero:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \operatorname{diam}(C_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where diam(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{diam}(C_n) = \sup\{d(x,y) | x,y\in C_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the intersection of the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; contains exactly one point:
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''x'' in ''X''.

=== Proof ===

A proof goes as follows.  Since the diameters tend to zero, the diameter of the intersection of the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is zero, so it is either empty or consists of a single point.  So it is sufficient to show that it is not empty.  Pick an element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for each ''n''.  Since the diameter of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to zero and the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are nested, the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; form a Cauchy sequence.  Since the metric space is complete this Cauchy sequence converges to some point ''x''.  Since each ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is closed, and ''x'' is a limit of a sequence in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x'' must lie in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is true for every ''n'', and therefore the intersection of the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; must contain ''x''.

A converse to this theorem is also true: if ''X'' is a metric space with the property that the intersection of any nested family of closed subsets whose diameters tend to zero is non-empty, then ''X'' is a complete metric space.  (To prove this, let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be a Cauchy sequence in ''X'', and let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the closure of the tail of this sequence.)

[[Image:Nonce-cnonce-uml.svg|thumb|right|345px|Typical client–server communication during a nonce-based [[authentication]] process including both a server nonce and a client nonce.]]
In [[cryptography]], a '''nonce''' is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication. It is similar in spirit to a [[nonce word]], hence the name. It is often a [[randomness|random]] or [[pseudo-random]] number issued in an [[authentication protocol]] to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in [[replay attack]]s. They can also be useful as [[initialization vector]]s and in [[cryptographic hash functions]].

== Definition ==
A nonce is an arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication, in the spirit of a [[nonce word]]. They are often [[randomness|random]] or [[pseudo-random]] numbers. Many nonces also include a timestamp to ensure exact timeliness, though this requires clock synchronization between organizations. The addition of a client nonce ("'''cnonce'''") helps to improve the security in some ways as implemented in [[digest access authentication]]. To ensure that a nonce is used only once, it should be time-variant (including a suitably fine-grained [[timestamp]] in its value), or generated with enough random bits to ensure a probabilistically insignificant chance of repeating a previously generated value. Some authors define pseudo-randomness (or unpredictability) as a requirement for a nonce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/nonce.pdf Nonce-Based Symmetric Encryption]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
=== Authentication ===
[[Authentication protocol]]s may use nonces to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in [[replay attack]]s. For instance, nonces are used in [[HTTP]] [[digest access authentication]] to calculate an [[MD5]] digest of the [[password]]. The nonces are different each time the 401 authentication challenge [[list of HTTP status codes|response code]] is presented, thus making [[replay attack]]s virtually impossible. The scenario of ordering products over the Internet can provide an example of the usefulness of nonces in replay attacks. An attacker could take the encrypted information and—without needing to decrypt—could continue to send a particular order to the supplier, thereby ordering products over and over again under the same name and purchase information. The nonce is used to give 'originality' to a given message so that if the company receives any other orders from the same person with the same nonce, it will discard those as invalid orders.

A nonce may be used to ensure security for a [[stream cipher]].  Where the same key is used for more than one message and then a different nonce is used to ensure that the [[keystream]] is different for different messages encrypted with that key; often the message number is used.

Secret nonce values are used by the [[Lamport signature]] scheme as a signer-side secret which can be selectively revealed for comparison to public hashes for signature creation and verification.

=== Initialization vectors ===
[[Initialization vector]]s may be referred to as nonces, as they are typically random or pseudo-random.

=== Hashing ===
Nonces are used in [[proof-of-work system]]s to vary the input to a [[cryptographic hash function]] so as to obtain a hash for a certain input that fulfills certain arbitrary conditions. In doing so, it becomes far more difficult to create a "desirable" hash than to verify it, shifting the burden of work onto one side of a transaction or system. For example, proof of work, using hash functions, was considered as a means to combat [[email spam]] by forcing email senders to find a hash value for the email (which included a timestamp to prevent pre-computation of useful hashes for later use) that had an arbitrary number of leading zeroes, by hashing the same input with a large number of nonce values until a "desirable" hash was obtained.

Similarly, the [[bitcoin]] [[blockchain]] hashing algorithm can be tuned to an arbitrary difficulty by changing the required minimum/maximum value of the hash so that the number of bitcoins awarded for new blocks does not increase linearly with increased network computation power as new users join. This is likewise achieved by forcing bitcoin miners to add nonce values to the value being hashed to change the hash algorithm output. Because cryptographic hash algorithms cannot easily be predicted based on their inputs, this makes the act of blockchain hashing and the possibility of being awarded bitcoins something of a lottery, where the first "miner" to find a nonce that delivers a desirable hash is awarded bitcoins.

'''Daina Taimina''' ({{lang-lv|Taimiņa}}; born August 19, 1954) is a [[Latvians|Latvian]] [[mathematician]], currently Adjunct Associate Professor at [[Cornell University]], known for [[crochet]]ing objects to illustrate [[hyperbolic space]].

==Education and career==

Taimina received all her formal education in [[Riga]], Latvia, where in 1977 she graduated summa cum laude from the [[University of Latvia]] and completed her graduate work in theoretical computer science (supervised by Prof. [[Rūsiņš Mārtiņš Freivalds]]) in 1990. At that time, a doctoral thesis had to be defended outside of Latvia, so she defended hers in [[Minsk]]. This explains the fact that formally Taimina's doctorate was issued by the Institute of Mathematics of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]]. After Latvia regained independence in 1991, Taimina received her doctorate in mathematics from the [[University of Latvia]], where she taught for 20 years.

Daina Taimina joined the Cornell Math Department in December 1996.

==Hyperbolic crochet==
While attending a geometry workshop in 1997, she saw fragile paper models of hyperbolic planes, designed by [[geometer]] [[William Thurston]].&lt;ref name="math.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~dwh/papers/crochet/crochet.html|title=Body|website=www.math.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; She decided to make more durable models, and did so by crocheting them.&lt;ref name="math.cornell.edu"/&gt; Due to her success in this she was invited, together with her husband [[David W. Henderson|David Henderson]], a math professor also at Cornell, to give a presentation at a Cornell workshop.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citation | last = York | first = Michelle | date = July 11, 2005 | journal = [[The New York Times]] | title = Professor Lets Her Fingers Do the Talking | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/11/nyregion/11cornell.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Crocheted mathematical models later appeared in three geometry textbooks they wrote together, of which the most popular is ''Experiencing Geometry: Euclidean and non-Euclidean with History''.

An article about Taimina's innovation in ''[[New Scientist]]'' was spotted by the [[Institute For Figuring]], a small non-profit organisation based in [[Los Angeles]], and she was invited to speak about hyperbolic space and its connections with nature to a general audience  which included artists and movie producers.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Taimina's initial lecture and following other public presentations sparked great interest in this new tactile way of exploring concepts of hyperbolic geometry, making this advanced topic accessible to wide audiences. Originally creating purely mathematical models, Taimina soon became popular as a fiber artist and public presenter for general audiences of ages five and up. In June 2005, her work was first shown as art in an exhibition "Not The Knitting You Know" at [[Eleven Eleven Sculpture Space]], an art gallery in [[Washington, D.C.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleveneleven.50webs.com/taimina.html|title=Eleven Eleven -- Not The Knitting You Know: Daina Taimina|website=eleveneleven.50webs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then she has participated regularly in various shows in galleries in US, UK, Latvia, Italy, Belgium, Ireland.  Her artwork is in the collections of several private collectors, colleges and universities, and has been included in the American Mathematical Model Collection of the [[Smithsonian Museum]], [[Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum]], and [[Institut Henri Poincaré]].

Her work has received wide interest in media.  It has been written about in 'Knit Theory' in [[Discover magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/mar/knit-theory|title=Knit Theory - DiscoverMagazine.com|website=discovermagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times ([[Alex Bellos]] “How Crochet Solved age-old Math Problem”, The Times, July 1, 2008 ) [[Margaret Wertheim]] interviewed Daina Taimina and David Henderson for Cabinet Magazine &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, the Institute For Figuring published a brochure "A Field Guide to Hyperbolic Space". In 2005 the IFF decided that to incorporate Taimina's ideas and approach of explaining hyperbolic space in their mission of popularizing mathematics, and curated an exhibition at Machine Project gallery, which was the subject of a piece in the [[Los Angeles Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/29/entertainment/et-galleries29 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Pagel | date=July 29, 2005 | title=Well now, isn't this a cozy little cosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Taimina's way of exploring hyperbolic space via crochet and connections with nature, combatting [[math phobia]], was adapted by [[Margaret Wertheim]] in her talks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/margaret_wertheim_crochets_the_coral_reef.html|title=The beautiful math of coral|website=ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became highly successful in the IFF-curated [[Hyperbolic Crochet Coral Reef project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crochetcoralreef.org|title=Crochet Coral Reef|website=crochetcoralreef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Taimina's book "Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes" ([[A K Peters, Ltd.]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-56881-452-0}}) won the 2009 [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| location=London}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It also won the 2012 [[Euler Book Prize]] of the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/journal-writing-awards/euler-book-prize/2012-euler-winner-announced|title=2012 Euler Winner Announced - Mathematical Association of America|website=www.maa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taimina also contributed to [[David W. Henderson]]'s book ''Differential Geometry: A Geometric Introduction'' (Prentice Hall, 1998) and, with Henderson, wrote ''Experiencing Geometry: Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History'' (Prentice Hall, 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8345">'''Data at rest''' in [[information technology]] means inactive data that is stored physically in any digital form (e.g. [[database]]s, [[Data warehouse|data warehouses]], [[Spreadsheet|spreadsheets]], archives, tapes, off-site backups, [[Mobile device|mobile devices]] etc.). 
[[File:3 states of data.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: The 3 states of data.]]

''Data at rest'' is used as a complement to the terms ''[[data in use]]'' and ''[[data in transit]]'' which together define the three states of digital data (''see Figure 1'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortoninternetsecurity.cc/2011/03/data-loss-prevention.html |title=Data Loss Prevention &amp;#124; Norton Internet Security |publisher=Nortoninternetsecurity.cc |date=2011-03-12 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Alternative definition ==
There is some disagreement as to the boundary between data at rest and [[data in use]]. Data at rest generally refers to data stored in persistent storage (disk, tape) while data in use generally refers to data being processed by a computer central processing unit ([[CPU]]) or in random access memory ([[RAM]], also referred to as main memory or simply memory). 
Definitions include: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...all data in computer storage while excluding data that is traversing a network or temporarily residing in computer memory to be read or updated."&lt;ref name="techtarget1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/data-at-rest |title=What is data at rest? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Searchstorage.techtarget.com |date=2012-12-22 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
[[File:DAR v DIU.JPG|thumb|Figure 2: Data at Rest vs Data in Use.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...all data in storage but excludes any data that frequently traverses the network or that which resides in temporary memory. Data at rest includes but is not limited to archived data, data which is not accessed or changed frequently, files stored on hard drives, USB thumb drives, files stored on backup tape and disks, and also files stored off-site or on a [[storage area network]] (SAN)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/data_at_rest.html |title=What is data at rest? - A Word Definition From the Webopedia Computer Dictionary |publisher=Webopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Data in use''' has also been taken to mean “active data” in the context of being in a database or being manipulated by an application.  For example, some [[enterprise encryption gateway]] solutions for the cloud claim to encrypt data at rest, [[data in transit]] and [[data in use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityweek.com/ciphercloud-brings-encryption-microsoft-office-365 |title=CipherCloud Brings Encryption to Microsoft Office 365 |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is generally accepted that archive data (i.e. which never changes), regardless of its storage medium, is data at rest and active data subject to constant or frequent change is data in use. “Inactive data” could be taken to mean data which may change, but infrequently. The imprecise nature of terms such as “constant” and “frequent” means that some stored data cannot be comprehensively defined as either data at rest or in use. These definitions could be taken to assume that Data at Rest is a superset of data in use; however, data in use, subject to frequent change, has distinct processing requirements from data at rest, whether completely static or subject to occasional change.

The division of data at rest into the sub-categories "static" and "inconstant" addresses this distinction (''see Figure 2'')..

== Concerns about data at rest ==
Because of its nature data at rest is of increasing concern to businesses, government agencies and other institutions.&lt;ref name="techtarget1"/&gt; Mobile devices are often subject to specific security protocols to protect data at rest from unauthorised access when lost or stolen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordon.army.mil/nec/documents/BBP%20Data%20at%20Rest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and there is an increasing recognition that database management systems and file servers should also be considered as at risk;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/research/spotlight/asset_63248_895.jsp |title=IT Research, Magic Quadrants, Hype Cycles |publisher=Gartner |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the longer data is left unused in storage, the more likely it might be retrieved by unauthorized individuals outside the network.

=== Encryption ===
[[Data encryption]], which prevents data visibility in the event of its unauthorized access or theft, is commonly used to protect data in motion and increasingly promoted for protecting data at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Inmon |first=Bill |url=http://www.information-management.com/issues/20050801/1033567-1.html |title=Encryption at Rest - Information Management Magazine Article |publisher=Information-management.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encryption of data at rest should only include strong encryption methods such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]].  Encrypted data should remain encrypted when access controls such as usernames and password fail.  Increasing encryption on multiple levels is recommended.  [[Cryptography]] can be implemented on the database housing the data and on the physical storage where the databases are stored.    Data encryption keys should be updated on a regular basis.  Encryption keys should be stored separately from the data.  Encryption also enables [[crypto-shredding]] at the end of the data or hardware lifecycle. Periodic auditing of sensitive data should be part of policy and should occur on scheduled occurrences.  Finally, only store the minimum possible amount of sensitive data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet |title=Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet |publisher=OWASP |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tokenization ===
[[Tokenization (data security)|Tokenization]] is a non-mathematical approach to protecting data at rest that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens, which have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. This process does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. 

Tokens require significantly less computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally encrypted data. This is achieved by keeping specific data fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. Lower processing and storage requirements makes tokenization an ideal method of securing data at rest in systems that manage large volumes of data. 

=== Federation ===
A further method of preventing unwanted access to data at rest is the use of data federation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-soa-infoserv1 |title=Information service patterns, Part 1: Data federation pattern |publisher=Ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when data is distributed globally (e.g. in off-shore archives). An example of this would be a European organisation which stores its archived data off-site in the USA. Under the terms of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/patriot/index.html |title=USA Patriot Act |publisher=Fincen.gov |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2012-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228161833/http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/patriot/index.html |archivedate=2012-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the American authorities can demand access to all data physically stored within its boundaries, even if it includes personal information on European citizens with no connections to the USA. Data encryption alone cannot be used to prevent this as the authorities have the right to demand decrypted information. A data federation policy which retained personal citizen information with no foreign connections within its country of origin (separate from information which is either not personal or is relevant to off-shore authorities) is one option to address this concern.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2015}}

In [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], the '''dilution ratio''' is the ratio of solute to solvent. It is often used for ''simple dilutions,'' one in which a unit volume of a liquid material of interest is combined with an appropriate volume of a solvent liquid to achieve the desired concentration. The diluted material must be thoroughly mixed to achieve the true dilution. For example, in a 1:5 dilution, with a 1:5 dilution ratio, entails combining 1 unit volume of solute (the material to be diluted) with 5 unit volumes of the solvent to give 6 total units of total volume.

This is often confused with "dilution factor" which is an expression which describes the ratio of the aliquot volume to the final volume. Dilution factor is a notation often used in commercial assays. For example, in a 1:5 dilution, with a 1:5 dilution factor, (verbalize as "1 to 5" dilution) entails combining 1 unit volume of solute (the material to be diluted) with (approximately) 4 unit volumes of the solvent to give 5 units of total volume. Note that some solutions and mixtures take up slightly less volume than their components.

The dilution factor can be expressed using exponents: 1:5 would be 5e−1 (5&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. one-fifth:one); 1:100 would be 10e−2 (10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. one hundredth:one), and so on.

There is often confusion between dilution ratio (1:n meaning 1 part solute to n parts solvent) and dilution factor (1:n+1) where the second number (n+1) represents the total volume of solute + solvent.  In scientific and serial dilution assays, the given dilution factor often means the ratio to the final volume, not to just the solvent. The factors then can easily be multiplied to give an overall dilution factor. Some have suggested that dilution factors should more clearly be written as a/total or a þ b, as the use of the colon symbol ":" is widely used to represent ratios in fields like [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], or [[organic chemistry]]. Leave ratios for actual ratios 1:100 = 101. However, at this time, both dilution conventions are widely used at this time -which is why it is important for laboratory personnel to always clarify whether a "dilution ratio" or "dilution factor" ought to be used in performing dilutions.


In analytical chemistry, dilution factor is always greater than 1 using equation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dilution Factor Chemistry|url=http://www.ausetute.com.au/dfactor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ,
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math style="width:30%"&gt;\mbox{dilution factor} = \frac{\mbox{final volume}}{\mbox{initial volume}} = \frac{\mbox{n+1}}{\mbox{1}} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemocytometer.org/dilution-factor/|title=Dilution factor calculation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

or sometimes the inverse for other fields: &lt;math style="width:30%"&gt;\mbox{dilution factor} = \frac{\mbox{initial volume}}{\mbox{final volume}} = \frac{\mbox{1}}{\mbox{n+1}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathbench serial dilution|url=http://mathbench.umd.edu/modules/microbio_serial-dilution/page03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In other areas of science such as pharmacy, and in non-scientific usage, a dilution is normally given as a plain ratio of solvent to solute.  For large factors, this confusion makes only a minor difference, but in precise work it can be important to make clear which ratio is intended.

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''discrete Weibull distribution''' is the [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] variant of the [[Weibull distribution]]. It was first described by Nakagawa and Osaki in 1975.

==Alternative parametrizations==
In the original paper by Nakagawa and Osaki they used the parametrization &lt;math&gt;q = e^{-\alpha^{-\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; making the cmf &lt;math&gt;1-q^{(x+1)^\beta}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Setting &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt; makes the relationship with the geometric distribution apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nakagawa, Toshio  |author2=Osaki, Shunji|title=The discrete Weibull distribution|journal=Reliability, IEEE Transactions on|date=1975|volume=24|pages=300–301|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5214915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location-scale transformation==
The continuous Weibull distribution has a close relationship with the [[Gumbel distribution]] which is easy to see when log-transforming the variable. A similar transformation can be made on the discrete-weibull.

Define &lt;math&gt;e^Y-1 = X &lt;/math&gt; where (unconventionally) &lt;math&gt; Y =\log(X+1)\in \{ \log(1), \log(2), \ldots \}&lt;/math&gt; and define parameters &lt;math&gt;\mu = \log(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{1}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;. By replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the cmf:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Pr(X\leq x) = \Pr(X\leq e^y-1).
&lt;/math&gt;

We see that we get a location-scale parametrization:
: &lt;math&gt;
= 1-\exp\left[-\left(\frac{x+1}{\alpha}\right)^\beta			\right]  
= 1-\exp\left[-\left(\frac{e^y}{e^\mu} \right)^\frac{1}{\sigma}	\right] 
= 1-\exp\left[-\exp\left[\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right]			\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

which in estimation-settings makes a lot of sense. This opens up the possibility of regression with frameworks developed for weibull-regression and extreme-value-theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">In [[mathematics]], and specifically in [[measure theory]], '''equivalence''' is a notion of two [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] being qualitatively similar. Specifically, the two measures agree on which events have measure zero.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; be two [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] on the measurable space &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal A) &lt;/math&gt;, and let 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal N_\mu := \{ A \in \mathcal A \mid \mu(A)=0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
be the set of all &lt;math&gt; \mu&lt;/math&gt;-[[null set]]s; &lt;math&gt; \mathcal N_\nu &lt;/math&gt; is similarly defined. Then the measure &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[Absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] in reference to &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt; \mathcal N_\nu \supset \mathcal N_\mu &lt;/math&gt;. This is denoted as &lt;math&gt; \nu \ll \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

The two measures are called equivalent iff &lt;math&gt; \mu \ll \nu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu \ll \mu &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klenke |first1=Achim |year=2008  |title=Probability Theory |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-048-3 |isbn=978-1-84800-047-6|page=156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mu \sim \nu&lt;/math&gt;. An equivalent definition is that two measures are equivalent if they satisfy &lt;math&gt; \mathcal N_\mu = \mathcal N_\nu &lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
=== On the real line ===
Define the two measures on the real line as
:&lt;math&gt; \mu(A)= \int_A \mathbf 1_{[0,1]}(x) \mathrm dx &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \nu(A)= \int_A  x^2 \mathbf 1_{[0,1]}(x) \mathrm dx &lt;/math&gt;
for all [[Borel set]]s &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; are equivalent, since all sets outside of &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt; \mu/\nu&lt;/math&gt; measure zero, and a set inside &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt; \mu/\nu&lt;/math&gt; null set in respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]].

=== Abstract measure space ===
Look at some measurable space &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal A) &lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; be the [[counting measure]], so
:&lt;math&gt; \mu(A)= |A| &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; |A| &lt;/math&gt; is the [[cardinality]] of the set a. So the counting measure has only one null set, which is the [[empty set]]. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal N_\mu= \{ \emptyset\} &lt;/math&gt;.

So by the second definition, any other measure &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the counting measure iff it also has just the empty set as the only null set.

== Supporting measures ==
A measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''supporting measure''' of a measure &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is [[sigma-finite|&lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-finite]] and &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kallenberg |first1=Olav |author-link1=Olav Kallenberg |year=2017  |title=Random Measures, Theory and Applications|location= Switzerland |publisher=Springer |doi= 10.1007/978-3-319-41598-7|isbn=978-3-319-41596-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5663">An '''exponential-Golomb code''' (or just '''Exp-Golomb code''') is a type of [[Universal code (data compression)|universal code]].  To encode any [[nonnegative integer]] ''x'' using the exp-Golomb code:
# Write down ''x''+1 in binary
# Count the bits written, subtract one, and write that number of starting zero bits preceding the previous bit string.

The first few values of the code are:
  0 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 1
  1 ⇒ 10 ⇒ 010
  2 ⇒ 11 ⇒ 011
  3 ⇒ 100 ⇒ 00100
  4 ⇒ 101 ⇒ 00101
  5 ⇒ 110 ⇒ 00110
  6 ⇒ 111 ⇒ 00111
  7 ⇒ 1000 ⇒ 0001000
  8 ⇒ 1001 ⇒ 0001001
 ...&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;

This is identical to the [[Elias gamma code]] of ''x''+1, allowing it to encode 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rupp |first = Markus |title = Video and Multimedia Transmissions over Cellular Networks: Analysis, Modelling and Optimization in Live 3G Mobile Networks |year = 2009 |publisher = Wiley |pages = 149 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H9hUBT-JvUoC&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=Exponential-Golomb%20coding&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q=Exponential-Golomb%20coding&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension to negative numbers==
Exp-Golomb coding for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is used in the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and H.265 [[High Efficiency Video Coding]] video compression standards, in which there is also a variation for the coding of signed numbers by assigning the value 0 to the binary codeword '0' and assigning subsequent codewords to input values of increasing magnitude (and alternating sign, if the field can contain a negative number):
  0 ⇒ 0 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 1
  1 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 10 ⇒ 010
 −1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 11 ⇒ 011
  2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 100 ⇒ 00100
 −2 ⇒ 4 ⇒ 101 ⇒ 00101
  3 ⇒ 5 ⇒ 110 ⇒ 00110
 −3 ⇒ 6 ⇒ 111 ⇒ 00111
  4 ⇒ 7 ⇒ 1000 ⇒ 0001000
 −4 ⇒ 8 ⇒ 1001 ⇒ 0001001
 ...&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;{{cite book |last = Richardson |first = Iain |title = The H.264 Advanced Video Compression Standard |year = 2010 |publisher = Wiley |isbn = 978-0-470-51692-8 |pages = 208,221 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LJoDiPnBzQ8C&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=Exponential-Golomb%20coding&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q=Exponential-Golomb%20coding&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, a non-positive integer ''x''≤0 is mapped to an even integer −2''x'', while a positive integer ''x''&amp;gt;0 is mapped to an odd integer 2''x''−1.

Exp-Golomb coding is also used in the [[Dirac (video compression format)|Dirac video codec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dirac Specification |url = http://diracvideo.org/download/specification/dirac-spec-latest.pdf |publisher = BBC |accessdate = 9 March 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503015104/http://diracvideo.org/download/specification/dirac-spec-latest.pdf |archivedate = 2015-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization to order ''k''==
To encode larger numbers in fewer bits (at the expense of using more bits to encode smaller numbers), this can be generalized using a [[nonnegative integer]] parameter &amp;nbsp;''k''.  To encode a nonnegative integer ''x'' in an order-''k''&amp;nbsp;exp-Golomb code:
# Encode ⌊''x''/2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;⌋ using order-0 exp-Golomb code described above, then
# Encode ''x'' mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in binary
An equivalent way of expressing this is:
# Encode ''x''+2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;−1 using the order-0 exp-Golomb code (i.e. encode ''x''+2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; using the Elias gamma code), then
# Delete ''k'' leading zero bits from the encoding result

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">In mathematical [[representation theory]], a '''good filtration''' is a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] of a representation of a [[reductive algebraic group]] ''G''  such that the [[subquotient]]s are isomorphic to the spaces of [[Section (fiber bundle)|sections]] ''F''(λ) of [[line bundle]]s λ over ''G''/''B'' for a [[Borel subgroup]] ''B''. In [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 this is automatically true as the [[Simple module|irreducible modules]] are all of the form ''F''(λ), but this is not usually true in positive characteristic. {{harvtxt|Mathieu|1990}} showed that the [[tensor product of representations|tensor product of two modules]] ''F''(λ)⊗''F''(μ) has a good filtration, completing the results of {{harvtxt|Donkin|1985}} who proved it in most cases and {{harvtxt|Wang|1982}} who proved it in large characteristic.  {{harvtxt|Littelmann|1992}} showed that the existence of good filtrations for these tensor products also follows from [[standard monomial theory]].

In [[mathematical logic]], '''Goodstein's theorem''' is a statement about the [[natural number]]s, proved by [[Reuben Goodstein]] in 1944, which states that every ''Goodstein sequence'' eventually terminates at 0. Kirby and Paris&lt;ref name="kirkbyparis"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1112/blms/14.4.285| title = Accessible Independence Results for Peano Arithmetic| journal = Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society| volume = 14| issue = 4| pages = 285| year = 1982| url = http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/term/Kirbyparis.pdf| last1 = Kirby | first1 = L.| last2 = Paris | first2 = J.| authorlink2 = Jeff Paris (mathematician)}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that it is [[independence (mathematical logic)|unprovable]] in [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] (but it can be proven in stronger systems, such as [[second-order arithmetic]]). This was the third example of a true statement that is unprovable in Peano arithmetic, after [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and [[Gerhard Gentzen]]'s 1943 direct proof of the unprovability of ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-induction in Peano arithmetic. The [[Paris–Harrington theorem]] was a later example.

Laurence Kirby and [[Jeff Paris (mathematician)|Jeff Paris]] introduced a graph-theoretic '''hydra game''' with behavior similar to that of Goodstein sequences: the "[[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]" is a rooted tree, and a move consists of cutting off one of its "heads" (a branch of the tree), to which the hydra responds by growing a finite number of new heads according to certain rules.  Kirby and Paris proved that the Hydra will eventually be killed, regardless of the strategy that Hercules uses to chop off its heads, though this may take a very long time. Just like for Goodstein sequences, Kirby and Paris showed that it cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic alone.&lt;ref name="kirkbyparis"/&gt;

== Hereditary base-''n'' notation ==
Goodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called "hereditary base-''n'' notation". This notation is very similar to usual base-''n'' positional notation, but the usual notation does not suffice for the purposes of Goodstein's theorem.

In ordinary base-''n'' notation, where ''n'' is a natural number greater than 1, an arbitrary natural number ''m'' is written as a sum of multiples of powers of ''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;m = a_k n^k + a_{k-1} n^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0,&lt;/math&gt;
where each coefficient ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' satisfies {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;lt; ''n''}}, and {{nowrap|''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0}}. For example, in base 2,
:&lt;math&gt;35 = 32 + 2 + 1 = 2^5 + 2^1 + 2^0.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the base-2 representation of 35 is 100011, which means {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 + 1}}.  Similarly, 100 represented in base 3 is 10201:
:&lt;math&gt;100 = 81 + 18 + 1 = 3^4 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3^0.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the exponents themselves are not written in base-''n'' notation. For example, the expressions above include 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

To convert a base-''n'' representation to hereditary base-''n'' notation, first rewrite all of the exponents in base-''n'' notation. Then rewrite any exponents inside the exponents, and continue in this way until every number appearing in the expression has been converted to base-''n'' notation.

For example, while 35 in ordinary base-2 notation is {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 + 1}}, it is written in hereditary base-2 notation as
:&lt;math&gt;35 = 2^{2^2+1}+2+1, &lt;/math&gt;
using the fact that {{nowrap|1=5 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1.}} Similarly, 100 in hereditary base-3 notation is
:&lt;math&gt;100 = 3^{3+1} + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

== Goodstein sequences ==

The '''Goodstein sequence'''  ''G''(''m'') of a number ''m'' is a sequence of natural numbers. The first element in the sequence ''G''(''m'') is ''m'' itself. To get the second, ''G''(''m'')(2), write ''m'' in hereditary base-2 notation, change all the 2s to 3s, and then subtract 1 from the result. In general, the {{nowrap|(''n'' + 1)-st}} term {{nowrap|''G''(''m'')(''n'' + 1)}} of the Goodstein sequence of ''m'' is as follows:
* Take the hereditary base-{{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} representation of ''G''(''m'')(''n'').
* Replace each occurrence of the base-{{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} with {{nowrap|''n'' + 2}}.
* Subtract one. (Note that the next term depends both on the previous term and on the index ''n''.)
* Continue until the result is zero, at which point the sequence terminates.

Early Goodstein sequences terminate quickly. For example, ''G''(3) terminates at the 6th step:

|    2 || &lt;math&gt; 2^1 + 1 &lt;/math&gt;           || 3 || Write 3 in base-2 notation

|    7 || &lt;math&gt; 1 - 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;         || 0 || No 6s left to switch to 7s. Just subtract 1
|}

Later Goodstein sequences increase for a very large number of steps. For example, ''G''(4) {{OEIS2C|id=A056193}} starts as follows:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Hereditary notation !! Value

| &lt;math&gt; 2^2 &lt;/math&gt;                                                || 4
|-
| &lt;math&gt; 3^3 - 1 = 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 &lt;/math&gt;              || 26

|-
| &lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot 7^2 + 7 + 4 &lt;/math&gt;                                || 109
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;                                             || &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot 11^2 + 11 &lt;/math&gt;                                  || 253
|-
| &lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot 12^2 + 12 - 1 = 2 \cdot 12^2 + 11 &lt;/math&gt;          || 299
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;                                             || &lt;math&gt; \vdots &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot 24^2 - 1 = 24^2 + 24 \cdot 23 + 23 &lt;/math&gt;         || 1151
|}

&lt;!-- In theory, the inline &lt; math&gt; tags should be replaced by HTML, but I think it would become illegible. --&gt;Elements of ''G''(4) continue to increase for a while, but at base &lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 2^{402\,653\,209}&lt;/math&gt;,
they reach the maximum of &lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 2^{402\,653\,210} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, stay there for the next &lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 2^{402\,653\,209}&lt;/math&gt; steps, and then begin their first and final descent.

The value 0 is reached at base &lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 2^{402\,653\,211} - 1&lt;/math&gt;. (Curiously, this is a [[Woodall number]]: &lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 2^{402\,653\,211} - 1 = 402\,653\,184 \cdot 2^{402\,653\,184} - 1&lt;/math&gt;. This is also the case with all other final bases for starting values greater than 4.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}})

However, even ''G''(4) doesn't give a good idea of just ''how'' quickly the elements of a Goodstein sequence can increase.
''G''(19) increases much more rapidly and starts as follows:

In spite of this rapid growth, Goodstein's theorem states that '''every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0''', no matter what the starting value is.

== Proof of Goodstein's theorem ==

Goodstein's theorem can be proved (using techniques outside Peano arithmetic, see below) as follows: Given a Goodstein sequence ''G''(''m''), we construct a parallel sequence ''P''(''m'') of [[ordinal number]]s which is strictly decreasing and terminates. Then ''G''(''m'') must terminate too, and it can terminate only when it goes to 0. A common misunderstanding of this proof is to believe that ''G''(''m'') goes to 0 ''because'' it is dominated by ''P''(''m''). Actually, the fact that ''P''(''m'') dominates ''G''(''m'') plays no role at all. The important point is: ''G''(''m'')(''k'') exists if and only if ''P''(''m'')(''k'') exists (parallelism). Then if ''P''(''m'') terminates, so does ''G''(''m''). And ''G''(''m'') can terminate only when it comes to 0.

More precisely, each term ''P''(''m'')(''n'') of the sequence ''P''(''m'') is obtained by applying a function ''f'' on the term ''G''(''m'')(''n'') of the Goodstein sequence of ''m'' as follows: take the hereditary base {{nowrap|''n''+1}} representation of ''G''(''m'')(''n''), and replace each occurrence of the base {{nowrap|''n''+1}} with the first infinite [[ordinal number]] ω. For example, {{nowrap|1=''G''(3)(1) = 3 = 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''P''(3)(1) = ''f''(''G''(3)(1)) = ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ω + 1}}. Addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal numbers are well defined.

* The ''base-changing'' operation of the Goodstein sequence when going from ''G''(''m'')(''n'') to {{nowrap|''G''(''m'')(''n''+1)}} does not change the value of ''f'' (that's the main point of the construction), thus after the ''minus 1'' operation, {{nowrap|''P''(''m'')(''n''+1)}} will be strictly smaller than ''P''(''m'')(''n''). For example, &lt;math&gt;f(3 \cdot 4^{4^4} + 4) = 3 \omega^{\omega^\omega} + \omega= f(3 \cdot 5^{5^5} + 5)&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;f(3 \cdot 4^{4^4} + 4)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than &lt;math&gt;f((3 \cdot 5^{5^5} + 5 )-1).&lt;/math&gt;

If the sequence ''G''(''m'') did not go to 0, it would not terminate and would be infinite (since {{nowrap|''G''(''m'')(''k''+1)}} would always exist). Consequently, ''P''(''m'') also would be infinite (since in its turn {{nowrap|''P''(''m'')(''k''+1)}} would always exist too). But ''P''(''m'') is strictly decreasing and the standard order &lt; on ordinals is [[well-founded]], therefore an infinite strictly decreasing sequence cannot exist, or equivalently, every strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals does terminate (and cannot be infinite). This contradiction shows that ''G''(''m'') terminates, and since it terminates, goes to 0 (by the way, since there exists a natural number ''k'' such that {{nowrap|1=''G''(''m'')(''k'') = 0}}, by construction of ''P''(''m'') we have that {{nowrap|1=''P''(''m'')(''k'') = 0}}).

While this proof of Goodstein's theorem is fairly easy, the ''Kirby–Paris theorem'',&lt;ref name="kirkbyparis"/&gt; which shows that Goodstein's theorem is not a theorem of Peano arithmetic, is technical and considerably more difficult. It makes use of [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|countable nonstandard models]] of Peano arithmetic.

== Extended Goodstein's theorem ==

Suppose the definition Goodstein sequence is changed so that instead of
replacing each occurrence of the base ''b'' with {{nowrap|''b''+1}}
it was replaces it with {{nowrap|''b''+2}}. Would the sequence still terminate?
More generally, let ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; be any sequences of integers.
Then let the {{nowrap|''n''+1st}}
term {{nowrap|''G''(''m'')(''n''+1)}} of the extended Goodstein sequence of ''m'' be as
follows: take the hereditary base ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' representation of
''G''(''m'')(''n''), and replace each occurrence of the base ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
with {{nowrap|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and then subtract one.
The claim is that this sequence still terminates.
The extended proof defines {{nowrap|1 = ''P''(''m'')(''n'') = ''f''(''G''(''m'')(''n''), ''n'')}} as
follows: take the hereditary base ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' representation of
''G''(''m'')(''n''), and replace each occurrence of the base
''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the first infinite [[ordinal number]] ω.
The ''base-changing'' operation of the Goodstein sequence when going
from ''G''(''m'')(''n'') to {{nowrap|''G''(''m'')(''n''+1)}} still does not change the value of ''f''.
For example, if {{nowrap|1=''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4}} and if {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 9}},
then
&lt;math&gt;f(3 \cdot 4^{4^4} + 4,4) = 3 \omega^{\omega^\omega} + \omega= f(3
\cdot 9^{9^9} + 9,9)&lt;/math&gt;, hence the ordinal &lt;math&gt;f(3 \cdot 4^{4^4} +
4,4)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than the ordinal &lt;math&gt;f((3 \cdot
9^{9^9} + 9 )-1,9).&lt;/math&gt;

== Sequence length as a function of the starting value ==

The '''Goodstein function''', &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;, is defined such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the Goodstein sequence that starts with ''n''.  (This is a [[total function]] since every Goodstein sequence terminates.)  The extreme growth-rate of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; can be calibrated by relating it to various standard ordinal-indexed hierarchies of functions, such as the functions &lt;math&gt;H_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Hardy hierarchy]], and the functions &lt;math&gt;f_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the [[fast-growing hierarchy]] of Löb and Wainer:

* Kirby and Paris (1982) proved that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; has approximately the same growth-rate as &lt;math&gt;H_{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; (which is the same as that of &lt;math&gt;f_{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;); more precisely, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; dominates &lt;math&gt;H_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H_{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; dominates &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}\,\!.&lt;/math&gt;
:(For any two functions &lt;math&gt;f, g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''dominate''' &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f(n) &gt; g(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.)

* Cichon (1983) showed that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}(n) = H_{R_2^\omega(n+1)}(1) - 1, &lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;R_2^\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the result of putting ''n'' in hereditary base-2 notation and then replacing all 2s with ω (as was done in the proof of Goodstein's theorem).

* Caicedo (2007) showed that if &lt;math&gt; n = 2^{m_1} + 2^{m_2} + \cdots + 2^{m_k} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; m_1 &gt; m_2 &gt; \cdots &gt; m_k, &lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}(n) = f_{R_2^\omega(m_1)}(f_{R_2^\omega(m_2)}(\cdots(f_{R_2^\omega(m_k)}(3))\cdots)) - 2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application to computable functions ==

Goodstein's theorem can be used to construct a total [[computable function]] that Peano arithmetic cannot prove to be total.  The Goodstein sequence of a number can be effectively enumerated by a [[Turing machine]]; thus the function which maps ''n'' to the number of steps required for the Goodstein sequence of ''n'' to terminate is computable by a particular Turing machine.  This machine merely enumerates the Goodstein sequence of ''n'' and, when the sequence reaches ''0'', returns the length of the sequence.  Because every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates, this function is total.   But because Peano arithmetic does not prove that every Goodstein sequence terminates, Peano arithmetic does not prove that this Turing machine computes a total function.

'''GraphML''' is an [[XML]]-based file format for [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. The GraphML file format results from the joint effort of the [[graph drawing]] community to define a common format for exchanging graph structure data. It uses an XML-based syntax and supports the entire range of possible graph structure constellations including directed, undirected, [[mixed graph]]s, [[hypergraph]]s, and application-specific attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=Graph Markup Language (GraphML)|first1=Ulrik|last1=Brandes|first2=Markus|last2=Eiglsperger|first3=Jürgen|last3=Lerner|first4=Christian|last4=Pich|url=http://cs.brown.edu/people/rtamassi/gdhandbook/chapters/graphml.pdf|pages=517–541|editor-first=Roberto|editor-last=Tamassia|editor-link=Roberto Tamassia|title=Handbook of Graph Drawing and Visualization|publisher=CRC Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A GraphML file consists of an XML file containing a &lt;code&gt;graph&lt;/code&gt; element, within which is an unordered sequence of &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edge&lt;/code&gt; elements. Each &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; element should have a distinct &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute, and each &lt;code&gt;edge&lt;/code&gt; element has &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; attributes that identify the endpoints of an edge by having the same value as the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attributes of those endpoints.
Here is what a simple undirected graph with two nodes and one edge between them looks like:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;graphml xmlns="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns"  
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;graph id="G" edgedefault="undirected"&gt;
    &lt;node id="n0"/&gt;
    &lt;node id="n1"/&gt;
    &lt;edge id="e1" source="n0" target="n1"/&gt;
  &lt;/graph&gt;
&lt;/graphml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Additional features of the GraphML language allow its users to specify whether edges are directed or undirected, and to associate additional data with vertices or edges.

Important graph polynomials include:
*The [[characteristic polynomial]], based on the graph's [[adjacency matrix]].
*The [[chromatic polynomial]], a polynomial whose values at integer arguments give the number of colorings of the graph with that many colors.
*The [[dichromatic polynomial]], a 2-variable generalization of the chromatic polynomial
*The [[flow polynomial]], a polynomial whose values at integer arguments give the number of [[nowhere-zero flow]]s with integer flow amounts modulo the argument.
*The (inverse of the) [[Ihara zeta function]], defined as a product of binomial terms corresponding to certain closed walks in a graph.
*The [[Martin polynomial]], used by Pierre Martin to study [[Euler tour]]s
*The [[matching polynomial]]s, several different polynomials defined as the [[generating function]] of the [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]] of a graph.
*The [[reliability polynomial]], a polynomial that describes the probability of remaining connected after independent edge failures
*The [[Tutte polynomial]], a polynomial in two variables that can be defined (after a small change of variables) as the generating function of the numbers of connected components of [[induced subgraph]]s of the given graph, parameterized by the number of vertices in the subgraph.

'''Grigorii Mikhailovich Fichtenholz''' (or '''Fikhtengolts''') ({{lang-ru|Григо́рий Миха́йлович Фихтенго́льц}}) (June 5, 1888 in [[Odessa]] &amp;ndash; June 26, 1959 in [[Leningrad]]) was a Russian mathematician working on [[real analysis]] and [[functional analysis]].  Fichtenholz was one of the founders of the Leningrad school of real analysis.

He also authored a three-volume textbook 'Differential and Integral Calculus'. The books cover mathematical analysis of function of one real variable, functions of many real variables and of complex functions. Due to depth and precision of presentation of material, these books are defined as classical position in mathematical analysis. Book was translated, among others, into German, Chinese, and Persian however translation to English language has not been done still.

Fichtenholz's books about analysis are widely used in Middle and Eastern European as well as Chinese universities due to its exceptionality of detailed and well-ordered presentation of material about mathematical analysis. Due to unknown reasons, these books do not have the same fame in universities in other areas of the world.

He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1924 in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fichtenholz, Gr. M.|chapter=Sur la notion de fermeture des systèmes de fonctions|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, August 11–16. 1924|volume=vol. 1|page=686|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1924.1/Main/icm1924.1.0686.0686.ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Kantorovich]] and [[Isidor Natanson]] were among his students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="753">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''first-order Gödel logic''' is a member of a family of [[finite-valued logic|finite-]] or [[infinite-valued logic]]s in which the sets of [[truth value]]s ''V'' are closed subsets of the interval [0,1] containing both 0 and 1. Different such sets ''V'' in general determine different Gödel logics.  The concept is named after [[Kurt Gödel]].

'''''Harmonices Mundi'''''&lt;ref name=h.mundi&gt;The full title is ''Ioannis Keppleri Harmonices mundi libri V'' (''The Five Books of Johannes Kepler's The Harmony of the World'').&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''The Harmony of the World'', 1619) is a book by [[Johannes Kepler]].  In the work Kepler discusses [[harmony]] and [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] in geometrical forms and physical phenomena.  The final section of the work relates his discovery of the so-called "[[third law of planetary motion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Harmonices Mundi'' [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1619), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLlCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 189.]  From the bottom of p. 189:  ''"Sed res est certissima extactissimaque quod ''proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise sesquialtera proportionis'' mediarum distantiarum, id est ''Orbium'' ipsorum; … "''  (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ''proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion'' [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, that is, of the actual ''spheres'', … "&lt;br/&gt;
An English translation of Kepler's ''Harmonices Mundi'' is available as:  Johannes Kepler with E.J. Aiton, A.M. Duncan, and J.V. Field, trans., ''The Harmony of the World'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  American Philosophical Society, 1997); see especially [https://books.google.com/books?id=rEkLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA411#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 411].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
It is estimated that Kepler had begun working on ''Harmonices Mundi'' sometime near 1599, which was the year Kepler sent a letter to [[Maestlin]] detailing the mathematical data and proofs that he intended to use for his upcoming text, which he originally planned to name ''De harmonia mundi''.  Kepler was aware that the content of ''Harmonices Mundi'' closely resembled that of the subject matter for [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy’s]] ''Harmonica'', but was not concerned because the new [[astronomy]] Kepler would use, most notably the adoption of [[elliptic orbits]] in the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]], allowed him to explore new theorems.  Another important development that allowed Kepler to establish his celestial-harmonic relationships, was the abandonment of the [[Pythagorean tuning]] as the basis for [[Consonance and dissonance|musical consonance]] and the adoption of geometrically supported musical ratios; this would eventually be what allowed Kepler to relate musical consonance and the angular velocities of the planets.  Thus Kepler could reason that his relationships gave evidence for God acting as a grand geometer, rather than a [[Numerology|Pythagorean numerologist]].&lt;ref name=field&gt;Field, J. V. (1984). A Lutheran astrologer: Johannes Kepler. Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 207-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of musical harmonies intrinsically existing within the spacing of the planets existed in medieval philosophy prior to Kepler. [[Music of the Spheres|Musica Universalis]] was a traditional philosophical metaphor that was taught in the [[quadrivium]], and was often referred to as the “[[music of the spheres]].”  Kepler was intrigued by this idea while he sought explanation for a rational arrangement of the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref name=voelkel&gt;Voelkel, J. R. (1995). The music of the heavens: Kepler's harmonic astronomy. 1994. Physics Today, 48(6), 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that when Kepler uses the term “harmony” it is not strictly referring to the musical definition, but rather, a broader definition encompassing congruence in [[Nature]] and the workings of both the [[Astronomical object|celestial]] and [[Earth|terrestrial]] bodies.  He notes musical harmony as being a product of man, derived from angles, in contrast to a harmony that he refers to as being a phenomenon that interacts with the human [[soul]].  In turn, this allowed Kepler to claim the [[Earth]] has a soul because it is subjected to [[Astrology|astrological]] harmony.&lt;ref name="field"/&gt;

==Content==
Kepler divides ''The Harmony of the World'' into five long chapters: the first is on regular polygons; the second is on the congruence of figures; the third is on the origin of harmonic proportions in music; the fourth is on [[Astrological aspects|harmonic configurations in astrology]]; and the fifth on the harmony of the motions of the planets.&lt;ref name="Brackenridge"&gt;Brackenridge, J. (1982). Kepler, elliptical orbits, and celestial circularity: A study in the persistence of metaphysical commitment part II. Annals of Science, 39(3), 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SmallStellatedDodecahedron.gif|thumb|right|Small stellated dodecahedron]][[File:GreatStellatedDodecahedron.gif|thumb|right|Great stellated dodecahedron]]Chapters 1 and 2 of ''The Harmony of the World'' contain most of Kepler’s contributions concerning [[polyhedra]]. He is primarily interested with how polygons, which he defines as either regular or semiregular, can come to be fixed together around a central point on a plane to form congruence. His primary objective was to be able to rank polygons based on a measure of sociability, or rather, their ability to form partial congruence when combined with other polyhedra. He returns to this concept later in ''Harmonices Mundi'' with relation to astronomical explanations. In the second chapter is the earliest mathematical understanding of two types of [[regular polyhedron|regular]] [[star polyhedron|star polyhedra]], the [[small stellated dodecahedron|small]] and [[great stellated dodecahedron]]; they would later be referred to as Kepler's solids or Kepler Polyhedra and, together with two regular polyhedra discovered by [[Louis Poinsot]], as the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;Cromwell, P. R. (1995). Kepler's work on polyhedra. Mathematical Intelligencer, 17(3), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes polyhedra in terms of their faces, which is similar to the model used in [[Plato|Plato’s]] ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' to describe the formation of [[Platonic solid]]s in terms of basic triangles.&lt;ref name="field"/&gt;

While medieval philosophers spoke metaphorically of the "music of the spheres", Kepler discovered physical harmonies in planetary motion. He found that the difference between the maximum and minimum angular speeds of a [[planet]] in its orbit approximates a harmonic proportion. For instance, the maximum angular speed of the Earth as measured from the Sun varies by a [[semitone]] (a ratio of 16:15), from ''mi'' to ''fa'', between [[aphelion]] and [[perihelion]]. Venus only varies by a tiny 25:24 interval (called a [[diesis]] in musical terms).&lt;ref name="Brackenridge"/&gt; Kepler explains the reason for the Earth's small harmonic range:

:The Earth sings Mi, Fa, Mi:  you may infer even from the syllables that in this our home '''mi'''sery and '''fa'''mine hold sway.&lt;ref name="Schoot, A. 2001"&gt;Schoot, A. (2001). Kepler's search for form and proportion. Renaissance Studies: Journal of the Society for Renaissance Studies, 15(1), 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The celestial choir Kepler formed was made up of a tenor ([[Mars]]), two bass ([[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]), a soprano ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), and two altos ([[Venus]] and Earth).  Mercury, with its large elliptical orbit, was determined to be able to produce the greatest number of notes, while Venus was found to be capable of only a single note because its orbit is nearly a circle.&lt;ref name="Brackenridge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The opening of the film ''[[Mars et Avril]]'', by [[Martin Villeneuve]], is based on Kepler's cosmological model in ''Harmonices Mundi'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies. [[Benoît Charest]] also composed the score according to this theory. This opening sequence can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/66697472&lt;/ref&gt;

At very rare intervals all of the planets would sing together in "perfect concord":  Kepler proposed that this may have happened only once in history, perhaps at the time of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, D. P. (1964). Kepler’s celestial music. Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 30, pp. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler reminds us that harmonic order is only mimicked by man, but has origin in the alignment of the heavenly bodies:

:Accordingly you won’t wonder any more that a very excellent order of sounds or pitches in a musical system or scale has been set up by men, since you see that they are doing nothing else in this business except to play the apes of God the Creator and to act out, as it were, a certain drama of the ordination of the celestial movements. (''Harmonices Mundi'', Book V).&lt;ref name="Brackenridge"/&gt;

Kepler discovers that all but one of the ratios of the maximum and minimum speeds of planets on neighboring [[orbit]]s approximate musical harmonies within a margin of error of less than a diesis (a 25:24 interval). The orbits of Mars and Jupiter produce the one exception to this rule, creating the inharmonic ratio of 18:19.&lt;ref name="Brackenridge"/&gt;  The cause of this dissonance might be explained by the fact that the [[asteroid belt]] separates those two planetary orbits, as discovered in 1801, 150 years after Kepler's death.

Kepler's previous book ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' related the discovery of the first two of the principles that we know today as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]]. The third law, which shows a constant proportionality between the cube of the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit and the square of the time of its orbital period, is set out in Chapter 5 of this book,&lt;ref name="Schoot, A. 2001"/&gt; immediately after a long digression on astrology.

==Recent history==
A copy of the 1619 edition was stolen from the [[National Library of Sweden]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books stolen from the National Library of Sweden between the years 1995-2004|url=http://www.kb.se/english/about/news/Updated-list-of-stolen-books/|publisher=National Library of Sweden|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7948">'''Ilona Palásti''' (1924–1991) was a Hungarian mathematician who worked at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics]]. She is known for her research in [[discrete geometry]], [[geometric probability]], and the theory of [[random graph]]s.{{r|fmi}}
With [[Alfréd Rényi]] and others, she was considered to be one of the members of the Hungarian School of Probability.{{r|leading}}

==Contributions==
In connection to the [[Erdős distinct distances problem]], Palásti studied the existence of point sets for which the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th least frequent distance occurs &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; times. That is, in such points there is one distance that occurs only once, another distance that occurs exactly two times, a third distance that occurs exactly three times, etc. For instance, three points with this structure must form an [[isosceles triangle]]. Any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; evenly-spaced points on a line or [[circular arc]] also have the same property, but [[Paul Erdős]] asked whether this is possible for points in [[general position]] (no three on a line, and no four on a circle). Palásti found an eight-point set with this property, and showed that for any number of points between three and eight (inclusive) there is a subset of the [[hexagonal lattice]] with this property. Palásti's eight-point example remains the largest known.{{r|pano|bicycle}}{{ran|E}}

Another of Palásti's results in discrete geometry concerns [[Arrangement of lines#Triangles in arrangements|the number of triangular faces in an arrangement of lines]]. When no three lines may cross at a single point, she and [[Zoltán Füredi]] found sets of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; lines, subsets of the diagonals of a regular &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;-gon, having &lt;math&gt;n(n-3)/3&lt;/math&gt; triangles. This remains the best lower bound known for this problem, and differs from the upper bound by only &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; triangles.{{r|pano}}{{ran|D}}

In [[geometric probability]], Palásti is known for her conjecture on [[random sequential adsorption]], also known in the one-dimensional case as "the parking problem". In this problem, one places non-overlapping balls within a given region, one at a time with random locations, until no more can be placed. Palásti conjectured that the average packing density in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space could be computed as the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;th power of the one-dimensional density.{{r|craft}} Although her conjecture led to subsequent research in the same area, it has been shown to be inconsistent with the actual average packing density in dimensions two through four.{{r|bs}}{{ran|A}}

Palásti's results in the theory of random graphs include bounds on the probability that a random graph has a [[Hamiltonian circuit]], and on the probability that a random [[directed graph]] is [[Strongly connected component|strongly connected]].{{r|rg}}{{ran|B}}{{ran|C}}

In the area of modern algebra known as [[group theory]], the '''Janko groups''' are the four [[sporadic simple group]]s ''[[Janko group J1| J&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]'', ''[[Janko group J2| J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]'', ''[[Janko group J3| J&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]'' and ''[[Janko group J4| J&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]'' introduced by [[Zvonimir Janko]].   Unlike the [[Mathieu groups]], [[Conway groups]], or [[Fischer groups]], the Janko groups do not form a series, and the relation among the four groups is mainly historical rather than mathematical.

== History ==
Janko constructed the first of these groups, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, in 1965 and predicted the existence of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  In 1976, he suggested the existence of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  Later, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; were all shown to exist.

''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; was the first sporadic simple group discovered in nearly a century: until then only the [[Mathieu group]]s were known, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; having been found in 1861, and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; in 1873. The discovery of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; caused a great "sensation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Held]], ''[http://www.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/arbeitsgruppen/gruppentheorie/held/klassifi.pdf Die Klassifikation der endlichen einfachen Gruppen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626081216/http://www.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/arbeitsgruppen/gruppentheorie/held/klassifi.pdf |date=2013-06-26 }}'' (the classification of the finite simple groups), Forschungsmagazin der [[University of Mainz|Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz]] 1/86
&lt;/ref&gt; and "surprise"&lt;ref&gt;The group theorist [[Bertram Huppert]] said of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: 
"There were a very few things that surprised me in my life... There were only the following two events that really surprised me: the discovery of the first Janko group and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]." [http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/janko/index.html#janko_groups]
 &lt;/ref&gt; among group theory specialists. This began the modern theory of sporadic groups. 

And in a sense, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ended it. It would be the last sporadic group (and, since the non-sporadic families had already been found, the last finite simple group) predicted and discovered, though this could only be said in hindsight when the [[classification of finite simple groups|Classification theorem]] was completed.

'''Jean Cavaillès''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|v|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|s}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ kavajɛs|lang}}; May 15, 1903 – February 17, 1944) was a [[French philosopher]] and logician who specialized in [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]]. He took part in the [[French Resistance]] within the ''[[Libération-Nord|Libération]]'' movement and was shot by the [[Gestapo]] on February 17, 1944.

==Early life and education==
Cavaillès was born in [[Saint-Maixent-l'École|Saint-Maixent]], [[Deux-Sèvres]]. After passing his first [[baccalauréat]] in 1919 and baccalauréats in mathematics and philosophy the following year, he studied at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]], including two years of ''[[:fr:classes préparatoires]]'', before entering the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1923, reading philosophy. In 1927 he successfully passed the ''[[agrégation]]'' competitive exam. He began graduate studies in Philosophy in 1928 under the supervision of [[Léon Brunschvicg]]. Cavaillès won a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] scholarship in 1929-1930. In 1931 he travelled extensively in Germany; in Göttingen he conceived, jointly with [[Emmy Noether]], the project of publishing the [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]--[[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] correpsondence. He was a teaching assistant at the École Normale Supérieure between 1929 and 1935, then teacher at the Lycée d'Amiens (now [[:fr:Lycée_Louis-Thuillier]]) in 1936. In 1937, he successfully defended his doctoral theses&lt;ref&gt;''Méthode axiomatique et formalisme'' (''thèse principale'') and ''Remarques sur la formation de la théorie abstraite des ensembles'' (''thèse complémentaire'') under the direction of [[Léon Brunschvicg]].&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Paris]] and became a [[Doctor of Letters]] in Philosophy. He was then appointed [[:fr:maître de conférences]] in Logic and in General Philosophy at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

==World War II==
After the outbreaks of World War II, he was mobilized in 1939 as an infantry lieutenant with the 43rd Regiment, and was later attached to the Staff of the 4th [[French Colonial Forces|Colonial Division]]. He was honoured for bravery twice, and was captured on June 11, 1940. At the end of July 1940 he escaped from Belgium and fled to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where the university of Strasbourg was re-organized.

At the end of December 1940, he met [[Emmanuel d'Astier|Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie]], with whom he created a small group of resistance fighters, known as "the Last Column". To reach a broader audience, it was decided to create a newspaper, which was to become ''[[Libération_(newspaper,_1941-1964)|Libération]]'', the mouthpiece of both ''[[Libération-Sud]]'' and ''[[Libération-Nord]]''. Cavaillès took an active part in editing the paper. The first edition appeared in July 1941.

He was appointed professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1941, and left Clermont-Ferrand for [[Paris]], where he helped form the Libération-Nord resistance group, becoming part of its management committee.

In April 1942, at the instigation of [[Christian Pineau]], the central Office of Information and Action ([[Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action|BCRA]]) of London charged him with the task of forming an intelligence network in the Northern Zone, known as "Cohors". He was ordered by [[Christian Pineau]] to pass into the Southern Zone, and Cavaillès headed the network and formed similar groups in Belgium and the north of France.

In [[Narbonne]] he was arrested with Pineau by the [[French police]] in September 1942. After a failed attempt at escaping to London, he was interned in [[Montpellier]] at the Saint-Paul d' Eyjeaux prison camp from where he escaped at the end of December 1942. The book Cavaillès wrote in prison in Montpellier in 1942 was published posthumously in 1946, edited by the epistemologist [[Georges Canguilhem]] and the mathematician [[Charles Ehresmann]] under the title ''Sur la logique et la theorie de la science''.

Denounced as a public enemy by the [[Vichy regime]], and sought by the police, he fled clandestinely to London in February 1943. There he met General [[Charles de Gaulle]] on several occasions.

Back in France on April 15 he resigned from the management Committee of the ''Libération'' movement in order to dedicate himself entirely to direct action. He was in charge of the sabotage of the stores of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' in [[Brittany]] and German radio installations on the coast.

Betrayed by one of his liaison officers, he was arrested on August 28, 1943 in Paris with his sister and her brother-in-law. Tortured, imprisoned in [[Fresnes Prison|Fresnes]] then in [[Compiègne]], he was transferred to the Citadel from Arras and was shot on February 17, 1944. Buried in [[Arras]] under a wooden cross marked "unknown n°5", his body was exhumed in 1946 to be buried in the Crypt in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], in Paris.

==Legacy==
The Centre Cavaillès de l'[[École Normale Supérieure]] was established in Paris in 1969, at 3e étage au 29 rue d'Ulm, as Centre for the Study of the History and Philosophy of Science. At the formal opening, philosopher [[Georges Canguilhem]] said, "A philosopher-mathematician loaded with explosives, lucid and reckless, resolute without optimism. If that's not a hero, what is a hero?" (Translated from the original [[French language]]: "Un philosophe mathématicien bourré d'explosifs, un lucide téméraire, un résolu sans optimisme. Si ce n'est pas un héros, qu'est-ce qu'un héros?)&lt;ref&gt;Georges Canguihem, ''Vie et mort de Jean Cavaillès'', Paris: Éditions Allia, 2004, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavaillès is honored in the [[Heroes of the Resistance]] postage stamp set.

In ''[[L'Armée des ombres]]'', a 1969 film directed by [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], the character of ''Luc Jardie'' (the Chief) was in part inspired by Cavaillès.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Jardie's chief operative, recuperating from injuries in a hideaway, has only five books; the title of each is a publication of Cavaillès, though the author is shown as "Luc Jardie."

[[File:Acute Triangle.svg|thumb|right|A triangle labelled with the components of the law of sines. Capital {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''C''}} are the angles, and lower-case {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are the sides opposite them. ({{math|''a''}} opposite {{math|''A''}}, etc.)]]
{{Trigonometry}}
In [[trigonometry]], the '''law of sines''', '''sine law''', '''sine formula''', or '''sine rule''' is an [[equation]] relating the [[lengths]] of the sides of a [[triangle]] (any shape) to the [[sine]]s of its angles. According to the law,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{\sin A} \,=\, \frac{b}{\sin B} \,=\, \frac{c}{\sin C} \,=\, d, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and {{math|''A'', ''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} are the opposite angles (see the figure to the right), while {{math|''d''}} is the [[diameter]] of the triangle's [[circumcircle]]. When the last part of the equation is not used, the law is sometimes stated using the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]];

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sin A}{a} \,=\, \frac{\sin B}{b} \,=\, \frac{\sin C}{c}. &lt;/math&gt;

The law of sines can be used to compute the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known—a technique known as [[triangulation]]. It can also be used when two sides and one of the non-enclosed angles are known. In some such cases, the triangle is not uniquely determined by this data (called the ''ambiguous case'') and the technique gives two possible values for the enclosed angle.

The law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations commonly applied to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles, with the other being the [[law of cosines]].

The law of sines can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature.&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedLawofSines.html|website=mathworld|title=Generalized law of sines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
The area {{math|''T''}} of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height.  Selecting one side of the triangle as the base, the height of the triangle relative to that base is computed as the length of another side times the sine of the angle between the chosen side and the base.  Thus, depending on the selection of the base the area of the triangle can be written as any of:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2}b(c \sin A) = \frac{1}{2}c(a \sin B) = \frac{1}{2}a(b \sin C)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying these by {{math|{{sfrac|2|''abc''}}}} gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2T}{abc} = \frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==The ambiguous case of triangle solution==
When using the law of sines to find a side of a triangle, an ambiguous case occurs when two separate triangles can be constructed from the data provided (i.e., there are two different possible solutions to the triangle). In the case shown below they are triangles {{math|''ABC''}} and {{math|''AB′C′''}}.

:[[File:PictureAmbitext.svg]]

Given a general triangle, the following conditions would need to be fulfilled for the case to be ambiguous:
* The only information known about the triangle is the angle {{math|''A''}} and the sides {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''c''}}.
* The angle {{math|''A''}} is [[Angle#Types of angles|acute]] (i.e., {{math|''A''}} &lt; 90°).
* The side {{math|''a''}} is shorter than the side {{math|''c''}} (i.e., {{math|''a'' &lt; ''c''}}).
* The side {{math|''a''}} is longer than the altitude {{math|''h''}} from angle {{math|''B''}}, where {{math|''h'' {{=}} ''c'' sin ''A''}} (i.e., {{math|''a'' &gt; ''h''}}).

If all the above conditions are true, then both angles {{math|''C''}} or {{math|''C′''}} produce a valid triangle, meaning that both of the following are true:

:&lt;math&gt; C' = \arcsin\frac{c \sin A}{a} \text{ or } C = \pi - \arcsin\frac{c \sin A}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

From there we can find the corresponding {{math|''B''}} and {{math|''b''}} or {{math|''B′''}} and {{math|''b′''}} if required, where {{math|''b''}} is the side bounded by angles {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''b′''}} bounded by {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''C′''}}.

Without further information it is impossible to decide which is the triangle being asked for.

==Examples==
The following are examples of how to solve a problem using the law of sines.

===Example 1===
Given: side {{math|''a'' {{=}} 20}}, side {{math|''c'' {{=}} 24}}, and angle {{math|''C'' {{=}} 40°}}. Angle A is desired.

Using the law of sines, we conclude that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{20} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{24}.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A = \arcsin\left( \frac{20\sin 40^\circ}{24} \right) \approx 32.39^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the potential solution {{math|1=''A'' = 147.61°}} is excluded because that would necessarily give {{math|1=''A'' + ''B'' + ''C'' &gt; 180°}}.

===Example 2===
If the lengths of two sides of the triangle {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are equal to {{math|''x''}}, the third side has length {{math|''c''}}, and the angles opposite the sides of lengths {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} respectively then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; A = B = \frac{180^\circ-C}{2}= 90^\circ-\frac{C}{2} \\[6pt]
&amp; \sin A = \sin B = \sin \left(90^\circ-\frac{C}{2}\right) = \cos \left(\frac{C}{2}\right) \\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{c}{\sin C}=\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{x}{\cos \left(\frac{C}{2}\right)} \\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{c \cos \left(\frac{C}{2}\right)}{\sin C} = x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to the circumcircle==
In the identity

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C},&lt;/math&gt;

the common value of the three fractions is actually the [[diameter]] of the triangle's [[circumcircle]] which dates back to [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, H. S. M. and Greitzer, S. L. ''Geometry Revisited''. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., pp. 1–3, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pballew.net/lawofsin.html|title=Law of Sines|website=www.pballew.net|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sinelaw radius.jpg|thumb|Deriving the ratio of the sine law equal to the circumscribing diameter. Note that triangle ADB passes through the center of the circumscribing circle.]]

=== Proof ===
As shown in the figure, let's have a circle with inscribed&lt;math&gt; \bigtriangleup ABC&lt;/math&gt;  and another inscribed &lt;math&gt; \bigtriangleup ADB&lt;/math&gt; that passes through the circle's center '''O'''. The &lt;math&gt; \angle AOD&lt;/math&gt; has a [[central angle]] of ''&lt;math&gt; 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;'' thus &lt;math&gt; \angle ABD = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; \bigtriangleup ABD&lt;/math&gt; is a right triangle,

:&lt;math&gt; \sin D= \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}= \frac{c}{2R}&lt;/math&gt;

Angles &lt;math&gt; \angle C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \angle D&lt;/math&gt; has the same [[central angle]] thus they are the same &lt;math&gt; \angle C=\angle D&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \sin D= \sin C=\frac{c}{2R}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,

:&lt;math&gt; 2R=\frac{c}{\sin C}&lt;/math&gt;

Repeating the process of creating &lt;math&gt; \bigtriangleup ADB&lt;/math&gt; with other points respectively, gives

{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}=2R&lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt; R&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circumscribing circle of the triangle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Relationship to the area of the triangle ===
The area of a triangle can be solved by &lt;math&gt;T=0.5ab \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting the sine law to the equation,

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2}ab \cdot \frac {c}{2R}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as the circumscribing radius,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mr. T's Math Videos|title=Area of a Triangle and Radius of its Circumscribed Circle|date=2015-06-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6QNGDPG4Og|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{abc}{4R}&lt;/math&gt;}}

It can also be shown that this quantity is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{abc} {2T} &amp; = \frac{abc} {2\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}} \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac {2abc} {\sqrt{{(a^2+b^2+c^2)}^2-2(a^4+b^4+c^4) }},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''T''}} is the area of the triangle and {{math|''s''}} is the [[semiperimeter]]

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality above readily simplifies to [[Heron's formula]] for the area. Neatly, it can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{abc}{4T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the triangle's circumcircle.

==Curvature==
The law of sines takes on a similar form in the presence of curvature.

===Spherical case===
In the spherical case, the formula is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{\sin B}{\sin \beta} = \frac{\sin C}{\sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are the angles at the center of the sphere subtended by the three arcs of the spherical surface triangle {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, respectively. {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}} are the surface angles opposite their respective arcs.

[[File:Spherical trigonometry vectors.svg|thumb|right|200px]]
Here is a simple derivation. Consider a unit sphere with three unit vectors {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}} drawn from the origin to the vertices of the triangle. Thus the angles {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are the angles {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, respectively. The arc {{math|BC}} subtends an angle of magnitude {{math|''a''}} at the centre. Introduce a Cartesian basis with {{math|'''OA'''}} along the {{math|''z''}}-axis and {{math|'''OB'''}} in the {{math|''xz''}}-plane making an angle {{math|''c''}} with the {{math|''z''}}-axis. The vector {{math|'''OC'''}} projects to {{math|ON}} in the {{math|''xy''}}-plane and the angle between {{math|ON}} and the {{math|''x''}}-axis is {{math|''A''}}. Therefore, the three vectors have components:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{OA} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{OB} = \begin{pmatrix}\sin c \\ 0 \\ \cos c\end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{OC} = \begin{pmatrix}\sin b\cos A \\ \sin b\sin A \\ \cos b\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[scalar triple product]], {{math|'''OA''' · ('''OB''' × '''OC''')}} is the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] formed by the position vectors of the vertices of the spherical triangle {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}}. This volume is invariant to the specific coordinate system used to represent {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}}. The value of the [[scalar triple product]] {{math|'''OA''' · ('''OB''' × '''OC''')}} is the 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 determinant with {{math|'''OA'''}}, {{math|'''OB'''}} and {{math|'''OC'''}} as its rows.  With the {{math|''z''}}-axis along {{math|'''OA'''}} the square of this determinant is
:&lt;math&gt;	
\begin{align}
\bigl(\mathbf{OA} \cdot (\mathbf{OB} \times \mathbf{OC})\bigr)^2 &amp; = \bigl(\det (\mathbf{OA}, \mathbf{OB}, \mathbf{OC})\bigr)^2 \\[4pt]
&amp; =  \left( \begin{vmatrix} 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 	 	
\sin c &amp; 0 &amp; \cos c \\ 	
\sin b \cos A &amp; \sin b \sin A &amp; \cos b 	
\end{vmatrix} \right)^2 = \left(\sin b \sin c \sin A\right)^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Repeating this calculation with the {{math|''z''}}-axis along {{math|'''OB'''}} gives {{math|(sin ''c'' sin ''a'' sin ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, while with the {{math|''z''}}-axis along {{math|'''OC'''}} it is {{math|(sin ''a'' sin ''b'' sin ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Equating these expressions and dividing throughout by {{math|(sin ''a'' sin ''b'' sin ''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} gives 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\sin^2 A}{\sin^2 a}=\frac{\sin^2 B}{\sin^2 b}=\frac{\sin^2 C}{\sin^2 c} = \frac{V^2}{\sin^2 a \sin^2 b \sin^2 c},
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|V}} is the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] formed by the position vector of the vertices of the spherical triangle.

It is easy to see how for small spherical triangles, when the radius of the sphere is much greater than the sides of the triangle, this formula becomes the planar formula at the limit, since

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\alpha \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

and the same for {{math|sin ''β''}} and {{math|sin ''γ''}}.

{{see also|Spherical trigonometry|Spherical law of cosines|Half-side formula}}

===Hyperbolic case===
In [[hyperbolic geometry]] when the curvature is −1, the law of sines becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{\sinh a} = \frac{\sin B}{\sinh b} = \frac{\sin C}{\sinh c} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case when {{math|''B''}} is a right angle, one gets
:&lt;math&gt;\sin C = \frac{\sinh c}{\sinh b} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the analog of the formula in Euclidean geometry expressing the sine of an angle as the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse.

:See also [[hyperbolic triangle]].

===Unified formulation===
Define a generalized sine function, depending also on a real parameter {{math|''K''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin_K x = x - \frac{K x^3}{3!} + \frac{K^2 x^5}{5!} - \frac{K^3 x^7}{7!} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

The law of sines in constant curvature {{math|''K''}} reads as&lt;ref name="mathworld"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{\sin_K a} = \frac{\sin B}{\sin_K b} = \frac{\sin C}{\sin_K c} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting {{math|''K'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''K'' {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|''K'' {{=}} −1}}, one obtains respectively the Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic cases of the law of sines described above.

Let {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'')}} indicate the circumference of a circle of radius {{math|''r''}} in a space of constant curvature {{math|''K''}}. Then {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') {{=}} 2π sin&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''}}. Therefore the law of sines can also be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{p_K(a)} = \frac{\sin B}{p_K(b)} = \frac{\sin C}{p_K(c)} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation was discovered by [[János Bolyai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katok|first=Svetlana|authorlink=Svetlana Katok|title=Fuchsian groups|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-42583-5|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher dimensions==
For an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[simplex]] (i.e., [[triangle]] ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}), [[tetrahedron]] ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}}), [[pentatope]] ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}), etc.) in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the [[absolute value]] of the [[polar sine]] of the [[normal vector]]s of the [[face (geometry)|face]]s that meet at a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]], divided by the hyperarea of the face opposite the vertex is independent of the choice of the vertex.  Writing {{math|''V''}} for the hypervolume of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional simplex and {{math|''P''}} for the product of the hyperareas of its {{math|(''n''−1)}}-dimensional faces, the common ratio is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{(nV)^{n-1}}{(n-1)! P}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a tetrahedron has four triangular faces.  The absolute value of the polar sine of the normal vectors to the three faces that share a vertex, divided by the area of the fourth face will not depend upon the choice of the vertex:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\bigl|\operatorname{psin}(\mathbf{n_2}, \mathbf{n_3}, \mathbf{n_4})\bigr|}{\mathrm{Area}_1} =
\frac{\bigl|\operatorname{psin}(\mathbf{n_1}, \mathbf{n_3}, \mathbf{n_4})\bigr|}{\mathrm{Area}_2} =
\frac{\bigl|\operatorname{psin}(\mathbf{n_1}, \mathbf{n_2}, \mathbf{n_4})\bigr|}{\mathrm{Area}_3} =
\frac{\bigl|\operatorname{psin}(\mathbf{n_1}, \mathbf{n_2}, \mathbf{n_3})\bigr|}{\mathrm{Area}_4} \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{(3\operatorname{Volume}_\mathrm{tetrahedron})^2}{2!~\mathrm{Area}_1 \mathrm{Area}_2 \mathrm{Area}_3 \mathrm{Area}_4}\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
According to [[Ubiratàn D'Ambrosio]] and [[Helaine Selin]], the spherical law of sines was discovered in the 10th century. It is variously attributed to [[Abu-Mahmud Khojandi]], [[Abu al-Wafa' Buzjani]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] and [[Abu Nasr Mansur]].&lt;ref name=Sesiano&gt;Sesiano just lists al-Wafa as a contributor. Sesiano, Jacques (2000) "Islamic mathematics" pp. 137–157, in {{citation|title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-western Mathematics|first1=Helaine|last1=Selin|first2=Ubiratan|last2=D'Ambrosio|year=2000|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1-4020-0260-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī]]'s ''The book of unknown arcs of a sphere'' in the 11th century contains the general law of sines.&lt;ref name="MacTutor Al-Jayyani"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Jayyani|title=Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muadh Al-Jayyani}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane law of sines was later stated in the 13th century by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]]. In his ''On the Sector Figure'', he stated the law of sines for plane and spherical triangles, and provided proofs for this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J. Lennart | last=Berggren | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A Sourcebook | chapter=Mathematics in Medieval Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | page=518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Glen Van Brummelen]], "The Law of Sines is really [[Regiomontanus]]'s foundation for his solutions of right-angled triangles in Book IV, and these solutions are in turn the bases for his solutions of general triangles."&lt;ref&gt;Glen Van Brummelen (2009). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bHD8IBaYN-oC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The mathematics of the heavens and the earth: the early history of trigonometry]''". Princeton University Press. p.259. {{isbn|0-691-12973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regiomontanus was a 15th-century German mathematician.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1324">'''MIME Object Security Services''' (MOSS) is a protocol that uses the [[multipart/signed]] and [[multipart/encrypted]] framework to apply [[digital signature]] and [[encryption]] services to [[MIME]] objects.

==Details==
The services are offered through the use of end-to-end [[cryptography]] between an originator and a recipient at the [[application layer]]. Asymmetric (public key) cryptography is used in support of the digital signature service and encryption key management. Symmetric (secret key) cryptography is used in support of the encryption service. The procedures are intended to be compatible with a wide range of public key management approaches, including both ad hoc and certificate-based schemes. Mechanisms are provided to support many public key management approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

MOSS was never widely deployed and is now abandoned, largely due to the popularity of [[Pretty Good Privacy | PGP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4014">In [[statistics]], the '''matrix variate Dirichlet distribution''' is a generalization of the [[matrix variate beta distribution]].

Suppose &lt;math&gt;U_1,\ldots,U_r&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;p\times p&lt;/math&gt; [[positive definite matrix|positive definite matrices]] with &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^rU_i&lt;I_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;p\times p&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]].  Then we say that the &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; have a matrix variate Dirichlet distribution, &lt;math&gt;\left(U_1,\ldots,U_r\right)\sim D_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_r;a_{r+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, if their joint [[probability density function]] is

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{\beta_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_r,a_{r+1}\right)\right\}^{-1}\prod_{i=1}^{r}\det\left(U_i\right)^{a_i-(p+1)/2}\det\left(I_p-\sum_{i=1}^rU_i\right)^{a_{r+1}-(p+1)/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_i&gt;(p-1)/2,i=1,\ldots,r+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_p\left(\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[multivariate beta function]].

If we write &lt;math&gt;U_{r+1}=I_p-\sum_{i=1}^r U_i&lt;/math&gt; then the PDF takes the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{\beta_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_{r+1}\right)\right\}^{-1}\prod_{i=1}^{r+1}\det\left(U_i\right)^{a_i-(p+1)/2},
&lt;/math&gt;

on the understanding that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^rU_i=I_p&lt;/math&gt;.

== Theorems ==

=== generalization of chi-squared-Dirichlet result===

Suppose &lt;math&gt;S_i\sim W_p\left(n_i,\Sigma\right),i=1,\ldots,r+1&lt;/math&gt; are independently distributed [[Wishart distribution|Wishart]] &lt;math&gt;p\times p&lt;/math&gt; [[positive definite matrices]].  Then, defining &lt;math&gt;U_i=S^{-1/2}S_i\left(S^{-1/2}\right)^T&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;Math&gt;S=\sum_{i=1}^{r+1}S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the matrices and &lt;math&gt;S^{1/2}\left(S^{-1/2}\right)^T&lt;/math&gt; is any reasonable factorization of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;), we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(U_1,\ldots,U_r\right)\sim D_p\left(n_1/2,...,n_{r+1}/2\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Marginal distribution===

If &lt;math&gt;\left(U_1,\ldots,U_r\right)\sim D_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_{r+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;s\leq r&lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(U_1,\ldots,U_s\right)\sim D_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_s,\sum_{i=s+1}^{r+1}a_i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Contitional distribution===
Also, with the same notation as above, the density of &lt;math&gt;\left(U_{s+1},\ldots,U_r\right)\left|\left(U_1,\ldots,U_s\right)\right.&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{
\prod_{i=s+1}^{r+1}\det\left(U_i\right)^{a_i-(p+1)/2}
}{
\beta_p\left(a_{s+1},\ldots,a_{r+1}\right)\det\left(I_p-\sum_{i=1}^{s}U_i\right)^{\sum_{i=s+1}^{r+1}a_i-(p+1)/2}
}
&lt;/math&gt;
where we write &lt;math&gt;U_{r+1} = I_p-\sum_{i=1}^rU_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===partitioned distribution===

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\left(U_1,\ldots,U_r\right)\sim D_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_{r+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and suppose that &lt;math&gt;S_1,\ldots,S_t&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of &lt;math&gt;\left[r+1\right]=\left\{1,\ldots r+1\right\}&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i=1}^tS_i=\left[r+1\right]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_i\cap S_j=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt;).  Then, writing &lt;math&gt;U_{(j)}=\sum_{i\in S_j}U_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{(j)}=\sum_{i\in S_j}a_i&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;U_{r+1}=I_p-\sum_{i=1}^r U_r&lt;/math&gt;), we have:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(U_{(1)},\ldots U_{(t)}\right)\sim D_p\left(a_{(1)},\ldots,a_{(t)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===partitions===

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\left(U_1,\ldots,U_r\right)\sim D_p\left(a_1,\ldots,a_{r+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Define
:&lt;math&gt;U_i= 
\left( \begin{array}{rr}
 U_{11(i)} &amp; U_{12(i)} \\
 U_{21(i)} &amp; U_{22(i)} 
 \end{array} \right) \qquad i=1,\ldots,r
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{11(i)}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p_1\times p_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;U_{22(i)}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p_2\times p_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Writing the [[Schur complement]] &lt;math&gt;U_{22\cdot 1(i)} = U_{21(i)} U_{11(i)}^{-1}U_{12(i)}&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(U_{11(1)},\ldots,U_{11(r)}\right)\sim D_{p_1}\left(a_1,\ldots,a_{r+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(U_{22.1(1)},\ldots,U_{22.1(r)}\right)\sim D_{p_2}\left(a_1-p_1/2,\ldots,a_r-p_1/2,a_{r+1}-p_1/2+p_1r/2\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[modal logic]], the '''modal depth''' of a formula is the deepest nesting of [[modal operator]]s (commonly &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;). Modal formulas without modal operators have a modal depth of zero.

== Definition ==

Modal depth can be defined as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;MD(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that computes the modal depth for a modal formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;MD(p) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is an [[atomic formula]].
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\top) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\bot) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\neg \varphi) = MD(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\varphi \wedge \psi) = max(MD(\varphi), MD(\psi))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\varphi \vee \psi) = max(MD(\varphi), MD(\psi))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\varphi \rightarrow \psi) = max(MD(\varphi), MD(\psi))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\Box \varphi) = 1 + MD(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MD(\Diamond \varphi) = 1 + MD(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==

The following computation gives the modal depth of &lt;math&gt;\Box ( \Box p \rightarrow p )&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;MD(\Box ( \Box p \rightarrow p )) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + MD( \Box p \rightarrow p) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + max(MD(\Box p), MD(p)) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + max(1 + MD(p), 0) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + max(1 + 0, 0) =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 =:2&lt;/math&gt;

== Modal depth and semantics ==

The modal depth of a formula indicates 'how far' one needs to look in a [[Kripke model]] when checking the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the formula. For each modal operator, one needs to transition from a world in the model to a world that is accessible through the [[accessibility relation]]. The modal depth indicates the longest 'chain' of transitions from a world to the next that is needed to verify the validity of a formula.

For example, to check whether &lt;math&gt;M, w \models \Diamond \Diamond \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, one needs to check whether there exists an accessible world &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;M, v \models \Diamond \varphi&lt;/math&gt;. If that is the case, one needs to check whether there is also a world &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M, u \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is accessible from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. We have made two steps from the world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (from &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) in the model to determine whether the formula holds; this is, by definition, the modal depth of that formula.

The modal depth is an upper bound (inclusive) on the number of transitions as for boxes, a modal formula is also true whenever a world has no accessible worlds (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Box \varphi&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in a world &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\forall v \in W \ (w, v) \not \in R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the set of worlds and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the accessibility relation). To check whether &lt;math&gt;M, w \models \Box \Box \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, it may be needed to take two steps in the model but it could be less, depending on the structure of the model. Suppose no worlds are accessible in &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;; the formula now trivially holds by the previous observation about the validity of formulas with a box as outer operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6863">In [[category theory]], a '''natural number object''' ('''NNO''') is an object endowed with a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] [[Mathematical structure|structure]] similar to [[natural number]]s. More precisely, in a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] '''E''' with a [[terminal object]] 1, an NNO ''N'' is given by:

# a [[global element]] ''z'' : 1 → ''N'', and
# an [[morphism|arrow]] ''s'' : ''N'' → ''N'',

such that for any object ''A'' of '''E''', global element ''q'' : 1 → ''A'', and arrow ''f'' : ''A'' → ''A'', there exists a unique arrow ''u'' : ''N'' → ''A'' such that:

# ''u'' ∘ ''z'' = ''q'', and
# ''u'' ∘ ''s'' = ''f'' ∘ ''u''.{{sfn|Johnstone|2002|loc=A2.5.1}}{{sfn|Lawvere|2005|p=14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leinster|first=Tom|date=2014|title=Rethinking set theory|journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=121|issue=5|pages=403–415|arxiv=1212.6543|bibcode=2012arXiv1212.6543L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the triangle and square in the following diagram commute.

&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;[[Image:Natural numbers object definition.svg|250px|A commutative diagram expressing the equations in the definition of an NNO]]&lt;/div&gt;

The pair (''q'', ''f'') is sometimes called the ''recursion data'' for ''u'', given in the form of a [[recursive definition]]:

# ⊢ ''u'' (''z'') = ''q''
# ''y'' ∈&lt;sub&gt;'''E'''&lt;/sub&gt; ''N'' ⊢ ''u'' (''s'' ''y'') = ''f'' (''u'' (''y''))

The above definition is the [[universal property]] of NNOs, meaning they are defined [[up to]] [[List of mathematical jargon#canonical|canonical]] [[morphism|isomorphism]]. If the arrow ''u'' as defined above merely has to exist, ''[[wiktionary:i.e.|i.e.]]'' uniqueness is not required, then ''N'' is called a ''weak'' NNO.

== Equivalent definitions ==

NNOs in [[Cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs) or [[Topos|topoi]] are sometimes defined in the following equivalent way (due to [[Lawvere]]): for every pair of arrows ''g'' : ''A'' → ''B'' and ''f'' : ''B'' → ''B'', there is a unique ''h'' : ''N'' × ''A'' → ''B'' such that the squares in the following diagram commute.{{sfn|Johnstone|2002|loc=A2.5.2}}

&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;[[Image:NNO definition alt.png|alternate NNO definition]]&lt;/div&gt;

This same construction defines weak NNOs in cartesian categories that are not cartesian closed.

In a category with a terminal object 1 and binary [[coproduct]]s (denoted by +), an NNO can be defined as the [[initial algebra]] of the [[endofunctor]] that acts on objects by {{math|{{var|X}} ↦ 1 + {{var|X}}}} and on arrows by {{math|{{var|f}} ↦ [id&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{var|f}}]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19126000|title=Category theory for computing science|last=Barr|first=Michael|last2=Wells|first2=Charles|date=1990|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0131204866|location=New York|oclc=19126000|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

* Every NNO is an initial object of the category of [[Diagram (category theory)|diagrams]] of the form
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;1 \xrightarrow{~ \quad q \quad ~} A \xrightarrow{~ \quad f \quad ~} A&lt;/math&gt;

* If a cartesian closed category has weak NNOs, then every [[slice category|slice]] of it also has a weak NNO.
* NNOs can be used for [[non-standard model]]s of [[type theory]] in a way analogous to non-standard models of analysis. Such categories (or topoi) tend to have "infinitely many" non-standard natural numbers.{{clarify|date=December 2017}} (Like always, there are simple ways to get non-standard NNOs; for example, if ''z'' = ''s z'', in which case the category or topos '''E''' is trivial.)
* [[Peter Freyd|Freyd]] showed that ''z'' and ''s'' form a [[coproduct]] diagram for NNOs; also, !&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''N'' → 1 is a [[coequalizer]] of ''s'' and 1&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i.e.'', every pair of global elements of ''N'' are connected by means of ''s''; furthermore, this pair of facts characterize all NNOs.

== Examples ==

* In '''Set''', the [[category of sets]], the standard natural numbers are an NNO.{{sfn|Johnstone|2005|p=108}} A terminal object in '''Set''' is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], and a function out of a singleton picks out a single [[Element (set theory)|element]] of a set. The natural numbers 𝐍 are an NNO where {{var|z}} is a function from a singleton to 𝐍 whose [[Image (mathematics)|image]] is zero, and {{var|s}} is the [[successor function]]. (We could actually allow {{var|z}} to pick out ''any'' element of 𝐍, and the resulting NNO would be isomorphic to this one.) One can prove that the diagram in the definition commutes using [[mathematical induction]].
* In the category of types of [[Martin-Löf type theory]] (with types as objects and functions as arrows), the standard natural numbers type '''nat''' is an NNO. One can use the recursor for '''nat''' to show that the appropriate diagram commutes.
* Assume that &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Grothendieck topos]] with terminal object &lt;math&gt; \top &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} \simeq \mathbf{Shv}(\mathfrak{C},J) &lt;/math&gt; for some [[Grothendieck topology]] &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; on the category &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{C} &lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{\mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt; is the constant presheaf on &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{C} &lt;/math&gt;, then the NNO in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} &lt;/math&gt; is the sheafification of &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{\mathbb{N}} &lt;/math&gt; and may be shown to take the form &lt;math display="block"&gt; \mathbb{N}_{\mathcal{E}} \cong \left(\Gamma_{\mathbb{N}}\right)^{++} \cong \coprod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \top. &lt;/math&gt;

In the [[calculus of variations]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''Nehari manifold''' is a manifold of functions, whose definition is motivated by the work of  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Zeev Nehari|first=Zeev|last=Nehari|year1=1960|year2=1961}}. It is a [[differential manifold]] associated to the [[Dirichlet problem]] for the semilinear [[elliptic partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; -\triangle u  = |u|^{p-1}u,\text{ with  }u\mid_{\partial \Omega} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here Δ is the [[Laplacian]] on a bounded domain Ω in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

There are infinitely many solutions to this problem.  Solutions are precisely the critical points for the [[energy functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;J(v) = \frac12\int_{\Omega}{|\nabla v|^2\,d\mu}-\frac1{p+1}\int_{\Omega}{|v|^{p+1}\,d\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

on the [[Sobolev space]] {{nowrap|1=''H''{{su|p=1|b=0}}(&amp;Omega;)}}. The Nehari manifold is defined to be the set of {{nowrap|1=''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''H''{{su|p=1|b=0}}(&amp;Omega;)}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\|\nabla v\|^2_{L^2(\Omega)} = \|v\|^{p+1}_{L^{p+1}(\Omega)} &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Solutions to the original variational problem that lie in the Nehari manifold are (constrained) minimizers of the energy, and so [[direct methods in the calculus of variations]] can be brought to bear.

More generally, given a suitable functional ''J'', the associated Nehari manifold is defined as the set of functions ''u'' in an appropriate function space for which

:&lt;math&gt;\langle J'(u), u\rangle = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''J''&amp;prime; is the [[functional derivative]] of ''J''.

'''Norman Macleod Ferrers''' &lt;small&gt;[[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]]&lt;/small&gt; (11 August 1829 – 31 January 1903) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and university administrator and editor of a [[mathematical journal]].

==Career and research==
Ferrers was educated at [[Eton College]] before studying at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he was [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1851.  He was appointed to a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellowship]] at the college in 1852, was called to the bar in 1855 and was ordained [[deacon]] in 1859 and priest in 1860.  In 1880, he was appointed Master of the college, and served as vice-chancellor of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] from 1884 to 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrers, Rev. Norman Macleod|work=[[Who Was Who|Who Was Who 1920–2008]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2007|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U185923|accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrers made many contributions to mathematical literature. From 1855 to 1891 he worked with [[J. J. Sylvester]] as editors, with others, in publishing [[The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics]]. Ferrers assembled the papers of [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] for publication in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;N. M. Ferrers editor (1871) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=AAN8197.0001.001 The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green], [[Macmillan Publishers]], link from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 he published "An Elementary Treatise on Trilinear Co-ordinates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferrers |first=N.M. |title=An Elementary Treatise on Trilinear Co-ordinates: The Method of Reciprocal Polars, and the Theory of Projections|publisher=Macmillan|year=1861}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of his early contributions was on Sylvester's development of Poinsot's representation of the motion of a rigid body about a fixed point.
He pointed out a conjugacy in [[integer partition]] diagrams, which are accordingly called [[Ferrers diagram]]s and are closely related to [[Young diagram]]s.
In 1871 he first suggested to extend the equations of motion with [[Nonholonomic system|nonholonomic constraints]].&lt;ref name="Ferrers1872"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrers|first=N.M.|title=Extension of Lagrange's equations|journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics]]|volume=XII|year=1872|pages=1&amp;ndash;5|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His another treatise on "Spherical Harmonics," published in 1877, presented many original features. 
In 1881 he studied Kelvin's investigation of the law of distribution of electricity in equilibrium on an uninfluenced spherical bowl 
and made the addition of finding the potential at any point of space in zonal harmonics.

He died at the College Lodge on 31 January 1903.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Ferrers was cited by [[Jacques Riguet]] in [[Comptes Rendus]] for 1952 in connection with [[binary relation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Riguet (1952) "Les relations de Ferrers", ''Comptes Rendus'' 232: 1729-30 [https://ia800707.us.archive.org/6/items/ComptesRendusAcademieDesSciences0232/ComptesRendusAcadmieDesSciences-Tome232-Janvier-juin1951.pdf pdf link at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer relations satisfy the inclusion &lt;math&gt;R \bar{R}^T R \subset R ,&lt;/math&gt; using the notions and symbols of [[algebraic logic]].

==Family==
On 3 April 1866, he married Emily, daughter of [[John Lamb (priest)|John Lamb]], dean of Bristol cathedral. 
They had four sons and one daughter.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle= Ferrers, Norman MacLeod|first=John |last=Venn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5814">'''Ordered geometry''' is a form of [[geometry]] featuring the concept of intermediacy (or "betweenness") but, like [[projective geometry]], omitting the basic notion of measurement.  Ordered geometry is a fundamental geometry forming a common framework for [[affine geometry|affine]], [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[absolute geometry|absolute]], and [[hyperbolic geometry]] (but not for projective geometry).

==History==
[[Moritz Pasch]] first defined a geometry without reference to measurement in 1882.  His axioms were improved upon by [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] (1889), [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] (1899), and [[Oswald Veblen|Veblen]] (1904).&lt;ref name=Coxeter69&gt;{{cite book | last=Coxeter | first=H.S.M. | authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | title=Introduction to Geometry | edition=2nd | publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] | year=1969 | isbn=0-471-18283-4 | zbl=0181.48101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|176}}  Euclid anticipated Pasch's approach in definition 4 of ''The Elements'':  "a straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Heath | first=Thomas | author-link=Thomas Little Heath | pages=165 | title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements (Vol 1) | location=New York | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | year=1956 | origyear=1925 | isbn=0-486-60088-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primitive concepts==
The only [[primitive notion]]s in ordered geometry are [[Point (geometry)|points]] A, B, C, ... and the [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] of intermediacy [ABC] which can be read as "B is between A and C".

==Definitions==

The ''segment'' AB is the set of points P such that [APB].

The ''interval'' AB is the segment AB and its end points A and B.

The ''ray'' A/B (read as "the ray from A away from B") is the set of points P such that [PAB].

The ''line'' AB is the interval AB and the two rays A/B and B/A.  Points on the line AB are said to be ''collinear''.

An ''angle'' consists of a point O (the ''vertex'') and two non-collinear rays out from O (the ''sides'').

A ''triangle'' is given by three non-collinear points (called ''vertices'') and their three ''segments'' AB, BC, and CA.

If three points A, B, and C are non-collinear, then a ''plane'' ABC is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points on one or two of the sides of triangle ABC.

If four points A, B, C, and D are non-coplanar, then a ''space'' ([[3-space]]) ABCD is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points selected from any of the four ''faces'' (planar regions) of the [[tetrahedron]] ABCD.

==Axioms of ordered geometry==
# There exist at least two points.
# If A and B are distinct points, there exists a C such that [ABC].
# If [ABC], then A and C are distinct (A≠C).
# If [ABC], then [CBA] but not [CAB].
# If C and D are distinct points on the line AB, then A is on the line CD.
# If AB is a line, there is a point C not on the line AB.
# ([[Axiom of Pasch]]) If ABC is a triangle and [BCD] and [CEA], then there exists a point F on the line DE for which [AFB].
# Axiom of [[dimensionality]]:
## For planar ordered geometry, all points are in one plane.  Or
## If ABC is a plane, then there exists a point D not in the plane ABC.
# All points are in the same plane, space, etc. (depending on the dimension one chooses to work within).
# (Dedekind's Axiom) For every partition of all the points on a line into two nonempty sets such that no point of either lies between two points of the other, there is a point of one set  which lies between every other point of that set  and every point of the other set.

These axioms are closely related to [[Hilbert's axioms#II. Order|Hilbert's axioms of order]]. For a comprehensive survey of axiomatizations of ordered geometry see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pambuccian | first = Victor | doi = 10.1016/j.exmath.2010.09.004 | journal = Expositiones Mathematicae | pages = 24–66 | title = The axiomatics of ordered geometry: I. Ordered incidence spaces | volume = 29 | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
===Sylvester's problem of collinear points===
The [[Sylvester–Gallai theorem]] can be proven within ordered geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pambuccian | first = Victor | journal = Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic | pages = 245–260 | title = A Reverse Analysis of the Sylvester–Gallai Theorem | volume = 50 | year = 2009 | zbl=1202.03023 | doi=10.1215/00294527-2009-010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coxeter69/&gt;{{rp|181,2}}

===Parallelism===
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[János Bolyai|Bolyai]], and [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]] developed a notion of [[parallel postulate|parallelism]] which can be expressed in ordered geometry.&lt;ref name=Coxeter69/&gt;{{rp|189,90}}

'''Theorem (existence of parallelism):''' Given a point A and a line r, not through A, there exist exactly two limiting rays from A in the plane Ar which do not meet r.  So there is a ''parallel'' line through A which does not meet r.

'''Theorem (transmissibility of parallelism):''' The parallelism of a ray and a line is preserved by adding or subtracting a segment from the beginning of a ray.

The symmetry of parallelism cannot be proven in ordered geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Busemann | first=Herbert | pages=139 | title=Geometry of Geodesics | location=New York | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year=1955 | zbl=0112.37002 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | volume=6 | isbn=0-12-148350-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the "ordered" concept of parallelism does not form an [[equivalence relation]] on lines.

'''Peter McMullen''' (born 11 May 1942)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmg.tuwien.ac.at/gruber/gruber_arbeiten/mcmullen.pdf Peter McMullen], [[Peter M. Gruber]], retrieved 2013-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt; is a British mathematician, a professor emeritus of mathematics at [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PMCMU56 UCL IRIS information system], accessed 2013-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
McMullen earned bachelor's and master's degrees from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and taught at [[Western Washington University]] from 1968 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/data/55804571 Peter McMullen Collection, 1967-1968], Special Collections, Wilson Library, Western Washington University, retrieved from worldcat.org 2013-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
He is known for his work in [[polyhedral combinatorics]] and [[discrete geometry]], and in particular for proving what was then called the upper bound conjecture and now is the [[upper bound theorem]]. This result states that [[cyclic polytope]]s have the maximum possible number of faces among all polytopes with a given dimension and number of vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lectures on Polytopes|volume=152|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|authorlink=Günter M.

McMullen's proof is amazingly simple and elegant, combining to key tools: shellability and ''h''-vectors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMullen also formulated the g-conjecture, later the [[g-theorem]] of [[Louis Billera]], Carl W. Lee, and [[Richard P. Stanley]], characterizing the [[f-vector|''f''-vectors]] of [[simplicial sphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Piero della Francesca''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpjɛːro della franˈtʃeska}} {{Audio|It-Piero della Francesca.oga|&lt;small&gt;listen&lt;/small&gt;}}; c. 1415&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; – 12 October 1492) was an [[list of Italian painters|Italian painter]] of the [[Italian Renaissance|Early Renaissance]]. As testified by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', to contemporaries he was also known as a mathematician and [[List of geometers|geometer]]. Nowadays Piero della Francesca is chiefly appreciated for his art. His painting is characterized by its serene [[humanism]], its use of geometric forms and  [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. His most famous work is the cycle of frescoes ''[[The History of the True Cross]]'' in the church of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of [[Arezzo]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Piero was born and died in the town of [[Sansepolcro|Borgo Santo Sepolcro]],&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt; modern-day [[Tuscany]], to Benedetto de' Franceschi, a tradesman, and Romana di Perino da [[Monterchi]], members of the Florentine and Tuscan Franceschi noble family.

[[File:Piero della Francesca - Baptism of Christ - WGA17595.jpg|thumb|left|''The [[Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Baptism of Christ]]'', (c. 1450) ([[National Gallery]], London).]]&lt;!--KEEP THIS HERE TO AVOID BLANK LINES--&gt;

He was most probably apprenticed to the local painter Antonio di Giovanni d'Anghiari, because in documents about payments it is noted that he was working with Antonio in 1432 and May 1438.&lt;ref&gt;Banker, James R., ''The culture of Sansepolcro during the youth of Piero della Francesca'', The University of Michican Press, 2003, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banker, James R., "Piero della Francesca as Assistant to Antonio d'Anghiari in the 1430s: Some Unpublished Documents",''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 135, No. 1078 (January 1993). pp. 16–21. {{jstor|/885421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He certainly took notice of the work of some of the [[Siena|Sienese]] artists active in San Sepolcro during his youth; e.g. [[Sassetta]]. In 1439 Piero received, together with [[Domenico Veneziano]], payments for his work on [[fresco]]es for the church of Sant'Egidio in Florence, now lost. In Florence he must have met leading masters like [[Fra Angelico]], [[Luca della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. The classicism of [[Masaccio]]'s frescoes and his majestic figures in the [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]] were for him an important source of inspiration. Dating of Piero's undocumented work is difficult because his style does not seem to have developed over the years.

===Mature work===
In 1442, Piero was listed as eligible for the City Council of Sansepolcro. Three years later, he received a commission to paint the [[altarpiece of the church of the Misericordia|''Madonna della Misericordia'' altarpiece]] for the church of the Misericordia in Sansepolcro, which was completed in the early 1460s. In 1449 he executed several frescoes in the [[Castello Estense]] and the church of Sant'Andrea of [[Ferrara]], now also lost. His influence was particularly strong in the later Ferrarese [[allegory|allegorical]] works of [[Cosimo Tura]].

Two years later he was in [[Rimini]], working for the [[condottieri|condottiero]] [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]. In 1451, during that sojourn, he executed the famous fresco of ''St. Sigismund and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta'' in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]], as well as a [[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|portrait of Sigismondo]]. In Rimini, Piero may have met the famous [[Renaissance]] mathematician and architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who had redesigned the [[Tempio Malatestiano]], although it is known that Alberti directed the execution of his designs for the church by correspondence with his building supervisor. Thereafter Piero was active in [[Ancona]], [[Pesaro]] and [[Bologna]].
[[File:Piero della Francesca Malatesta.jpg|thumb|''[[St. Sigismund and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' (1451)]]
In 1454, he signed a contract for the ''Polyptych of Saint Augustine'' in the church of Sant'Agostino in Sansepolcro. The central panel of this [[polyptych]] is lost, and the four panels of the wings, with representations of [[saint]]s, are now scattered around the world. A few years later, summoned by [[Pope Nicholas V]], he moved to Rome, where he executed frescoes in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], of which only fragments remain. Two years later he was again in the Papal capital, painting frescoes in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican Palace]], which have since been destroyed.

The ''Baptism of Christ'', now in the [[National Gallery]] in London, was executed in about 1460 for the high altar of the church of the Priory of S. Giovanni Battista at Sansepolcro. Other notable mature works of Piero della Francesca are the frescoes of the ''[[Resurrection (Piero della Francesca)|Resurrection of Christ]]'' in Sansepolcro, and the ''[[Madonna del parto]]'' in [[Monterchi]], near Sansepolcro.

===Frescoes in San Francesco at Arezzo===
[[File:Piero della Francesca- Legend of the True Cross - the Queen of Sheba Meeting with Solomon; detail.JPG|left|thumb|220px|''[[Legend of the True Cross]]'' – the [[Queen of Sheba]] meeting with [[King Solomon]].]]
In 1452, Piero della Francesca was called to [[Arezzo]] to replace [[Bicci di Lorenzo]] in painting the frescoes of the basilica of [[San Francesco, Arezzo|San Francesco]]. The work was finished before 1466, probably between 1452 and 1456.
The [[The History of the True Cross|cycle of frescoes]], depicting the [[Legend of the True Cross]], is generally considered among his masterworks and those of [[Renaissance painting]] in general. The story in these frescoes derives from legendary medieval sources as to how timber relics of the [[True Cross]] came to be found. These stories were collected in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacopo da Varazze]] ([[Jacopo da Varagine]]) of the mid-13th century.
&lt;ref name="goldenlegend"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GoldenLegend-Volume3.htm#invention%20of%20the%20Holy%20Cross "The Golden Legend, or Lives of the Saints" Volume Three], retrieved on 2007-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piero's activity in Urbino===
Between 1469 and 1486 Piero della Francesca worked repeatedly in the service of Count [[Federico III da Montefeltro]] (Duke in 1474). According to Giorgio Vasari, Piero would have worked for Federico's father Guidantonio, who died in February 1443. However, this is unlikely because this statement is not confirmed by documents or paintings. Vasari may have confused Guidantonio with Federico. ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation]]'' is generally considered Piero's oldest work in Urbino (dating c. 1455–1470). It is one of the most famous and controversial pictures of the early Renaissance. As discussed in its own entry, it is marked by an air of geometric sobriety, in addition to presenting a perplexing enigma as to the nature of the three men standing at the foreground.
[[File:Piero - The Flagellation.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''[[Flagellation of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]''. [[Galleria Nazionale delle Marche]], [[Urbino]] ]]
Another famous work painted in Urbino is the ''Double Portrait'' of Federico and his wife Battista Sforza, in the [[Uffizi]]. The portraits in profile take their inspiration from large bronze medals and stucco roundels with the official portraits of Fedederico and his wife. Other paintings made in Urbino are the monumental ''[[Brera Madonna|Montefeltro Altarpiece]]'' in the Brera Gallery in Milan and probably also the ''[[Madonna of Senigallia]]''.

In Urbino Piero met the painters [[Melozzo da Forlì]], [[Fra Carnevale]] and the Flemish [[Justus van Gent]] (or Joos van Wassenhove or Giusto di Gant), the mathematician Fra [[Luca Pacioli]], the architect [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]] and probably also [[Leon Battista Alberti]].

===His later years===
In his later years, painters such as [[Perugino]] and [[Luca Signorelli]] frequently visited his workshop. It is documented that Piero rented a house in Rimini in 1482. Although he may have given up painting in his later years, Vasari's remarks that he went blind at old age and at the age of sixty, have to be doubted, since in 1485 he completed his treatise on regular solids, dedicated to Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, son and heir of Duke Federico, in his own fine handwriting. Piero made his will in 1487 and he died five years later, on 12 October 1492, in his own house in San Sepolcro. He left his possessions to his family and the church.  He died the same [[Columbus Day|day]] that [[Christopher Columbus]] [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|arrived in the Americas]].

==Criticism and interpretation==
Recently, the [[Frick Collection]] in New York until 19 May 2013, collected seven of the eight extant paintings of Piero known to exist in the United States for exhibition. Of the seven pieces in the exhibit, critic [[Jerry Saltz]] writing in ''New York'' magazine singled out Piero's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels'' for its exemplary qualities. Saltz states that, "The Virgin and child are elevated two steps. They are in a world itself apart from this world apart. Mary isn't looking at her child and looks instead at the rose he reaches for. You begin to glean the revelation she is having. The flower represents love, devotion, and beauty. It also symbolizes blood and the crown of thorns Christ will wear. This child who will suffer a horrendous death reaches for his acceptance of fate. Mary does not pull the flower back. You sense an inner agony, noticing her deep-blue robe open to reveal scarlet beneath, symbol of outward passion and pain to come. In the dead-center vertical line of the painting is Christ's right palm that will be nailed to the cross." Saltz accepted this oil painting as the most exceptional work of Piero on display in the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry (2013). "Take the Day Off. Go to the Frick."

[[File:Resurrection.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The [[Resurrection (Piero della Francesca)|''Resurrection'']] (c. 1463-5)]]
Piero's deep interest in the theoretical study of perspective and his contemplative approach to his paintings are apparent in all his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=J. V.|title=Piero della Francesca. A Mathematician’s Art|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10342-5|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200703/rev-emmer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his youth, Piero was trained in mathematics, which most likely was for mercantilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T067465?q=piero+della+francesca&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=Piero della Francesca|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Art Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three treatises written by Piero are known to modern mathematicians: ''Abacus Treatise (Trattato d'Abaco)'', ''Short Book on the Five Regular Solids (Libellus de Quinque Corporibus Regularibus)'' and ''On Perspective for Painting'' (''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]]''). The subjects covered in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Biographers of his patron, [[Federico da Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]], record that he was encouraged to pursue the interest in perspective which was shared by the Duke.

In the late 1450s, Piero copied and illustrated the following works of [[Archimedes]]:&lt;ref name = "jim"&gt;James Banker, ''A Manuscript of the Works of Archimedes in the Hand of Piero della Francesca'', «Burlington Magazine», CXLVII, March 2005, pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Sphere and the Cylinder; On the Measurement of the Circle; On Conoids and Spheroids; On Spirals; On the Equilibrium of Planes; On the Quadrature of the Parabola; The Sand Reckoner''. The [[manuscript]] consists of 82 folio leaves. It's held in the collection of the [[Biblioteca Riccardiana]]&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/10646/ |title = On the Sphere and the Cylinder; On the Measurement of the Circle; On Conoids and Spheroids; On Spirals; On the Equilibrium of Planes; On the Quadrature of the Parabola; The Sand Reckoner |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1450–1460 |accessdate = 2013-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a copy of the translation of the Archimedean corpus made by the Italian humanist [[Iacopo da San Cassiano]] (also known as [[Iacobus Cremonensis]]).&lt;ref name = "pdan"&gt;Paolo d'Alessandro e Pier Daniele Napolitani, ''Archimede latino.Iacopo da San Cassiano e il corpus archimedeo alla metà del Quattrocento'', Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspirations==
[[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote a three movement work for orchestra entitled ''[[Les Fresques de Piero della Francesca]]''. Dedicated to [[Rafael Kubelik]], it was premiered by Kubelik and the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] at the 1956 Salzburg Festival. Piero's geometrical perfection and the almost magic atmosphere of the light in his painting inspired modern painters like [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Massimo Campigli]], [[Felice Casorati]] and [[Balthus]].

A '''pollination network''' is a bipartite [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] network in which plants and [[pollinator]]s are the [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]], and the [[pollination]] interactions form the links between these nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Fonkalsrud, Sindre
[https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/8538/121809649.pdf?sequence=1 Interaction Patterns and Specialization in a Local and National  Norwegian Pollination Network]. [[University of Bergen]]. Spring 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The pollination network is  bipartite as interactions only exist between two distinct, non-overlapping sets of [[species]], but not within the set: a pollinator can never be pollinated, unlike in a  [[Lotka–Volterra equation|predator-prey network]] where a predator can be depredated.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, M. (2009). ''Networks: an introduction'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pollination network is two-modal, i.e., it includes only links connecting plant and animal communities.&lt;ref&gt;Olesen,Jens M. ; Bascompte, Jordi; Dupont, Yoko L. ;  Jordano, Pedro [http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19891.full.pdf The modularity of pollination networks]. [[PNAS]],  December 11, 2007  vol. 104 n° 50  19891–19896.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nested structure of pollination networks==
A key feature of pollination networks is their nested design. A study of 52 mutualist networks (including plant-pollinator interactions and plant-seed disperser interactions) found that most of the networks were nested.&lt;ref name="Bascompte 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bascompte|first1=Jordi|last2=Jordano|first2=Pedro|last3=Melián|first3=Carlos J.|last4=Olesen|first4=Jens M.|title=The nested assembly of plant–animal mutualistic networks|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=5 August 2003|volume=100|issue=16|pages=9383–9387|doi=10.1073/pnas.1633576100|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/16/9383.short|language=en|issn=0027-8424|pmid=12881488|pmc=170927}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the core of the network is made up of highly connected [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]] (a pollinator that visits many different species of plant), while specialized species interact with a subset of the species that the generalists interact with (a pollinator that visits few species of plant, which are also visited by generalist pollinators).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=Anders|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|title=Ecological networks, nestedness and sampling effort|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=1 September 2007|volume=95|issue=5|pages=1134–1141|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01271.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01271.x/full|language=en|issn=1365-2745}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of interactions in a network increases, the degree of nestedness increases as well.&lt;ref name = "Bascompte 2003"/&gt; One property that results from nested structure of pollination networks is an asymmetry in specialization, where specialist species are often interacting with some of the most generalized species. This is in contrast to the idea of reciprocal specialization, where specialist pollinators interact with specialist plants.&lt;ref name = "Vazquez 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vázquez|first1=Diego P.|last2=Aizen|first2=Marcelo A.|title=Asymmetric Specialization: A Pervasive Feature of Plant–Pollinator Interactions|journal=Ecology|date=1 May 2004|volume=85|issue=5|pages=1251–1257|doi=10.1890/03-3112|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/03-3112/abstract|language=en|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the relationship between network complexity and network nestedness, the amount of asymmetry in specialization increases as the number of interactions increases.&lt;ref name = "Vazquez 2004"/&gt;

==Modularity of networks==
Another feature that is common in pollination networks is [[modularity]]. Modularity occurs when certain groups of species within a network are much more highly connected to each other than they are with the rest of the network, with weak interactions connecting different modules.&lt;ref name = "Oleson 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olesen|first1=Jens M.|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|last3=Dupont|first3=Yoko L.|last4=Jordano|first4=Pedro|title=The modularity of pollination networks|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=11 December 2007|volume=104|issue=50|pages=19891–19896|doi=10.1073/pnas.0706375104|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19891.short|language=en|issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupont 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupont|first1=Yoko L.|last2=Olesen|first2=Jens M.|title=Ecological modules and roles of species in heathland plant–insect flower visitor networks|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|date=1 March 2009|volume=78|issue=2|pages=346–353|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01501.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01501.x/full|language=en|issn=1365-2656}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Within modules it has been shown that individual species play certain roles. Highly specialized species often only interact with individuals within their own module and are known as ‘peripheral species’; more generalized species can be thought of as ‘hubs’ within their own module, with interactions between many different species; there are also species which are very generalized which can act as ‘connectors’ between their own module and other modules.&lt;ref name = "Oleson 2007"/&gt; A study of three separate networks, all of which showed modularity, revealed that hub species were always plants and not the insect pollinators.&lt;ref name = "Dupont 2009"/&gt; Previous work has found that networks will become nested at a smaller size (number of species) than that where networks frequently become modular.&lt;ref name = "Oleson 2007"/&gt;

==Species loss and robustness to collapse==
There is substantial interest into the robustness of pollination networks to species loss and collapse, especially due to anthropogenic factors such as [[habitat destruction]]. The structure of a network is thought to affect how long it is able to persist after species decline begins. In particular, the nested structure of networks has been shown to protect against complete destruction of the network, because the core group of generalists are the most robust to [[extinction]] by habitat loss.&lt;ref name = "Fortuna 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortuna|first1=Miguel A.|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|title=Habitat loss and the structure of plant–animal mutualistic networks|journal=Ecology Letters|date=1 March 2006|volume=9|issue=3|pages=281–286|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00868.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00868.x/full|language=en|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Memmott 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Memmott|first1=Jane|last2=Waser|first2=Nickolas M.|last3=Price|first3=Mary V.|title=Tolerance of pollination networks to species extinctions|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date=22 December 2004|volume=271|issue=1557|pages=2605–2611|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2909|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/271/1557/2605.short|language=en|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1691904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models specifically focused on the effects of habitat loss have shown that specialist species tend to go extinct first, while the last species to go extinct are the most generalized of the network.&lt;ref name ="Fortuna 2006"/&gt; Other studies focusing specifically on the removal of different types of species showed that species decline is the fastest when removing the most generalized species. However, there have been contrasting results on how rapidly decline occurs with removal of these species. One study showed that even at the fastest rate, the decline was still linear.&lt;ref name ="Memmott 2004"/&gt; Another study revealed that with the removal of the most common pollinator species, the network showed a drastic collapse.&lt;ref name = "Kaiser 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaiser-Bunbury|first1=Christopher N.|last2=Muff|first2=Stefanie|last3=Memmott|first3=Jane|last4=Müller|first4=Christine B.|last5=Caflisch|first5=Amedeo|title=The robustness of pollination networks to the loss of species and interactions: a quantitative approach incorporating pollinator behaviour|journal=Ecology Letters|date=1 April 2010|volume=13|issue=4|pages=442–452|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01437.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01437.x/full|language=en|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on the removal of species themselves, other work has emphasized the importance of studying the loss of interactions, as this will often precede species loss and may well accelerate the rate at which extinction occurs.&lt;ref name = "Valiente 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valiente-Banuet|first1=Alfonso|last2=Aizen|first2=Marcelo A.|last3=Alcántara|first3=Julio M.|last4=Arroyo|first4=Juan|last5=Cocucci|first5=Andrea|last6=Galetti|first6=Mauro|last7=García|first7=María B.|last8=García|first8=Daniel|last9=Gómez|first9=José M.|last10=Jordano|first10=Pedro|last11=Medel|first11=Rodrigo|last12=Navarro|first12=Luis|last13=Obeso|first13=José R.|last14=Oviedo|first14=Ramona|last15=Ramírez|first15=Nelson|last16=Rey|first16=Pedro J.|last17=Traveset|first17=Anna|last18=Verdú|first18=Miguel|last19=Zamora|first19=Regino|title=Beyond species loss: the extinction of ecological interactions in a changing world|journal=Functional Ecology|date=1 March 2015|volume=29|issue=3|pages=299–307|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12356|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12356/epdf|language=en|issn=1365-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14179">{{Distinguish|education reform}}

'''Reform mathematics''' is an approach to [[mathematics education]], particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM). The NCTM document, [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics#1989 Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics|Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics]], attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) [[mathematics education]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards with the publication of [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]] (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to serve as the basis for many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.

Mathematics instruction in this style has been called ''standards-based mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdkintl.org/kappan/k0111tra.htm "Standards-Based Mathematics Curriculum Materials: A Phrase in Search of a Definition"] By Paul R. Trafton, Barbara J. Reys, and Deanna G. Wasman&lt;/ref&gt; or ''reform mathematics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathematicallysane.com/analysis/reformvsbasics.asp Reform Mathematics vs. the Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Principles and standards==
{{Main|Principles and Standards for School Mathematics}}

The momentum for reform in mathematics education began in the early 1980s, as educators reacted to the "[[New Math|new math]]" of the 1960s and 1970s.  The work of Piaget and other developmental psychologists was shifting the focus of mathematics educators from mathematics content to how children best learn mathematics. &lt;ref name="John"&gt; John A. Van de Walle, ''Elementary and Middle School Mathematics: Teaching Developmentally'' Longman, 2001, {{isbn|0-8013-3253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] summarized the state of current research with the publication of [[National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics#1989_Curriculum_and_Evaluation_Standards_for_School_Mathematics|Curriculum and Evaluation Standards]] in 1989 and [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]] in 2000, bringing definition to the reform movement in North America.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Van Hiele model]] for an example of research that influenced the NCTM Standards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform mathematics curricula challenge students to make sense of new mathematical ideas through explorations and projects, often in real contexts. &lt;ref name="John" /&gt; Reform texts emphasize written and verbal communication, working in cooperative groups, making connections between concepts, and connections between representations. By contrast, "traditional" textbooks emphasize procedural mathematics and provide step-by-step examples with skill exercises.

[[Traditional mathematics]] focuses on teaching algorithms that will lead to the correct answer.  Because of this focus on application of algorithms, the traditional math student must always use the specific method that is being taught.  This kind of algorithmic dependence is de-emphasized in reform mathematics.&lt;ref name=wgquirk&gt;[http://www.wgquirk.com/chap3.html The NCTM Calls it "Math"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reformers do not oppose correct answers, but prefer to focus students' attention on the process leading to the answer, rather than the answer itself.  The presence of occasional errors is deemed less important than the overall thought process. Research has shown that children make fewer mistakes with calculations and remember algorithms longer when they understand the concepts underlying the methods they use. In general, children in reform classes perform at least as well as children in traditional classes on tests of calculation skill, and considerably better on tests of problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Carpenter | first = T.P. | title = Using Knowledge of Children's Mathematics Thinking in Classroom Teaching: An Experimental Study | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | year = 1989 | pages = 499–531 | doi=10.3102/00028312026004499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Villasenor | first = A. | last2 = Kepner | first2 = H.

==Controversy==
{{main|Math wars}}

"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics" was championed by educators, administrators and some mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;The position of the [[Mathematics Association of America|MAA]] is "We believe that PSSM outlines an ambitious, challenging and idealized program whose implementation would be a vast improvement over the current state of mathematics education."[http://www.maa.org/features/pssm.html The MAA and the New NCTM Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; as raising standards for all students, but it was criticized by some for valuing understanding processes more than learning standard procedures. Parents, educators and some mathematicians opposing reform mathematics complained about students becoming confused and frustrated, claiming that it was an inefficient style of instruction characterized by frequent false starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Stokke| first =Anna| title =What to Do about Canada’s Declining Math Scores| work =Education Policy; commentary #427| publisher =[[C. D. Howe Institute]]| date =May 2015| url =https://www.cdhowe.org/public-policy-research/what-do-about-canada%E2%80%99s-declining-math-scores| accessdate = 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of reform mathematics countered that research showed that, when done correctly, students in reform math curricula learned basic math skills at least as well as those in traditional programs, and additionally understood the underlying concepts much better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nctm.org/news/content.aspx?id=12324|title=Which Curriculum Is Most Effective in Producing Gains in Students' Learning?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities that adopted reform curricula generally saw increased math scores by their students. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = ARC Center | title = The ARC Center Tri-State Student Achievement Study executive summary | year = 2003 | place = Bedford, MA | publisher = COMAP | url = http://www.comap.com/elementary/projects/arc/Executive_Summary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has found that first-grade students with a below-average aptitude in math responded best to teacher-directed instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Morgan | first =Paul | author-link = | last2 =Farkas | first2 =George | last3 =Maczuga | first3 =Steve | title =Which Instructional Practices Most Help First-Grade Students With and Without Mathematics Difficulties? | journal =Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis | volume =XX | issue =X | pages =1–22 | date =20 June 2014 | orig-year = | year = | month = | language = | url =http://epa.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/20/0162373714536608.full.pdf+html?ijkey=J2BxFXoAWRPSo&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spepa | jstor = | archive-url = | archive-date = | doi =10.3102/0162373714536608 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | pmc =4500292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the development and large-scale adoption of curricula such as [[Mathland]] was criticized for partially or entirely abandoning teaching of standard arithmetic methods such as regrouping or common denominators. Protests from groups such as [[Mathematically Correct]] led to many districts and states abandoning such textbooks. Some states such as California revised their mathematics standards to partially or largely repudiate the basic beliefs of reform mathematics, and re-emphasize mastery of standard mathematics facts and methods.

The American Institutes for Research (AIR) reported in 2005 that the NCTM proposals "risk exposing students to unrealistically advanced mathematics content in the early grades."&lt;ref name="title"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/Singapore%20Report%20(Bookmark%20Version).pdf |format=PDF|title= What the United States Can Learn From Singapore’s World-Class Mathematics System |accessdate=2008-01-29 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in reference to NCTM's recommendation that algebraic concepts, such as understanding patterns and properties like [[Commutative property|commutativity]] (2+3=3+2), should be taught as early as first grade.

Some, such as the 2008 National Mathematics Advisory Panel, called for a balance between reform and traditional mathematics teaching styles rather than a "war" between the two styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/351655_math18.html February 17, 2008 10:44 p.m. State's proposed new math standards don't add up, critics say By JESSICA BLANCHARD "the district's elementary and middle-school math textbook choices lack a good balance between reform and traditional learning styles"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 NCTM published its [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Curriculum Focal Points|Curriculum Focal Points]], which made clear that standard algorithms were to be included in all elementary school curricula, as well as activities aiming at conceptual understanding. 

A common misconception was that reform educators did not want children to learn the standard methods of arithmetic. As the NCTM Focal Points made clear, such methods were still the ultimate goal, but reformers believed that conceptual understanding should come first. Reform educators believed that such understanding is best pursued by allowing children at first to solve problems using their own understanding and methods. Under guidance from the teacher, students eventually arrive at an understanding of standard methods. Even the controversial [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics#1989 Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics|NCTM Standards]] of 1989 did not call for abandoning standard algorithms, but instead recommended a decreased emphasis on complex paper-and-pencil computation drills and greater attention to mental computation, estimation skills, thinking strategies for mastering basic facts and conceptual understanding of arithmetic operations.

During the peak of the controversy in the 1990s, unfavorable terminology for reform mathematics appeared in press and web articles, including ''Where's the math?'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/10/17/ED92574.DTL San Francisco Chronicle: Where's the Math?]&lt;/ref&gt; ''anti-math'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/klein.htm The State's Invisible Math Standards: "With Zacarias' anti-math policies in force..."] &lt;/ref&gt; ''math for dummies'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dehnbase.org/hold/ Math Framework in California  NCTM "A State Dummies Down", editorial, The Business Journal (Sacramento), 10 April 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[rainforest algebra]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texaspolicy.com/pdf/1997-11-15-rejectedbooks.pdf]
Texas adopts textbook rejected by nation:  Adoption of "Rainforest Algebra" appears to contradict this logic&lt;/ref&gt; ''math for women and minorities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/house.htm]  David Klein: "This misguided view of women and minorities..."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''new new math''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/05/28/eveningnews/main200272.shtml] New, New Math = Controversy CBS News 5/28/2000&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these critical terms refer to the 1989 standards rather than the PSSM.

Beginning in 2011, most states adopted the [[Common Core Standards]], which attempted to incorporate reform ideas, rigor (introducing ideas at a younger age) and a leaner math curriculum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">In [[mathematics]], the '''Silverman–Toeplitz theorem''', first proved by [[Otto Toeplitz]], is a result in [[summability theory]] characterizing [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] summability methods that are regular. A regular matrix summability method is a matrix transformation of a [[convergent sequence]] which preserves the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/silvermantoeplit00rude Silverman–Toeplitz theorem], by Ruder, Brian, Published 1966, Call number LD2668 .R4 1966 R915, Publisher Kansas State University, Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[infinite matrix]] &lt;math&gt;(a_{i,j})_{i,j \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; with [[complex number|complex]]-valued entries defines a regular summability method [[if and only if]] it satisfies all of the following properties:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{i \to \infty} a_{i,j} = 0 \quad j \in \mathbb{N} &amp; &amp; \text{(Every column sequence converges to 0.)} \\[3pt]
&amp; \lim_{i \to \infty} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} a_{i,j} = 1 &amp; &amp; \text{(The row sums converge to 1.)} \\[3pt]
&amp; \sup_i \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \vert a_{i,j} \vert &lt; \infty &amp; &amp; \text{(The absolute row sums are bounded.)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is [[Cesaro summation]], a matrix summability method with
:&lt;math&gt;a_{mn}=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{m} &amp; n\le m\\ 0 &amp; n&gt;m\end{cases},&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12303">In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''subgraph isomorphism''' problem is a computational task in which two [[undirected graph|graphs]] ''G'' and ''H'' are given as input, and one must determine whether ''G'' contains a [[Glossary of graph theory#subgraph|subgraph]] that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''H''.
Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of both the [[clique problem|maximum clique problem]] and the problem of testing whether a graph contains a [[Hamiltonian cycle]], and is therefore [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;The original {{harvtxt|Cook|1971}} paper that proves the [[Cook–Levin theorem]] already showed subgraph isomorphism to be NP-complete, using a reduction from [[3-SAT]] involving cliques.&lt;/ref&gt; However certain other cases of subgraph isomorphism may be solved in polynomial time.&lt;ref name="e99"/&gt;

Sometimes the name '''subgraph matching''' is also used for the same problem. This name puts emphasis on finding such a subgraph as opposed to the bare decision problem.

==Decision problem and computational complexity==
To prove subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete, it must be formulated as a [[decision problem]].  The input to the decision problem is a pair of graphs ''G'' and ''H''. The answer to the problem is positive if ''H'' is isomorphic to a subgraph of ''G'', and negative otherwise.

Formal question:

Let &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H=(V^\prime,E^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; be graphs. Is there a subgraph &lt;math&gt;G_0=(V_0,E_0): V_0\subseteq V, E_0\subseteq E\cap(V_0\times V_0)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G_0\cong H&lt;/math&gt;? I.e., does there exist a [[bijection]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon V_0\rightarrow V^\prime&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(v_1,v_2)\in E_0\Rightarrow (f(v_1),f(v_2))\in E^\prime&lt;/math&gt;?

The proof of subgraph isomorphism being NP-complete is simple and based on reduction of the [[clique problem]], an NP-complete decision problem in which the input is a single graph ''G'' and a number ''k'', and the question is whether ''G'' contains a [[complete graph|complete subgraph]] with ''k'' vertices. To translate this to a subgraph isomorphism problem, simply let ''H'' be the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;; then the answer to the subgraph isomorphism problem for ''G'' and ''H'' is equal to the answer to the clique problem for ''G'' and ''k''. Since the clique problem is NP-complete, this [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]] shows that subgraph isomorphism is also NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Complexity Theory: Exploring the Limits of Efficient Algorithms|first=Ingo|last=Wegener|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9783540210450|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1fo7_KoFUPsC&amp;pg=PA81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative reduction from the [[Hamiltonian path problem|Hamiltonian cycle]] problem translates a graph ''G'' which is to be tested for Hamiltonicity into the pair of graphs ''G'' and ''H'', where ''H'' is a cycle having the same number of vertices as ''G''. Because the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete even for [[planar graphs]], this shows that subgraph isomorphism remains NP-complete even in the planar case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Subgraph isomorphism is a generalization of the [[graph isomorphism problem]], which asks whether ''G'' is isomorphic to ''H'': the answer to the graph isomorphism problem is true if and only if ''G'' and ''H'' both have the same numbers of vertices and edges and the subgraph isomorphism problem for ''G'' and ''H'' is true. However the complexity-theoretic status of graph isomorphism remains an open question.

In the context of the [[Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture]] on the [[query complexity]] of monotone graph properties, {{harvtxt|Gröger|1992}} showed that any subgraph isomorphism problem has query complexity Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;); that is, solving the subgraph isomorphism requires an algorithm to check the presence or absence in the input of Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) different edges in the graph.&lt;ref&gt;Here &amp;Omega; invokes [[Big O notation|Big Omega notation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
{{harvtxt|Ullmann|1976}} describes a recursive backtracking procedure for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem. Although its running time is, in general, exponential, it takes polynomial time for any fixed choice of ''H'' (with a polynomial that depends on the choice of ''H''). When ''G'' is a [[planar graph]] (or more generally a graph of [[bounded expansion]]) and ''H'' is fixed, the running time of subgraph isomorphism can be reduced to [[linear time]].&lt;ref name="e99"&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Ullmann|2010}} is a substantial update to the 1976 subgraph isomorphism algorithm paper.

{{harvtxt|Cordella|2004}} proposed in 2004 another algorithm based on Ullmann's, VF2, which improves the refinement process using different heuristics and uses significantly less memory.

{{harvtxt|Bonnici|2013}} proposed a better algorithm, which improves the initial order of the vertices using some heuristics.

==Applications==
As subgraph isomorphism has been applied in the area of [[cheminformatics]] to find similarities between chemical compounds from their structural formula; often in this area the term '''substructure search''' is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ullmann|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; A query structure is often defined graphically using a [[structure editor]] program; [[SMILES]] based database systems typically define queries using [[Smiles arbitrary target specification|SMARTS]], a [[SMILES]] extension.

The closely related problem of counting the number of isomorphic copies of a graph ''H'' in a larger graph ''G'' has been applied to pattern discovery in databases,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kuramochi|Karypis|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bioinformatics]] of protein-protein interaction networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pržulj|Corneil|Jurisica|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[exponential random graph]] methods for mathematically modeling [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Snijders|Pattison|Robins|Handcock|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Ohlrich|Ebeling|Ginting|Sather|1993}} describe an application of subgraph isomorphism in the [[computer-aided design]] of [[electronic circuits]]. Subgraph matching is also a substep in [[graph rewriting]] (the most runtime-intensive), and thus offered by [[Graph rewriting#Implementations and applications|graph rewrite tools]].

The problem is also of interest in [[artificial intelligence]], where it is considered part of an array of [[pattern matching]] in graphs problems; an extension of subgraph isomorphism known as [[structure mining|graph mining]] is also of interest in that area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/2006/FS-06-02/FS06-02-007.pdf; expanded version at https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/332302.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T-symmetry''' or '''time reversal symmetry''' is the theoretical [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry of physical laws]] under the [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] of time reversal:
:&lt;math&gt; T: t \mapsto -t.&lt;/math&gt;
T-symmetry can be shown to be equivalent to the conservation of [[entropy]], by [[Noether's Theorem]]. But as the [[second law of thermodynamics]] does not permit entropy to be conserved in general, it follows that the observable [[universe]] does not in general show symmetry under time reversal. In other words, time is said to be non-symmetric, or asymmetric, except for special equilibrium states when the second law of thermodynamics predicts the time symmetry to hold.
However, quantum [[Weak measurement|noninvasive measurements]] are predicted to violate time symmetry even in equilibrium,&lt;ref name=non-time&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bednorz|first1=Adam|last2=Franke|first2=Kurt|last3=Belzig|first3=Wolfgang|title=Noninvasiveness and time symmetry of weak measurements|journal=New Journal of Physics|date=February 2013|volume=15|pages=023043|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/15/2/023043 |bibcode = 2013NJPh...15b3043B }}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to their classical counterparts, although this has not yet been experimentally confirmed.

Time ''asymmetries'' are generally distinguished as among those...
# intrinsic to the dynamic [[physical law]] (e.g., for the [[weak force]])
# due to the [[Big Bang|initial conditions of our universe]] (e.g., for the [[second law of thermodynamics]])
# due to [[Weak measurement|measurements]] (e.g., for the noninvasive measurements)



== Invariance ==
[[Image:teeter-totter.png|frame|A toy called the [[teeter-totter]] illustrates, in cross-section, the two aspects of time reversal invariance. When set into motion atop a pedestal (rocking side to side, as in the image), the figure oscillates for a very long time. The toy is engineered to minimize friction and illustrate the reversibility of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. However, the mechanically stable state of the toy is when the figure falls down from the pedestal into one of arbitrarily many positions. This is an illustration of the law of increase of [[entropy]] through [[Boltzmann]]'s identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy.]]

Physicists also discuss the time-reversal invariance of local and/or macroscopic descriptions of physical systems, independent of the invariance of the underlying microscopic physical laws.  
For example, [[Maxwell's equations]] with material [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or Newtonian mechanics with [[friction]] are not time-reversal invariant at the macroscopic level where they are normally applied, even if they are invariant at the microscopic level; when one includes the atomic motions, the "lost" energy is translated into heat.

== Macroscopic phenomena: the second law of thermodynamics ==

Our daily experience shows that T-symmetry does not hold for the behavior of bulk materials. Of these macroscopic laws, most notable is the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Many other phenomena, such as the relative motion of bodies with friction, or viscous motion of fluids, reduce to this, because the underlying mechanism is the dissipation of usable energy (for example, kinetic energy) into heat.

The question of whether this time-asymmetric dissipation is really inevitable has been considered by many physicists, often in the context of '''[[Maxwell's demon]]'''. The name comes from a [[thought experiment]] described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in which a microscopic demon guards a gate between two halves of a room. It only lets slow molecules into one half, only fast ones into the other. By eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter, it seems to reduce the [[entropy]] of the room, and reverse the arrow of time. Many analyses have been made of this; all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together, this total entropy does increase. Modern analyses of this problem have taken into account [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s relation between [[information entropy|entropy and information]]. Many interesting results in modern computing are closely related to this problem &amp;mdash; [[reversible computing]], [[quantum computing]] and [[physical limits to computing]], are examples. These seemingly metaphysical questions are today, in these ways, slowly being converted into hypotheses of the physical sciences.

The current consensus hinges upon the Boltzmann-Shannon identification of the logarithm of [[phase space]] volume with the negative of [[information theory|Shannon information]], and hence to [[entropy]]. In this notion, a fixed initial state of a macroscopic system corresponds to relatively low entropy because the coordinates of the molecules of the body are constrained. As the system evolves in the presence of dissipation, the molecular coordinates can move into larger volumes of phase space, becoming more uncertain, and thus leading to increase in entropy.

One can, however, equally well imagine a state of the universe in which the motions of all of the particles at one instant were the reverse (strictly, the [[CPT-symmetry|CPT reverse]]).  Such a state would then evolve in reverse, so presumably entropy would decrease ([[Loschmidt's paradox]]).  Why is 'our' state preferred over the other?

One position is to say that the constant increase of entropy we observe happens ''only'' because of the initial state of our universe. Other possible states of the universe (for example, a universe at [[Heat death of the Universe|heat death]] equilibrium) would actually result in no increase of entropy. In this view, the apparent T-asymmetry of our universe is a problem in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]:  why did the universe start with a low entropy? This view, if it remains viable in the light of future cosmological observation, would connect this problem to one of the big open questions beyond the reach of today's physics &amp;mdash; the question of ''initial conditions'' of the universe.

==Macroscopic phenomena: black holes==

An object can cross through the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] from the outside, and then fall rapidly to the central region where our understanding of physics breaks down. Since within a black hole the forward light-cone is directed towards the center and the backward light-cone is directed outward, it is not even possible to define time-reversal in the usual manner. The only way anything can escape from a black hole is as [[Hawking radiation]].

The time reversal of a black hole would be a hypothetical object known as a [[white hole]]. From the outside they appear similar. While a black hole has a beginning and is inescapable, a white hole has an ending and cannot be entered. The forward light-cones of a white hole are directed outward; and its backward light-cones are directed towards the center.

The event horizon of a black hole may be thought of as a surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between escaping and falling back. The event horizon of a white hole is a surface moving inward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between being swept outward and succeeding in reaching the center. They are two different kinds of horizons—the horizon of a white hole is like the horizon of a black hole turned inside-out.

The modern view of black hole irreversibility is to relate it to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], since black holes are viewed as [[Black hole thermodynamics|thermodynamic objects]]. Indeed, according to the [[Gauge–gravity duality]] conjecture, all microscopic processes in a black hole are reversible, and only the collective behavior is irreversible, as in any other macroscopic, thermal system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Kinetic consequences: detailed balance and Onsager reciprocal relations==

In physical and [[chemical kinetics]], T-symmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws: the principle of [[detailed balance]] and the [[Onsager reciprocal relations]]. T-symmetry of the microscopic description together with its kinetic consequences are called [[microscopic reversibility]].

:&lt;math&gt;\vec x\!&lt;/math&gt;, Position of a particle in three-space

==Microscopic phenomena: time reversal invariance==

Most systems are asymmetric under time reversal, but there may be phenomena with symmetry. In classical mechanics, a velocity ''v'' reverses under the operation of ''T'', but an acceleration does not. Therefore, one models dissipative phenomena through terms that are odd in ''v''. However, delicate experiments in which known sources of dissipation are removed reveal that the laws of mechanics are time reversal invariant. Dissipation itself is originated in the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

The motion of a charged body in a magnetic field, ''B'' involves the velocity through the [[Lorentz force]] term ''v''&amp;times;''B'', and might seem at first to be asymmetric under ''T''. A closer look assures us that ''B'' also changes sign under time reversal. This happens because a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, ''J'', which reverses sign under ''T''. Thus, the motion of classical charged particles in [[electromagnetic field]]s is also time reversal invariant.  (Despite this, it is still useful to consider the time-reversal non-invariance in a ''local'' sense when the external field is held fixed, as when the [[magneto-optic effect]] is analyzed.  This allows one to analyze the conditions under which optical phenomena that locally break time-reversal, such as [[Faraday isolator]]s and [http://magnetooptics.phy.bme.hu/research/topics/optical-properties-of-multiferroic-materials/ directional dichroism], can occur.)  The laws of gravity also seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics.

In [[physics]] one separates the laws of motion, called [[kinematics]], from the laws of force, called [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]. Following the classical kinematics of [[Newton's laws of motion]], the kinematics of [[quantum mechanics]] is built in such a way that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics. In other words, if the dynamics are invariant, then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant; if the dynamics is not, then the kinematics will also show this. The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer, and we examine these next.

===Time reversal in quantum mechanics===

[[Image:parity 1drep.png|frame|Two-dimensional representations of [[parity (physics)|parity]] are given by a pair of quantum states that go into each other under parity. However, this representation can always be reduced to linear combinations of states, each of which is either even or odd under parity. One says that all [[irreducible representation]]s of parity are one-dimensional. '''Kramers' theorem''' states that time reversal need not have this property because it is represented by an anti-unitary operator.]]

This section contains a discussion of the three most important properties of time reversal in quantum mechanics; chiefly,
#that it must be represented as an anti-unitary operator,
#that it protects non-degenerate quantum states from having an [[electric dipole moment]],
#that it has two-dimensional representations with the property ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1.
The strangeness of this result is clear if one compares it with parity. If parity transforms a pair of [[quantum states]] into each other, then the sum and difference of these two basis states are states of good parity. Time reversal does not behave like this. It seems to violate the theorem that all [[abelian group]]s be represented by one-dimensional irreducible representations. The reason it does this is that it is represented by an anti-unitary operator. It thus opens the way to [[spinor]]s in quantum mechanics.

===Anti-unitary representation of time reversal===

[[Eugene Wigner]] showed that a symmetry operation ''S'' of a Hamiltonian is represented, in [[quantum mechanics]] either by a '''[[unitary operator|unitary]]''' operator, ''S'' = ''U'', or an '''[[antiunitary]]''' one, ''S'' = ''UK'' where ''U'' is unitary, and ''K'' denotes [[complex conjugation]]. These are the only operations that act on Hilbert space so as to preserve the ''length'' of the projection of any one state-vector onto another state-vector.

Consider the [[parity (physics)|parity]] operator. Acting on the position, it reverses the directions of space, so that ''PxP&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = &amp;minus;''x''. Similarly, it reverses the direction of ''momentum'', so that ''PpP&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = &amp;minus;''p'', where ''x'' and ''p'' are the position and momentum operators. This preserves the [[canonical commutation relation|canonical commutator]] [''x'', ''p''] = ''iħ'', where ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], only if ''P'' is chosen to be unitary, ''PiP&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''i''.

On the other hand, the ''time reversal'' operator ''T'', it does nothing to the x-operator, ''TxT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''x'', but it reverses the direction of p, so that ''TpT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = &amp;minus;''p''. The canonical commutator is invariant only if ''T'' is chosen to be anti-unitary, i.e., ''TiT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = &amp;minus;''i''.

Another argument involves energy, the time-component of the momentum. If time reversal were implemented as a unitary operator, it would reverse the sign of the energy just as space-reversal reverses the sign of the momentum. This is not possible, because, unlike momentum, energy is always positive. Since energy in quantum mechanics is defined as the phase factor exp(-iEt) that one gets when one moves forward in time, the way to reverse time while preserving the sign of the energy is to also reverse the sense of "i", so that the sense of phases is reversed.

Similarly, any operation that reverses the sense of phase, which changes the sign of i, will turn positive energies into negative energies unless it also changes the direction of time. So every antiunitary symmetry in a theory with positive energy must reverse the direction of time. Every antiunitary operator can be written as the product of the time reversal operator and a unitary operator that does not reverse time.

For a [[elementary particle|particle]] with spin ''J'', one can use the representation

::&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-i\pi J_y/\hbar} K,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''y''-component of the spin, and use of ''TJT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' = &amp;minus;J has been made.

===Electric dipole moments===

This has an interesting consequence on the [[electric dipole moment]] (EDM) of any particle. The EDM is defined through the shift in the energy of a state when it is put in an external electric field: Δ''e'' = d·''E'' + ''E''·δ·''E'', where ''d'' is called the EDM and δ, the induced dipole moment. One important property of an EDM is that the energy shift due to it changes sign under a parity transformation. However, since '''d''' is a vector, its expectation value in a state |ψ&gt; must be proportional to &lt;ψ| ''J'' |ψ&gt;, that is the expected spin. Thus, under time reversal, an invariant state must have vanishing EDM. In other words, a non-vanishing EDM signals both ''P'' and ''T'' symmetry-breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khriplovich|first1=Iosip B.|last2=Lamoreaux|first2=Steve K.|title=CP violation without strangeness : electric dipole moments of particles, atoms, and molecules.|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-3-642-64577-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some molecules, such as water, must have EDM irrespective of whether '''T''' is a symmetry. This is correct; if a quantum system has degenerate ground states that transform into each other under parity, then time reversal need not be broken to give EDM.

Experimentally observed bounds on the [[neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment of the nucleon]] currently set stringent limits on the violation of time reversal symmetry in the [[strong interactions]], and their modern theory: [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Then, using the [[CPT invariance]] of a relativistic [[quantum field theory]], this puts [[CryoEDM|strong bounds]] on [[strong CP violation]].

Experimental bounds on the [[electron electric dipole moment]] also place limits on theories of particle physics and their parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Tarik|last2=Itani|first2=Ahmad|last3=Nath|first3=Pran|title=Electron EDM as a Sensitive Probe of PeV Scale Physics |date=12 Aug 2014 |arxiv=1406.0083|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.90.055006|volume=90|journal=Physical Review D|bibcode=2014PhRvD..90e5006I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jihn E.|last2=Carosi|first2=Gianpaolo|title=Axions and the strong CP problem|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=4 March 2010|volume=82|page=557|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.82.557|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.82.557|arxiv = 0807.3125 |bibcode = 2010RvMP...82..557K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kramers' theorem===
{{Main|Kramers' degeneracy theorem}}

For ''T'', which is an anti-unitary ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry generator

::''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''UKUK'' = ''U U''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''U'' (''U''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = Φ,
where Φ is a diagonal matrix of phases. As a result, ''U'' = Φ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''U''Φ, showing that

::''U'' = Φ ''U'' Φ.

This means that the entries in Φ are ±1, as a result of which one may have either ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ±1. This is specific to the anti-unitarity of ''T''. For a unitary operator, such as the [[parity (physics)|parity]], any phase is allowed.

Next, take a Hamiltonian invariant under ''T''. Let |''a''&gt; and ''T''|''a''&gt; be two quantum states of the same energy. Now, if ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1, then one finds that the states are orthogonal: a result called '''Kramers' theorem'''. This implies that if ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1, then there is a twofold degeneracy in the state. This result in non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]] presages the [[spin statistics theorem]] of [[quantum field theory]].

[[Quantum state]]s that give unitary representations of time reversal, i.e., have '''T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1''', are characterized by a [[multiplicative quantum number]], sometimes called the '''T-parity'''.

Time reversal transformation for fermions in quantum field theories can be represented by an [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0010074 8-component spinor] in which the above-mentioned '''T-parity''' can be a complex number with unit radius. The CPT invariance is not a theorem but a '''better-to-have''' property in these class of theories.

===Time reversal of the known dynamical laws===

[[Particle physics]] codified the basic laws of dynamics into the [[standard model]]. This is formulated as a [[quantum field theory]] that has [[CPT symmetry]], i.e., the laws are invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal, [[parity (physics)|parity]] and [[charge conjugation]]. However, time reversal itself is seen not to be a symmetry (this is usually called [[CP violation]]). There are two possible origins of this asymmetry, one through the [[CKM matrix|mixing]] of different [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]s of quarks in their [[Weak interaction|weak decay]]s, the second through a direct CP violation in strong interactions. The first is seen in experiments, the second is strongly constrained by the non-observation of the [[Neutron electric dipole moment|EDM of a neutron]].

Time reversal violation is unrelated to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], because due to the conservation of the [[CPT symmetry]], the effect of time reversal is to rename [[elementary particle|particle]]s as [[antiparticle]]s and ''vice versa''. Thus the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is thought to originate in the [[initial conditions]] in the universe.

===Time reversal of noninvasive measurements===
[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Strong measurements]] (both classical and quantum) are certainly disturbing, causing asymmetry due to [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However,
[[Weak measurement|noninvasive measurements]] should not disturb the evolution  so they are expected to be time-symmetric. Surprisingly, it is true only in classical physics but not quantum, even in a thermodynamically invariant equilibrium state.
&lt;ref name=non-time /&gt; This type of asymmetry is independent of [[CPT symmetry]] but has not yet been confirmed experimentally due to extreme conditions of the checking proposal.

This article gives a table of some common [[Lie group]]s and their associated [[Lie algebra]]s.

The following are noted: the [[Topology|topological]] properties of the group ([[dimension]]; [[Connected space|connectedness]]; [[Compact space|compactness]]; the nature of the [[fundamental group]]; and whether or not they are [[simply connected]]) as well as on their algebraic properties ([[Abelian group|abelian]]; [[Simple group|simple]]; [[Semisimple group|semisimple]]).

For more examples of Lie groups and other related topics see the [[list of simple Lie groups]]; the [[Bianchi classification]] of groups of up to three dimensions; and the [[list of Lie group topics]].

In [[probability theory]], a '''telescoping Markov chain (TMC)''' is a vector-valued [[stochastic process]] that satisfies a [[Markov property]] and admits a hierarchical format through a network of transition matrices with cascading dependence.

For any &lt;math&gt;N&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; consider the set of spaces &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal S^\ell\}_{\ell=1}^N&lt;/math&gt;. The hierarchical process &lt;math&gt;\theta_k&lt;/math&gt; defined in the product-space

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_k = (\theta_k^1,.....,\theta_k^N)\in\mathcal S^1\times......\times\mathcal S^N&lt;/math&gt;

is said to be a TMC if there is a set of transition probability kernels &lt;math&gt;\{\Lambda^n\}_{n=1}^N&lt;/math&gt; such that

# &lt;math&gt;\theta_k^1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Markov chain]] with transition probability matrix &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^1&lt;/math&gt;
#: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P(\theta_k^1=s|\theta_{k-1}^1=r)=\Lambda^1(s|r)&lt;/math&gt;
# there is a cascading dependence in every level of the hierarchy,
#: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P(\theta_k^n=s|\theta_{k-1}^n=r,\theta_k^{n-1}=t)=\Lambda^n(s|r,t)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  for all &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\theta_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfies a Markov property with a transition kernel that can be written in terms of the &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;'s,
#:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb P(\theta_{k+1}=\vec s|\theta_k=\vec r)=\Lambda^1(s_1|r_1)\prod_{\ell=2}^N\Lambda^\ell(s_\ell|r_\ell,s_{\ell-1})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec s = (s_1,\ldots,s_N)\in\mathcal S^1\times\cdots\times\mathcal S^N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec r = (r_1,\ldots,r_N)\in\mathcal S^1\times\cdots\times\mathcal S^N.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae''' provide uniformity across mathematical texts and help the readers of those texts to grasp new concepts quickly.

[[Mathematical notation]] includes letters from various alphabets, as well as special mathematical symbols. Letters in various [[font]]s often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. A mathematical article or a [[theorem]] typically starts from the definitions of the introduced symbols, such as: "Let ''G'' = (''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') be a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with the vertex set ''V'' and edge set ''E''...". Theoretically it is admissible to write "Let ''X'' = (''a'', ''q'') be a graph with the vertex set ''a'' and edge set ''q''..."; however, this would decrease readability, since the reader has to consciously memorize these unusual notations in a limited context.

Usage of [[subscript]]s and [[superscript]]s is also an important convention. In the early days of computers with limited graphical capabilities for text, subscripts and superscripts were represented with the help of additional notation. In particular, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; could be written as n^2 or n**2 (the latter borrowed from [[FORTRAN]]) and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be written as n_2.

==International recommendations==
Various international authorities, including [[IUPAC]], [[NIST]] and [[ISO]] have produced similar recommendations with regard to typesetting variables and other mathematical symbols (whether in equations or otherwise).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=I. M. |last1=Mills |first2=W.

Volume 36, Issue 5, Pages 23–24, ISSN (Online) 1365-2192, ISSN (Print) 0193-6484, DOI: 10.1515/ci-2014-0529, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.gruppodelcolore.it/Docs/ISO_NIST_typefaces.pdf Typefaces for Symbols in Scientific Manuscripts], NIST, January 1998.  This cites the family of [[ISO standards]] 31-0:1992 to 31-13:1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec10.html More on Printing and Using Symbols and Numbers in Scientific and Technical Documents]".  Chapter 10 of NIST Special Publication 811 (SP 811):  [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)]. 2008 Edition, by Ambler Thompson and Barry N. Taylor.  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, US.  March 2008.  76 pages.  This cites the [[ISO standards]] 31-0:1992 and 31-11:1992, but notes "Currently ISO 31 is being revised &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The revised joint standards ISO/IEC 80000-1—ISO/IEC 80000-15 will supersede ISO 31-0:1992—ISO 31-13.".&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, anything that represents a variable (for example, ''h'' for a patient's height) should be set in italic, and everything else should be set in roman type.  This applies equally to characters from the Latin/English alphabet (a, b, c, ...; A, B, C, ...) as to letters from any other alphabet, most notably Greek (α, β, γ, ...; Α, Β, Γ, ...). Any operator, such as cos (representing cosine) or ∑ (representing summation), should therefore be set roman.  Note that each element must be set depending upon its own merits, including subscripts and superscripts.  Thus, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would be suitable for the initial height, while ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' would represent one instance from a set of heights (''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...). Notice that numbers (1, 2, 3, ''etc.'') are not variables, and so are always set roman.  Likewise, in some special cases symbols are used to represent general constants, such as π used to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and such general constants can be set in roman.  (This does not apply to parameters which are merely chosen to not vary.) 
 
For vectors, matrices and tensors, it is recommended to set the variable itself in boldface (excluding any associated subscripts or superscripts).  Hence, '''''u'''''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would be suitable for the initial velocity, while '''''u'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' would represent one instance from a set of velocities ('''''u'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''''u'''''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''''u'''''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...). Italic is still used for variables, both for lowercase and for uppercase symbols (Latin, Greek, or otherwise).  The only general situation where italic is not used for bolded symbols is for vector operators, such as '''∇''' (nabla), set bold and roman.

==General rules in American mathematical typography==
The rules of mathematical typography differ from country to country; thus, American [[mathematical journal]]s and books will tend to use slightly different conventions from those of European journals.

One advantage of mathematical notation is its modularity&amp;mdash;it is possible to write extremely complicated formulae involving multiple levels of super- or subscripting, and multiple levels of fraction bars. However, it is considered poor style to set up a formula in such a way as to leave more than a certain number of levels; for example, in non-math publications
&lt;!--
Note the use of "matrix" environment to shrink fraction; TeX does the wrong thing here, and MediaWiki doesn't recognize \textstyle --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;AX = \Omega_{e^x} + \begin{matrix}\frac{a}{b+\frac{c}{d}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
might be rewritten as
&lt;!--
Note the use of "matrix" environment to shrink fraction; TeX does the wrong thing here, and MediaWiki doesn't recognize \textstyle --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;AX = \Omega_{\,\exp x} + \begin{matrix}\frac{a}{b+c/d}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

(Even in mathematical publications, where 3 or 4 levels of indices are frequent, avoiding multilevel fractions is productive.)

Incidentally, the above formula demonstrates the American rule that [[italic type]] is used for all letters representing variables and parameters except uppercase Greek letters, which are in upright type.  Upright type is also standard for digits and punctuation; currently, the ISO-mandated style of using upright for constants (such as e, i) is not widespread.  Bold Latin capital letters usually represent [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and bold lowercase letters are often used for [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s. The names of well-known functions, such as sin ''x'' (the [[trigonometric function]] sine) and exp ''x'' (the constant ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' raised to the power of ''x'') are written in lowercase upright letters (and often, as shown here, without parentheses around the argument).

Certain important constructs are sometimes referred to by [[blackboard bold]] letters. For example, some authors denote the set of [[natural number]]s by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Other authors prefer to use bold Latin for these symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Krantz, S., ''Handbook of Typography for the Mathematical Sciences'', Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, Florida, 2001, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; (In context of math, font variations such as bold/non-bold may encode an arbitrary relation between symbols; using specialized symbols for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; etc. allows the author more freedom of expressing such relations.)

[[Donald Knuth]]'s [[TeX]] typesetting engine incorporates a large amount of additional knowledge about American-style mathematical typography.

'''Sir Vaughan Frederick Randal Jones''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM|FRS|FRSNZ}} {{post-nominals|country=AUS|FAA}} (born 31 December 1952) is a New Zealand mathematician, known for his work on [[von Neumann algebra]]s and [[knot polynomial]]s. He was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] in 1990, and famously wore a [[All Blacks|New Zealand rugby]] jersey when he gave his acceptance speech in Kyoto.

== Biography ==
Vaughan Jones was born in [[Gisborne, New Zealand]] and brought up in [[Cambridge, New Zealand]], completing secondary school at [[Auckland Grammar School]]. His undergraduate studies were at the University of Auckland, from where he obtained a BSc in 1972 and an MSc in 1973. For his graduate studies, he went to [[Switzerland]], where he completed his PhD at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1979. His thesis, titled ''Actions of finite groups on the hyperfinite II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor'', was written under the supervision of [[André Haefliger]]. In 1980, he moved to the United States, where he taught at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1980–1981) and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1981–1985), before being appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.

His work on [[knot polynomial]]s, with the discovery of what is now called the [[Jones polynomial]], was from an unexpected direction with origins in the theory of [[von Neumann algebras]], an area of [[analysis]] already much developed by [[Alain Connes]]. It led to the solution of a number of classical problems of [[knot theory]], and to increased interest in [[low-dimensional topology]].

Jones has since 2011 been at [[Vanderbilt University]] as Stevenson Distinguished Professor of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/bio/vaughan-jones Personal web page at Vanderbilt University]&lt;/ref&gt; He remains Professor Emeritus at [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he has been on the faculty since 1985&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/vaughan-f-r-jones Personal web page at Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a Distinguished Alumni Professor at the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/v-jones Personal web page at Auckland]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made an honorary vice-president for life of the [[International Guild of Knot Tyers]] in 1992.

{{Commons category|Wang tiles}}

'''Wang tiles''' (or '''Wang dominoes'''), first proposed by mathematician, logician, and philosopher [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] in 1961, are a class of [[formal system]]s. They are modelled visually by square tiles with a color on each side. A set of such tiles is selected, and copies of the tiles are arranged side by side with matching colors, ''without'' rotating or reflecting them.

The basic question about a set of Wang tiles is whether it can [[tessellation|tile]] the plane or not, i.e., whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way. The next question is whether this can be done in a periodic pattern.

==Domino problem==
[[Image:Wang tesselation.svg|thumb|400px|Example of Wang tessellation with 13 tiles.]]
In 1961, Wang conjectured that if a finite set of Wang tiles can tile the plane, then there exists also a [[tessellation|''periodic'' tiling]], i.e., a tiling that is invariant under translations by vectors in a 2-dimensional lattice, like a wallpaper pattern.  He also observed that this conjecture would imply the existence of an algorithm to decide whether a given finite set of Wang tiles can tile the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

According to Wang's student, [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]],&lt;ref name="berger"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Domino Problem deals with the class of all domino sets. It consists of deciding, for each domino set, whether or not it is solvable. We say that the Domino Problem is ''decidable'' or ''undecidable'' according to whether there exists or does not exist an algorithm which, given the specifications of an arbitrary domino set, will decide whether or not the set is solvable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In other words, the domino problem asks whether there is an [[effective procedure]] that correctly settles the problem for all given domino sets.

In 1966, Wang's student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] solved the domino problem in the negative. He proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any [[Turing machine]] into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt.  The undecidability of the [[halting problem]] (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang's tiling problem.&lt;ref name="berger"&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1966}}.  Berger coins the term "Wang tiles", and demonstrates the first aperiodic set of them.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aperiodic sets of tiles==
Combining Berger's undecidability result with Wang's observation shows that there must exist a finite set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane, but only ''[[aperiodic tiling|aperiodically]]''.  This is similar to a [[Penrose tiling]], or the arrangement of atoms in a [[quasicrystal]].  Although Berger's original set contained 20,426 tiles, he conjectured that smaller sets would work, including subsets of his set, and in his unpublished Ph.D. thesis, he reduced the number of tiles to 104.  In later years, increasingly smaller sets were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For example, the set of 13 tiles given in the image above is an aperiodic set published by Karel Culik II in 1996.&lt;ref name="culik"/&gt;  It can tile the plane, but not periodically.  A smaller set of 11 tiles using 4 colors was discovered by Emmanuel Jeandel and Michael Rao in 2015, using an exhaustive search to prove that 10 tiles or 3 colors are insufficient to force aperiodicity.&lt;ref name="jeandel" /&gt;

==Generalizations==
Wang tiles can be generalized in various ways, all of which are also undecidable in the above sense.  For example, ''Wang cubes'' are equal-sized cubes with colored faces and side colors can be matched on any polygonal [[tessellation]].
Culik and Kari have demonstrated aperiodic sets of Wang cubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Applications==
Wang tiles have recently become a popular tool for [[procedural synthesis]] of textures, [[heightfield]]s, and other large and nonrepeating bidimensional data sets; a small set of precomputed or hand-made source tiles can be assembled very cheaply without too obvious repetitions and without periodicity.
In this case, traditional aperiodic tilings would show their very regular structure; much less constrained sets that guarantee at least two tile choices for any two given side colors are common because tileability is easily ensured and each tile can be selected pseudorandomly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Zerah Colburn''' (September 1, 1804 – March 2, 1839)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Colburn, Zerah|volume=Comprehensive Index|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[child prodigy]] of the 19th century who gained fame as a [[mental calculator]].&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''Calculating Prodigies'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Colburn was born in [[Cabot, Vermont]], in 1804. He was thought to be [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] until the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stepanov.lk.net/mnemo/zerae.html|title=The Nineteenth Century in Print, 1833|website=stepanov.lk.net|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after six weeks of schooling his father overheard him repeating his [[multiplication table]]s. His father was not sure whether or not he learned the tables from his older brothers and sisters but he decided to test him further on his mathematical abilities and discovered that there was something special about his son when Zerah correctly multiplied 13 and 97.

Colburn's abilities developed rapidly and he was soon able to solve such problems as the number of seconds in 2,000 years, the product of 12,225 and 1,223, or the square root of 1,449. When he was seven years old he took six seconds to give the numbers of hours in thirty-eight years, two months, and seven days.

Zerah is reported to have been able to solve fairly complex problems. For example, the sixth [[Fermat number]] is 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;+1 (or 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;+1). The question is whether this number, 4,294,967,297, is prime or not. Zerah calculated in his head that it was not and has divisor 641. The other divisor is 6,700,417 and can easily be found using a calculator.

His father capitalized on his boy's talents by taking Zerah around the country and eventually abroad, demonstrating the boy's exceptional abilities. The two left Vermont in the winter of 1810-11. Passing through [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], [[John Wheelock]], then president of [[Dartmouth College]], offered to take upon himself the whole care and expense of his education, but his father rejected the offer. At [[Boston]], the boy's performances attracted much attention. He was visited by [[Harvard College]] professors and eminent people from all professions, and the newspapers ran numerous articles concerning his powers of computation.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{AmCyc|wstitle=Colburn, Zerah|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Boston, his father exhibited Zerah for money throughout the middle and part of the southern states and, in January 1812, sailed with him for England. In September 1813 Colburn was being exhibited in Dublin. Colburn was pitted against the 8-year-old [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in a mental arithmetic contest, with Colburn emerging the clear victor. In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less time to studying languages and more time to studying mathematics. After traveling over England, [[Scotland]], and [[Ireland]], they spent 18 months in Paris. Here Zerah was placed in the Lycée Napoléon, but was soon removed by his father, who, at length, in 1816, returned to England in deep poverty.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

The [[Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol|Earl of Bristol]] soon became interested in the boy, and placed him in [[Westminster School]], where he remained until 1819. In consequence of his father's refusal to comply with certain arrangements proposed by the earl, Zerah was removed from Westminster, and his father now proposed to Zerah that he should study to become an actor. Accordingly, he studied for this profession, and was for a few months under the tuition of [[Charles Kemble]]. His first appearance, however, dissatisfied both his instructor and himself so much, that he was not accepted for the stage, so he accepted a position as an assistant in a school, and soon afterward commenced a school of his own. To this he added the performing of some astronomical calculations for [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], then secretary of the [[Board of Longitude]].&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

In 1824 when his father died, he was enabled by the Earl of Bristol and other friends to return to the United States. Though Zerah's schooling was rather irregular, he showed talent in languages. He went to [[Fairfield, New York]], as assistant teacher of an academy; but not being pleased with his situation, he moved in March following to [[Burlington, Vermont]], where he taught French, pursuing his studies at the same time in the [[University of Vermont]]. Toward the end of 1825 he connected himself with the [[Methodist Church]] and, after nine years of service as an itinerant preacher, he settled in [[Norwich, Vermont]], in 1835, where he was soon after appointed professor of languages at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

In 1833 he published his autobiography.
