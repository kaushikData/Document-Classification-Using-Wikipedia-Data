{{for|the minor planet|17776 Troska}}
'''''17776''''', also known as '''''What Football Will Look Like in the Future''''', is a serialized [[speculative fiction]] multimedia narrative by [[Jon Bois]] published online through [[SB Nation]]. Set in the distant future, the series follows three [[Space probe|space probes]] that have gained sentience and watch humanity play an evolved form of [[American football]], in which games can be played for millennia over distances of thousands of miles. The series debuted on July 5, 2017, and new chapters were published daily until the series concluded ten days later with its twenty-fifth chapter on July 15.

Bois began developing ''17776'' in 2016. Because the story incorporates text, animated [[GIF]]s, still images, and videos hosted on [[YouTube]], new tools were developed to allow it to be hosted efficiently on the SB Nation website. The work explores themes of consciousness, hope, despair, and why humans play sports. ''17776'' was well received by critics, who praised it for its innovative use of its medium and for the depth of emotion it evoked. In 2018, the story won a [[National Magazine Awards|National Magazine Award]] for Digital Innovation and was longlisted for a [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story]].

== Premise ==
[[File:Pioneer-6-9.jpg|thumb|A newly sentient ''Pioneer 9'' is one of the main characters of ''17776''.|alt=A barrel-like space probe with several antennae floats through red-black space.]]
The story takes place on an Earth where humans stopped dying, aging, and being born in 2026. All social ills were subsequently eliminated, and technology preventing humans from any injury was developed. In the United States, [[American football]] evolved to include new rules, including those that allow fields thousands of miles long, hundreds of in-game players, and games millennia long. Over time, computers gained [[sentience]] due to constant exposure to broadcast human data.

By the year 17776, the [[space probe]] ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (called Nine) has gained sentience and made contact with ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' (called Ten) and the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]] (called Juice). As Nine adjusts to a world radically different from that of the [[20th century]], the three space probes watch multiple football games occurring across the United States: a game using the entirety of [[Nebraska]] as a field in which the next point scored wins the game; a game in which players strive to possess every existing football signed by [[Koy Detmer]]; a game played between the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]] and the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] deadlocked for 13,000 years at the bottom of a [[Canyon|gorge]] in [[Arizona]]; an [[National Football League|NFL]] regulation game between the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] that changed over 15,000 years into 58 playing teams owning and capitalizing upon portions of the field while the ball is lost; a [[500 (ball game)|500]] game that results in the destruction of the [[Centennial Light]]; and a game in which the possessing player is attempting to score an automatic win by hiding in his team's [[end zone]] for 10,000 years.

==Format==
''17776'' is read by [[scrolling]] through pages occupied by large [[GIF]] images and colored dialogue text, interspersed with occasional [[YouTube]] videos. The story is divided into chapters, which were originally published in daily installments between July 5 and July 15, 2017.&lt;ref name=Quartz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1024077/an-explanation-of-sb-nations-what-football-will-look-like-in-the-future-17776-by-jon-bois/|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|title=A dazzling new piece of experimental fiction is being serialized on a sports news site|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|date=July 8, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115195343/https://qz.com/1024077/an-explanation-of-sb-nations-what-football-will-look-like-in-the-future-17776-by-jon-bois/|archivedate=November 15, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Bois wrote and illustrated ''17776'' for [[Vox Media]]'s sports news website [[SB Nation]], of which he is creative director. Aside from ''17776'', Bois produces two other recurring, humorous video essay programs for the site: ''Pretty Good'', which focuses on unusual sports topics and stories, and ''Chart Party'',  which focuses on statistics and has an emphasis on Bois' use of visual art in his journalism and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Lars|title=SB Nation’s Jon Bois shows Seahawks are "Least Volatile" in NFL|url=https://www.fieldgulls.com/2017/8/23/16193930/seattle-seahawks-chart-party-jon-bois-least-volatile-team-30-years|website=Field Gulls|accessdate= September 4, 2017|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904063758/https://www.fieldgulls.com/2017/8/23/16193930/seattle-seahawks-chart-party-jon-bois-least-volatile-team-30-years|archivedate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bois is also known for the ''Breaking Madden'' series, in which he attempted unusual scenarios in the ''[[Madden NFL]]'' series of video games.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Bois began developing an "anti-sci fi" project as a possible sequel to ''The [[Tim Tebow]] CFL Chronicles'', an earlier work for SB Nation, and set the story in a year far enough in the future that "nobody ever thinks about it." Although he liked the concept and the visuals, he believed the project would not connect with readers and shelved it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, he realized that the story needed a centering character; he wrote one in the form of a small town, [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[talk show]] host before coming up with the characters of the probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers|title=17776: Questions and answers|date=July 24, 2017|website=[[SB Nation]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904070557/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers|archive-date=September 4, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018|last1=Bois|first1=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development renewed in May 2016, and the project solidified after SB Nation published its article "The Future of Football."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.poynter.org/2017/this-sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-2-3-million-pageviews/466041/|title=This SB Nation story has everything: Robots, football and 2.3 million pageviews|last=Funke|first=Daniel|date=July 10, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Poynter Institute]]|work=Poynter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152053/https://www.poynter.org/news/sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-23-million-pageviews|archive-date=September 4, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bois described it as the biggest project he ever attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=882763911510052864|user=jon_bois|title=today is day one of the biggest project i've ever tried. it is called 17776|author=|date=July 10, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017|last=Bois|first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was developed by Graham MacAree, who used a Vox Media tool that creates custom packages from standard article sets to give Bois creative leeway and to accommodate the series' weight on the SB Nation website. MacAree found that there were few resources online for achieving the desired effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Themes ==
Bois has stated that he had "conceived [''17776''] to give the reader a good time," asserting that this "was literally the whole point."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

William Hughes writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described ''17776'' as concerned with why humans play sports: "That is, given the massive resources, time, and information at our disposal (not to mention those available to our descendants), why does communal game-playing still hold such an important place in society?" He also listed consciousness, hope, and despair as among the work's themes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/future-football-post-human-despair-and-fascinating-257765|title=The future of football is post-human despair (and fascinating sports meta-fiction)|last=Hughes|first=William|date=July 6, 2017|access-date=September 7, 2018|dead-url=|work=[[The A.V.

She also felt that Ten and Juice take on the [[Shoulder angel|role of angel and devil]], and she suggested the two may be [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narrators]].&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/sports-site-dives-into-scifi-with-series-about-the-futu-1796753325|title=Sports Site Dives Into Scifi with Series About the Future of Football|last=Elderkin|first=Beth|date=July 9, 2017|work=[[io9]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080645/http://io9.gizmodo.com/sports-site-dives-into-scifi-with-series-about-the-futu-1796753325|archivedate=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Crouch of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt that the work had a "tonal echo" of [[Don DeLillo]]'s 1972 novel ''[[End Zone]]'' due to thematic similarities "with the way that the order and logic of football might act as a counterbalance to the chaos of the real world".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Reception==
According to the communications director at Vox Media, ''17776'' garnered over 2.3 million pageviews by July 10.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two days later it had received more than 2.9 million pageviews.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-experimental-fiction-that-imagines-football-obsessed-americans-in-the-extremely-distant-future|title=The Experimental Fiction That Imagines Football-Obsessed Americans in the Extremely Distant Future|last=Crouch|first=Ian|date=July 12, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613014956/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-experimental-fiction-that-imagines-football-obsessed-americans-in-the-extremely-distant-future|archive-date=June 13, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average engagement time was over nine minutes, and 43 percent of readers finished each installment of the series published by July 7.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On July 19, Bois claimed that ''17776''  received 700,000 [[unique visitors]] and 4 million total pageviews, with an average engagement time of 11 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=887538023805669376|user=jon_bois|title=over the last two weeks, 17776 got four million pageviews and 700,000 unique visitors. people stuck around for an average of 11 minutes|author=|date=July 19, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017|last=Bois|first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thu-Huong Ha described ''17776'' as "part [[Italo Calvino]], part Peter Heller [author of ''[[The Dog Stars]]''], with humor seemingly from within the depths of [[Reddit]]," saying that the story would appeal to fans of both sports and literature.&lt;ref name=Quartz /&gt; [[Tor.com]] described the first chapter as full of tension and felt that receiving answers is a "surprisingly heartbreaking" experience "lessened by a gleeful bouncing immaturity" one would not expect from the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2017/07/06/jon-bois-future-of-football-17776-story/|title=You Don't Know It Yet, But You're Reading a Hilarious Sci-Fi Short Story|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=July 6, 2017|website=On Our Radar|publisher=[[Tor.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811010826/https://www.tor.com/2017/07/06/jon-bois-future-of-football-17776-story/|archive-date=August 11, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth Elderkin at ''io9'' said the series is "akin to ''[[Homestuck]]''" and described it as "weird, complex, and pretty spectacular".&lt;ref name="io9" /&gt; William Hughes writing for ''The A.V. Club'' felt that ''17776'' is a "truly innovative piece of work".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After reading the first three chapters, Agatha French of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that she was "impressed and excited by the innovation" of what she saw, and that she was intrigued despite not knowing what the work is or is saying. She felt the work took full advantage of its online medium and suggested that it "may also be a glimpse into the future of reading on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-litweek-20170712-htmlstory.html|title=Radiant children, the future of football and eau de literary hero|last=French|first=Agatha|date=July 12, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=September 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202044237/http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-litweek-20170712-htmlstory.html|archive-date=February 2, 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Crouch of ''The New Yorker'' described the series as, "despite its seemingly meagre parts, a thing of startling beauty". Of the chapters published by July 12, he felt "the most striking chapter" to be one that utilized audio of [[Verne Lundquist]] calling [[Kick Six|the end of a 2013 game]] between the [[2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|University of Alabama]] and [[2013 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn University]] over a video panning over Earth. He also noted that the series was compared to ''Homestuck'' and relayed additional comparisons to [[Thomas Pynchon]] novels and "a Reddit thread hijacked by robot [[Internet troll|trolls]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The series won a [[National Magazine Award]] for Digital Innovation from the [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] for the story and its delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=973618290839912450|user=ASME1963|title=Ellies 2018: @SBNation wins Digital Innovation category for '17776: An American Football Story'|author=American Society of Magazine Editors|authorlink=American Society of Magazine Editors|date=March 13, 2018|access-date=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also longlisted for the [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story]] in 2018, ultimately finishing in 11th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adair |first1=Torsten |title=Hugo Awards, 2018: A Deeper Look Into the Nominations and Voting Data |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/hugo-awards-2018-a-deeper-look-into-the-nominations-and-voting-data/ |work=[[Comics Beat|The Beat]] |date=September 2, 2018|accessdate=October 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904184049/http://www.comicsbeat.com/hugo-awards-2018-a-deeper-look-into-the-nominations-and-voting-data/|archivedate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centro de Arqueologia Annette Laming Emperaire.jpg|thumb|262px|Centre of archaeology Annette Laming Emperaire]]
'''Annette Laming-Emperaire''' (22 October 1917 – May 1977) was a French [[archaeology|archeologist]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], as the [[daughter]] of French [[diplomat]]s, 15 days before the Bolsheviks took Moscow she went with her parents to [[France]]. Annette Laming studied philosophy in [[Paris]] until [[World War II]] began. She then turned to teaching while participating in the [[French Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/UN78019/LAMING_EMPERAIRE_A.htm Universalis.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, she studied [[archaeology]] and specialized in cave art, her doctoral thesis, done under the supervision of [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], ''La Signification de l’art rupestre paléolithique'' (published in 1962),&lt;blockquote&gt;dismissed the various, too creative theories of its predecessors, and, with them, any residual nineteenth-century prejudice or romance about the "primitive" mind. Laming-Emperaire's structuralist methodology is still in use, much facilitated by computer science. It involves compiling minutely detailed inventories and diagrams of the way that species are grouped on the cave walls; of their gender, frequency, and position; and of their relation to the signs and handprints that often appear close to them.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Thurman, "First Impressions", ''The New Yorker'', June 23, 2008, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She married a fellow archeologist, [[Joseph Emperaire]], a student of [[Paul Rivet]], who believed humans had come to South America from South Asia before reaching [[North America]], and they began digging, looking for signs of early human occupation, in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]], where Joseph died when the wall of an excavation fell in on him. In the early 1970s, she returned to Brazil and selected six sites in the [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]] area, where the Danish paleontologist [[Peter Wilhelm Lund]] had dug a century earlier. She found a rock shelter at site IV where in 1974-1975 she discovered most of the fat bones of what was named Lapa Vermelha IV hominid 1, the oldest human fossil in Brazil, around 11 thousand years old. The skull was given the nickname [[Luzia Woman|Luzia]]. "Shortly after that, Annette Laming-Emperaire too died tragically. She went on a vacation in 1976 to the Brazilian state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], and was [[asphyxia]]ted in her shower by a defective gas heating element."&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, ''Bones: Discovering the First Americans,'' p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, work at the site ceased until her assistant Andre Prous (who became a professor at UFMG) returned to Lapa Vermelha IV in 1979 to take over the project.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, "Lagoa Santa sites (Minas Gerais, Brazil)"&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial by a colleague called her "un des esprits les plus riches et les plus féconds de la recherche préhistorique française" ['one of the richest and most fertile spirits of French prehistoric research'].&lt;ref&gt;Lavallée, "Annette Laming-Emperaire," p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the French researcher at region of Lagoa Santa, which includes, in addition to Lagoa Santa and Pedro Leopoldo, the municipalities of Matozinhos, Capim Branco, Vespasiano, Confins, Funilândia and Prudente de Morais, are at the Archeology Center Annette Laming Emperaire (Caale), of the Municipality of Lagoa Santa, in operation for 35 years. In Annette's team were researchers from the National Museum, where thousands of ceramic, lytic fragments and bones found in the excavations. The Franco-Brazilian mission in Lagoa Santa, under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[Unesco]]), remained in the region between 1974 and 1976 and concentrated the excavations mainly in the Lapa Vermelha de Pedro Leopoldo. It was in this [[cave]] that Annette found "Luzia". In 1998, the "first Brazilian", as it entered the history, gained a face. When surveying collections of fossils in the museum, anthropologist Walter Neves, from the University of São Paulo (USP), made in-depth studies on the bones and provided the dating, which is 11,400 years. One of the great merits of the Franco-Brazilian mission, according to experts, was to rescue in the world scientific scenario the importance of Lagoa Santa, where Dr. Lund, in more than four decades, collected more than 12 thousand fossils, which were sent in 1845, to the King of Denmark. After Lund, the region, in the Lagoa Santa Cárstica Environmental Preservation Area (APA Cárstica), only attracted new glances in the 1950s, when researchers from the Minas Gerais Academy of Sciences and the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum in Rio de Janeiro]] resumed the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/gerais/2018/10/03/interna_gerais,993745/busca-pelo-cranio-de-luzia-continua-um-mes-apos-incendio-no-rio.shtml|title=Busca pelo crânio de Luzia continua um mês após incêndio no Museu Nacional|publisher=em.com.br|access-date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The downhill spiral followed by the final return of a damaged-for-life boy to Rochdale is well handled too. He has a very expressive face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guantanamo Boy Theatre Review - WhatsonStage Susan Elkin|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/11-2013/guantanamo-boy_32626.html|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=WhatsonStage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archduchess Mathilde of Austria''' (Mathilde Marie Adelgunde Alexandra; 25 January 1849, [[Vienna]] – 6 June 1867, [[Schloss Hetzendorf]] near Vienna) was an Austrian noblewoman.  She was the second daughter of [[Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen]] and [[Princess Hildegard of Bavaria]] (1825–1864).

== Family ==
Her forenames were derived from her mother's sisters, [[Princess Mathilde of Bavaria (1813–1862)|Mathilde, Grand Duchess of Hesse (1813–1862)]], [[Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria|Adelgunde, Duchess of Modena (1823–1914)]] and [[Princess Alexandra of Bavaria|Princess Alexandra of Bavaria (1826–1875)]], with whom Hildegard had a very close relationship.

Mathilde had two elder siblings: [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1845–1927)|Maria Theresia]] (1845–1927) in 1865 married Duke [[Philipp of Württemberg]] (1838–1917) and her only brother, Karl Albrecht (1847–1848), who died of smallpox at the age of 18 months.

== Life ==
After the death of his father [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Karl]], Archduke Albrecht inherited in 1847 the Weilburg Palace in [[Baden bei Wien]], that Karl had built for his wife [[Princess Henrietta of Weilburg]] (1797–1829). Albrecht and his family usually spent summers there, Archduchess Hildegard being especially fond of its renowned [[public baths]]. Because of his charity, he was popularly named ''Engelsherz'' (Angel's Heart).  During the winter, the family lived in [[Vienna]].  Her family was very close to the imperial family, and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth]] greatly enjoyed the company of her cousin Archduchess Hildegard.

Among Mathilde's circle of friends was the Archduchess [[Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1849–1919)|Marie Therese (1849–1919)]], later [[Queen of Bavaria]], who was of the same age and also the stepdaughter of [[Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria|Karl Ferdinand (1818–1874)]], Mathilde's uncle.

A distant cousin, Archduke [[Ludwig Salvator]] (1847–1915), of the Italian Habsburg line, fell in love with Mathilde and sought to marry her, but they never became engaged.  Mathilde was intended to become Queen of [[Italy]] as the wife of [[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto of Savoy]] (1844–1900) in order to improve the already tense relations between [[Austria-Hungary]] and Italy.

During her stay in [[Munich]] for the funeral of her brother [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|King Maximilian II (1811–1864)]] in March 1864, Mathilde's mother became ill with a [[lung]] [[inflammation]] and [[pleurisy]], and died; Mathilde was then 15 years old.

== Death ==
Mathilde died at the age of 18 in [[Schloss Hetzendorf]], the Viennese home of [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elisabeth]], on 6 June 1867.  The archduchess had put on a [[gauze]] [[dress]] to go to the [[theatre]].  Before leaving for the theatre, she wanted to smoke a [[cigarette]] but shortly thereafter her father, who had forbidden [[smoking]], approached her, and she hid the cigarette behind her dress, immediately setting light to its very flammable material and giving her second and third-degree burns.  Her death was witnessed by her whole family.

Archduchess Mathilde was buried in the imperial vault in the [[Imperial Crypt, Vienna|Imperial Crypt]] beside her mother and her brother Karl Albrecht.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2213">'''Asarpay''', also known as '''Sarpay''', was an [[Inca Empire|Inca]] priestess in a cult dedicated to Apurima, the personified version of the [[Apurímac River|Apurimac River]], during the 1500s. Asarpay spoke for the Apurimac [[Sayhuite|shrine]], understood as an oracle of the personified river. She would give advice and warning to those of her community on the shrine's behalf. Asarpay is known for her actions and premonitions during the Spanish conquest; Asarpay foretold the Conquest and advised Inca nobility to gather and use up all of their food stores, as to not leave the conquerors any access to their resources. Asarpay is mentioned most frequently in regards to her sensationalized suicide; the reasoning for her suicide, however, is not exact. There are some claims that Asarpay threw herself into the Apurimac river gorge as a way to assure her freedom after being previously kidnapped by the Spaniard Diego Nunez Mercado.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tpSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=asarpay+apurimac&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z8qPTDZAAY&amp;sig=eXxmZAEJbJ9pEmTcYVihrBCHxT4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbj_H577HWAhWo6IMKHRNsDywQ6AEITDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=asarpay%20apurimac&amp;f=false|title=Women in Ancient America: Second Edition|last=Bruhns|first=Karen Olsen|last2=Stothert|first2=Karen E.|date=2014-08-20|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806147529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also believed that Asarpay threw herself from the Apurima temple into the river as a way of returning to the river goddess, rather than watching the destruction of the idol by the advancing Spanish army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RS8pDscWlpIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=moon+sun+and+witches&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLs9SVgbLWAhWM7IMKHTVmD3EQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=moon%20sun%20and%20witches&amp;f=false|title=Moon, Sun, and Witches: Gender Ideologies and Class in Inca and Colonial Peru|last=Silverblatt|first=Irene Marsha|date=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691022585|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">'''Autokabalesis''' is a very rare psychiatric term,  referring to the choice of jumping from a raised structure or otherwise at a  significant height to the ground as an act of suicide or due to psychiatric disorder.

==Studies==
Studied in 1979 by Sims &amp; O'Brien K.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=459744 |year=1979 |last1=Sims |first1=A |last2=O'Brien |first2=K |title=Autokabalesis: An account of mentally ill people who jump from buildings |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=195–8 |journal=Medicine, science, and the law}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study of 1992 found that many suicidal acts of falling from height were done by young males that were unemployed and single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0020-1383(92)90046-U |title=Autokabalesis: A study of intentional vertical deceleration injuries |year=1992 |last1=Isbister |first1=E.S. |last2=Roberts |first2=J.A. |journal=Injury |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=119–22 |pmid=1572707}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 study of 28 persons hospitalized as a result of falling from height, findings showed most fallers had serious psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0020-1383(88)90124-6 |title=Injuries in attempted suicide by jumping from a height |year=1988 |last1=Katz |first1=Kalman |last2=Gonen |first2=Noah |last3=Goldberg |first3=Igo |last4=Mizrahi |first4=Joseph |last5=Radwan |first5=Marguerite |last6=Yosipovitch |first6=Zvi |journal=Injury |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=371–4 |pmid=3267637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of data from between 1990 and 1998 of this type of suicide within New York city showed the highest number of deaths were within the populus aged 65 and over (Abrams ''et al'' 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.037861 |title=Preference for Fall from Height as a Method of Suicide by Elderly Residents of New York City |year=2005 |last1=Abrams |first1=Robert C. |last2=Marzuk |first2=Peter M. |last3=Tardiff |first3=Kenneth |last4=Leon |first4=Andrew C. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=1000–2 |pmid=15914824 |pmc=1449299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In the period  between 1987 and 1990, 39 people were treated at the University Hospital Bochum with injuries sustained by falls from height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8584940 |year=1995 |last1=Hahn |first1=MP |last2=Richter |first2=D |last3=Ostermann |first3=PA |last4=Muhr |first4=G |title=Verletzungsmuster nach Sturz aus großer Höhe.

An analysis of 101 cases |language=German |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=609–13 |journal=Der Unfallchirurg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study  of 1998 (Joyce &amp; Fleminger) reported that according to the Office of Census and Surveys 1990-1994, 4% of all deaths by suicide were accountable by falling from height or jumping in front of a moving object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/pb.22.7.424 |title=Suicide attempts by jumping |year=1998 |last1=Joyce |first1=J. |last2=Fleminger |first2=S. |journal=Psychiatric Bulletin |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of cases of suicide of this nature are complicated by doubt  as to whether death was caused as a result of murder (homicide). Evidence for suicidal intent according to  psychological opinion is thought to be, previous suicide attempts, depression, a history of mental disorder, or current psychiatric admission,and the ''leaving of possessions at a cliff top''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rod Cross]] - [[The University of Sydney]] [http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~cross/FORENSIC-PHYSICS/FALLING-FATALITIES.htm School of Physics] Retrieved 2012-01-25{{Self-published inline|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14977">{{Other uses|Boot camp (disambiguation)}}

'''Boot camps''' can be governmental being part of the correctional and [[penal system]] of some countries.  Modeled after military [[recruit training]] camps, these programs are based on shock incarceration grounded on military techniques. The aggressive training used has resulted in deaths in a variety of circumstances. Boot camps are also criticized around the world for their lack of behavioral change and for the way extreme force can traumatize children and teenagers.&lt;ref name="nytimes-deaths

==Criticisms==
Other countries have been closely watching the boot camp system in the U.S. but so far have been slow to copy it, if at all.

There are no research findings in favor of boot camps in light of any of the initial intentions. [[Recidivism]] rates in the U.S. among former prison inmates and boot camp participants are roughly the same. Yet, the effects of boot camps are controversially disputed, some surveys claiming lower re-offence rates, others showing no change as compared to persons serving normal time. Surveys also show different results concerning the reduction of costs. Critics add that the emphasis on authority can only result in frustration, resentment, anger, short temper, a low self-esteem and [[aggression]] rather than [[respect]].

According to the [[New York Times]] there have been 31 known deaths of youths in U.S. boot camps since 1980.&lt;ref name="nytimes-deaths"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/states-pressed-as-3-boys-die-at-boot-camps.html|title=States Pressed As 3 Boys Die At Boot Camps |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |date=2001-07-15 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage around the world==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] the Premier of the state of Queensland [[Campbell Newman]] announced that bootcamps for convicted young people will open in Townsville and Rockhampton by September 2013, along with two other camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newman announces boot camps for young offenders|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/newman-announces-boot-camps-for-young-offenders-20130324-2gnp6.html#ixzz2OQlC99gD|accessdate=27 March 2013|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada participation in boot camp programs is voluntary, so as to avoid any challenges under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] under which treatment at boot camps could be seen as an infringement on a youth's right to not be subject to cruel and unusual punishment and to ensure security of person. Canada started a boot camp project for non-violent juveniles with differences from the American models. The first one was opened in 1997 in Ontario. Unlike in the US system it is not possible to trade or shorten a jail sentence with a significantly shorter boot camp program.

Canadian boot camps do not have the time frame of 90 to 180 days and they are restricted to juveniles under 18, and are not yet open to female offenders. The judges do not directly possess the authority to send a youth to a boot camp. They may impose a sentence of secure or open custody. The latter is defined as, "a community residential center, group home, child care institution or forest or wilderness camp..." Once an open custody sentence is granted, a correctional official decides whether a sentence is served in a boot camp program. But the ultimate decision rests with the young person and the decision is made purely on the merits of the program because the time served remains the same.

The Canadian system is too new to show any comparable results but research has been done among US boot camps with different emphases, e.g. more on drug treatment or education than solely on military drill. According to the findings treatment has a slightly positive impact on the reduction of recidivism over strict discipline.

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] set up its first boot camps in 1971 but they were abandoned in 1981. The boot camps were regarded as a failure with a 71% rate of re-offending among corrective trainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0902/S00180.htm|title=Boot Camps no more than "Correctional Quackery" - Rethinking Crime and Punishment press release|date=17 February 2009|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being elected into Government in 2008 the [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]] released a policy of using boot camps for those with drug problems.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_242511"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/242511 |title=Boot camps for teen crims in Nats' plan |date=29 January 2008 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] introduced military-style activity camps (MACs) run by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] for forty of the most serious recidivist young offenders which involved marching exercises, mentoring, drug and alcohol treatment programs, education, and an assisted move back into the community. The Government also launched a nine-week camp for the most serious, recidivist offenders in [[Christchurch]] in 2010 and a court-supervised programme providing up to ten days of adventure camp activities. While the-then Deputy Prime Minister [[Paula Bennett]] claimed the programmes had succeeded in lowering offending among that group, this was disputed by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[John Key]]'s chief science adviser Sir [[Peter Gluckman]] in a 2011 report. The [[Superu|New Zealand Families Commission]] concluded that military camps and other measures such as curfews with electronic monitoring could not reduce re-offending on their own and that the most successful rehabilitation programmes involved the offenders' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boot camps tried and rejected - youth advocates|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/337099/boot-camps-tried-and-rejected-youth-advocates|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Gabrielle|title=Youth offenders - Programmes for young offenders|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/youth-offenders/page-4|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 August 2017, Prime Minister [[Bill English]] promised to establish a boot camp known as the "Junior Training Academy" for youth offenders at the [[Waiouru Military Camp]] during the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 election campaign]]. English clarified that the camp would be for small group of around 150 young offenders who had committed serious offenses including serious assault, sexual assaults, aggravated robbery and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Special bootcamp for youth offenders at Waiouru army camp, under National|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/95727988/special-bootcamp-for-youth-offenders-at-waiouru-army-camp-under-national|accessdate=14 August 2017|agency=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, youth Justice advocacy group JustSpeak director Katie Bruce criticized the proposed boot camp policy and argued that it would do little to curb re-offending among young offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5:22 am today Boot camps tried and rejected - youth advocates|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/337099/boot-camps-tried-and-rejected-youth-advocates|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; National's proposed policy was criticized by the radio host [[Mark Sainsbury (broadcaster)|Mark Sainsbury]], [[The Opportunities Party]] leader [[Gareth Morgan (economist)|Gareth Morgan]], the [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]], and the [[University of Canterbury]] psychologist and author Jarrod Gilbert, who contended that the policy was aimed at enticing voters rather than helping youth offenders and that previous boot camp programmes had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sainsbury|first1=Mark|title=Mark Sainsbury: National's bootcamp policy is for voters, not offenders|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/mark-sainsbury-national-s-bootcamp-policy-is-for-voters-not-offenders.html|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[Newshub]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satherley|first1=Dan|title=Boot camps don't work - Gareth Morgan, crime expert|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/boot-camps-don-t-work-gareth-morgan-crime-expert.html|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=Newshub|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boot camp policy was also criticized by both National's support partner, the [[Māori Party]], and the opposition [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] for doing little to address youth offending within the [[Māori people|Māori]] and the [[Pacific Islander#New Zealand|Pasifika]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Nicholas|title=Maori Party: National's boot camp plan an 'attack on Maori and Pasifika children'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11903919|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]], the leader of National's support partner the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]], criticized the boot camp policy as a sign of the Government's failure to tackle "broken families" and youth crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Audrey|title=Act's David Seymour calls out National's law and order policy|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11903379|accessdate=14 August 2017|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first boot camps appeared in the states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Oklahoma]] in 1983. Boot camps are intended to be less restrictive than prison but harsher than [[probation]].

In most U.S. states participation in boot camp programs is offered to young first-time offenders in place of a prison term or [[probation]]; in some states{{Where|date=July 2011}} a youth can also be [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to participate in such a program. The time served can range from 90 to 180 days, which can make up for prison sentences of up to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://problemwithteens.com/helping-troubled-teens/troubled-teen-boot-camps-2/|title=Troubled Teen Boot Camps - Problem with Teens, Troubled teens, help for troubled teens|work=problemwithteens.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140329093203/http://problemwithteens.com/helping-troubled-teens/troubled-teen-boot-camps-2/|archivedate=2014-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Federal shock incarceration programs are authorized under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/4046- 18 U.S.C. § 4046], although the placement requires consent of the prisoner.

In 1995, the U.S. federal government and about two-thirds of the 50 states were operating boot camp programs. Presently, there are no statistics as to how many boot camps there are in the U.S. today. In 2000, there were 51 boot camps still open.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/197018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of boot camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegebound.net/content/cat/types-of-boarding-schools/349/|title=Collegebound Network|work=collegebound.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some boot camps are more therapeutic. Boot camps such as West Ridge Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Windmeyer |first=Shane |url=http://www.collegebound.net/content/article/boarding-school-spotlight-west-ridge-academy/8574/ |title=Boarding School Spotlight: West Ridge Academy |publisher=Collegebound.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218215825/http://www.collegebound.net/content/article/boarding-school-spotlight-west-ridge-academy/8574/ |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in West Jordan, Utah offer a wide range of activities, academics, and boarding school treatment programs to give students a well-rounded education.

State run boot camps were banned in [[Florida]] on June 1, 2006 through legislation signed by [[Florida Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]] after 14-year-old [[Martin Lee Anderson]] died during his abidance in a boot camp. Anderson died as [[drill instructor]]s beat him and encouraged him to continue physical exercise after he had collapsed. While Anderson was unconscious, guards placed [[Smelling salts|ammonia tablets]] near his [[Human nose|nose]] in an attempt to revive him, and he suffocated. Anderson attended Bay County Boot Camp in [[Panama City, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=WJHG|title= Boot Camps Abolished in Florida|url=http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/2905871.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victory Forge Military Academy]] in Florida has come under intense scrutiny of its methods, which border on physical abuse. The camp's defense is that the parents had signed a contract authorizing the use of physical force against their children.

==Alternatives==
Boot camps claim to remove children "from environments filled with negative influences and triggering events that produce self-defeating, reckless or self-destructive behavior". Other types of programs (see  [[outdoor education]], [[adventure therapy]], and [[wilderness therapy]]) use this method while avoiding all or some of the controversial methods of boot camps, and they claim lower [[recidivism]].

The '''Burning of Edinburgh''' in 1544 by an English sea-borne army was the first major action of the war of [[the Rough Wooing]]. A Scottish army observed the landing on 3 May 1544 but did not engage with the English force. The [[Provost of Edinburgh]] was compelled to allow the English to sack [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]]. However, the Scottish artillery within [[Edinburgh Castle]] harassed the English forces, who had neither the time nor the resources to besiege the Castle. The English fleet sailed away loaded with captured goods, and with [[Salamander of Leith|two ships]] that had belonged to [[James V of Scotland]].

==The Plan==
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Henry VIII]]
[[Henry VIII of England]] wished to unite the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], or at least bring the kingdom under his hegemony. He had contracted with the [[Regent Arran]] that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] would marry his son, [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]]. But Arran allowed the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to revoke this agreement prompting Henry to declare war in December 1543, and now the Regent was making ground against his rebels who still supported the English marriage, such as the [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox|Earl of Lennox]], [[William Cunningham, 4th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]], the [[Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassillis]] and the [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus|Earl of Angus]]. These nobles were in touch with Henry VIII via Lennox's secretary Thomas Bishop and Angus's chaplain, Master John Penven. Their letters to Henry VIII requested intervention, and in March he replied that a 'main army' was in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Calendar, Marquis of Salisbury, Hatfield House'', vol. 1 (1883), nos.101, 133, 134, 135: Haynes (1740), pp.19, 20: ''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), preface, identifies Penven as Angus's chaplain.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's Privy Council issued his instructions for the invasion force on 10 April 1544, and they were to;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon (them) for their falsehood and disloyalty."&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, Marcus, ''The Rough Wooings'', Tuckwell (2000), 144 from ''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2, p.326 ''Letters &amp; Papers'', vol.19 part 1, no.314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], at this time called [[Earl of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] was the King's Lieutenant of this Army Royal. He had considered establishing an English garrison at [[Leith]] but the Privy Council vetoed this plan. Henry VIII had also asked him to destroy [[St Andrews]], but Lord Hertford pointed out the extra distance would be troublesome.
[[File:Edward Seymour.jpg|thumb|140px|Hertford]]
Hertford discussed with Privy Council the possibility of Scottish allies capturing [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] during his invasion. Henry VIII believed that Beaton, a favourer of the [[Auld Alliance]] with France, was particularly responsible for the rejection of the marriage plan. Beaton's would-be kidnappers included [[James Kirkcaldy of Grange]], [[Norman Leslie (soldier)|Norman Leslie Master of Rothes]], and John Charteris who offered to attempt to capture the Cardinal as he travelled in [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]]. Their second scheme was to attack [[Arbroath]] while attention was focussed on Edinburgh. This offer was made by [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] who sent a messenger called Wishart to Lord Hertford.&lt;ref&gt;''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5, part IV cont., (1836), 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Time was too short to offer military support for these plans, but if those concerned would join in the destruction of Church property they would be offered asylum in England and £1000 to fund their action.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Salisbury, Hatfield'', vol.1 (1883), p.36 no.36: Haynes, Samuel, ed., ''A Collection of State Papers'', vol. 1 (1740), p.32: the Scottish agent conducting this negotiation in London was called 'Wishart.'&lt;/ref&gt; Any schemes more elaborate than a punitive raid on Edinburgh were shelved as Henry VIII committed resources to the [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544–1546)|siege of Boulogne]] in France already planned for the summer.

==Supplies==
The army assembled at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Gateshead]]. In April 1544, [[Christopher Morris (Master of the Ordnance)|Sir Christopher Morris]] reported to Lord Hertford that he had organised munitions for the invasion at [[Berwick upon Tweed]]. These included;
* 2 batard [[culverin]]s
* 3 [[Saker (cannon)|sakers]]
* 8 falcons
* a [[Falconet (cannon)|falconette]]
* 4 carriages with two [[Breech-loading swivel gun|'bases']] on each
* 3000 bows, 1000 ready strung in 60 chests
* 4000 sheaves of arrows in 80 chests
* 4 barrels of bow strings; described further as 40 [[Gross (unit)|gross]] of 12 dozen, i.e., 5,760 strings
* 480 [[Pike (weapon)|Moorish pikes]]
* 3000 [[Bill (weapon)|Bills]]
Anthony Neville of South Leverton was appointed Surveyor General of Victuals for the army.&lt;ref&gt;Bindoff, Stanley T., et al ed., ''The House of Commons: 1509 - 1558, part 1, Appendices, constituencies, members A - C'', vol. 4 (1982), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
Edward Shelley (who was one of the first English soldiers to be killed at the [[battle of Pinkie]]) reported that he had 40 thousand-weight of biscuit on 20 April. At Berwick, Shelley had problems getting enough coal or wood for baking and brewing. He had to ask permission to impress more supplies and hold sales to rotate his stock.&lt;ref&gt;HMC: ''Report on the Manuscripts of the Most Honourable the Marquess of Bath, at Longleat, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967), pp.60-63.&lt;/ref&gt; 4000 border horsemen waited at Berwick for Hertford's signal. At first it was planned that they would make a diversionary attack on [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]]. Their commander [[William Eure, 1st Baron Eure|Ralph Eure]] wrote from [[Alnwick Castle|Alnwick]] on 28 April that these 'countrymen' were so poor he had to lend them money.&lt;ref&gt;''HMC, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967),p.64-5&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked for 1000 Yorkshire archers as reinforcement so that they could come to Edinburgh to support the landing. In the event, it was agreed that Hertford would summon Eure when he had disembarked his troops. When Eure's men arrived in Edinburgh they would get their pay.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters and Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), nos. 464, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orders for the fleet===
Orders for the fleet at [[Tynemouth]] were given on 28 April. All the ships were to be ready to weigh anchor at a favourable wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the [[Vanguard (military formation)|'vaward', the vanguard]], would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship ([[Ralph Sadler]] was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the [[Mast (sailing)|main-top mast]] of the ''Rose Lion'' with two night lights on the [[Shroud (sailing)|shrouds]]. The [[Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]], captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a [[cresset]] light in the [[poop deck]] at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2 (1892), pp.354-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==
On 23 April 1544, all Scottish east coast towns were warned to entrench their bounds to resist the English navy. Men from neighbouring counties were summoned to muster in Edinburgh on 5 May. Extra gunners were hired for Edinburgh Castle, and Regent Arran's goods and the [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|royal tapestries]] were carried up the [[Royal Mile]] from Holyroodhouse to the Castle and watched by his wardrobe servant Malcolm Gourlay. In the previous month an Edinburgh merchant James Johnston of Coates was paid £22 for going to "find out the Englishmen's purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/accountslordhig00unkngoog ''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, HM General Register House (1908)] lv-lix, pp.276, 289-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgh records are mostly missing for the year, so there is no detailed information on any defence measures provided by the town. The English account mentions that the Scots had cast great trenches and ditches to defend Leith.&lt;ref&gt;''An English Garner: Tudor Tracts'', (1903), p.41 re-printing, ''The Late Expedition in Scotland, 1544'', London (1544)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The landing==
An account of the episode was published later in 1544 in London as; ''The Late Expedition in Scotland made by the King's highness' army under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Earl of Hertford in 1544.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Late Expedition in Scotland made by the King's highness' army under the conduct of the Right Honourable the Earl of Hertford in 1544.'' Reynold Wolf, London (1544); reprinted in ''Tudor Tracts'' (1903), pp.38-51.&lt;/ref&gt; A later account by Mary's secretary [[Claude Nau]] records the fleet burning [[St Monans|St Mynettes]] on the north side of the [[River Forth|Forth]] and taking fishing boats for landing-craft.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Joseph ed., ''The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau, Edinburgh'', (1883), 318, 338-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Knox]] gave an account of the landing from another Scottish viewpoint. The English fleet was sighted before noon on Saturday. Knox said that [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] dismissed the threat and sat calmly at dinner. At 6pm there were 200 ships and an English pilot sounded the depths between Granton and Leith. Though experts could see this meant the English minded to land still there was no Scottish response. At daybreak on Sunday some of the smaller boats nosed onto land at [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton Crags]] and the troops landed using these as piers for the larger boats. According to Knox, when around 10,000 men were landed unchallenged the Cardinal and [[Regent Arran]] left Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, John, ''History of the Reformation'', Book 1, see external links for an edition: Claude Nau has "Wendy" meaning "Wardie" east of Granton.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. Ninian's Manse, North Leith.JPG|thumb|180px|'''St Ninian's Chapel at the Bridgend''' was burnt in May 1544. The attached manse still stands.]]
The English account is similar, but mentions the presence of five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith. The Cardinal was with this army but after a few shots and only a couple of casualties on either side, the Scots abandoned their position at the ford of a stream, leaving their eight cannon. (Lisle said two slings and three serpentines were placed to fire across the river, agreeing with Lee's plan).&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1908), no.481, Lisle to Paget.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earls of [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|Huntly]] and [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray (1501 creation)|Moray]] also left the field. Hertford's own dispatch describes this as a half hour fight, "right sharply handled on both parts," with [[Jane Meutas|Peter Mewtas]]'s [[Arquebus|hagbuters]] giving good service.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers,'' vol.19 part 1 (1908), no.472.&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiral reported that Beaton stayed until he was in range of the handguns. He was wearing a frock of yellow velvet, cut and pulled out with white tinselled sarcenet.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers, Spain'', vol.7, (1899), no.86, Admiral to Paget, 8 May 1544: the description of the Cardinal's costume was translated into French; "Le cardinal y estoit en ung beau chamar de velour iausne tout couppé et deschiquetté bien soigneusement comme à ung tel prelat appartient.", no.88 &amp; note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stand before Leith itself gave some resistance, but folded after three expert Scottish gunners were killed by arrows. Hertford summoned Eure and the border horsemen with a brief note mentioning the lack of resistance, signed from the field on the west of Leith.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), no.464.&lt;/ref&gt; The English then entered Leith unopposed, where they found two ships that had belonged to James V, the ''[[Salamander of Leith]]'' and the ''Unicorn.'' Some buildings in Leith were burnt, including St Ninian's chapel at the Bridge-end.&lt;ref&gt;'Calendar of Charters &amp; other writs', ''PSAS'' (1907), p.327 no.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Their overnight security was increased by recently constructed defensive entrenchments. Next day, Monday 5 May, the larger English ships were able to unload the heavier artillery on the quayside of the Shore of Leith. these guns were to be used against Edinburgh's gates and the castle.&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903),40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Beaton left the area on Monday, the date recorded in his accounts for hiring a guide between [[Corstorphine]] and [[Stirling]], (a journey then more usually made by boat).&lt;ref&gt;''Rentale Sancti Andree'', SHS (1913), p.180&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eustace Chapuys]], on the same day the Cardinal's enemy [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] tried to meet Hertford at Leith, but an English guard shot him with an arrow in the leg. However, Hertford wrote that Brunstane was in the field with Arran and retreated with him to [[Linlithgow]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol.7 (1899), no.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus|Earl of Angus]], [[George Douglas of Pittendreich]] and [[Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell|Lord Maxwell]] were in prison at [[Blackness Castle]] and Edinburgh Castle because they supported the English alliance. Arran, Guise and the Cardinal now ordered their release so their supporters would help their cause. Maxwell later wrote that they were offered cash inducements, with incomes from church lands and pensions from the [[Francis I of France|King of France]].&lt;ref&gt;''State Papers Henry VIII'', vol.5 (1836), pp.428-229, the Confession of Lord Maxwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edinburgh==
[[File:Holyrood Palace 1544.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of '''Richard Lee's''' sketch showing the Palace of Holyroodhouse, English troops entering the [[Canongate]] and an English position on [[Calton Hill]]]]

[[William Stourton, 7th Baron Stourton|William Stourton]] (later commander of the Newhaven fort at [[Ambleteuse]]) was left in charge of Leith on 6 May with 1,500 men while the main force approached Edinburgh itself. They were met by the Provost [[Adam Otterburn]] and two heralds. Otterburn offered to give up the keys of the town on conditions. Hertford refused to accept as he had no authority to bargain. Another English herald went to the Castle, and returned with the news that the Earl of Huntly and [[George Home, 4th Lord Home|Lord Home]] had brought 2000 horsemen to defend the town.

[[Christopher Morris (Master of the Ordnance)|Sir Christopher Morris]] was then ordered to bring his artillery up [[the Canongate]] to assault Edinburgh's Netherbow Gate. During this operation some of the English gunners were killed. The infantry attacked the gate and, according to the English narrative, pulled one of the Scottish artillery pieces through its gunloop. The Scots could not retaliate due to heavy small arms fire and archery, during which Morris placed a cannon close to the gate. After three or four rounds, the gate was breached and the English army stormed through killing 300 or 400 defenders. The Scottish exchequer accounts record that their heavy guns were withdrawn from the High Street into the Castle.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8, HM General Register House (1908), p.291.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, according to a report sent to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the English troops who were unused to urban warfare fought amongst each other, and [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|William Howard]], brother of the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], was hurt in the cheek by an English arrow.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers, Spain'', vol.7, (1899), no. 89, French copy of Imperial newsletter.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Royal Mile, the central main street of Edinburgh, the English were exposed to the artillery of the Castle. They attempted to place their cannon above the Butter-Tron, between Lawnmarket and Castlehill. A shot from the Castle dismounted one English cannon, and Hertford ordered it to be deliberately burst. At the end of that day, the English retired from the town to their camp at Leith after starting a number of fires.

On 7 May, the fire-raising and looting continued, in the town and at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], and the English force was joined by Ralph Eure's 4000 border horsemen. [[Nicholas Poyntz]] was sent to burn [[Kinghorn]] and villages on the north of the [[river Forth]]. The fortress on the island of [[Inchgarvie]] was captured and destroyed by [[Richard Brooke (Norton)|Richard Brooke]] in the ''[[List of early warships of the English navy|Galley Subtile]]'' on 6 May. (Hertford mentioned in his dispatch that it would have been useful to garrison Inchgarvie, but his orders from Henry VIII would not allow it.)

Christopher Morris shipped the larger artillery, the ships sailed, and on 14 May the harbour and piers of Leith were demolished. Hertford, as the King's Lieutenant, knighted fifty-eight of his captains and his servant Thomas Fisher distributed three pounds and fifteen shillings amongst the men.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Marquis of Bath, Longleat, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The army left Leith by land on 15 May, stopping to burn [[Seton Palace]] and Haddington.&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903), pp.41-45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edinburgh Castle==
[[File:Edinburgh Castle 1544.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of '''Richard Lee's''' sketch showing [[Edinburgh Castle]] with an English siege gun before David's Tower]]
Although Hertford's army entered the town with little resistance, the defenders of the castle led by the Captain, James Hamilton of Stenhouse kept up an artillery barrage, firing down the line of the Royal Mile. The Clerk of the King's Works, [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Richard Lee]], who was Captain of the Pioneers on this expedition and the Surveyor of Calais, William Burgate, declared the castle impregnable.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the King's Works'', vol. 3, HMSO (1975), 357: ''Letters &amp; Papers'', vol.19, 327, 468, 483-4: ''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2 (1892), p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Castle gunners was [[Andrew Mansioun]], a French carver who had made fittings for the ''Unicorn'', the yacht of James V and furniture for the royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pearce, 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', ''Regional Furniture'' vol. XXXII (2018), pp. 127-136.&lt;/ref&gt; His hand was injured when a cannon backfired, and in June 1544 he was given 44 shillings to pay for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 8 (1908), 127, 143, 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Repairs were made in July 1544, when two of the gunners, Tibault Roqueneau and Piers Schouffene (French or Flemish, originally employed at [[Dunbar Castle]]) were working to improve the gun emplacements with [[gabion]]s. The fore-wall of the castle was strengthened and repaired from July. This work was completed between July and August 1546 by three masons and four workmen (called barrowmen in the accounts).&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High treasurer of Scotland'', vol.8 (1908), pp.304, 305, 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting==
Hertford estimated the value of goods in Leith at £10,000.  This included a large stock of three grades of linen cloth from Brittany. The ships were loaded with property seized in Edinburgh and Leith. He also took the ''Salamander'' and ''Unicorn'', loading them with 80,000 cannon balls for ballast from the [[John Chisholm (soldier)|King's Wark]] arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;''Tudor Tracts'', (1903), 44: ''Hamilton Papers'', vol.2 (1892), p.378 no.238, "canvas, [[Douarnenez|polldavies (Pouldavid linen)]], olromes, other linen cloths," perhaps sail-cloth.&lt;/ref&gt; One surviving captured item is the [[Dunkeld Lectern]], removed from [[Holyrood Abbey]] before the English soldiers fired the church. The lectern may have come into the possession of [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Sir Richard Lee]] who made plans of Edinburgh and Leith and assessed the strength of Edinburgh Castle. Lee certainly took a brass font from Holyrood which he gave to [[St Albans Abbey]]. He had it engraved with an inscription claiming that it was used for the baptism of the Kings of Scotland. As a relic of the monarchy it was destroyed during the [[English civil war]]. [[Longleat House]] has a manuscript copy of a translation of [[Hector Boece]]'s ''Chronicle of Scotland'', taken by [[John Thynne]], Hertford's steward, from [[Holyroodhouse]] on Wednesday 7 May 1544.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers &amp; Seton, 'Bellenden's translation of Boece' in ''SHR'', vol. 9, no.75 (April 1922), p.198: [http://www.christies.com/special_sites/longleat/article.asp?sale=1&amp;article=4 Longleat's Libraries Christie's]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Hertford's muster lists survive at Longleat. These include the name of Sir William Norris of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;HMC, ''Manuscripts of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat, Seymour Papers'', vol.4, HMSO (1967), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; It has traditionally been asserted that carved panelling at his house of [[Speke Hall]] came from the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] though this has been challenged on stylistic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/arch_scot_vol_004/04_001_014.pdf Whatton, William Robert, 'An Inquiry into the probability of a Tradition connected with the Library and Furniture of James IV of Scotland, and of their having been carried off after the Battle of Flodden, and set up at Speke Hall, in the county of Lancaster', ''Archaeologia Scotia'', vol.4, (1857), pp.1-14] (no knowledge of the Longleat muster)&lt;/ref&gt; At Speke there were legal books including [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato|''Bartolus sup. primi degestis veteris'']], Venice (1499) and [[Panormitanus|''Panormitanus on the Decretals'']], Lyon (1501), with [[Robert Estienne]]'s Bible (1532). William Norris wrote in each volume that they were won at Edinburgh on 8 May 1544.  The books passed to the library of the [[Liverpool Athenaeum]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Clark Pidgeon|Pidgeon, H. C.]], ''Proceedings and Papers of the Historical Society of Liverpool and Cheshire'', vol.1&amp;2, (1855), p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Duff, E., 'Some Scottish book-bindings', ''Scottish Historical Review'', vol.4 no.16 (July 1907), p.432.&lt;/ref&gt; They were returned to Edinburgh in 2008 when the [[National Library of Scotland]] bought the collection. Inscriptions show they belonged to the [[Abbot of Cambuskenneth]], who had a lodging on the south side of the Lawnmarket.&lt;ref&gt;See external links&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burnt places==
The returning English army burnt a number of settlements. The destruction was described by [[Walter Lynne]] in his appendix to [[Johann Carion]]'s ''Cronicles'', (1550); "burnyng and destroyeng the countrey about, sparyng nether castel, towne, pyle nor vyllage, untyll they had overthrowen and destroyed many of them, as the borough and towne of Edenborough with the Abbey called Holy Rodehouse, and the kynges Palice adjoyned to the same. The towne of Lyth also with the haven and peyre. The castell and vyllage of Cragmyller, the Abbay of Newbottell, and parte of Muskelborowe towne, the Chappel of our lady of Lawret. Preston towne, and the castell Hatintowne wyth the Freres and Nunery, and castell of [[Oliver Sinclair|Oliuer Sancklers]], the towne of Dunbar, Laurestone wyth the Graunge, with many other townes, castels, vyllages and pyles."&lt;ref&gt;Carion, John, ''Thre Bokes of Cronicles'', (1550), p.cliii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
News spread quickly throughout Europe, though [[Nicholas Wotton]] at [[Speyer]] had to show the importance of Edinburgh as the capital of Scotland using the chronicles of [[Hector Boece]] and [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers, Henry VIII'', vol.19 part 1 (1903), no.556&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from the physical destruction, a recent historian of the conflict [[Marcus Merriman]] concluded that the army, "really did little of any long-term effect."&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, Marcus, ''The Rough Wooings'', Tuckwell (2000), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Edinburgh was not again threatened by the war, rebuilding was a slow process. New buildings were built on the exact site of their predecessors. Tenure of the Edinburgh lands was complex with numbers of owners claiming incomes from sub-divided buildings, with some portions 'mortified' to the chaplains of altars. At the end of the war, in September 1551 and February 1552 Parliament laid down guidelines for sharing the burden of costs for re-building the burnt lands and tenements "brint be the auld inimies of Ingland."&lt;ref&gt;''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland,'' vol. 3 (1814), pp.489-491.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertford, as the King's lieutenant knighted the men listed below. The names of his captains are recorded in pay-books and muster lists preserved at [[Longleat House]]. A book of 'conduct money' notes where the captains came from, e.g., Hugh Chomley from [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire]] with 100 men, paid for travelling 130 miles to Edinburgh and back, William Norris from [[Speke Hall|Liverpool]], John Markham from Cottham near [[Retford]], Nottinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;''HMC, Seymour Papers'', vol.4 (1967), pp.66-7, 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knighted on Sunday, 11 May, at Leith;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">The '''Combs method''' is a method of writing [[fuzzy logic]] rules described by [[William E. Combs]] in 1997. It is designed to prevent [[combinatorial explosion]] in fuzzy logic rules.

The Combs method takes advantage of the [[propositional logic|logical]] equality &lt;math&gt;((p \land q) \Rightarrow r) \iff ((p \Rightarrow r) \lor (q \Rightarrow r))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Equality proof ==
The simplest proof of given equality involves usage of truth tables:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;p \land q \Rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q \Rightarrow r&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;(p \Rightarrow r) \lor (q \Rightarrow r)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| T || T || F || F || F || F || F 
|-
| T || F || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| T || F || F || T || F || T || T 
|-
| F || T || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| F || T || F || T || T || F || T 
|-
| F || F || T || T || T || T || T 
|-
| F || F || F || T || T || T || T 
|}

== Combinatorial explosion ==
Suppose we have a fuzzy system that considers N variables at a time, each of which can fit into at least one of S sets. The number of rules necessary to cover all the cases in a traditional fuzzy system is &lt;math&gt;S^N&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the Combs method would need only &lt;math&gt;S \times N&lt;/math&gt; rules. For example, if we have five sets and five variables to consider to produce one output, covering all the cases would require 3125 rules in a traditional system, while the Combs method would require only 25 rules, taming the [[combinatorial explosion]] that occurs when more inputs or more sets are added to the system.

This article will focus on the Combs method itself. To learn more about the way rules are traditionally formed, see [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy associative matrix]].

== Example ==
Suppose we were designing an [[artificial personality]] system that determined how friendly the personality is supposed to be towards a person in a strategic video game. The personality would consider its own fear, trust, and love in the other person. A set of rules in the Combs system might look like this:
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3"
! Fear
| Unafraid THEN Enemies || Moderate Fear THEN Neutral || Afraid THEN Good Friends
|-
! Trust
| Distrusting THEN Enemies || Moderate Trust THEN Neutral || Trusting THEN Good Friends
|-
! Love
| Unloving THEN Enemies || Moderate Love THEN Neutral || Loving THEN Good Friends
|}

The table translates to:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Fear IS Unafraid THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Fear IS ModerateFear THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Fear IS Afraid THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 OR
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Trust IS Distrusting THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Trust IS ModerateTrust THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Trust IS Trusting THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 OR
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;IF Love IS Unloving THEN Friendship IS Enemies OR
  IF Love IS ModerateLove THEN Friendship IS Neutral OR
  IF Love IS Loving THEN Friendship IS GoodFriends&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In this case, because the table follows a straightforward pattern in the output, it could be rewritten as:
{| align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3"
! Fear
| Unafraid || Moderate Fear || Afraid
|-
! Trust
| Distrusting || Moderate Trust || Trusting
|-
! Love
| Unloving || Moderate Love || Loving
|-
! Friendship

Each column of the table maps to the output provided in the last row. To obtain the output of the system, we just average the outputs of each rule for that output. For example, to calculate how much the computer is Enemies with the player, we take the average of how much the computer is Unafraid, Distrusting, and Unloving of the player. When all three averages are obtained, the result can then be [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] by any of the traditional means.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">The balance of '''Competing goods''' is a philosophical problem involving the acknowledgement of multiple social values that may at times conflict with one another.

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] invokes [[Aristotle]] in her discussions of the problem, writing that "[T]he Aristotelian agent scrutinizes each valuable alternative, seeking out its distinct nature. She is determined to acknowledge the precise sort of value or goodness present in each of competing alternatives, seeing each value, so to speak, as a separate jewel in the crown, valuable in its own right, which does not cease to be separately valuable just because the contingencies of the situation sever it from other goods and it loses out in an overall rational choice.";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The failure of corporate law: fundamental flaws and progressive possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEKqN8QMONsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=The+failure+of+corporate+law:+fundamental+flaws+and+progressive+possibilities+competing+goods+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006|page=226|ISBN=978-0-226-30693-3|author=Kent Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Aristotle saw that "the values that are constitutive of a good human life are plural and incommensurable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4C-maGgYk0C&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=Competing+goods+nussbaum+aristotle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=03wSTPeXAcWonAevtvWRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=|author=James Jasinski|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|ISBN=978-0-7619-0504-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum has argued that [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] were mistaken when they dismissed conflicts of obligation as illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leading lives that matter: what we should do and who we should be|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqEMy6RbF4sC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22competing+goods%22+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22competing%20goods%22%20nussbaum&amp;f=false|year=2006|author=Mark R.

'''Damiano Damiani''' (23 July 1922&amp;nbsp;– 7 March 2013) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[screenwriter]], [[film director]], [[actor]] and writer. Poet and director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] referred to him as "a bitter moralist hungry for old purity", while film critic [[Paolo Mereghetti]] said that his style made him "the most American of Italian directors".&lt;ref name=corr&gt;{{cite news|last=Paolo Mereghetti|title=Addio a Damiano Damiani|url=http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/13_marzo_07/regista-damiani-morto_4849a770-8777-11e2-82ae-71d5d7252090.shtml|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 Damiano Damiani became part of the so-called Group of Venice with [[Fernando Carcupino]], [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Dino Battaglia]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Pasiano di Pordenone]], [[Friuli]], Damiani studied at the [[Accademia di Brera]] in [[Milan]], then made his début in 1947 with the documentary ''La banda d'Affari''.

His 1962 film ''[[Arturo's Island (film)|Arturo's Island]]'' won the [[Golden Shell]] at the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Lino Micciché, ''Storia del cinema italiano''. Edizioni di Bianco &amp; nero, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s were Damiani's "golden decade"; he was praised by critics and his films were box office successes.&lt;ref name=sta&gt;{{cite news|title=Morto il regista Damiano Damiani|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2013/03/07/spettacoli/morto-il-regista-damiano-damiani-LaDej9jiBc9wGLpL14yWVL/pagina.html|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 he directed one of the most famous Italian television series, ''[[La piovra]]'', a description of the contemporary [[Sicilian Mafia|Italian Mafia]] and its involvement in politics.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; His last feature film was ''Assassini dei giorni di festa '', directed in 2002.

==Character background==
===Season 1 and 2===
In the Enchanted Forest, David was originally a poor [[shepherd]] whose twin brother James was given to King George as an heir in a deal with Rumplestiltskin. From an internal story chronology we first encounter him when he meets Anna of Arendelle, whom he tells he is a friend of Kristof, and we find him being terrorized by the evil Little Bo Peep.

When James, his twin brother, is killed in battle, David takes his brother's name in exchange for the prosperity of his mother's farm. King Midas declares David fit to marry his daughter Abigail and unite the kingdoms. However, David wants to marry for love, but George vows to kill his mother if he declines.&lt;ref name="S01E06"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/once-upon-a-time-the-shepherd-65911 |title=Once Upon A Time: 'The Shepherd' |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |first=Oliver |last=Sava |date=December 4, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He falls in love with Snow White, who nicknames him '''Charming''', later inviting her to run away. After continuous interceptions by George, the Evil Queen Regina captures him to convince Snow to willingly eat an apple containing a sleeping curse. He later awakens her and the pair marry, before Regina announces that she will cast a curse to destroy their happiness. Rumplestiltskin informs them that their child will break the curse in 28 years. Emma is born before the curse takes hold, and Charming places her in a magical wardrobe to protect her from the curse, before being wounded by the Queen's knights.

In Storybrooke, as a result of his wounds, he first appears as a John Doe, who has gone unidentified for years. He awakens after Mary Margaret (Snow White) reads him their story. He reunites with his wife Kathryn (Princess Abigail), and is identified as '''David Nolan'''. David suffers from amnesia and cannot remember his fake life with Kathryn. He falls in love with Mary Margaret and begins an affair with her, ending his marriage to Kathryn, who is soon reported as being murdered, a plan arranged between Regina Mills and Mr. Gold. David becomes a suspect in her disappearance, until evidence against Mary Margaret is found. Kathryn is found alive, though David's relationship with Mary Margaret becomes strained, as he did not believe her innocence. He decides to move to Boston, though the curse is broken shortly after, and he reunites with Snow and Emma. David agrees to send a wraith released into Storybrooke through a portal, though Emma and Mary Margaret are dragged with it. David looks after Henry while Emma and Mary Margaret are absent.&lt;ref name="S02E01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-prudom/once-upon-a-time-premiere-recap_b_1926331.html|title='Once Upon A Time' Season Premiere Recap: Magic Returns And Brings New Danger In 'Broken'|first=Laura|last=Prudom|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=September 30, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing attempts of transportation, David falls under a sleeping curse to communicate with Mary Margaret. He is awoken by true love's kiss when the two return. When Henry is kidnapped to Neverland, David travels with his family and friends to rescue him from Peter Pan.

===Season 3 and 4===
In Neverland, David is poisoned by Dreamshade,&lt;ref name="S03E02"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-2/ 'Once Upon a Time' recap: Doubt: A Parable] by Hilary Busis, from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (October 6, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; though Hook partially cures him and the group successfully return to Storybrooke where Mr. Gold fully heals him. After Pan enacts the original curse once more, David is returned to his original world with the remaining inhabitants, while Emma and Henry escape to New York City.

Back in the Enchanted Forest, David learns that Snow is pregnant but also discovers that Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West wants their baby. The two enact a new curse to return to Storybrooke and make Emma stop Zelena. David insists Snow crush his heart, though she later asks Regina to split her heart in two to give to both of them. Zelena adds a forgetting potion to the curse, removing their memories of the past year. A year later, Emma returns to Storybrooke, and David and Mary Margaret reveal they are having a baby. Zelena poses as the couple's mid-wife, stealing a symbol of David's courage from him.&lt;ref name="S03E14"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-14/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: Fear Itself"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (March 23, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Zelena is ultimately defeated and Mary Margaret gives birth to a son, whom she names after Henry's father and Rumplestiltkin's son, Neal. Following the Queens of Darkness's arrival in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret and David battle to keep their secret (being the reason Maleficent lost her child) from Emma. However, they eventually tell Emma the truth, who finds it hard to forgive them. After Mary Margaret is almost killed by Maleficent's daughter Lily, Emma reunites with her parents, although this is short lived when Emma sacrifices herself to become the new Dark One. With the other residents, Mary Margaret transports to the Enchanted Forest, taking Emma to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove her darkness. However, weeks later, they return to Storybrooke with missing memories as to how they failed. In "Siege Perilous", David is [[knight]]ed by King Arthur ([[Liam Garrigan]]) and bestowed the Siege Perilous seat at the [[Round Table]].&lt;ref name="Siege Perilous"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Siege Perilous|episodelink=|series=Once Upon a Time|serieslink=Once Upon a Time (TV series)|airdate=October 11, 2015|season=5|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later gives this up when he learned of Arthur's deception, which would later result in David having Arthur arrested in Storybrooke.

===Season 5===
After Emma restored his memory, David followed his daughter to the Underworld to help rescue Hook, only to learn that his late twin brother James is the Sheriff in this realm and discovered from Cruella de Vil that James has resentment against David over being raised by their mother and having a family that James envies. When the two finally meet for the first time, David attempted to explain to James (who still believed he was the "Prince") over what happened back in the Enchanted Forest, but James cut to the chase and used a stun gun on David, and pretended to play "Shepherd" in a scheme to help him and Cruella escape the Underworld by tricking Emma into finding the location of where Robin Hood was keeping Zelena's baby. When James attempted to send Emma and Robin to the River of Lost Souls at the harbor, David stopped James and tried to convince him that he can be at peace and move on, but James continued to believe that killing David was his unfinished business. James attempted to pull a knife to kill David but he missed and is sent into the water, where he was consumed by the lost souls. As David watched this unfold, Emma told her father that despite his effort to save him, it was too late for James anyway.

===Season 6===
Once the Evil Queen return to Storybrooke chaos erupted but David and his family tried to continue to have a normal life but this is short lived when the Evil Queen threatens the town with water from the River of Lost Souls unless Snow and David give up their hearts which they do. However, instead of killing them the Evil Queen puts a sleeping curse on their shared heart so when one is awake, the other will remain asleep so now Snow and David cannot be together but they try to adjust to life without each other. It was revealed that while David believed his father was a drunk who died because of his behavior, David's father Robert rescued James after James ran away from King George. When Robert asked to take James back because James was unhappy, King George ordered the father killed causing David to almost kill King George but is later stopped by Hook. Hook after given permission by David to marry Emma finds out he killed the men who were supposed to kill the father, and he killed Robert because "dead men tell no tales."

==Character development and reception==
Prior to landing the role on the series, Dallas was cast in 2011 as [[Fandral]] in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' after Irish actor [[Stuart Townsend]] withdrew from the role days before filming was to begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://movies.ign.com/articles/105/1059835p1.html | title = Thor Finds a New Fandral | accessdate =April 13, 2011 | first= Jim |last=Vejvoda| date =January 10, 2011  | publisher= IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a308139/three-more-stars-join-once-upon-a-time.html | title =Three more stars join 'Once Upon A Time' | accessdate =July 24, 2011  | first= Catriona|last=Wightman| date =March 10, 2011  | publisher= [[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dallas did not reprise his role in the sequel to ''Thor'' due to his commitments in ''Once Upon a Time''. [[Zachary Levi]] replaced him in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zachary-levi-thor-2-cast-josh-dallas-335401 |title='Thor 2' Eyes 'Chuck' Star Zachary Levi (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creators also mixed Charming's history with that of ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'',&lt;ref name="ModernWorld"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Joshua Dallas]], [[Edward Kitsis]], [[Adam Horowitz]] |date=2011 |title=Fairy Tales in the Modern World | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] |location=''Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season'' Disc 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Dallas portraying both the original Prince and the Pauper who replaced his brother after he was killed. Because of this history, Dallas tried to bring a "rural" feel to the character to make him more accessible to viewers.&lt;ref name="ModernWorld" /&gt; On what makes his portrayal of Prince Charming different to those before, Dallas explained that "Prince Charming just happens to be a name. He's still a man with the same emotions as any other man. He's a Prince, but he's a Prince of the people. He gets his hands dirty. He's got a kingdom to run. He has a family to protect. He has an epic, epic love for Snow White. He's like everybody else. He's human."

Dallas subsequently began dating his ''Once Upon a Time'' co-star Goodwin in fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ginnifer-goodwin-and-josh-dallas-make-red-carpet-debut-as-a-couple-2012144 |title=Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas make red carpet debut as a couple |publisher=usmagazine.com |date=April 14, 2012|accessdate=April 14, 2012|first=Zach|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dallas and Goodwin became engaged in October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20744536,00.html|title=Ginnifer Goodwin Engaged to Josh Dallas|work=People|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013|first=Julie|last=Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married on April 12, 2014 in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/Ginnifer-Goodwin-Marries-Josh-Dallas|title=Ginnifer Goodwin Marries Josh Dallas|work=People|date=April 13, 2014|accessdate=May 30, 2014|first=Sarah|last=Michaud}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one child, a son, born in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/ginnfer-good-win-josh-dallas-baby-boy|title=Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas Are Parents of Baby Boy|work=People|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=May 30, 2014|first=Julie|last=Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dot cancellation test'''  or '''Bourdon-Wiersma test''' is a commonly used test of combined [[visual perception]] and [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laursen|first=Peter|title=Functions and Parameterization|url=http://www.crs.dk/function.html|work=Cognitive Function Scanner|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akinwuntan /&gt;

The test has been used in the evaluation of [[stroke]] where subjects were instructed to cross out all groups of 4 dots on an A4 paper. The numbers of uncrossed groups of 4 dots, groups of dots other than 4 crossed, and the time spent (maximum, 15 minutes) were taken into account.&lt;ref name=Akinwuntan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akinwuntan AE, De Weerdt W, Feys H, Baten G, Arno P, Kiekens C |title=The validity of a road test after stroke |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=421–6 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15759222 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2004.04.047 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group-Bourdon test, a modification of the Bourdon-Wiersma, is one of a number of [[psychometrics|psychometric]] tests which trainee [[Railroad engineer|train driver]]s in the UK are required to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group-Bourdon tool|url=http://www.digital-reality.org.uk/|publisher=Digital Reality|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nijenhuis|first=J|author2=Vanderflier, H|title=The correlation of g with attentional and perceptual-motor ability tests|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=19 July 2002|volume=33|issue=2|pages=287–297|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00152-0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 March 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The test is based on the work of French psychologist [[Benjamin B. Bourdon]] (1860–1943) and Dutch neurologist {{illm|Enno Dirk Wiersma|nl}} (1858–1940).&lt;ref&gt;Ono H, Lillakas L, Kapoor A, Wong I, 2013, "Replicating and extending Bourdon’s (1902) experiment on motion parallax" Perception 42(1) 45 – 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://universal_lexikon.deacademic.com/216409/Bourdon-Test&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth le Despenser''' (c. 1327 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1389) was an English noblewoman. She was the youngest daughter of [[Hugh Despenser the Younger|Hugh le Despenser the younger]] and his wife [[Eleanor de Clare]].&lt;ref name=lundy&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lundy|first=Darryl|title = The Peerage: Elizabeth le Despencer|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2570.htm#i25698|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is famous for being the favourite of [[Edward II of England]], and being executed as a result of his position and actions. Through her mother, Elizabeth was a great granddaughter of [[King Edward I of England]].

==Early life==
The exact date of her birth is disputed; it is possible that she (or her brother John) was born in December 1325. She may have been born to her mother sometime after her [[Hugh le Despenser the Younger#Trial and execution|father's death]], as she was not forced to take the veil like three of her older sisters. Not much else is known about her youth until August 1338, when she was sent to the care of her maternal aunt [[Elizabeth de Clare]] after her mother Eleanor's death the previous year.&lt;ref name=SH&gt;Higginbotham, Susan. [http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/Elizabeth%20le%20Despenser.htm "Elizabeth le Despenser"]; retrieved 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and later life==
In August 1338, she married [[Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley]], who was ironically a grandson of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]], the man largely responsible for the execution of Elizabeth's father [[Hugh le Despenser the Younger|Hugh]]. She and her husband had seven children:

* [[Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley|Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Lord Berkeley]] (born 5 January 1352/53 – 13 July 1417); married [[Baron Lisle|Margaret de Lisle, Baroness Lisle]]
* Sir James de Berkeley (born c. 1355 – 13 June 1405), married Elizabeth Bluet; sired [[James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley]]
* John de Berkeley (born c. 1357–1381)
* Maurice de Berkeley (born c. 1358; death date unknown), married Jane Hereford
* Catherine de Berkeley (born c. 1360; death date unknown)
* Agnes de Berkeley (born c. 1363; death date unknown)
* Elizabeth de Berkeley (born c. 1365; death date unknown)

==Death==
Elizabeth le Despenser, Baroness Berkeley died on 13 July 1389. She was buried at [[St Botolph's Aldgate]], London, England.&lt;ref name=lundy/&gt;

'''Enlightenment''' is the "full comprehension of a situation".&lt;ref group="web" name="merriam-webster1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enlightenment |title=enlightenment - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used to denote the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{refn|group=note|"Mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance and error."{{sfn|Porter|2001|p=1}}}} but is also used in Western cultures in a religious context. It translates several Buddhist terms and concepts, most notably ''[[bodhi]]'',{{refn|group=note|When referring to the Enlightenment of the Buddha (''samma-sambodhi'') and thus to the goal of the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist path]], the word ''enlightenment'' is normally translating the Pali and Sanskrit word ''[[bodhi]]''}} ''[[kensho]]'' and ''[[satori]]''. Related terms from Asian religions are ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation) in [[Hinduism]],  ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' in [[Jainism]], and ''ushta'' in [[Zoroastrianism]].

In Christianity, the word "enlightenment" is rarely used, except to refer to the Age of Enlightenment and its influence on Christianity. Roughly equivalent terms in Christianity may be [[Illuminationism|illumination]], [[kenosis]], [[metanoia (theology)|metanoia]], [[revelation]], [[salvation]] and [[Religious conversion|conversion]].

[[Perennial philosophy|Perennialists]] and [[Universalism|Universalists]] view enlightenment and [[mysticism]] as equivalent terms for religious or spiritual insight.

==Western understanding==
In the Western world the concept of ''enlightenment'' in a religious context acquired a [[Romanticism|romantic]] meaning. It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[True self and false self|true self]], which is being regarded as a substantial essence which is covered over by social conditioning.{{refn|group=note|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was an important influence on the development of this idea. See for example [[Rajneesh#Ego and the mind|Osho's teachings]] for a popularisation of this idea.}}

===As 'Aufklärung'===
{{Main article|Age of Enlightenment}}

The use of the Western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p = 181-183}}

===Awakening: Historical period of renewed interest in religion===
The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context,&lt;ref&gt;J. Rixey Ruffin, ''A Paradise of Reason: William Bentley and Enlightenment Christianity in the Early Republic'', 0195326512, 9780195326512, 9781435620407 Oxford University Press 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[Great Awakening]]s, several periods of [[Christian revival|religious revival]] in [[Religion in the United States|American religious history]]. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

===Illumination===
{{Main article|Divine illumination}}

Another equivalent term is [[Illuminationism]], which was also used by Paul Demieville in his work ''The Mirror of the Mind'', in which he made a distinction between "illumination subie" and "illumination graduelle".{{sfn|Demieville|1991}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; Illuminationism is a [[doctrine]] according to which the process of human thought needs to be aided by divine grace. It is the oldest and most influential alternative to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in the [[theory of mind]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/illumination/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an important feature of ancient [[Greek philosophy]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[medieval philosophy]], and in particular, the Illuminationist school of [[Islamic philosophy]].

[[Augustine]] was an important proponent of Illuminationism, stating that everything we know is taught to us by God as He casts His light over the world,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://churchandpomo.typepad.com/conversation/2008/11/illumination-an.html ''Illumination and Enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "The mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside itself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself the nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord," &lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' IV.xv.25&lt;/ref&gt; and "You hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' X.ii.2&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's version of illuminationism is not that God gives us certain information, but rather gives us insight into the truth of the information we received for ourselves.

===Romanticism and transcendentalism===
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

This romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by [[D.T. Suzuki]].&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf Robert H. Sharf, ''Whose Zen?

Its History and Method]&lt;/ref&gt; Further popularization was due to the writings of [[Heinrich Dumoulin]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-B}}&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/McRaeIntroduction.pdf Critical introduction by John McRae to the reprint of Dumoulin's ''A history of Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes [[anatta]].{{sfn|Dumonlin|2000}} This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of [[Ken Wilber]].{{sfn|Wilber|1996}}

In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p = 116-124}}&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/nlarc/Pruning_the_bodhi_tree.htm Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://meaningness.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/effing-the-ineffable/ David Chapman: Effing the ineffable]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
{{main article|Religious experience}}

A common reference in Western culture is the notion of "enlightenment ''experience''". This notion can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p = 47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

It was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th-century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p = 3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}

It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p = 12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p = 30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}} would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 284}}

Nevertheless, the notion of religious experience has gained widespread use in the study of religion,{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 246-289}} and is extensively researched.{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 246-289}}

==Asian cultures and religions==

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}
The English term  "enlightenment" has commonly been used to translate several Sanskrit, Pali,&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&amp;query=enlightenment&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese and Japanese terms and concepts, especially ''[[bodhi]]'', ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'', ''[[satori]]'' and [[buddhahood]].

''Bodhi'' is a [[Theravada]] term. It literally means "awakening" and "understanding". Someone who is awakened has gained insight into [[Four Noble Truths|the workings of the mind]] which keeps us imprisoned in craving, suffering and [[Saṃsāra|rebirth]],&lt;ref group="web" name="merriam-webster1" /&gt; and has also gained insight into [[Noble Eightfold Path|the way]] that leads to ''[[nirvana]]'', the liberation of oneself from this imprisonment.

''Prajna'' is a [[Mahayana]] term. It refers to insight into our true nature, which according to [[Madhyamaka]] is [[Sunyata|empty]] of a personal essence in the stream of experience. But it also refers to the ''[[Tathāgata-garbha]]'' or [[Buddha-nature]], the essential basic-consciousness beyond the stream of experience.

In [[Zen]], ''kensho'' means "seeing into one's true nature".{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} ''Satori'' is often used interchangeably with ''kensho'', but refers to the ''experience'' of ''kensho''.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

Buddhahood is the attainment of full awakening and becoming a [[Buddha]]. According to the Tibetan [[Thubten Yeshe]],&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=508 Lama Yeshe]&lt;/ref&gt; enlightenment full awakening; buddhahood. The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, attained when all limitations have been removed from the mind and one's positive potential has been completely and perfectly realized. It is a state characterized by infinite compassion, wisdom and skill.&lt;ref group=web name=lamayeshe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=static&amp;subsect=glossary#enlightenment|title=Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive|location=Lincoln, MA, USA |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Indian religion]]s ''moksha'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}} ''{{IAST|mokṣa}}''; liberation) or ''mukti'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|मुक्ति}}; release —both from the root ''{{IAST|muc}}'' "to let loose, let go") is the final extrication of the [[soul]] or consciousness (''purusha'') from ''[[samsara]]'' and the bringing to an end of all the [[suffering]] involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and  [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] ([[reincarnation]]).

====Advaita Vedanta====
{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Advaita}}

''Advaita Vedanta'' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: अद्वैत वेदान्त {{IPA-sa|əd̪ʋait̪ə ʋeːd̪ɑːnt̪ə|}}) is a [[List of philosophical concepts|philosophical concept]] where followers seek liberation/release by recognizing identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman) through long preparation and training, usually under the guidance of a [[guru]], that involves efforts such as knowledge of scriptures, renunciation of worldly activities, and inducement of direct identity experiences. Originating in India before 788 AD, Advaita Vedanta is widely considered the most influential{{sfn|Indich|1995}} and most dominant&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/GB.htm ''Gandhi And Mahayana Buddhism'', Journal of Oriental Studies 35:2 (1996), pp. 84-105 (accessdate=2011-06-10)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zelliot|1980}} sub-school of the [[Vedānta]] (literally, ''end or the goal of the [[Vedas]]'', [[Sanskrit]]) school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{sfn|Deutsch|1988}} Other major sub-schools of [[Vedānta]] are ''{{IAST|[[Vishishtadvaita|Viśishṭādvaita]]}}'' and ''[[Dvaita]]''; while the minor ones include [[Suddhadvaita]], [[Dvaitadvaita]] and [[Achintya Bhedabheda]].

''Advaita'' (literally, ''[[non-dual]]ity'') is a system of thought where "Advaita" refers to the identity of the Self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') and the Whole ([[Brahman]]).{{refn|group=note|"Brahman" is not to be confused with [[Brahma]], the Creator and one third of the [[Trimurti]] along with [[Shiva]], the Destroyer and [[Vishnu]], the Preserver.}} Recognition of this identity leads to liberation. Attaining this liberation takes a long preparation and training under the guidance of a guru.

The key source texts for all schools of Vedānta are the [[Prasthanatrayi]]—the canonical texts consisting of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahma Sutras]]. The first person to explicitly consolidate the principles of Advaita Vedanta was [[Adi Shankara|Shankara Bhagavadpada]],{{sfn|Collinson|1994}} while the first historical proponent was [[Gaudapada]], the guru of Shankara's guru [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]].

=====Philosophical system=====
Shankara systematized the works of preceding philosophers.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p = 680}} His system of Vedanta introduced the method of scholarly exegesis on the accepted metaphysics of the Upanishads. This style was adopted by all the later Vedanta schools.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Shankara's synthesis of Advaita Vedanta is summarized in this quote from the {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}}, one of his {{IAST|[[Adi Shankara#Prakaraṇa graṃtha|Prakaraṇa graṃthas]]}} (philosophical treatises):{{refn|group=note|The authorship of this work is disputed. Most 20th-century academic scholars feel it was not authored by Sankara, and [[Sacchidanandendra Saraswati|Swami Sacchidanandendra Saraswathi]] of Holenarsipur concurs.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;In half a couplet I state, what has been stated by crores of texts;&lt;br/&gt;
that is [[Brahman]] alone is real, the world is mithyā (not independently existent),&lt;br/&gt;
and the individual self is nondifferent from Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Shankara, Vivekacūḍāmaṇi&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{IAST|slokārdhena pravaksāmi yaduktaṃ granthakotibhih, brahma satyaṃ jagat mithyā, jīvo brahmaiva nāparah}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Neo-Vedanta=====
{{Main article|Hindu reform movements|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

In the 19th century, Vivekananda played a major role in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p = 191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta".{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}

In a talk on "The absolute and manifestation" given in at London in 1896 [[Swami Vivekananda]] said,
{{quote|I may make bold to say that the only religion which agrees with, and even goes a little further than modern researchers, both on physical and moral lines is the Advaita, and that is why it appeals to modern scientists so much. They find that the old dualistic theories are not enough for them, do not satisfy their necessities. A man must have not only faith, but intellectual faith too".&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Jnana-Yoga/The_Absolute_and_Manifestation |title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 2/Jnana-Yoga/The Absolute and Manifestation - Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2011-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193348/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Jnana-Yoga/The_Absolute_and_Manifestation| archivedate= 28 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vivekananda emphasized [[samadhi]] as a means to attain liberation.{{sfn|Comans|1993}} Yet this emphasis is not to be found in the Upanishads nor in Shankara.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p = 307}} For Shankara, meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman,{{sfn|Comans|1993}} not the highest goal itself:
{{quote|[Y]oga is a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness. This approach is different from the classical yoga of complete thought suppression.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}}}

Vivekenanda's modernisation has been criticized:{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}
{{quote|Without calling into question the right of any philosopher to interpret Advaita according to his own understanding of it, [...] the process of Westernization has obscured the core of this school of thought. The basic correlation of renunciation and Bliss has been lost sight of in the attempts to underscore the cognitive structure and the realistic structure which according to Samkaracarya should both belong to, and indeed constitute the realm of māyā.{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

=====Neo-Advaita=====
{{Main article|Neo-Advaita}}

''Neo-Advaita'' is a [[new religious movement]] based on a modern, Western interpretation of [[Advaita Vedanta]], especially the teachings of [[Ramana Maharshi]].{{sfn|Lucas|2011}} Neo-Advaita is being criticized{{sfn|Marek|2008|p = 10, note 6}}{{refn|group=note|Marek: "Wobei der Begriff Neo-Advaita darauf hinweist, dass sich die traditionelle Advaita von dieser Strömung zunehmend distanziert, da sie die Bedeutung der übenden Vorbereitung nach wie vor als unumgänglich ansieht.

It can even be termed 'pseudo' because, by presenting the teaching in a highly attenuated form, it might be described as purporting to be Advaita, but not in effect actually being so, in the fullest sense of the word.

====Yoga====
{{Main article|Yoga}}

The prime means to reach moksha is through the practice of yoga ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli]]: {{lang|inc|[[:wikt:योग|योग]]}}, /ˈjəʊɡə/, ''{{IAST|yoga}}'') is a commonly known generic term for [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], and [[soul|spiritual]] disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]].{{sfn|Baptiste|2011}}{{sfn|Yogani|2011}} Specifically, yoga is one of the six ''[[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]'' ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. It is based on the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]]''. Various traditions of yoga are found in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].{{sfn|Lardner Carmody|1996|p = 68}}{{sfn|Sarbacker|2005|p = 1–2}}{{refn|group=note|Tattvarthasutra [6.1]{{sfn|Doshi|2007}}}}

Pre–philosophical speculations and diverse ascetic practices of first millennium BCE were systematized into a formal philosophy in early centuries CE by the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''.{{sfn|Whicher|1998|p = 38–39}} By the turn of the first millennium, [[Hatha yoga]] emerged as a prominent tradition of yoga distinct from the Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutras''. While the ''Yoga Sutras'' focus on discipline of the mind, Hatha yoga concentrates on health and purity of the body.{{sfn|Larson|2008|p = 139–140}}

Hindu monks, beginning with [[Swami Vivekananda]], brought yoga to the West in the late 19th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a physical system of health exercises across the Western world. Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma and heart patients. In a national survey, long-term yoga practitioners in the United States reported musculo–skeletal and mental health improvements.{{sfn|Birdee|2008}}

=====Jnana yoga=====
{{Main article|Jnana yoga}}

Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of ''jnana yoga'', a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]]. It consists of four stages:{{sfn|puligandla|1997|p = 251-254}}&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/cjw/cjw05.htm|title=The Crest Jewel of Wisdom|last=Shankara|first=Adi|others=Charles Johnston (Trans.)|pages=Ch. 1|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Bhakti yoga=====
{{Main article|Bhakti}}

The paths of ''bhakti yoga'' and ''karma yoga'' are subsidiary.

In bhakti yoga, practice centers on the worship God in any way and in any form, like [[Krishna]] or [[Ayyappa]]. Adi Shankara himself was a proponent of devotional worship or ''[[Bhakti]]''. But Adi Shankara taught that while Vedic sacrifices, ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' and devotional worship can lead one in the direction of ''jnana'' (true knowledge), they cannot lead one directly to ''[[moksha]]''. At best, they can serve as means to obtain moksha via shukla gati.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=====Karma yoga=====
{{Main article|Karma yoga}}

Karma yoga is the way of doing our duties, in disregard of personal gains or losses. According to Sri Swami Sivananda,
{{quote|Karma Yoga is consecration of all actions and their fruits unto the Lord. Karma Yoga is performance of actions dwelling in union with the Divine, removing attachment and remaining balanced ever in success and failure.

Karma Yoga is selfless service unto humanity. Karma Yoga is the Yoga of action which purifies the heart and prepares the Antahkarana (the heart and the mind) for the reception of Divine Light or attainment of Knowledge of the Self. The important point is that you will have to serve humanity without any attachment or egoism.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/karmayoga.htm Sri Swami Sivananda, ''Karma Yoga'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Jainism===
{{Main article|Jainism|Kevala Jnana|Mahavira}}

Jainism ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|n|ɪ|z|əm}}; {{lang-sa|जैनधर्म}} ''{{IAST|Jainadharma}}'', {{lang-ta|சமணம்}} ''Samaṇam'', {{lang-bn|জৈনধর্ম}} ''{{IAST|Jainadharma}}'', {{lang-te|జైనమతం}} ''{{IAST|Jainamataṁ}}'', {{lang-ml|ജൈനമതം}} ''Jainmat'',  {{lang-kn|ಜೈನ ಧರ್ಮ}} ''{{IAST|Jaina dharma}}''), is an [[Indian religions|Indian religion]] that prescribes a path of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|non-violence]] towards all [[Jiva|living beings]]. Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the [[Jiva|soul]] toward divine consciousness and [[Moksa (Jainism)|liberation]]. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a ''jina'' ("conqueror" or "victor"). The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called [[siddha]]. Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as ''[[shramana]] dharma'' (self-reliant) or the "path of the [[nirgrantha|nirgantha]]s" (those without attachments or aversions).

In [[Jainism]] highest form of pure knowledge a soul can attain is called [[Kevala Jnana]] ( Sanskrit : केवलज्ञान )or Kevala Ṇāṇa (Prakrit : केवल णाण).  which means “absolute or perfect” and Jñāna, which means "knowledge". Kevala is the state of isolation of the jīva from the ajīva attained through ascetic practices which burn off one's karmic residues, releasing one from bondage to the cycle of death and rebirth. Kevala Jñāna thus means infinite knowledge of self and non-self, attained by a soul after annihilation of the all  [[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|ghātiyā karmas]]. The soul which has reached this stage achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] or liberation at the end of its life span.

[[Mahavira]], 24th thirthankara of Jainism, is said to have practised rigorous austerities for 12 years before he attained enlightenment,

{{quote|During the thirteenth year, in the second month of summer, in the fourth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Vaisakha, on its tenth day, when the shadow had turned towards the east and the first wake was over, on the day called Suvrata, in the Muhurta called Vigaya, outside of the town Grimbhikagrama on the bank of the river Rjupalika, not far from an old temple, in the field of the householder Samaga, under a Sal tree, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism [[Nakshatra#Nakshatra descriptions|Uttara Phalguni]], (the Venerable One) in a [[squatting position]] with joined heels, exposing himself to the heat of the sun, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, being engaged in deep meditation, reached the highest knowledge and intuition, called Kevala, which is infinite, supreme, unobstructed, unimpeded, complete, and full.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}}}

Kevala Jñāna is one of the five major events in the life of a [[Tirthankara]] and is known as Jñāna Kalyanaka and supposedly celebrated by all gods. Mahavira’s Kaivalya was said to have been celebrated by the demi-gods, who constructed the [[Samosarana]] or a grand preaching assembly for him.

==Western culture==
===Christianity===
{{See also|Religious conversion|Divinization (Christian)}}

The word "enlightenment" is not generally used in Christian contexts for religious understanding or insight. More commonly used terms in the Christian tradition are [[religious conversion]] and [[revelation]].

[[Lewis Sperry Chafer]] (1871–1952), one of the founders of [[Dispensationalism]], uses the word "[[illuminism]]". Christians who are "illuminated" are of two groups, those who have experienced true illuminism (biblical) and those who experienced false illuminism (not from the Holy Spirit).{{sfn|Chafer|1993|p = 12–14}}

Christian interest in eastern spirituality has grown throughout the 20th century. Notable Christians, such as [[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle]] and [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], have participated in Buddhist training and even become Buddhist teachers themselves. In a few places Eastern contemplative techniques have been integrated in Christian practices, such as centering prayer.&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.centeringprayer.com/ Contemplative Outreach: Centering Prayer]&lt;/ref&gt; But this integration has also raised questions about the borders between these traditions.&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.innerexplorations.com/ewtext/chen.htm Inner Explorations: Christian Enlightenment?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western esotericism and mysticism===
{{Main article|Mysticism|Western esotericism|Perennial philosophy}}
Western and Mediterranean culture has a rich tradition of [[esotericism]] and [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}} The [[Perennial philosophy]], basic to the [[New Age]] understanding of the world, regards those traditions as akin to [[Eastern religions]] which aim at awakening/ enlightenment and developing wisdom. The hypothesis that all mystical traditions share a "common core",{{sfn|Hood|2001|p = 32}} is central to New Age, but contested by a diversity of scientists like Katz and Proudfoot.{{sfn|Hood|2001|p = 32}}

[[Judaism]] includes the mystical tradition of [[Kabbalah]]. [[Islam]] includes the mystical tradition of [[Sufism]]. In the [[Fourth Way]] teaching, enlightenment is the highest state of Man (humanity).{{sfn|Ouspensky|year unknown}}

===Nondualism===
{{Main article|Nondualism|New Age|Syncretism|Neo-Advaita}}

A popular western understanding sees "enlightenment" as "nondual consciousness", "a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object".&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://undividedjournal.com/about-the-journal/ Undivided Journal, ''About the Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is used interchangeably with Neo-Advaita.

This nondual consciousness is seen as a common stratum to different religions. Several definitions or meanings are combined in this approach, which makes it possible to recognize various traditions as having the same essence.{{sfn|Katz|2007}} According to Renard, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of "the Real"{{sfn|Renard|2010|p = 59}}

This idea of nonduality as "the central essence"{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p = iii}} is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements.{{refn|group=note|See McMahan, "The making of Buddhist modernity"{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and Rambachan, "The Limits of Scripture: Vivekananda's Reinterpretation of the Vedas"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} for descriptions of this mutual exchange.}} Western predecessors are, among others, [[New Age]],{{sfn|Hanegraaf|1996}} [[Ken Wilber|Wilber's]] synthesis of western psychology and Asian spirituality, the idea of a [[Perennial Philosophy]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Eastern influences are the [[Hindu reform movements]] such as [[Shri Aurobindo|Aurobindo's]] Integral Yoga and [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Advaita Vedanta#Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta]], the [[Vipassana movement]], and [[Buddhist modernism]]. A truly syncretistic influence is [[Rajneesh|Osho]]{{sfn|Swartz|2010|p = 306}} and the [[Rajneesh movement]], a hybrid of eastern and western ideas and teachings, and a mainly western group of followers.{{sfn|Aveling|1999}}

==Cognitive aspects==
===Religious experience as cognitive construct===
"Religious experiences" have "evidential value",{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} since they confirm the specific worldview of the experiencer:{{sfn|Yandell|1994}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}
{{quote|These experiences are ''cognitive'' in that, allegedly at least, the subject of the experience receives a reliable and accurate view of what, religiously considered, are the most important features of things. This, so far as their religious tradition is concerned, is what is most important about them. This is what makes them "salvific" or powerful to save.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=18}}}}

Yet, just like the very notion of "religious experience" is shaped by a specific [[discourse]] and [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]], the "uniformity of interpretation"{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 259}} may be due to the influence of religious traditions which shape the interpretation of such experiences.{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 259}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Berger|1990}}{{sfn|Yandell|1994}}

===Various religious experiences===
Yandell discerns various "religious experiences" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the "evidential value" they present.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 19-23}} Yandell discerns five sorts:{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 23-31}}
# [[Numinous]] experiences – [[Monotheism]] (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic, Sufi Islam){{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 24-26}}
# [[Nirvana|Nirvanic]] experiences – [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|yandell|1994|p = 24-25, 26-27}} "according to which one sees that the self is but [[Anatta|a bundle of fleeting states]]"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 24-25}}
# [[Kevala Jnana|Kevala]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 30}} – [[Jainism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} "according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}}
# [[Moksha]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 29}} – Hinduism,{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} Brahman "either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}}
# Nature mystical experience{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 30}}

===Cognitive science===
{{Main article|Cognitive science|Cognitive science of religion}}

Various philosophers and cognitive scientists state that there is no [[True self and false self|"true self"]] or a "little person" ([[homunculus]]) in the brain that "watches the show," and that consciousness is an [[Emergent properties|emergent property]] that arise from the various modules of the brain in ways that are yet far from understood.{{sfn|Dennett|1992}}{{sfn|Ramachandran|2012}}{{sfn|Damassio|2012}} According to Susan Greenfield, the "self" may be seen as a composite,{{sfn|Greenfield|2000}} whereas [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]] describes the sense of "I" as a result of cognitive process.{{sfn|Hofstadter|2007}}

This is in line with the Buddhist teachings, which state that
{{quote|[...] what we call 'I' or 'being,' is only a combination of physical and mental aggregates which are working together interdependently in a flux of momentary change within the law of cause and effect, and that there is nothing, permanent, everlasting, unchanging, and eternal in the whole of existence.{{sfn|Rahula|1959|p=66}}}}

To this end, Parfit called Buddha the "first [[Personal identity#The bundle theory of the self|bundle theorist]]".{{sfn|Parfit|1987}}

The idea that the mind is the result of the activities of neurons in the brain was most notably popularized by [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of DNA, in his book [[The Astonishing Hypothesis]].{{sfn|Crick|1994}}{{refn|group=note|Crick, after his work on DNA focused his remaining research activities on the brain basis of consciousness.}} The basic idea can be traced back to at least [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]]. According to Crick, the idea was not a novel one:
{{quote|[...] an exceptionally clear statement of it can be found in a well known paper by [[Horace Barlow]].{{sfn|Crick|1994}}}}

===Entheogens===
{{See also|Entheogen}}
Several users of entheogens [[Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record|throughout the ages]] have claimed spiritual enlightenment with the use of these substances, their use and prevalence through history is well recorded, and continues today.  In modern times we have seen increased interest in these practices, for example the rise of interest in [[Ayahuasca]]. The psychological effects of these substances have been subject to scientific research focused on understanding their physiological basis.

'''Fernando Amorsolo y Cueto''' (May 30, 1892 – April 24, 1972) was one of the most important artists in the history of painting in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="asianart"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hallman |first1=Tim |title=Pioneers of Philippine Art: Luna, Amorsolo, Zóbel |url=http://www.asianart.org/documents/AAMPoPAPRFINAL_000.pdf |publisher=Asian Art Museum |accessdate=8 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220101833/http://www.asianart.org/documents/AAMPoPAPRFINAL_000.pdf |date=11 August 2006 |archive-date=2012-02-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amorsolo was a portraitist and painter of rural Philippine landscapes.  He is popularly known for his craftsmanship and mastery in the use of light.&lt;ref name=NCCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Fernando C. Amorsolo |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/cultprofile/natarts/visual/amorsolo.php |publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts |accessdate=8 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060010/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/cultprofile/natarts/visual/amorsolo.php |archivedate=15 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Amorsolo was born on May 30, 1892, in [[Paco, Manila]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gale |first=Thomson|title=Dernando Amorsolo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography |date= |year=2005–2006 |publisher=Thomson Corporation |location= |id= |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/fernando-amorsolo/ |access-date=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mst&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Nickie|title=Introducing Fernando Amorsolo to a new generation|url=https://andronico.wordpress.com/2008/09/13/introducing-fernando-amorsolo-to-a-new-generation/|accessdate=8 October 2016|publisher=Manila Standard Today|date=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don [[Fabián de la Rosa]], his mother's cousin, was also a Filipino painter. At the age of 13, Amorsolo became an apprentice to De la Rosa, who would eventually become the advocate and guide to Amorsolo's painting career.  During this time, Amorsolo's mother embroidered to earn money, while Amorsolo helped by selling water color postcards to a local bookstore for 10 [[Philippine peso|centavos]] each. His brother, [[Pablo Amorsolo]], was also a painter.
Amorsolo's first success as a young painter came in 1908, when his painting ''Leyendo el periódico'' took second place at the ''Bazar Escolta'', a contest organized by the ''Asociacion Internacional de Artistas''. Between 1909 and 1914, he enrolled at the Art School of the Liceo de Manila.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After graduating from the Liceo, he entered the [[University of the Philippines]]' School of Fine Arts, where De la Rosa worked at the time. During college, Fernando Amorsolo's primary influences were the Spanish people court painter [[Diego Velázquez]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Anders Zorn]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], but mostly his contemporary Spanish masters [[Joaquín Sorolla Bastida]] and [[Ignacio Zuloaga]]. Amorsolo's most notable work as a student at the Liceo was his painting of a young man and a young woman in a garden, which won him the first prize in the art school exhibition during his graduation year. To make money during school, Amorsolo joined competitions and did illustrations for various Philippine publications, including Severino Reyes’ first novel in Tagalog language, ''Parusa ng Diyos'' ("Punishment of God"), Iñigo Ed. Regalado's ''Madaling Araw'' ("Dawn"), as well as illustrations for editions of the ''[[Pasyon|Pasion]]''. Amorsolo graduated with medals from the University of the Philippines in 1914.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Career==
{{unreferenced|1=section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Antipolo by Fernando Amorsolo.jpg|thumb|320px|''Antipolo'' by Fernando Amorsolo, depicting Filipinos celebrating a town ''[[Festival|fiesta]]''.]]
After graduating from the University of the Philippines, Amorsolo worked as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] for the Bureau of Public Works, as a chief artist at the Pacific Commercial Company, and as a part-time instructor at the University of the Philippines (where he would work for 38 years). After three years as an instructor and commercial artist, Amorsolo was given a grant to study at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Academia de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]], Spain by Filipino businessman [[Enrique Zobel de Ayala|Enrique Zóbel de Ayala]]. During his seven months in Spain, Amorsolo sketched at museums and along the streets of Madrid, experimenting with the use of light and color. Through the Zóbel grant, Amorsolo was also able to visit New York City, where he encountered postwar impressionism and cubism, which would be major influences on his work.

Amorsolo set up his own studio upon his return to Manila and painted prodigiously during the 1920s and the 1930s.  His ''Rice Planting'' (1922), which appeared on posters and tourist brochures, became one of the most popular images of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]].  Beginning in the 1930s, Amorsolo's work was exhibited widely both in the Philippines and abroad. His bright, optimistic, pastoral images set the tone for Philippine painting before World War II. Except for his darker World War II-era paintings, Amorsolo painted quiet and peaceful scenes throughout his career.

Amorsolo was sought after by influential Filipinos including Luis Araneta, Antonio Araneta and [[Jorge B. Vargas]]. Amorsolo also became the favourite Philippine artist of United States officials and visitors to the country. Due to his popularity, Amorsolo had to resort to photographing his works and pasted and mounted them in an album. Prospective patrons could then choose from this catalog of his works. Amorsolo did not create exact replicas of his trademark themes; he recreated the paintings by varying some elements.

His works later appeared on the cover and pages of children textbooks, in novels, in commercial designs, in cartoons and illustrations for the Philippine publications such ''The Independent'', ''Philippine Magazine'', ''Telembang'', ''El Renacimiento Filipino'', and ''Excelsior''. He was the director of the University of the Philippine's College of Fine Arts from 1938 to 1952.

During the 1950s until his death in 1972, Amorsolo averaged to finishing 10 paintings a month. However, during his later years, diabetes, cataracts, arthritis, headaches, dizziness and the death of two sons affected the execution of his works. Amorsolo underwent a cataract operation when he was 70 years old, a surgery that did not impede him from drawing and painting.

Amorsolo was a close friend of the Philippine sculptor [[Guillermo Tolentino]], the creator of the [[Caloocan City]] monument to the patriot [[Andrés Bonifacio]].

==Style and techniques==

[[File:Amorsolosketch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sketch of a woman, whose unfinished style is representative of Amorsolo's sketching]]

===Women and landscapes===
Amorsolo is best known for his illuminated landscapes,&lt;ref name=fih&gt;"Fernando Amorsolo". ''Filipinos in History''. Manila, Philippines: National Historical Institute. Available for download though [http://www.nhi.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=44&amp;func=select&amp;id=3 nhi.gov.ph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012243/http://www.nhi.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=44&amp;func=select&amp;id=3 |date=2007-09-27 }} (requires registration).&lt;/ref&gt; which often portrayed traditional Filipino customs, culture, fiestas and occupations. His pastoral works presented "an imagined sense of nationhood in counterpoint to American colonial rule" and were important to the formation of Filipino national identity.&lt;ref name="asianart"/&gt; 
He was educated in the classical tradition and aimed "to achieve his Philippine version of the Greek ideal for the human form."&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;  In his paintings of [[Filipina women]], Amorsolo rejected Western ideals of beauty in favor of Filipino ideals&lt;ref name=Paras/&gt; and was fond of basing the faces of his subjects on members of his family.&lt;ref name=Sylvia/&gt;

{{quote
|text= "[The women I paint should have] a rounded face, not of the oval type often presented to us in newspapers and magazine illustrations. The eyes should be exceptionally lively, not the dreamy, sleepy type that characterizes the Mongolian. The nose should be of the blunt form but firm and strongly marked. ... So the ideal Filipina beauty should not necessarily be white complexioned, nor of the dark brown color of the typical Malayan, but of the clear skin or fresh colored type which we often witness when we met a blushing girl."|sign= Fernando Amorsolo&lt;ref name=Paras/&gt;
}}

Amorsolo used natural light in his paintings and developed the [[backlight]]ing technique Chiaroscuro, which became his artistic trademark and his greatest contribution to Philippine painting.&lt;ref name=NCCA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobalPinoy&gt;{{cite web|title=Fernando C. Amorsolo (1892-1972)|url=http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_nationalartists_sub.php?name=Fernando%20C.%20Amorsolo%20(1892-1972)&amp;category=Visual%20Arts|website=GlobalPinoy.com|accessdate=30 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719042421/http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_nationalartists_sub.php?name=Fernando%20C.%20Amorsolo%20%281892-1972%29&amp;category=Visual%20Arts|archivedate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a typical Amorsolo painting, figures are outlined against a characteristic glow, and intense light on one part of the canvas highlights nearby details.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; Philippine sunlight was a constant feature of Amorsolo's work; he is believed to have painted only one rainy-day scene.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

===Sketches===
Amorsolo was an incessant [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] artist,&lt;ref name=Paras&gt;Paras-Perez, Rodriguez (1992). ''Fernando C. Amorsolo: Drawings''. Manila: Lopez Museum. {{OCLC|702602295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; often drawing sketches at his home, at [[Luneta Park]], and in the countryside.&lt;ref name=Sylvia/&gt;  He drew the people he saw around him, from farmers to city-dwellers coping with the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]].&lt;ref name="Paras"/&gt;  Amorsolo's impressionistic tendencies, which may be seen in his paintings as well, were at their height in his sketches.&lt;ref name="Paras"/&gt;  His figures were not completely finished but were mere "suggestions" of the image.&lt;ref name="Paras"/&gt;

===Historical paintings and portraits===
Amorsolo also painted a series of historical paintings on pre-Colonial and Spanish Colonization events.  Amorsolo's ''Making of the [[Philippine Flag]]'', in particular, was widely reproduced. His ''The First Baptism in the Philippines'' required numerous detailed sketches and colored studies of its elements.  These diverse elements were meticulously and carefully set by the artist before being transferred to the final canvas.   For his pre-colonial and 16th-century depiction of the Philippines, Amorsolo referred to the written accounts of [[Antonio Pigafetta]], other available reading materials, and visual sources He consulted with the Philippine scholars of the time, H. Pardo de Tavera and [[Epifanio de los Santos]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth. [http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/artscene_zeroin_amorsolo_01.html "Amorsolo's Brush with History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621094443/http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/artscene_zeroin_amorsolo_01.html |date=2007-06-21 }}. [[Lopez Memorial Museum]] (2003). Retrieved June 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amorsolo also painted oil portraits of [[President of the Philippines|Presidents]] like General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], and other prominent individuals such as Don Alfredo Jacób and Doña Pura Garchitorena Toral of [[Camarines Sur]]. He also painted the wedding picture of Don [[Mariano Garchitorena]] and Doña Caridad Pamintuan of [[Pampanga]].

He also did a portrait of American [[Senate of the United States|Senator]] [[Warren Grant Magnuson]] (1905–1989), of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from Washington, whom the [[Warren G. Magnuson Health Sciences Building]] at the University of Washington, and the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in Bethesda, [[Maryland]] are named after.

Here, a Filipino man defends a woman, who is either his wife or daughter, from being raped by an unseen Japanese soldier. Note the Japanese military cap at the man's foot]]

===World War II-era works===
After the onset of World War II, Amorsolo's typical pastoral scenes were replaced by the depictions of a war-torn nation. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, Amorsolo spent his days at his home near the Japanese [[garrison]], where he sketched war scenes from the house's windows or rooftop.&lt;ref name=Sylvia&gt;Amorsolo Lazo, Sylvia. [http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/main_reader5.html "Remembering Papa"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702045831/http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/main_reader5.html |date=2007-07-02 }}. [[Lopez Memorial Museum]] (2003). Retrieved June 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, he documented the destruction of many landmarks in Manila and the pain, tragedy and death experienced by Filipino people, with his subjects including "women mourning their dead husbands, files of people with pushcarts and makeshift bags leaving a dark burning city tinged with red from fire and blood."&lt;ref name="Ocampo"/&gt; Amorsolo frequently portrayed the lives and suffering of Filipina women during World War II. Other World War II-era paintings by Amorsolo include a portrait ''in absentia'' of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as well as self-portraits and paintings of Japanese occupation soldiers.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;  In 1948, Amorsolo's wartime paintings were exhibited at the [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang Presidential Palace]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
Amorsolo's supporters consider his portrayals of the countryside as "the true reflections of the Filipino Soul."&lt;ref name="benesa"&gt;Benesa, Leo. [http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/comarticles.php?artcl_Id=163 "An Amorsolo Festival"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055540/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/comarticles.php?artcl_Id=163 |date=2007-09-28 }} (originally from Philippine Sunday Express, November 16, 1975). ''What is Philippine about Philippine Art? and Other Essays'', Manila: National Commission for Culture and the Arts, 2000, pp. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amorsolo has been accused, however, of succumbing to commercialism and merely producing souvenir paintings for American soldiers.&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;  Critic [[Francisco Arcellana]] wrote in 1948 that Amorsolo's paintings "have nothing to say" and that they were not hard to understand because "there is nothing to understand."&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;  Critics have criticized Amorsolo's portraits of Philippine Commonwealth personalities, his large, mid-career anecdotal works, and his large historical paintings.&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;  Of the latter, critics have said that his "artistic temperament was simply not suited to generating the sense of dramatic tension necessary for such works."&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;

Another critic, however, while noting that most of Amorsolo's estimated ten thousand works were not worthy of his talent, argues that Amorsolo's oeuvre should nonetheless judged by his best works instead of his worst.&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;  Amorsolo's small landscapes, especially those of his early career, have been judged as his best works, "hold[ing] well together plastic-ally."&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;  Amorsolo may "be considered a master of the Philippine landscape as landscape, even outranking [[Juan Luna|Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Hidalgo]] who also did some Philippine landscapes of the same measurements."&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Amorsolo grave.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Amorsolo's grave in Marikina City]]

After being confined at the St. Luke's Hospital in Quezon City for two months, Amorsolo died of heart failure at the age of 79 on April 24, 1972.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Four days after his death, Amorsolo was honoured as the first [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist in Painting]] at the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] by then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The volume of paintings, sketches and studies of Amorsolo is believed to have reached more than 10,000 pieces.  Amorsolo was an important influence on contemporary Filipino art and artists, even beyond the so-called "Amorsolo school."&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt; Amorsolo's influence can be seen in many landscape paintings by Filipino artists, including early landscape paintings by abstract painter [[Federico Aguilar Alcuaz]].&lt;ref name="benesa"/&gt;

In 2003, Amorsolo's children founded the Fernando C. Amorsolo Art Foundation, which is dedicated to preserving Fernando Amorsolo's legacy, promoting his style and vision, and preserving a national heritage through the conservation and promotion of his works.&lt;ref name=Foundation&gt;[http://www.fernandocamorsolo.com/index.html "Fernando C. Amorsolo Art Foundation"]. FernandoAmorsolo.com. Retrieved July 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post-war period, Insular Life commissioned Amorsolo to create a series of paintings of historical events for their offices (and which were subsequently used in Insular Life calendars from '50s to '80s). [http://www.inopacan.blogspot.com/2010_06_01_archive.html].

===Amorsolo paintings in the art market===
At a 2001 auction in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], two original 1950s paintings by Amorsolo, ''The Cockfight'' and ''Resting Under the Trees'', were bought by a New Jersey collector for $36,000 and $31,500, respectively.&lt;ref name=BeePub&gt;[http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW0-01-16-2001-11-41-23 "Estate Sale Yields Fine Art, Furniture Gems in Wellesley, Mass."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213218/http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW0-01-16-2001-11-41-23 |date=2007-09-27 }} Antiques and the Arts online, January 16, 2001. Retrieved on July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2002 episode of [[Antiques Roadshow]], a [[Sotheby's]] antiques appraiser estimated that an attendee's signed 1945 rural landscape painting by Amorsolo could fetch between $30,000 and $50,000 at auction.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/roadshow/series/highlights/2002/neworleans/neworleans.html "New Orleans, LA (2002)"] (Antiques Roadshow program #619, Morial Convention Center, aired November 11, 2002).

On November 30, 2009, the '' Family Gathering Fruit'' sold for US$77,257 at Christie's.  In December 2009, ''Fruit Gatherer'' was auctioned off in [[Maryland]], in record-breaking manner, topping 19th- and 20th-century European and American paintings.  In May 2010, the highest priced Amorsolo painting was auctioned off at Christie's for about US$440,000.

Vargas Museum and Filipiniana Research Center]] in Manila displays a major collection of Amorsolo's work.&lt;ref name="CruzCollection"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruz|first1=Jasmine|title=The Vargas Museum permanent collection: Amorsolos and more|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Arts&amp;Leisure&amp;title=the-vargas-museum-permanent-collection-amorsolos-and-more&amp;id=101602|accessdate=6 September 2016|publisher=[[BusinessWorld]]|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Fernando Amorsolo became the first Filipino to be distinguished as the [[National Artists of the Philippines|Philippine's National Artist]] in Painting.  He was named as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art" during the [[inauguration]] of the [[Hilton Hotels|Manila Hilton]]'s art center, where his paintings were exhibited on January 23, 1969.

===Major exhibitions===
Outside the Philippines, his exhibitions were held in Belgium, at the Exposicion de [[Panama]] in 1914, at a one-man show at the [[Grand Central Art Galleries]] in New York City in 1925, and at the [[National Museum]] in Herran on November 6, 1948.  During the 1931 Paris Exposition, Amorsolo exhibited one of his anecdotal paintings, ''The Conversion of the Filipinos''.  Amorsolo's entries at the ''Exposicion'' in Panama were a portrait of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and the piece ''La Muerte de Socrates''.  At the 1948 National Museum in Herran, Amorsolo exhibition was sponsored by the Art Association of the Philippines. In 1950, Amorsolo exhibited two more  historical paintings, ''Faith Among the Ruins'' and ''Baptism of Rajah Humabon'' at ssthe Missionary Art Exhibit in Rome.  In 1979, Fernando Amorsolo's legacy as a painter was celebrated through an exhibition of his works at the Art Center of the Manila Hilton.&lt;ref name=fih/&gt;  His art was also featured in a 2007 exhibition in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfa.gov.ph/news/pr/pr2007/mar/pr112.htm "Havana Inaugurates Philippine Modern Exhibit."] Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, March 2, 2007. Retrieved August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{unreferenced|1=section|date=October 2016}}
During his lifetime, Amorsolo was married twice and had 20 children. In 1916, he married Salud Tolentino Jorge, with whom he had six children. Amorsolo's first wife died in 1931 leaving him with six children.  He had six more children by a common-law wife, named Virginia Guevarra Santos. Amorsolo have three children with her namely Manuel (followed in his father's footstep, with a degree in Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines), Jorge and Norma when he met his second wife. Subsequently, Virginia found an engagement ring in one of Amorsolo's drawers; she knew about Maria, that prompted her to leave his house with her three children. In 1935, he married Maria del Carmen who gave him eight more children. Among her daughters are [[Sylvia Amorsolo-Lazo]] and Luz. But as Maria was giving birth with his children, Virginia had three more children with Amorsolo. His reputation was growing as fast as his brood and his work was more than enough to provide for his rather large family. Six of Amorsolo's children became artists themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12578">{{For|the documentary film|The Fog of War}}

The '''fog of war''' ({{lang-de|links=no|Nebel des Krieges}}) is the [[uncertainty]] in [[situational awareness]] experienced by participants in  [[military operations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joint Service Command and Staff College]], Advanced Command and Staff Course Notes dated 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one's own capability, adversary capability, and adversary [[Intent (Military)|intent]] during an engagement, operation, or campaign. Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through [[military intelligence]] and friendly force tracking systems. The term is also used to define uncertainty mechanics in [[war gaming|wargames]].

== Origin ==
The word "fog" in reference to uncertainty in war was introduced by the [[Prussia]]n military analyst [[Carl von Clausewitz]] in his posthumously published book, ''[[On War|Vom Kriege]]'' (1832), which appeared in English translation in 1873 under the title ''On War'':

{{quote|War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.|Carl von Clausewitz&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Clausewitz, ''[http://slantchev.ucsd.edu/courses/ps143a/readings/Clausewitz%20-%20On%20War,%20Books%201%20and%208.pdf Vom Kriege]'', Book 1, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been pointed out that von Clausewitz does not use the exact phrase "fog of war," using multiple similar metaphors such as "twilight" and "moonlight" to describe lack of clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=On War Without the Fog| url=http://www.clausewitz.com/bibl/Kiesling-OnFog.pdf| author=Eugenia C. Kiesling| date=2001| publisher=Military Review| accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1896 when the exact phrase "fog of war" was used in text, described as "the state of ignorance in which commanders frequently find themselves as regards the real strength and position, not only of their foes, but also of their friends."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fog_of_War_by_Colonel_Lonsdale_Hale.html?id=zvlLMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y “The fog of war”], by Col. Lonsdale Hale, Royal Engineers (retired), Aldershot Military Academy, March 24, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military ==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
The fog of war is a reality in all military conflict. Precision and certainty are unattainable goals, but modern military doctrine suggests a trade off of precision and certainty for speed and agility. Militaries employ [[command and control]] (C2) systems and doctrine to partially alleviate the fog of war.

The term also applies to the experience of individual soldiers in battle: often cited is the pure confusion of direction, location, and perspective on a battlefield. Officers and soldiers become separated, orders become confused and subject to revision with poor communication. Sounds and vision are limited from the perspective of the individual and may not be easily resolved, resulting in a continuing uncertainty, a perceptual "fog".

The fog of war has been decreasing as [[intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance]] technology is improving. In 2016, [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] Gen. [[Mark A. Milley]] stated that "On the future [[battlefield]], if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours, you will be dead..With enemy drones and sensors constantly on the hunt for targets, there won’t even be time for four hours’ unbroken sleep."&lt;ref&gt;https://breakingdefense.com/2016/10/miserable-disobedient-victorious-gen-milleys-future-us-soldier/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulations and games ==
[[File:Richard III from Columbia Games.jpg|thumb|A [[block wargame]], Richard III by [[Columbia Games]], showing the fog of war in play.]]
Abstract and military [[board game]]s sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces, by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player (as in ''[[Stratego]]'') or covered (as in ''[[Squad Leader]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Squad Leader Rulebook'', 4th Edition, section 25.0.&lt;/ref&gt;). Other games, such as the ''[[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]]'' chess-[[Chess variants#Chess with incomplete information and/or elements of chance|variant]], playing pieces could be hidden from the players by using a duplicate, hidden game board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/incinf.dir/kriegspiel.html  Kriegspiel] by Hans L. Bodlaender.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of fog of war emulation is used by [[Block wargame|block wargaming]] where, much like ''Stratego'', the blocks face each player, hiding their value. However, this also allows for incremental damage, where the block is rotated up to four times to indicate battle damage before the unit is eliminated from the playing field.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Solitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls or card draws to determine events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lewis| last=Pulsipher |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmUY_RCnwgIC&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2012 |title=Game Design: How to Create Video and Tabletop Games, Start to Finish |work=McFarland |page= 227|isbn=0-786-46952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex double-blind [[miniature wargame]]s, including [[military simulation]]s, may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes, one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides, participants in the roles of sub-unit leaders, and the use of radio sets or intercoms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== In video games ===
[[File:Freeciv-net-screenshot-2011-06-23.png|thumb|In the computer game ''[[Freeciv]]'', completely unexplored areas are fully black, while currently unobserved areas are covered in a grey shroud.]]
A computer's ability to effectively hide information from a player is seen as a distinct advantage over board games when simulating war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine  |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1984&amp;pub=2&amp;id=15 |title=Carrier Force: The Fog of War at its Foggiest |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |date=April 1984 |volume=4 |number=2 |pages=22, 47 |accessdate=2017-03-15 |editor-first1=Russell |editor-last1=Sipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fog of war in [[strategy video game]]s refers to enemy units, and often terrain, being hidden from the player; this is lifted once the area is explored, but the information is often fully or partially re-hidden whenever the player does not have a unit in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Ernest |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm1jAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA510#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fundamentals of Game Design |publisher=[[New Riders Press]] |date=2014 |edition=3 |isbn=978-0-321-92967-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of fog of war was in the 1977 game ''[[Classic Empire|Empire]]'' by [[Walter Bright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher George |last=Lewin |title=War Games and their History |chapter=8 |publisher=Fonthill Media |location=Stroud, Great Britain |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-78155-042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early use of fog of war was the 1978 game ''[[Tanktics]]'' designed by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]], which was criticized for its unreliable and "confusing" fog of war system.&lt;ref name="proctor198201"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Proctor |first=Bob |date=January 1982 |title=Tanktics: Review and Analysis |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1982&amp;pub=2&amp;id=2 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |pages=17-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford in 1982 suggested "limit[ing] the amount of information available to the human player" to compensate for the computer's lack of intelligence.&lt;ref name="crawford198212"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-12/1982_12_BYTE_07-12_Game_Plan_1982#page/n97/mode/2up | title=Design Techniques and Ideas for Computer Games | magazine=BYTE | date=December 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 |last=Crawford |first=Chris | pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' article [[Dave Arneson]] called fog of war "one of the biggest 'plus' factors in computer simulations", while Crawford concluded, using ''Tanktics'' as an example, that video game fog of war systems became less "fun" the more realistic they were, leading the medium to instead use simplified systems.&lt;ref name="CGW"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=April 1988 |title="Fog of War": A Clearer View |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1988&amp;pub=2&amp;id=46 |magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] |pages=24–26, 52–53 |access-date=2017-03-15 |number=46 |editor-first1=Russell |editor-last1=Sipe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two large [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] franchises, ''[[Warcraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft]]'', use a fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player's [[reconnaissance]]. Without a unit actively observing, previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible, but changes in enemy units or bases are not.&lt;ref name="StarCraft"&gt;{{cite web |title=StarCraft's Steps |url=http://www.howell.seattle.wa.us/ggggd/StarcraftsSteps.pdf |first=Dave |last=Howell |date=2010 |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110101417/http://www.howell.seattle.wa.us/ggggd/StarcraftsSteps.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also common in both turn-based and real-time strategy games, such as the [[Total War (series) | ''Total War'' series]], [[Age of Empires (series)|''Age of Empires'' series]], [[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert series|''Red Alert'' series]], [[Wars (series)|''Advance Wars'' series]], [[Fire Emblem (series)|''Fire Emblem'' series]] and [[Sid Meier]]'s [[Civilization (series)|''Civilization'' series]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Fog of war gives players an incentive to uncover a game's world. A compulsion to reveal obscured parts of a map has been described to give a sense of exploring the unknown.&lt;ref name="gamechurch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Power, Knowledge and the Fog of War |url=http://gamechurch.com/power-knowledge-and-the-fog-of-war/ |first=Jonah |last=Stowe |work=[[Gamechurch]] |accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford said that "reasonable" uses of fog of war, such as needing to send out scouts, "not only seem natural, but ... add to the realism and excitement of the game"{{r|crawford198212}} ''[[Merchant Prince]]'' displays over unexplored territory what ''Computer Gaming World'' described as a "[[Here be dragons|renaissance-style map of dubious accuracy]]".&lt;ref name="carter199404"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''Frank Pearson''' (1837–22 December 1899) was an [[Australia]]n [[bushranger]], operating under the [[pseudonym]] ''Captain Starlight.'' Pearson claimed he was the inspiration for a fictional figure of the same name: the character Captain Starlight in [[Thomas Alexander Browne|Rolf Boldrewood]]'s novel, of 1882–1883, ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]''. Boldrewood, who presumably had some insight into the matter, denied the claim and stated that the character was a composite of several bushrangers of the era, including [[Henry Redford|Henry Readford]] and [[Thomas Smith (bushranger)|Thomas Smith, alias ''Captain Midnight'']]. The cattle thief Readford did not use a pseudonym himself and had no connection with Captain Starlight until the author indicated a possible influence.

==Early life==
Pearson's early life is a mystery as he gave a range of different versions of his background. In his earlier prison records he claimed he was born in [[London]] and that he had arrived in Australia in 1866. Later he claimed to be from America; he also told friends that he was born in Mexico of a Spanish mother and Irish father. He used so many aliases that his origins are obscure; however, he may have been connected to a family with the surname ''Arnold''.

==Notoriety==
In September 1868, as Doctor Frank Pearson, he teamed up with stockman Charley Rutherford and robbed the shop, the Yarrambah Post Office, and Angledool Station in New South Wales before heading to Enngonia also in New South Wales, some {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Bourke, New South Wales. Two police constables, McCabe from New South Wales and McManus from Queensland,set out from Walgett, New South Wales to catch the bushrangers but became lost. The Police patrol stopped for supplies in Enngonia and were making a purchase at the Shearer's Inn when Pearson and Rutherford entered the inn yelling ''Bail Up''. Both constables opened fire hitting Pearson in the arm and wrist while Pearson returned fire hitting McCabe in the chest. The two bushrangers then fled to Belalie where they stole fresh horses before continuing down the [[Darling River]] to near [[Pooncarie, New South Wales|Pooncarie]] where they split up and went their separate ways. Pearson travelled north, robbing several stations along the way before heading toward [[Gundabooka National Park|Mount Gunderbooka]], {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Bourke. A police party tracked Pearson to Mount Gunderbooka but he eluded them in the thick scrub of the mountain. Based at the foot of the mountain and stationing men at the waterholes to prevent Pearson from access to water, the party chased him for three days before capturing him on Christmas Day, in a small cave, weakened from lack of water and badly bitten by [[Myrmecia (ant)|bull ants]]. Contable McCabe had died from his injury in November and Pearson was charged with murder. Committed for trial on 4 January 1869 Pearson was found guilty at trial on 3 May 1869 and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment and he was released in 1884 after fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policensw.com/info/policerem/text/index3.html Police Deaths in NSW: McCABE, John] The Thin Blue Line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qppha.com.au/1-files/members-index.htm |title=Frank Pearson |publisher=Qppha.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commutation of his sentence was controversial. There is some evidence to suggest that [[William Munnings Arnold]], Parliamentary Speaker of the time, may have influenced the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Captain Starlight: the strange but true story of a bushranger, impostor and murderer|last=Smith|first=Jane|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781925275308|location=Newport, NSW|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starlightjanesmith.com/william-munnings-arnold.html|title=William Munnings Arnold|last=Smith|first=Jane|date=2015|website=Captain Starlight|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to legend, In 1884 bushrangers stopped at the local police station in [[Barmera, South Australia]], where they locked the police in their own cells. The leader of the gang then rode his horse into the bar of the Overland Corner Hotel and carved his name into the wall. No trace remains of the name and his identity is disputed with some claiming it was [[Captain Moonlite]]. However it is known that Pearson was active in the area at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/murray/content/didyouknow/bushrangers.htm Bushrangers at Overland Corner] State Library of South Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Pearson returned to Queensland and in 1887 was arrested for forgery and false pretences, under the name of Frank Gordon (alias Dr Lamb), tried in Rockhampton and sentenced to a year in prison in Brisbane. He was admitted to Boggo Road Gaol and shortly afterwards, transferred to [[St Helena Island National Park|St. Helena Island]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starlightjanesmith.com/|title=Captain Starlight|website=Captain Starlight|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was while in prison here that Pearson boasted that he was the inspiration for Boldrewood’s Captain Starlight. While in prison he met fellow prisoner Major Patrick Edward Pelly and, from his release, Pearson adopted that name. Upon his release from St Helena, Pearson was re-arrested, tried at Toowoomba, and imprisoned (again as Frank Gordon) in the Toowoomba Gaol for another three months. As Patrick "Frank" Pelly he lived in [[South Australia]] for around two years, working as a drover. He is not known to have committed any serious crimes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Tredrea |url=http://www.sapolicehistory.org/July04.html |title=South Australia Police Historical Society |publisher=Sapolicehistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 he moved to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] where, as Major Patrick Frances Pelly he was employed on the recommendation of the WA Premier, Sir [[John Forrest]], as a clerk-accountant with the [[Geological Survey of Western Australia|Western Australia Geological Survey]]. In Perth he often related elaborate and false stories of his past as a major in the British army and a member of the Russian Czar’s bodyguard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sro.wa.gov.au/pdfs/sotr-spring2002-3.pdf  Captain Starlight: Man of Mystery] State of the Record Volume 1 Number 3 2002 (Newsletter of the State Records Office of Western Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 22 December 1899, Pearson died after accidentally swallowing cyanide. He was drunk and mistook it for his medicine. He is buried in [[Karrakatta Cemetery]] Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/OurCemeteries/Karrakatta/Heroes_and_Humanitarians.pdf Historical tour guide to Karrakatta Cemetery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012230252/http://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/OurCemeteries/Karrakatta/Heroes_and_Humanitarians.pdf |date=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gars''' (or '''garpike''') are members of the '''Lepisosteiformes''' (or '''[[Semionotiformes]]'''), an ancient [[holostei]]an order of [[ray-finned fish]]; fossils from this order are known from the [[Late Jurassic]] onwards.  The family '''Lepisosteidae''' includes seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern [[North America]], [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands.&lt;ref name="filaman.ifm-geomar.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/FamilySummary.cfm?ID=34|title=Family Lepisosteidae - Gars|accessdate=2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterba, G: Freshwater Fishes of the World, p. 609, Vista Books, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with [[ganoid scale]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Vincent R.|last2=Yaraghi|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Kisailus|first3=David|last4=Meyers|first4=Marc A.|date=2016-12-01|title=Microstructural and geometric influences in the protective scales of Atractosteus spatula|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/125/20160595|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|language=en|volume=13|issue=125|pages=20160595|doi=10.1098/rsif.2016.0595|issn=1742-5689|pmid=27974575|pmc=5221522}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fronted by similarly elongated [[jaw]]s filled with long, sharp teeth.

Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans; however their eggs are highly toxic.

==Etymology== 
The name ''gar'' was originally used for a species of [[needlefish]] (''[[Belone belone]]'') found in the North Atlantic and likely taking its name from the [[Old English]] word for "spear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gar|title=Gar|accessdate=2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Belone belone'' is now more commonly referred to as the "garfish" or "gar fish" to avoid confusion with the North American gars of the family Lepisosteidae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/comnames/CommonNamesList.cfm?ID=47&amp;GenusName=Belone&amp;SpeciesName=belone&amp;StockCode=57|title=Common Names of  Belone belone|accessdate=2007-04-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019180912/http://www.fishbase.org/comnames/CommonNamesList.cfm?ID=47&amp;GenusName=Belone&amp;SpeciesName=belone&amp;StockCode=57 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusingly, the name "garfish" is commonly used for a number of other species of the related genera ''[[Strongylura]], [[Tylosurus]]'' and ''[[Xenentodon]]'' of the family [[Belonidae]].

The genus name ''Lepisosteus'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''lepis'' meaning "scale" and ''osteon'' meaning "bone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Eschmeyer/GeneraSummary.cfm?ID=Lepisosteus|title=Genera reference detail|accessdate=2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atractosteus'' is similarly derived from Greek, in this case from ''atraktos'', meaning ''arrow.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishbase.sinica.edu.tw/summary/Atractosteus-spatula.html|title=Genera reference detail|accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Fossil gars are found in Europe, India, South America, and North America, indicating that in times past, these fish had a wider distribution than they do today. Gars are considered to be a remnant of a group of [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] that flourished in the [[Mesozoic]], and are most closely related to the [[bowfin]]. The distribution of the Gar ''Lepisosteidae'' in North America, lies mainly in the shallow, [[Brackish water|brackish]] waters off of Texas and Louisiana, and off the eastern coast of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/fish/discover/species-profiles/atractosteus-spatula|title=Atractosteus spatula :: Florida Museum of Natural History|website=www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Lepisosteus_oculatus.html|title=Lepisosteus oculatus (Spotted gar)|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few populations are also present in the Great Lakes region of the United States, living in similar shallow waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=756|title=Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) - Species Profile|website=nas.er.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Gar shedd.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Large gar in an aquarium]]

===Scales===
[[Image:Atractosteus.JPG|thumb|200px|''Atractosteus'' fossil]]
Gar bodies are elongated, heavily armored with [[ganoid scale]]s, and fronted by similarly elongated [[jaw]]s filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are [[heterocercal]], and the [[dorsal fin]]s are close to the tail.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Wiley, Edward G.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 78–79|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swim bladder===
As their vascularised [[swim bladder]]s can function as lungs,&lt;ref name="FB" /&gt; most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. Experiments on the [[swim bladder]] has shown that the temperature of the water affects which respiration method the gar will use: aerial or aquatic. They will increase the aerial breathing rate (breathing air) as temperature of the water is increased. Gars can live completely submerged in oxygenated water without access to air and remain healthy while also being able to survive in deoxygenated water if allowed access to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renfro|first1=Larry|last2=Hill|first2=Loren|title=Factors Influencing the Aerial Breathing and Metabolism of Gars (Lepisosteus)|journal=The Southwestern Naturalist|date=1970|volume=15|issue=1|pages=45–54|jstor=3670201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation can be the result of environmental pressures and behavioral factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Loren|title=Social Aspects of Aerial Respiration of Young Gars (Lepisosteus)|journal=The Southwestern Naturalist|date=1972|volume=16|issue=3|pages=239–247|jstor=3670060}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this organ, they are extremely resilient and able to tolerate conditions that most other fish could not survive in.

===Pectoral girdle===
[[File:Lepisosteidae Pectoral Girdle.jpg|thumb|Medial and lateral view of Lepisosteidae pectoral girdle]]

The gar has paired appendages, including pectoral fins, pelvic fins, while also having an anal fin, caudal fin, and a dorsal fin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=George|title=Fishes of Wisconsin|date=1983|pages=239–248|url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/EcoNatRes/EFacs/FishesWI/reference/econatres.fisheswi.i0019.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bone structures within the fins are important to study as they can show [[Homology (biology)|homology]] throughout the fossil record. Specifically, the pelvic girdle resembles that of other [[actinopterygians]] yet still having some of its own characteristics. Gars have a postcleithrun - which is a bone that is lateral to the scapula, but do not have postpectorals. Proximally to the postcleithrum, the supracleithrum is important as it plays a critical role in opening the gar's jaws. This structure has a unique internal coracoid lamina only present in the Gar species. Proximal to the supracleithrum is the posttemporal bone, which is significantly smaller than other actinopterygians. Gars also have no clavicle bone, although there have been observations of elongated plates within the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malcolm|first1=Jollie|title=Development of Cranial and Pectoral Girdle Bones of Lepisosteus with a Note on Scales|jstor=1445204|journal=Copeia|publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (ASIH)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lepisosteus platostomus - fins.jpg|thumb|Shortnose gar]]

===Morphology===
All the gars are relatively large fish, but the [[alligator gar]] ''Atractosteus spatula'' is the largest.  The largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was {{Convert|8|ft|5+1/4|in|abbr=on}} long, weighed {{Convert|327|lb|abbr=on}}, and was {{Convert|47|in|cm|abbr=on}} around the girth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/alg/ | title=Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula) | publisher=Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department | accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the smaller species, such as ''Lepisosteus oculatus'', are large, commonly reaching lengths of over {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, and sometimes much more.&lt;ref name=Kodera&gt;Kodera H. ''et al.'': Jurassic Fishes. TFH, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7938-0086-2}}{{page needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Gars tend to be slow-moving fish except when striking at their prey. They prefer the shallow and weedy areas of rivers, lakes, and [[bayou]]s, often congregating in small groups.&lt;ref name="filaman.ifm-geomar.de"/&gt; They are voracious predators, catching their prey with their needle-like teeth, obtained with a sideways strike of the head.&lt;ref name=Kodera/&gt; They feed extensively on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crabs.&lt;ref name="fishbase.org"/&gt; Gars are found across much of North America (for example ''Lepisosteus osseus'').&lt;ref name="filaman.ifm-geomar.de"/&gt; Although gars are primarily found in freshwater habitats, several species enter [[brackish]] waters and a few, most notably ''Atractosteus tristoechus'', are sometimes found in the sea. Some gars travel from lakes and rivers through sewers to get to ponds.&lt;ref name="filaman.ifm-geomar.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monks N. (editor): Brackish Water Fishes, pp 322–324. TFH 2006, {{ISBN|0-7938-0564-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
The gar family contains seven extant species, in two genera:&lt;ref name=FB&gt;{{FishBase family|family=Lepisosteidae|year=2009|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roe==
[[Image:Kaimanfische (Lepisosteus).jpg|thumb|''Lepisosteus platyrhincus'']]
Gar flesh is edible, and sometimes available in markets, but unlike the [[sturgeon]] they resemble, their [[roe|eggs]] are highly toxic to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gar|publisher=Environment.nationalgeographic.com|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/gar|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gar eggs are toxic because of a [[Protein toxicity|protein toxin]] called [[ichthyotoxin]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ostrand|first=Kenneth G.|last2=Thies|first2=Monte L.|last3=Hall|first3=Darrell D.|last4=Carpenter|first4=Mark|date=1996|title=Gar ichthyootoxin: Its effect on natural predators and the toxin's evolutionary function|jstor=30055193|journal=The Southwestern Naturalist|volume=41|issue=4|pages=375–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuhrman|first=Frederick A.|last2=Fuhrman|first2=Geraldine J.|last3=Dull|first3=David L.|last4=Mosher|first4=Harry S.|date=1969-05-01|title=Toxins from eggs of fishes and amphibia|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/jf60163a043|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=17|issue=3|pages=417–424|doi=10.1021/jf60163a043|issn=0021-8561}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When cooking [[roe]], the temperature does not typically get that high so the protein stays intact and causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs. However, [[bluegill]]s and [[channel catfish]] were fed gar eggs and remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. [[Crayfish]] were not immune to the toxin and most of the crayfish that ate the roe died. The immunity to the ichthyotoxins in bluegills and catfish suggests that the toxin came about for a reason other than keeping the gar eggs safe. It may just be a coincidence that the roe is toxic to humans and crayfish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Significance to humans==
Several species are traded as aquarium fish.&lt;ref name="Kodera" /&gt; The hard skin and scales of the gar were used by humans. Native Americans used the scales of the gar as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows in gar skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Maurice|title=The international wildlife encyclopedia, Volume 9|year=2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7266-7|page=929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0_AD0v7vl0C&amp;pg=PA929|author2=Robert Burton|accessdate=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture, but besides using the gar, [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] and [[Chickasaw]] people have ritual "garfish dances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Mark|title=Season of the Gar: Adventures in Pursuit of America's Most Misunderstood Fish|year=2010|publisher=U of Arkansas P|isbn=978-1-55728-929-2|pages=118–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yepqz2i3Iv4C&amp;pg=PA119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''Gisulf II''' (''Gisulfo II di Friuli'') (b. abt. 545 – d. 611) was the [[Duke of Friuli]] from around 591&lt;ref&gt;Or 594.&lt;/ref&gt; to his death. He was the son and successor of [[Gisulf I of Friuli|Gisulf I]].

Gisulf and [[Gaidoald]] of Trent were at odds with King [[Agilulf]] until they made peace in 602 or 603. Gisulf also allied with the Avars to make war on [[Istria]].

Gisulf was involved in the local church. The bishops of "the schismatics of Istria and Venetia," as [[Paul the Deacon]] calls them, fled to the protection of Gisulf. Gisulf also took part in the confirmation of the succession of [[Candidianus]] to the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|patriarchate of Aquileia]] in 606.

The most significant event of his reign occurred probably in 611.&lt;ref&gt;It has been dated as early as 602. However, Gisulf certainly took part in the confirmation of Candidianus in 606.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] invaded Italy, Gisulf's territory was the first they passed through. Gisulf summoned a large army and went to meet them. The Avars were a larger force, however, and they soon overwhelmed the Lombards. Gisulf died in battle, and his duchy was overrun. He left four sons and four daughters by his wife Romilda (or Ramhilde). His elder two sons, [[Tasso of Friuli|Tasso]] and [[Kakko of Friuli|Kakko]], succeeded him.

Gisulf's younger sons, [[Radoald of Benevento|Radoald]] and [[Grimoald I of Benevento|Grimoald]], fled to [[Arechis I of Benevento]], a relative of Gisulf's. They both eventually became [[dukes of Benevento]] in turn, and Grimoald even became king. Gisulf left two daughters, Appa and Geila (or Gaila). [[Paul the Deacon]] says that one married the [[Duke of Alamannia|King of the Alemanni]] (uncertain) and another the [[Duke of Bavaria|Prince of the Bavarians]], probably [[Garibald II of Bavaria]], but he does not identify who married whom.

'''The [[Hmong People]]''' society originally from [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], and southeast [[China]]. {{As of | 2011}} the worldwide Hmong population is about twelve million. The Hmong culture is [[patrilineality|patrilineal]], allowing a husband's family to make all major decisions, even when they solely concern the woman.  However, the Hmong women have traditionally carried a large amount of responsibility and some power due to their necessary contribution of food and labor to the family.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Women's traditional roles==
Hmong children learn gender expectations at a young age. Women belong to their marital family, and before [[marriage]] are considered "other people’s women" by their birth family or clan. Girls traditionally learned household skills from their female elders by the age of eight. Hmong women worked as housekeepers, child bearers and caretakers, cooks, and tailors, and were responsible for making all of their families’ clothes and preparing all meals. Women also planted, harvested, and cleared fields with their husbands, carried water from the river, tended to the animals, and helped build their own houses and furniture.

===Marriage and widows===
"Marriage is considered vital in every Hmong person's life and is the basis for establishing ties with other family groups."&lt;ref&gt;Keown-Bomar, Julie. Kinship Networks Among Hmong-American Refugees. New York: LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC 2004:50&lt;/ref&gt; Hmong men traditionally chose a bride from another clan, with the man's father arranging the marriage. It was taboo for a man to choose a bride from his own clan.  The father would consult with his own relatives and the [[bride]]. She could decline the match, but if she and her family agreed, drinks were made and a [[bride price]] was discussed. 

A traditional Hmong [[wedding]] consisted of three separate ceremonies of animal sacrifices and feasts. In the Hmong society, a woman keeps close relationships with her family and never takes her husband’s last name. However, after marriage, she joins her husband’s family to work and live with them.&lt;ref&gt;Ngo, Bic (2002) Contesting “Culture”: The Perspectives of Hmong American Female Students on Early Marriage. Anthropology and Education Quarterly 33(2):168-88&lt;/ref&gt; If widowed, a Hmong woman has few choices. According to a Hmong saying, "Widows cry to death". The woman’s children belong to her husband’s family and a woman cannot inherit wealth, which leaves her with virtually nothing. If her husband’s brother marries her she can remain in her husband’s family. [[Polygamy]] is condoned in Hmong society, but rare.

===Paj Ntaub===
A large part of Hmong women’s culture is sewing. Hmong women are highly skilled and famous for their fine [[needlework]] and [[embroidery]] called paj ntaub (flower cloth). Example of this ancient craft can be found in Chinese art albums. Women spend years on one piece of clothing for a wedding or other celebratory attire. The cross-stitching, if done exceptionally well, is so fine it can appear to the naked eye as beading. There are five traditional patterns including an eight-point star, a snail shell, a ram’s head, an elephant’s footprint and a heart, which, when combined create a beautiful display.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Franklin, ed. (1999) Asian American Women and Gender. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Women work all day in the fields and in the house and then sew by oil lamp throughout the night so that their children will have appropriate clothes for [[New Year]]’s.

==Childbirth==
Hmong families usually consist of many children, fulfilling several crucial purposes. First and foremost, children guarantee the continuation of the lineage and [[clan]]. Children also provide helping hands for farm work, housework, and childcare. Being able to produce many children adds to a sense of importance for women, helping them feel a stronger sense of belonging within their clan. Children are also very highly celebrated in Hmong culture, as the Hmong people believe in reincarnation and center their lives around the family.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, Keith. [[Hmong History of a People]] 2nd ed.). Cheney: [[Eastern Washington University Press]] 1995:99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy and labor===
During [[pregnancy]], Hmong women carried out their daily responsibilities until the day they went into labor. A Hmong woman would follow her [[food craving]]s to guarantee that her child would not be born with a deformity. Once her water broke she would then walk to the nearest water source and carry water to her house to wash her baby when it was born. 

In the book ''[[The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down]]'', [[Anne Fadiman]] discusses a woman who gave birth to twelve of her fifteen children alone in the middle of the night. The woman, Foua, delivered each child into her own hands in completely silence, believing that noise would "thwart the birth". The father then cut the [[umbilical cord]] and the mother washed her newborn. The father proceeded to dig a deep hole in the dirt floor of the house to bury the [[placenta]]. If the baby was a girl the placenta was buried underneath her parents' bed, but if it was a boy it was buried with greater honor under the central column of the house. The Hmong believe that after death a soul returns to its birthplace, retrieves its placental jacket, puts it on, and begins its voyage to the sky. Women had a strict postpartum diet that consisted solely of hot foods and drinks. Cold food would "make the blood congeal in the womb instead of cleansing it by flowing freely".&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, Anne. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1997:9&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs were closely followed to ensure the continued fertility of the new mother.

===Hu Plig===
A baby was not considered part of the community until a ceremony called the hu plig (soul-calling) occurred three days after its birth. Chickens were sacrificed and if the soul was content in its new body, the chickens' tongues would be curled upward and the skulls translucent. Either string or silver necklaces or bracelets were put on the infant to prevent the soul from wandering from the body. After this ceremony the infant would be named and considered an official member of the human race.

==Socio-cultural dynamics==
Foua, the woman from ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down'', noted that her personal life was based on her cultural life. Hmong culture is centered around [[legend]]s, the religion of [[shaman]]s, souls, high regards for ancestors, and the many rituals and ceremonies the Hmong perform. Women's social life and status is often a direct result of the completion of and attendance at the proper rituals and ceremonies. One Hmong legend tells of a girl who took every man who passed by her as a lover. Eventually, "her sexual excesses so destroyed her health that she fell ill and died".&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, Keith. [[Hmong History of a People]] 2nd ed.). Cheney: [[Eastern Washington University Press]] 1995:77&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, the woman's failure to follow one of the religious tenets of Hmong culture resulted in her death. The Hmong also have stories of great female shamans, showing how social life and cultural life of Hmong women are interrelated. Hmong culture shapes gender roles in that female culture is a culture in itself. The female gender is shaped beginning in childhood and to gain high status, a woman must always fulfill the expectations for the female sex.

==Current situation==
The Hmong people’s way of life changed drastically during the '''[[Vietnam War]]'''. The [[United States]] could not send troops into Laos, so they instead trained Hmong men to fight in the hopes that they could keep Laos an anticommunist nation. Since the Hmong were fighting against Laos, they had to evacuate their homes there and live in refugee camps in Thailand. After the war was over, Thailand closed the refugee camps and Hmong people were dispersed all over the world to Western countries such as the United States, [[Australia]], [[France]], and [[Canada]]. The rest of the Hmong people fled to various countries in [[Asia]]. 

Hmong women in the Western world had a difficult time adjusting to a new way of life, having trouble transferring skills they had learned in Asia to a different culture. The newer generation of Hmong women are generally more assimilated. In Fadiman’s book the mother, Foua, declares herself stupid because she is not familiar with American culture. She cannot read or speak English and due to that inability cannot perform simple yet necessary tasks such as grocery shopping. She can no longer farm or provide for her children as she once could.

===Women's current roles===
The patrilineal and [[patriarchal]] family system has changed little since for those Hmong who emigrated to the Global North. Decisions about any family member of either gender are still passed down through the husband's family elders. Women contribute greatly to their families, but in different ways. Women tend to have somewhat more freedom in choosing a husband, but the families of the bride and groom still have the final say in the match. The woman does not live outside the home before she is married to protect her reputation. 

Childbirth is also a different process now that hospitals are located in every neighborhood. Once Foua, from Fadiman’s book, relocated to the United States she no longer birthed her own children; a doctor did. She no longer bathed her infants; a nurse took care of it. Foua’s husband brought in the proper postpartum food because the hospital offered only ice water. Often a doctor will not release the placenta to the parents of the newborn and the Hmong fear that they will never recover the placental jackets necessary for afterlife. Over time, the women of this group have lost some of their power and agency. As a result of globalization and assimilation into another culture, women have less control over their lives because they cannot provide food for their families as they did, birth children traditionally, or perform many traditional ceremonies.

'''John Gray''' (1819-1872) was a Scottish [[merchant seaman]] and [[master mariner]] who served as Captain of the [[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']] for eighteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Alexander|title=The Cabinet, or a Repository of Facts, Figures and Fancies relating to the Voyage of the "Great Britain" SS|date=1862|publisher=J. Reid|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSGB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Gray's Disapperance|url=http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/about-us/blog/captain-grays-disapperance|publisher=SS Great Britain Trust|accessdate=3 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in mysterious circumstances, after apparently jumping or falling overboard.&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bayanne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain John GRAY b. 8 Dec 1819 Valand, Lund, Unst, SHI, SCT d. 26 Nov 1872 At sea: Shetland Family History|url=https://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I45521&amp;tree=ID1|website=Bayanne|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Gray, was born on 8 December 1819 at Valand, Westing, [[Unst]], in the [[Shetland Isles]], &lt;ref name="SSGB-Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Gray Facts|url=http://www.ssgreatbritain.org/story/captain-gray/facts|publisher=SS Great Britain Trust|accessdate=3 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Sarah (née Johnson) and Robert Gray. &lt;ref name="Bayanne" /&gt;

He went to sea at a young age, initially joining the [[Eagle Line]].&lt;ref name="Mercury"&gt;{{cite news |title=[[:s:John Gray - Mercury, Hobart - 1873-01-03|John Gray]] |work=The Mercury |date=3 January 1873 |location=Hobart, Tasmania, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

[[File:SS Great Britain with four masts 1853.jpg|thumb|''Great Britain'' in 1853, after her refit to four masts]]

Gray progressed to commanding ships for [[Gibbs, Bright &amp; Co.]].&lt;ref name="Mercury" /&gt; He took both a demotion and a pay cut in order to serve as Second Officer on their SS ''Great Britain'' in 1852, in time for the vessel's first voyage to Australia.&lt;ref name="SSGB-Facts" /&gt; He was promoted to First Officer for the second Australian voyage, then made Captain in April 1854, prior to the third, following the resignation of his predecessor Captain Matthews.&lt;ref name="SSGB-Facts" /&gt; He held the longest tenure of any SS ''Great Britain'' captain, and in that role completed 27 journeys from the United Kingdom to Australia and back.&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt; He was also her captain when she was used as a [[troop ship]], during the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Indian Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt;

In 1869 a passenger wrote that he was:&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt;

{{Quote|the popular commander of a popular ship, deservedly esteemed for his tact and judgement. He knew how to handle his ship, his crew and his passengers}}

== Death ==

On his two penultimate voyages to Australia and back, Gray, according to subsequent newspaper reports:&lt;ref name="Mercury" /&gt;

{{Quote|suffered severely from liver and stomach complaint, brought on by pure anxiety to maintain the reputation of his ship in the strong competition with the London steam clippers}}

On 25 November 1872, thirty days into another return voyage from [[Melbourne]] to [[Liverpool]], Gray complained of pain in his bowels and returned to his cabin. Near midnight he was seen walking towards the ship's deck. The next morning, he could not be found, and one of the transom windows at the ship's stern was open, having been locked the night before.&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt; The letter he had been seen writing that night could not be found.&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt;

Since there was no way to send a message ashore, his wife Mary Ann (née Jamieson) only found out that she was a widow when she and one of their daughters met the ship upon its arrival in Liverpool in January 1873.&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury" /&gt; His death was reported on the front pages of newspapers in the United Kingdom and in Australia.&lt;ref name="SSGB" /&gt;

== In fiction ==

The novel ''Revenge My Death'' by Bill Jackman tells an invented story of Gray's disappearance being due to him being kidnapped by a passenger.&lt;ref name="WMercury"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Ron|title=Author Bill solves mystery of SS Great Britain captain|url=http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/author-bill-solves-mystery-of-ss-great-britain-captain-1-3698733|accessdate=3 December 2017|work=Weston Mercury|date=24 July 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of people burned after being deemed [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]]''' by different [[Christianity|Christian Churches]]. The list does not attempt to encompass the list of those executed by burning for other reasons (such as [[List of people executed for witchcraft|victims of witch hunts]] or other persecutions).  The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] states that "with the formal recognition of the Church by the State and the increase of ecclesiastical penalties proportioned to the increase of ecclesiastical offences, came an appeal from the Church to the secular arm for aid in enforcing the said penalties, which aid was always willingly granted...deviations from the Catholic Faith, were by the State made punishable in civil law and secular penalties were attached to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= |first1=Catholic encyclopedia |title=Jurisdiction |url=Chttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08567a.htm |website=.newadvent.org |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 3 of the Ecumenical Fourth Lateran Council, 1215 required secular authorities to "exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics" pointed out by the [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schroeder |first1=H.

On November 13, 1966, the decomposed body of a male was found in the [[Hiawatha National Forest]] in [[Trout Lake, Michigan|Trout Lake]], Chippewa County, Michigan. The man's exact cause of death has not been released, but the nature was determined to have been murder. The victim was aged between nineteen and twenty-five, although he may have been up to thirty years old when he died. He was approximately {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} tall at a weight of {{convert|150|lb|kg}}. His hair was around {{convert|4|in|cm|spell=in}} long and was brown with a reddish tint. He was dressed in a tan shirt with jeans and had both American and Canadian currency in his shirt pocket, leading officers to believe he was of Canadian nationality. Additionally, he was found near the border of the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]. A gold and chrome-colored lighter and a set of five Canadian-style keys on a key ring, with the number "330" etched in it, were also found with the remains. The man's belongings and clothing no longer exist, as they were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 948UMMI|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/948ummi.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have died approximately six months before his discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8378|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/8378|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 27, 2014|date=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1987, the body of a young woman, aged 16 to 25 was located in a dump in [[Detroit]], Wayne County, Michigan. The victim was deceased less than two days and had been stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bodies exhumed at Plymouth cemetery by police for DNA testing|url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/27342968/2-bodies-being-exhumed-at-plymouth-cemetery|accessdate=November 18, 2014|publisher=[[WJBK-TV]]|location=Detroit|agency=Fox News|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was approximately {{Convert|5|ft|5|in|m}} tall and weighed around {{convert|114|lb|kg}}.

Her hair was brown with red and blond highlights and was styled with a long nape with various layers. She was slender, but had an athletic build and an O blood type. Her nails were painted with pink polish and she had brown or hazel eyes. A worn black bikini bottom was the only clothing she wore. Two rings were found on her left hand, one on her index finger and one on her ring finger, indicating she may have been married. She also had pierced ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1987|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMC/1184291/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with some other unidentified decedents from Detroit, the victim was exhumed in 2014 for additional examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Kim|title=Police and federal investigators dig up bodies hoping DNA will help put names to unsolved deaths|url=http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/wayne-county/police-and-federal-investigators-dig-up-bodies-hoping-dna-will-help-put-names-to-unsolved-deaths|accessdate=November 18, 2014|publisher= [[WXYZ-TV]] |location= Detroit|agency=ABC News|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of a woman were found on August 23, 1992 in [[New Buffalo, Michigan|New Buffalo]], Berrien County, Michigan. The victim was nude and between the ages of 65 and 75 when she was murdered. The victim was wrapped in a bed sheet, two garbage bags and a towel and left alongside a highway. Her hands were severed to prevent identification through fingerprint examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case file #2 Unidentified female 1992|url=http://www.bcsheriff.org/main/Casefile2Unidentifiedfemale1992|website=www.bcsheriff.org/|publisher=Berrien County Police Department|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim was also missing her dentures, as she had no teeth. The body was at the scene for approximately two days, but she was killed four to seven days before. The woman may have been from a nursing home in Illinois or Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 129UFMI|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/129ufmi.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was believed to have been five feet two inches tall at a weight of around 102 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8224|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/8224|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 4, 2014|date=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of a female between fifteen and twenty-five years old was located in an alley in [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], Wayne County, Michigan on May 20, 1996.

She wore a distinctive white shirt with yellow smiley faces, a white bra, white socks and black shoes, as well as a teddy-bear shaped wristwatch. Her eyes were brown, like her hair. The victim's teeth had three fillings and untreated decay, although none of them had been removed. She is also believed to have been a tobacco smoker. Other than this, she is believed to have been drug-free. She had O type blood and painted her nails, her fingernails were purple and her toenails were pink. Other distinguishing features included many freckles on her face and a scar under her right knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1996|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1228681/1|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim also had pelvic inflammatory disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 11787|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/11787|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 27, 2014|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the afternoon of May 8, 2002, the burned body of a white or Hispanic man was discovered in a wooded area of a blueberry field in [[Grand Haven, Michigan|Grand Haven]], Ottawa County, Michigan. The man was killed by blunt force trauma and was then set on fire after being transported to the area. He had extensive dental work, including a partial dental plate, crowns and restorations. However, they had not been performed within a decade before he died. It is believed that he received such care in the southern United States or Mexico. His clothing included a shirt originating from southern California, boxer shorts and a watch. He was {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} to {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}} tall and was fairly healthy when he was alive. His remains were found in a footlocker that was then set on fire. A charred cushion, which was placed below the remains, was also found. Because of the size of the footlocker and the absence of disturbance to the surface of the earth, it is believed that more than one person was involved in disposing the corpse. Because it had rained the morning of the discovery, trace evidence at the scene was no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack in the Box|url=http://www.delayedjustice.com/?page_id=10|website=delayedjustice.com|publisher=penULTIMATE, Ltd|accessdate=August 3, 2014|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack In The Box|url=http://www.delayedjustice.com/?p=589|publisher=Delayed Justice|accessdate=August 3, 2014|date=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 1288UMMI|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1288ummi.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2005, the severely deteriorated body of a 35- to 60-year-old woman was found naked inside an abandoned building in [[Detroit]], Michigan.

The partially mummified remains of a woman were located in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan on March 26, 2009 in an alley. The woman's cause of death is unknown, but she was found without clothing, which indicates homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit, Michigan Jane Doe|url=http://www.hellbeasts.com/?p=6478|accessdate=October 14, 2014|date=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim was between 25 and 45 years old, standing around {{convert|4|ft|8|in|m}} tall. Because of the state of her body, her weight could not be estimated. The Jane Doe was deceased for approximately eight months. Judging by a wad of hair found at the scene, she may have had red or auburn hair when she was alive. Examining the woman's bones suggested that she had borne at least one child and had trauma to her back before she died, which likely caused her pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8175|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/8175|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database]]|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before becoming the coroner, the mother-of-two had left her hometown of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] for Birmingham at 18 and worked as a nurse at [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham]], graduating with a law degree in 1992. She was appointed in 2013 on the resignation of Aidan Cotter OBE who had been in the role for little more than a decade. In the process, Louise became the first female coroner in Birmingham legal history.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In 2016 she was asked by a campaign of bereaved families to resume the inquest into the [[Birmingham pub bombings]] of 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/10/birmingham-pub-bombings-victims-families-push-to-reopen-investigation|title=Birmingham pub bombings: victims' families push to reopen investigation|author=Owen Bowcott|work=[[the Guardian]]|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3935">'''Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus Privernas''' ({{lang-la|Lucius Aemilius L. f. L. n. Mamercinus Privernas}}) was a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[Politician|statesman]] who served as the [[Roman Consul|consul]] in 341 and 329 BC, [[Magister Equitum]] in 342, [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] in 335 and 316, and [[Interrex]] in 326.

==Family==
Lucius Aemilius was the son of [[Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus (consul 366 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus]], consul in 366 and 363. He belonged to the ''[[gens Aemilia]]'', one of the oldest [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] families of [[Ancient Rome]].

==Career==
In 342, during the dictatorship of [[Marcus Valerius Corvus]], Aemilius served as [[Magister Equitum]]. The following year he was elected to his first [[Roman Consul|consulship]] with [[Gaius Plautius Venox Hypsaeus]]. Gaius Plautius led his troops to victories in [[Priverno]] and [[Volsci]], while Lucius Aemilius travelled to [[Samnium]] where he received the region's ambassadors who demanded peace.  The praetor laid the petition of the Samnites before the Senate, and the Senators voted to renew the treaty with them. 

After the peace was accepted by the [[Roman Senate]], Lucius Aemilius left Samnium. The Roman army was at once recalled, after receiving a year's pay and rations for three months, which the consul had stipulated should be the price of a truce, to last until the envoys should return. According to [[Livy]], Aemilius was encouraged by his colleagues to resign before the end of his term of office because of the impending [[Latin War]]. 

In 335 he was appointed [[Roman Dictator|dictator]] (''dictator comitiorum habendorum causa''). In 329 Aemilius was again elected to the [[Roman Consul|consulship]] alongside [[Gaius Plautius Decianus]]. There was great alarm at Rome at this time because of a report that the Gauls were marching southward. Accordingly, while Decianus proceeded against [[Privernum]], which was continuing to resist the Romans, Lucius Aemilius began to levy a large army in order to oppose the Gauls.  However, the report of the Gaulish invasion proved to be unfounded, so both consuls united their forces against Privernum. The town was taken and Mamercinus, as well as his colleague, obtained a triumph as a result. The capture of this town must have been regarded as a very glorious achievement since Mamercinus received the surname of Privernas. 

In 326 he was selected as [[interrex]]. In 316 he again served as dictator (''dictator rei gerundae causa''). His primary mission as dictator was to fight the [[Samnites]].

'''Mars Base Camp''' ('''MBC''') is a crewed [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] laboratory orbiter concept under study that was commissioned by NASA from [[Lockheed Martin]] in US.&lt;ref name="intro 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/ssc/mars-orion.html |title=Mars Base Camp |work=Lockheed Martin |accessdate=2016-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would use both future and proven concepts as well as the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion MPCV]], also built by Lockheed Martin. 

The Mars Base Camp concept is being proposed to NASA as a possible version of the [[Deep Space Transport]], a crewed interplanetary [[spacecraft]] to support science exploration missions to [[Mars]] of up to 1,000 days.&lt;ref name='Lockheed Update 2017'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/space/photo/mbc/MBC_Updates_IAC_2017.pdf|title=MARS BASE CAMP UPDATES AND NEW CONCEPTS 68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) |date= 2017 |publisher=Lockheed Martin| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929053546/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/space/photo/mbc/MBC_Updates_IAC_2017.pdf|archive-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of MBC would be to conduct real-time [[Telerobotics|telerobotic]] science, both in Mars orbit and on the surface of its moons ([[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]), and serve as a proving ground in preparing humans for future missions to the Martian surface.

==History==
The concept was published in May 2016 by Lockheed Martin, and it is a design for a spacecraft for carrying humans to Mars orbit and conducting operations in Mars orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cichan|first=Timothy|last2=Bailey|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Antonelli|first3=Tony|last4=Jolly|first4=Steven D.|last5=Chambers|first5=Robert P.|last6=Clark|first6=Benton|last7=Ramm|first7=Steven J.|date=2017-12|title=Mars Base Camp: An Architecture for Sending Humans to Mars|url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/space.2017.0037|journal=New Space|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=203–218|doi=10.1089/space.2017.0037|issn=2168-0256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars Base Camp harnesses many NASA technologies in development, or technology goals at the time of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cichan|first=Timothy|last2=Bailey|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Antonelli|first3=Tony|last4=Jolly|first4=Steven D.|last5=Chambers|first5=Robert P.|last6=Clark|first6=Benton|last7=Ramm|first7=Steven J.|date=2017-12|title=Mars Base Camp: An Architecture for Sending Humans to Mars|url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/space.2017.0037|journal=New Space|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=203–218|doi=10.1089/space.2017.0037|issn=2168-0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the plan was updated including a concept for a reusable crewed shuttle called MADV (Mars Ascent Descent Vehicle), which would connect to the MBC Mars space station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/38306-lockheed-martin-reusable-mars-lander-unveiled.html|title=Lockheed Martin Unveils Sleek, Reusable Lander for Crewed Mars Missions|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Mihran is first mentioned during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab invasion of Persia]], and is known to have commanded the left wing of the [[Sasanian]] army during the [[battle of al-Qādisiyyah]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=232}} Mihran, along with [[Nakhiragan]], [[Hormuzan]] and [[Piruz Khosrow]], including the rest of the survivors, regrouped at Bavel ([[Babylon]]), where they tried to repel the [[Arabs|Arab]] army, but were once again defeated.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=192}} While Piruz and Hormuzan fled different directions, Mihran and Nakhiragan remained in [[Asoristan]].

After a brief stay at [[Veh-Ardashir]],{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1999|p=2421-2423}} they abandoned and destroyed the bridge on the east bank of the [[Tigris|Tigris river]]. Nakhiragan and Mihran then briefly stayed at [[Kutha]], where they installed a certain ''[[dehqan]]'' named [[Shahriyar of Derbent|Shahriyar]] as the commander of the garrison of the place.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1999|p=2421-2423}} The two Sasanian military officers then went to the capital [[Ctesiphon]], which was under attack by the Arabs. However, their stay there was only brief.

After some time, they regrouped again with other Sasanian officers and fought the Arabs at [[Battle of Jalula|Jalula]]. The Sasanian forces, however, were once again defeated. Mihran along with the rest of the survivors then fled to [[Khanaqin]], but were at last killed by an Arab force which had pursued them.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=194}}

'''Mortimer John Brown''' (27 April 1874 – 1966) was an English sculptor.

==Early life and education==
Mortimer Brown was born in [[Fenton, Staffordshire]], the son of a brewer and potter's agent. He was educated at [[Hanley School of Art]] and the [[Royal College of Art|National Art Training School]] under [[Edouard Lanteri]]. From the mid 1890s he studied at the [[Royal Academy Schools]] , winning several prizes including the Landseer Scholarship and British Institution Scholarship fund in 1898. He travelled to Italy and Greece to complete his studies.&lt;ref name="Glasgow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mortimer John Brown |work=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851–1951 |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] History of Art and HATII, online database 2011 |url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1215013444 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/mortimer-brown-822/text-artist-biography |title=Mortimer Brown 1874–1966 |publisher=[[Tate Gallery]] |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career and works==
Brown initially worked as an assistant to [[William Hamo Thornycroft]]. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1900 to 1916 and his statue of [[John the Baptist]] attracted particular interest in 1901. Other early work was similarly based on religious and classical themes.&lt;ref name="speel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speel.me.uk/sculpt/brownmortimer.htm| title=Mortimer Brown (1874–1966)|accessdate=6 June 2015}}{{self-published source|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1911 bronze, ''The Shepherd Boy'' was purchased by the [[Chantrey Bequest]] in 1912 and gifted to the [[Tate Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Glasgow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/brown-shepherd-boy-n02896 |title='Shepherd Boy', Mortimer Brown |publisher=[[Tate Gallery]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly his best known work is the World War I memorial raised in [[Radnor Gardens]], [[Twickenham]], in 1921.

In 1925, he married Gertrude Walter in [[Brentford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=buzkOu4XqLIQ9%2BUGiEY%2FpQ&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=8 June 2015|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent the remainder of his life at [[Budleigh Salterton]], [[Devon]] and died there in 1966 at the age of 92.

'''Breck Bednar''' was a 14-year-old English boy who was [[murder|murdered]] on 17 February 2014 by 18-year-old Lewis Daynes. Bednar knew Daynes only through online gaming and had never met him in person until he visited Daynes's flat at Rosebery Road in [[Grays]], [[Essex]], England.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

== Victim ==
Bednar was a student at [[St Bede's School]] in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] in Surrey, and a member of the [[Air Training Corps]] 135 Squadron also in Redhill.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/25/breck-bednar-14-murder-lewis-daynes|title=Teenage computer engineer pleads guilty to murdering Breck Bednar, 14|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |author=Josh Halliday |date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended St John the Evangelist church in [[Caterham]].  His mother described him as relaxed and warm-hearted, with many friends with whom he played [[Online game|games online]] after school, and passionate about computing.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewast /&gt;

Bednar's parents, Barry Bednar and Lorin LaFave, were born in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Randhawa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/computer-engineer-admits-killing-oil-traders-son-he-met-online-9881848.html|title=Computer engineer admits killing oil trader's 14-year-old son who he met online |publisher=Evening Standard|date=25 November 2014|author=Kiran Randhawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family moved to England from the United States seventeen years before the murder.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;  Barry Bednar, 49, is an oil trader and shipping consultant, described by some sources as a [[millionaire]].&lt;ref name=Randhawa /&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans1125&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11252415/Breck-Bednar-murder-computer-engineer-admits-killing-oil-millionaires-son.html|title=Breck Bednar murder: computer engineer admits killing oil millionaire's son|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 November 2014|author=Martin Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lorin LaFave, 48, is a teaching assistant.&lt;ref name=Dewast /&gt;&lt;ref name=Randhawa /&gt;  The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that the couple had divorced in 2006 and that Lorin LaFave was living as a single mother with the four children in their family home in Surrey.{{cn|date=September 2018}}  The ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' reported that the family lives with their three surviving children in a family home in Caterham.&lt;ref name=Randhawa /&gt;

== Circumstances of death ==
It was reported that Bednar's mother, Lorin LaFave, "limited his access to electronics, installed parental controls and forbade him from using the same server as a boy she had grown suspicious of."&lt;ref name=Dewast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/mom-sons-murder-online-gaming-partner/story?id=27309290|title=Mom Will 'Never Be the Same' After Son's Murder by Online Gaming Partner|publisher=ABC News|author=Louise Dewast|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled, "His personality was changing and his ideology was changing and he was starting to refuse to attend church with us. I felt like it was because of the negative influence of this person."&lt;ref name=BBC1201 /&gt; According to the ''Daily Mail'', Bednar had been introduced to the 'exclusive' six-person online gaming club at a church youth group. Bednar's mother described Lewis Daynes as controlling the group, with the power to expel members, owning and controlling an Internet chat channel on which members would communicate by voice. She told the ''Daily Mail'' that Daynes had told her son improbable stories, such as donating $2.5 million in [[bitcoin]] to [[Syrian rebels]], and had told members they did not need to finish school because he would arrange £100,000 computer technology jobs for them.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In December 2013 a relative of Breck placed a call to [[Surrey Police]] expressing concerns around [[online grooming]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-30193056|title=Breck Bednar stabbing: Lewis Daynes admits boy's murder|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaFave said she warned British police that her son was in danger.&lt;ref name = Dewast /&gt; Nonetheless, it was reported, "The teenagers had been playing games online for several months, despite LaFave's efforts to put an end to their relationship."

On the day of Bednar's death, LaFave's former husband, with whom he had been expected to spend the weekend, sent a text message to tell her that the boy had not arrived. A few hours later his siblings, 12-year-old triplets, began to receive messages that their brother had been killed, describing photos of Bednar that had been posted to social media, which were soon confirmed by the police.&lt;ref name=Dewast /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1201&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-30273692|title=Breck Bednar murder: Body photos 'circulated by killer'|publisher=BBC News|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos, showing Bednar's body, were posted to other members of the six-person online gaming group. Word spread, leading to a friend's [[text message]] to one of the triplets, "Is it true about your brother? If it's true, it's so sad." At the same time, police were telling Bednar's parents the news that their son had been murdered.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11263702/Baby-faced-killer-posted-pictures-of-Breck-Bednars-body-on-the-Internet.html|title=Baby-faced killer posted pictures of Breck Bednar's body on the Internet|publisher=The Telegraph|date=30 November 2014|author=Martin Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police and paramedics were called to the flat where Bednar was found with stab wounds to his neck, but were unable to prevent him from dying at the scene.&lt;ref name=Evans1125 /&gt;

== Perpetrator ==
According to [[BBC News]], "Lewis Daynes, 19, of Rosebery Road, [[Grays]], was due to stand trial at [[Chelmsford]] Crown Court on a charge of murder but admitted the offence" before the jury was sworn.  Sentencing by Mrs [[Laura Cox|Justice Cox]] was scheduled for 12 January 2015. Daynes, an unemployed [[computer engineer]], was believed to have met Bednar while playing online video games.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewast /&gt;  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described Daynes as a 'baby-faced killer' who looked 'much younger than his 19 years'.&lt;ref name=Evans1125 /&gt;  Daynes was reported by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' to have grown up as an only child, and after his parents split when he was 16 he lived alone in a flat owned by his grandparents; his neighbours described him as 'reclusive'.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC told the court, "The prosecution case was that at the time of his murder Breck was aged 14. The law makes specific provision for the murder of a child involving sexual or sadistic motivation.  The prosecution have advanced the case on that basis and anticipate doing that again on the date of sentence."&lt;ref name=Evans1125 /&gt;

Simon Mayo QC, mitigating, said Daynes had [[Asperger syndrome]] which "affects his ability to make sound judgments." Mayo also argued that there was not enough evidence to prove that the murder had been premeditated.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/breck-bednar-murderer-lewis-daynes-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-9973204.html|title=Breck Bednar: Murderer Lewis Daynes sentenced to life in prison|work=The Independent|author=Lizzie Dearden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daynes was given a life sentence with a minimum 25-year term. [[Crown Prosecutor]] Jenny Hopkins said: "Our case was that Lewis Daynes, even though he was only 18 when he committed Breck's murder, was a controlling and manipulative individual who carefully planned this crime. [...] The degree of planning and manipulation by Daynes is shocking and when you consider the young ages of perpetrator and victim, it stands out as one of the most cruel, violent and unusual cases we have dealt with."&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (12 January 2015). [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/12/lewis-daynes-stabbed-breck-bednar-essex-sentenced-chelmsford-crown-court Teenager who killed Breck Bednar in ‘sadistic’ attack jailed for life].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Bednar's family established The Breck Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breckbednar.com/|title=Breck Bednar Memorial Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise awareness of online dangers&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; and promote responsible use of the Internet.&lt;ref name=BBC1201 /&gt;  His mother was quoted by the BBC: "I want Breck's tragedy to open the eyes of everyone to recognise the dangers of online predators. It is a very real danger today.  We all need to look after each other."  His mother asked his favourite band, [[Coldplay]], to help raise awareness of online dangers.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;  She told [[ABC News]], "People think it only happens to anti-social kids, but it's just not true."&lt;ref name=Dewast /&gt;

Ms LaFave has called for "more help from the government for online safety", saying that she had expected more feedback from Surrey Police and adding, "I also wasn't recommended to contact CEOP ([[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]]), which I found out – when it was too late – is a really great agency that would help parents."&lt;ref name=BBC1201 /&gt;

After Daynes' plea in court, Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens said the handling of Bednar's case by [[Surrey Police]] had been referred to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC):  "Following Breck's death we carried out a review of practices in our call handling centre and implemented changes to improve the way information is handled and shared.  Due to the prior contact the case was referred to the IPCC.  They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey Police following this communication."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

According to ABC News, the family was "filing a lawsuit against [[Essex]] and [[Surrey]] police over the handling of the case."&lt;ref name=Dewast /&gt; In March 2016, the family accepted a settlement in which Surrey Police apologised for their mishandling of the case, and paid an undisclosed sum in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police pay out to parents of boy murdered after online grooming |author=Aisha Gani |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=13 March 2016|accessdate=13 March 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/13/parents-of-murdered-boy-get-payout-from-police-for-mishandling-case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, [[BBC Three]] broadcast a drama-documentary about the murder entitled ''Murder Games: The Life and Death of Breck Bednar''.&lt;ref name=elgot&gt;{{cite news |title=Breck Bednar's mother says killer has blogged from prison |author=Jessica Elgot |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 January 2016|accessdate=7 February 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/27/breck-bednars-mother-says-his-killer-has-been-writing-blogs-online-from-prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged, in January 2016, that Daynes had been blogging from prison.&lt;ref name=elgot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Letter from Lewis Daynes|url=http://lewisdaynes-open-letter.blogspot.co.uk |date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 in the U.S., the story was depicted on the [[Investigation Discovery]] channel in 'Dangerous Games' episode on "Web of Lies" series.

In 2015, Bednar's murder was featured in the US series ''Stalkers Who Kill'' in the episode titled "Babyface Killer".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1523">'''Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny''' (1600 &amp;ndash; 1648) was a military person and [[seigneurial system of New France|seigneur]] in [[New France]]. He served as Governor [[Charles Huault de Montmagny|Huault de Montmagny]]'s lieutenant, as a director of the [[Communauté des habitants]] and as admiral of the fleet.&lt;ref name=cdob&gt;{{Cite DCB |ID=399 |volume=1 |last=Hamelin |first=Jean |name=Legardeur de Repentigny, Pierre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of René Legardeur de Tilly and Catherine de Cordé, he was born at [[Thury-Harcourt]] in [[France]] and came to [[Quebec City]] in June 1636, arriving with his mother, his sister Marguerite, the wife of [[Jacques Leneuf de La Poterie]], and his brother [[Charles Legardeur de Tilly]]. Legardeur helped found the Communauté des Habitants, who took over the [[fur trade]] monopoly from the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]]. In 1647, he obtained the seigneuries of Repentigny and Bécancour.&lt;ref name=cdob/&gt;

Legardeur died at sea during a return trip to Canada from France in spring 1648 after an epidemic broke out on his ship.&lt;ref name=cdob/&gt;

He had married Marie Favery. His daughter Marie-Madeleine married [[Jean-Paul Godefroy]] and his daughter Catherine married  [[Charles Joseph d'Ailleboust des Muceaux]].&lt;ref name=cdob/&gt;

== Fall ==

The Pioneer Cabin Tree fell during a rain storm and flooding on January 8, 2017.&lt;ref name="Hockaday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt; It was the strongest storm to hit the area in over a decade.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The flooding, combined with the shallow root system of giant sequoias, likely caused it to fall.&lt;ref name="Hockaday"/&gt; A park volunteer reported that the tree had been weakening, becoming brittle and leaning to one side for several years, with only a single branch remaining alive.&lt;ref name="Hockaday"/&gt; It had been weakened by the severe damage caused by the tunnel carved through its trunk.&lt;ref name="Hongo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazza"/&gt; The tree shattered on impact with the ground.&lt;ref name="Hockaday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC"/&gt;

After the fall of the tree the park trail closed for a cleanup operation.&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/travel/index.ssf/2017/01/iconic_drive-through_tree_in_c.html |title=Iconic drive-through tree in California has fallen |first1=Jamie |last1=Hale |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sections of the tree remained intact, but the park's preservation policy prevented them from being cut up, for example to determine the tree's exact age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fox40.com/2017/01/09/iconic-pioneer-cabin-tree-crashes-down-in-calaveras-county/ |title=Iconic Pioneer Cabin Tree Crashes Down in Calaveras County |last=Recede |first=Kay |date=January 9, 2017 |publisher=FOX40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tunnel Log]] is a fallen giant sequoia tree in [[Sequoia National Park]]. The tree, which measured 275 feet (84 m) tall and 21 feet (6.4 m) in diameter, fell across a park road in 1937 due to natural causes. The following year, a crew cut an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall, 17-foot (5.2 m) wide tunnel through the trunk, making the road passable again.&lt;ref name="usdf"/&gt;

There are three [[coast redwood]] trees that can be driven through near [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] in [[northern California]], namely: Klamath Tour Thru Tree; Shrine Drive-Thru Tree; and [[Chandelier Tree]].&lt;ref name="usdf"/&gt;

The loss of the Pioneer Cabin Tree occasioned an encomium to other important trees that still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/10-incredible-trees-still-visit-081449199.html |title=Lifestyle: 10 Incredible Trees You Can Still Visit, Now That Pioneer Cabin Is No More |via=[[Yahoo]] |work=[[Travel+Leisure]] |date=January 14, 2017 |accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team'''''|ポケモン不思議のダンジョン 青の救助隊|Pokemon Fushigi no Danjon Ao no Kyūjotai}} and {{nihongo|'''''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team'''''|ポケモン不思議のダンジョン 赤の救助隊|Pokemon Fushigi no Danjon Aka no Kyūjotai}} are a matched pair of ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[Pokémon (video game series)|games]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]], respectively. These two games were developed by [[Chunsoft]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]], and distributed by [[Nintendo]]. ''Red Rescue Team'' was the last Pokémon-themed video game to be released on the Game Boy Advance. The two versions are mostly identical, with ''Blue Rescue Team'' taking advantage of the dual-screen features and increased graphical and sound capabilities of the Nintendo DS. The game has six Pokémon exclusive to each version.

Similar to other ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' titles, the [[roguelike]] gameplay revolves around randomly changing dungeons which need to be explored by the player and their partner Pokémon using turn-based moves. The story focuses on the player who has been turned into a Pokémon and has developed amnesia who later joins a rescue team with a partner Pokémon while finding out who they are. The game received mixed reviews, being criticized for the repetitive nature of the changing dungeons but praised for its addictive nature. As of July 25, 2007, ''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team'' had sold 3.08 million copies worldwide. Two sequels, [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time'' and ''Explorers of Darkness'']], were released in Japan on September 13, 2007, and in North America on April 20, 2008. They featured [[List of generation IV Pokémon|Generation IV Pokémon]], improved [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Wi-Fi]] features, and more [[touchscreen]] options.

The games received moderately positive reviews, with praise for their originality, while their gameplay and poor visuals were criticized. By 2007, the two games had accumulated lifetime sales of over 5.25 million copies. ''Red Rescue Team'' and ''Blue Rescue Team'' were released on the European [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] on February 11, 2016 and on the Japanese Wii U Virtual Console on March 23, 2016. They were released on the North American Wii U Virtual Console on June 23, 2016.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:BlueRescueTeam.JPG|frame|left|The protagonist [[Psyduck]] and two teammates, [[Pikachu]] and [[Ledyba]], engage in combat with an enemy [[Breloom]], [[Doduo]], and [[Vileplume]]. The battlefield is overlaid on a grid, with [[tactical role-playing game|tactical]] commands and a map also visible on the bottom screen. More detailed team information occupies the top screen.]]
The player starts out as a human who turned into a Pokémon, which can be one of sixteen Pokémon ([[Bulbasaur]], [[Squirtle]], [[Charmander]], [[Cyndaquil]], [[Totodile]], [[Chikorita]], [[Treecko]], [[Torchic]], [[Mudkip]], [[Pikachu]], [[Eevee]], [[Machop]], [[Cubone]], [[Psyduck]], [[Meowth]], and [[Skitty]]) and is determined by a personality quiz taken at the beginning of the game.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; The player chooses a partner Pokémon which is one of ten Pokémon (which excludes the last six stated above and the Pokémon of the same [[Pokemon type|type]]).&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; The game is mission-based with many jobs, which can be found on the bulletin board, requested by mail, or initiated through story events, and include rescuing Pokémon, delivering items, and escorting clients.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; If the player successfully completes a job, they receive a reward, and Rescue Points, which increase a team's rank.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt;

These jobs take part in dungeons, of which the layout is randomized.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; The objective is to either finish a job, or go through all the floors to find the exit.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; In the dungeon, there are wild Pokémon that battle with the player's team.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; These battles are [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]], and take place in the dungeon map.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; Pokémon fight using the four [[Pokemon Move|moves]] they know, by using a standard 'A button' attack,&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; or using projectiles and other items.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; While going through the dungeon, the player gets hungry and has to eat food, either found in the dungeon or bought in advance.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt;

The player will fail if the main character is defeated. Before the credits, the player will also fail if the partner is defeated. However, supplementary allies (including the partner, after the credits) can be lost, at which point they will return to the base.

== Plot ==
The player wakes up one day finding that they have been transformed into a Pokémon,&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; without any memory of their past. In a world devastated by many [[natural disaster]]s — that have only begun to happen quite recently — &lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; the player and a newly made friend join forces and form a rescue team. The team meets other rescue teams, including a top-ranked rescue team consisting of [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Alakazam]], [[Charizard]], and [[Tyranitar]], named Team ACT. The team makes enemies unwittingly with another rescue team, Team Meanies, consisting of [[Gengar]], [[Ekans]], and [[Medicham]], who seek world domination under the disguise of a rescue team. Not far into the storyline, the player is told of a legend about a [[Ninetales]] laying a curse on a human who had deliberately grabbed Ninetales' tail. Ninetales predicted that the human would eventually be reborn as a Pokémon, and that the natural balance of the world would be upset. In the quest to discover the player's lost memory and purpose as a Pokémon, the team journeys to where the fortune-teller [[Xatu]] resides. Xatu is quick to realize that the player was once a human and tells that the player's human-to-Pokémon transformation is tied together with the natural disasters. This conversation is eavesdropped upon by Team Meanies' Gengar, who reveals the player's secret to the townsfolk and says that eliminating the human-turned-Pokémon in the legend would return the world to normal.

They are confronted by Alakazam, who says the Pokémon held a town meeting on what they must do to save the world: they must find and kill the player and anyone who sides with them. As they give the team one night to get away, the two leave Pokémon Square as fugitives and make their way to the northeasternmost part of the world in an effort to elude the teams that are now hunting them down. Along the way, they encounter the legendary birds [[Moltres]] and [[Articuno]], who feel the effects of the disasters in their respective areas. They befriend an [[Absol]] who seeks to find the true cause of the natural disasters. The trio reaches the top of Mt. Freeze only to be cornered by Team ACT. They get ready to finish the player and partner off, but are stopped by Ninetales, who reveals that the player is not the human in the legend and that the world is in greater danger caused by the awakening of [[Groudon]]. Team ACT proceeds to try and stop Groudon, while the team heads home to clear all remaining suspicion at Pokémon Square. After a few days, the player and the partner worry, as Team ACT has not come back from their mission to quell Groudon. Asking to rescue the missing Team ACT, [[Lombre]] refuses to let them go, saying there are plenty of tougher Pokémon than them. [[Shiftry]] convinces three of the strongest Pokémon, [[Blastoise]], [[Octillery]], and [[Golem (Pokemon)|Golem]], to form a special rescue team and rescue Team ACT. After a few days, the special team returns defeated.

After being discouraged by Gengar, the player and partner are able to get everyone's spirits back up, and volunteer to rescue Team ACT themselves. When the team reaches Magma Cavern, they find Charizard and Tyranitar defeated, with Alakazam fighting against Groudon alone before quickly being defeated. The team takes matters into their own hands and defeat Groudon. They return to town as heroes, but their celebration is short-lived as grave news arrives from Xatu. A huge meteor, revealed to be the true cause of the natural disasters, is heading for the world, threatening to destroy it. The only way to stop it is to ask for help from the sky guardian [[Rayquaza]]. It is less than cooperative, but after a battle, Rayquaza agrees to use its Hyper Beam to destroy the meteor. The team reawakens on the ground, surrounded by their supporters, where they find that the world is safe once again. However, the player must return to being a human and leave the Pokémon world behind. After the credits roll, the player returns to the rescue team base in Pokémon form and surprises everybody. 

As time passes, many more secrets are revealed. A shard of the destroyed meteor opens a secret cave under [[Whiscash]] Pond, enabling [[Pokemon evolution|evolution]]. It is later revealed that another shard hit [[Latias and Latios|Latias]]' wing, and the team rescues her at Pitfall Valley. It is eventually discovered that Gengar was the human from the legend; after uncomfortably getting the player's assistance, he manages to remove the part of the curse that affected his old partner [[Gardevoir]].

The game has received mixed to positive reviews. [[IGN]] rated the game a "Passable" 6.5, feeling that the DS version could have been better if it did not have to be made for Game Boy Advance. They stated, "For a game that encourages team play, it's amazing that [[Chunsoft]] missed the boat when it comes to exploring dungeons and finishing missions with a friend".&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/733/733777p1.html|title=Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Review|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=September 20, 2006|work=|accessdate=August 3, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911075111/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/20/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-review|archive-date=September 11, 2017|dead-url=No|publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been criticized for its visuals, with reviewers stating that the DS version does not improve graphically on the GBA version.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] gave it a 5.2, stating, "No matter how much you claim to love Pokémon, you should probably skip Pokémon Mystery Dungeon", further stating, "Chunsoft's dungeon hack game wasn't that good to begin with, and the injection of Pokémon elements hasn't done a thing to change that".&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/pokemonblue/review.html|title=Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team Review for DS - GameSpot|author=Provo|first=Frank|date=Sep 20, 2006|website=|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329010502/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/pokemonblue/review.html|archivedate=March 29, 2010|deadurl=|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com|1UP]] gave the games an A-, saying, "you may realize the game isn't 'perfect,' but somehow it's addictive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3153731|title=Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team|author=Barnholt|first=Ray|date=September 18, 2006|website=|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AFLEZxSi?url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/pokemon-dungeons_5|archivedate=August 28, 2012|deadurl=|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpy]] gave it a 4/5, stating, "It may confuse some and frustrate others, but its addictive nature should keep you hooked until you learn to appreciate the art of the dungeon crawl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/mysterious-dungeon/733506p1.html|title=GameSpy: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team – Page 1|author=Theobald|first=Phil|date=Sep 19, 2006|website=|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130230008/http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/mysterious-dungeon/733506p1.html|archive-date=January 30, 2016|dead-url=No|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo Power]] gave the game an 80/100, saying, "Mystery Dungeon is not perfect, but its robust and original aspects form a game more solid than many expected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 2006|title=Mystery Dungeon is not perfect, but its robust and original aspects form a game more solid than many expected|series=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|page=86|editor=Chris Slate}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-04-19--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] gave the game a 7.2/10, stating, "storing and retrieving items is too much of a hassle"; they also did not like that when the player faints, they lose all of their valuable items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 2006|title=storing and retrieving items is too much of a hassle|series=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|page=138|editor=James "Milkman" Mielke}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-04-19--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheeled animal - East Mexico cultures - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC00852.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A toy animal with wheels, from [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mexico]]{{r|Gambino}}|alt=A toy animal with wheels]]
[[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|Several organisms]] are capable of [[rolling]] locomotion; however, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s—despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s—do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial_locomotion#Limbless_locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.&lt;!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article--&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Known instances of rotation in biology==
There exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}

===Rolling===
[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]
{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}
Some organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}

[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name="Howey"/&gt; Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}

[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.&lt;ref name="ABN"/&gt;

[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}

}}
Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of [[mucus]]. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases [[digestive enzyme]]s.{{r|owen}} Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style ''in vivo'' vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.{{r|kristensen}}

====Molecular====
There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells.{{r|Oster}} [[ATP synthase]] is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer.{{r|Feniouk}} It bears some similarity to the [[flagellum|flagellar motors]] discussed below.{{r|Crofts}} ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by [[mosaic evolution|modular evolution]], in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.{{r|Falk}}

[[File:Physical model of a bacterial flagellum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Model of the base of a bacterial flagellum, a true biological example of a freely rotating structure|alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum]]
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive [[torque]] about a fixed body—is the  [[flagellum]], a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled [[prokaryote]]s for propulsion.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}} The [[bacterial flagellum]] is the best known example.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|gebremichael}} About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.{{r|goldsworthy}}

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a [[motor protein]] acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral_bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}

[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as [[archaellum |archaella]] – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili |type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}

Some [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}

==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}

===Evolutionary constraints===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness "valley" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}

According to [[neo-Darwinism]], adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728–729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]]."{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}

Molecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}
{{clear}}

===Developmental and anatomical constraints===
{{Wikibooks|Biomechanics}}
Using human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as "wheels", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface in order to generate forward motion.{{r|Bräunl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

====Power transmission to driven wheels====
[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]
In the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}

====Friction====
Reducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2–3}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}

====Nutrient and waste transfer====
Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]], of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}

==Disadvantages of wheels==
Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}

===Efficiency===

====Rolling resistance====
[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on—and deforming—a soft surface, resulting in the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', which has a component that opposes the motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the portion of the vehicle being supported; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''N'' is the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] from the surface; ''r'' is the radius of wheel.)]]

Although stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}

====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====
When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}

===Traction===
Wheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]—an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}—but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}
{{clear}}

===Obstacle navigation===
[[File:Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Mountain goats on rocky terrain|A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape. Mountain goats illustrate the versatility of legs in challenging terrain.]]
Work by engineer [[Mieczysław G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400–401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}

====Going around====
Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}

====Going over====
Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}

In addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402–403}}

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

===Versatility===
Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}

{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}
Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia.{{r|Full93}}

===Rolling creatures===
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}} [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described and illustrated in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.{{r|de_Plancy_1825}}{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in [[Curl-up|a 1951 lithograph]].{{r|Escher}} Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author [[Carl Barks]],{{r|Andrae}} science fiction writers [[Fredric Brown]],{{r|Brown}} [[George R. R. Martin]],{{r|martin}} and [[Joan Slonczewski]],{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}} and in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

===Wheeled creatures===
Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D. Simak]],{{r|Simak}} [[Piers Anthony]],{{r|anthony}} [[David Brin]],{{r|Brin95}} [[K. A. Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9942">'''Social network aggregation''' is the process of collecting content from multiple [[social network service]]s, such as [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], [[Flickr]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[YouTube]],  [[List of social networking websites|etc.]] into one unified presentation. The task is often performed by a social network aggregator (such as [[Hootsuite]], [https://taggbox.com Taggbox] and [[FriendFeed]]), which pulls together information into a single location,&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070615_141976.htm |title=When Your Social Sites Need Networking |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Rachael King |date=2007-06-18 |work=[[BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or helps a user consolidate multiple social networking profiles into one profile.&lt;ref name=mashable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2007/07/17/social-network-aggregators/ |title=20 Ways To Aggregate Your Social Networking Profiles |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Stan Schroeder |date=2007-07-17 |publisher=[[Mashable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various aggregation services provide tools or [[GUI widget|widgets]] to allow users to consolidate messages, track friends, combine bookmarks, search across multiple social networking sites, read [[RSS feed]]s for multiple social networks, see when their name is mentioned on various sites, access their profiles from a single interface, provide "lifestreams", etc.&lt;ref name=mashable/&gt; Social network aggregation services attempt to organize or simplify a user's social networking experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Upstart websites aim to consolidate social networking |author=Beth Snyder Bulik |date=2007-06-18 |publisher=[[Advertising Age]] |quote= The latest trend in the space is aggregation-websites...[which] all present variations on the theme of organizing or simplifying a consumer's social-networking experience. }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea has been satirized by the concept of a "social network aggregator aggregator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspot.com/News/2008/03/social-network-aggregator-aggregator-launched.html |title=Social Network Aggregator Aggregator AllMyFrickingFriends.com Launched |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Brian Briggs |date=2008-03-17 |publisher=[[BBSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other related uses of social media aggregators aside from simplifying the user's social networking experiences. Some aggregators are designed to help companies (and bloggers) improve engagement with their brand(s) by creating aggregated social streams that can be embedded into an existing website and customized to look visually intrinsic to the site. This allows potential customers to interact with all the social media posts maintained by the brand without requiring them to jump from site to site. This has the benefit of keeping customers on the brand's site for a longer period of time (increasing "time on site" metrics).

==Social network aggregators==
Social network aggregation platforms allow social network members to share social network activities like [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Stumbleupon]], [[Digg]], [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]], with other major platforms. All content appears in real time to other members who subscribe to a particular community, which eliminates the need to jump from one [[social media]] network to another, trying to keep an eye on one's interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.justmoved.in/2008/04/01/social-aggregation-defragment-your-online-life/|title=Social Aggregation: defragment your online life|date=April 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229172414/http://tech.justmoved.in/2008/04/01/social-aggregation-defragment-your-online-life/|archivedate=December 29, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social network aggregation systems can rely on initiation by publishers or by readers. In the publisher-initiated aggregation systems, the publishers combine their own identities, which make their readers see all aggregated content once subscribed. In the reader-initiated systems (such as [[Windows Phone 7]] people hub&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/features/default.aspx|title=Windows Phone 7 Features|accessdate=2011-11-11 |author=Microsoft |work=[[Microsoft]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Linked Internet UI&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://research.nokia.com/page/5457 |title= Linked Internet UI Concept|accessdate=2011-11-11 |author=Nokia |date=2009-09-02 | work= [[Nokia]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), the readers combine the identities of others, which has no impact on the publishers or other readers. The publishers can still keep separate identities for different readers.

Technically, the aggregation is enabled by [[API]]s provided by social networks. For the API to access a user's actions from another platform, the user will have to give permission to the social-aggregation platform, by specifying the user-id and password of the social media to be syndicated. This concept resembles [[open ID]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alchemi.co.uk/archives/hum/aggregation_of_.html |title=Aggregation of data across social networks |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=David Jennings |date=2005-08-03 |publisher=alchemi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that [[social network service]]s are only beginning the move away from "walled gardens" to more open architectures.  Some sites are working together on a "data portability workgroup", while others are focusing on a single sign-on system called [[OpenID]] to allow users to log on across multiple sites.  Historically, the trend from private services to more open ones can be seen across many Internet services from email and instant messaging to the move that early [[online service provider]]s made to become websites.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880936 |title=Everywhere and nowhere |accessdate=2008-04-10 |date=2008-03-19 |publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[OpenSocial]] initiative aims to bridge the member overlap between various online social network services.&lt;ref name=alexp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.compete.com/2007/11/12/connecting-the-social-graph-member-overlap-at-opensocial-and-facebook/ |title=Connecting the Social Graph: Member Overlap at OpenSocial and Facebook |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Alex Patriquin |date=2007-11-12 |publisher=[[Compete.com]] blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap between multiple social-network services==
The attraction of social network aggregation comes from the fact that some users tend to use multiple social networks: they have accounts on several social-networking sites.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; In November 2007, Alex Patriquin of [[Compete.com]] reported on the member overlap between various online social network services:&lt;ref name="alexp"/&gt;

A '''space habitat''' (also called a '''space colony''', '''space settlement''', '''orbital habitat''', '''orbital settlement''' or '''orbital colony''') is a type of [[space station]], intended as a [[space colonization|permanent settlement]] rather than as a simple way-station or other specialized facility.  No space habitat has been constructed yet, but many design concepts, with varying degrees of realism, have come both from engineers and from science-fiction authors.

The term ''space habitat'' sometimes includes more broadly [[space colonization|colonies built on or in a body other than Earth]] - such as the Moon, Mars or an asteroid. This article concentrates on self-contained structures envisaged for [[micro-g environment]]s.

Several motivations for building [[space colonization|space colonies]] have been proposed:
* Survival of human [[civilization]] and the [[biosphere]], in case of a disaster on the Earth (natural or man-made)&lt;ref name=Doehring&gt;{{cite web | author= Doehring, James| url=http://www.lifeboat.com/ex/space.habitats | title= Space Habitats | website= lifeboat.com | publisher= Lifeboat Foundation | accessdate= 29 June 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Huge resources in space for expansion of human society
* Expansion without any [[ecosystem]]s to destroy or [[indigenous peoples]] to displace
* It could help the Earth by relieving population pressure and taking industry off-Earth.
(See: [[space colonization#Reasons|Reasons for space colonization]] or [[Space and survival]].)

==Advantages==
A number of arguments are made for space habitats having a number of advantages:

===Access to solar energy===
Space has an abundance of light produced from the Sun. In Earth orbit, this amounts to 1400 watts of power per square meter.&lt;ref name=KoppLean11&gt;{{cite journal|last=G. Kopp|author2=J. Lean |title=A new, lower value of total solar irradiance: Evidence and climate significance|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett.|volume=38 |issue=1 |year=2011|pages=L01706|doi=10.1029/2010GL045777|bibcode = 2011GeoRL..38.1706K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This energy can be used to produce electricity from [[Photovoltaics|solar cells]] or [[heat engine]] based power stations, process ores, provide light for plants to grow and to warm space colonies.

===Outside gravity well===
Earth-to-space habitat trade would be easier than Earth-to-planetary colony trade, as colonies orbiting Earth will not have a [[gravity well]] to overcome to export to Earth, and a smaller gravity well to overcome to import from Earth.

===In-situ resource utilization===
Space habitats may be supplied with resources from extraterrestrial places like [[Mars]], [[asteroid]]s, or the [[Moon]] ([[in-situ resource utilization]] [ISRU];&lt;ref name=Doehring /&gt; see [[Asteroid mining]]). One could produce breathing oxygen, drinking water, and rocket fuel with the help of ISRU.&lt;ref name=Doehring /&gt; It may become possible to manufacture solar panels from lunar materials.&lt;ref name=Doehring /&gt;

===Asteroids and other small bodies===
Most asteroids have a mixture of materials, that could be mined, and because these bodies do not have substantial gravity wells, it would require low delta-V to [[Asteroid mining|draw materials from them]] and haul them to a construction site.&lt;ref name="Pournelle, Jerrold E. 1977"/&gt;&lt;!--there are issues of delta-V to access Main Belt asteroids, but for NEAs, it's less than a GEO-Luna-GEO or L5-Luna-L5... Sad to say, I don't have any of these 3 at hand...--&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There is estimated to be enough material in the main asteroid belt alone to build enough space habitats to equal the habitable surface area of 3,000 Earths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/Chapt7.html#LIM "Limits to Growth"], Chapter 7, ''Space Settlements: A Design Study''. NASA, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
A 1974 estimate assumed that collection of all the material in the main asteroid belt would allow habitats may be constructed to give an immense total population capacity.{{clarify |date= September 2018| reason= poorly / wrongly worded}}  Using the free-floating resources of the Solar System, this estimate extended into the trillions.&lt;ref name=cos&gt;{{cite journal | author= O'Neill, Gerard K. | title= The Colonization of Space | journal= Physics Today | volume= 27 | issue= 9 | pages= 32–40 | date= September 1974 | url= http://www.nss.org/settlement/physicstoday.htm | bibcode= 1974PhT....27i..32O | doi= 10.1063/1.3128863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero g recreation===
If a large area at the rotation axis is enclosed, various zero-g sports are possible, including swimming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | conference= Space 98: Sixth International Conference and Exposition on Engineering, Construction, and Operations in Space | location= Albuquerque, New Mexico | url= http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/artificial_gravity_swimming_pool.shtml | title= Artificial-Gravity Swimming-Pool | last1= Collins | first1= Patrick |display-authors=etal}} April 26–30, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalpana" /&gt; [[hang gliding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/ColoniesInSpace/colonies_chap11.html | title=Colonies in Space, Chapter 11: What's to Do on Saturday Night ? |date=1977 | accessdate=30 January 2012 | author=T. A. Heppenheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of [[human-powered aircraft]].

===Passenger compartment===
A space habitat can be the passenger compartment of a large spacecraft for colonizing [[asteroid]]s, moons, and planets. It can also function as one for a [[generation ship]] for travel to other planets (see: [[Space and survival]]) or distant stars (L. R. Shepherd described a generation starship in 1952 comparing it to a small planet with many people living in it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Shepherd | first= L. R. | title= Interstellar Flight | periodical= Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | volume= 11 | date= July 1952 | pages= 149–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Les Shepherd, RIP | author= Gilster, Paul | date= 28 February 2012 | website= centauri-dreams.org | url= http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=21895 | accessdate= 1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Requirements==
[[File:Cupola above the darkened Earth.jpg|thumb|400px|The airglow above the horizon, captured from the [[International Space Station|ISS]].]]
The requirements for a space habitat are many. They would have to provide all the material needs for hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life.

===Atmosphere===
Air [[pressure]], with normal partial pressures of [[oxygen]](21%), [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]](78%), is a basic requirement of any space habitat. Basically, most space colony designs concepts envision large, thin-walled pressure vessels. The required oxygen could be obtained from lunar rock. Nitrogen is most easily available from the Earth, but is also recycled nearly perfectly.  Also, nitrogen in the form of ammonia ([[ammonia|{{chem|NH|3}}]]) may be obtainable from comets and the moons of outer planets.  Nitrogen may also be available in unknown quantities on certain other bodies in the [[outer solar system]]. The air of a colony could be recycled in a number of ways. One concept is to use [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[gardening|garden]]s, possibly via [[hydroponics]], or [[forest gardening]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} However, these do not remove certain industrial pollutants, such as volatile oils, and excess simple molecular gases. The standard method used on [[nuclear submarines]], a similar form of closed environment, is to use a [[catalytic]] burner, which effectively decomposes most organics. Further protection might be provided by a small cryogenic distillation system which would gradually remove impurities such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, and noble gases that cannot be catalytically burned. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Food production===
[[Organic chemistry|Organic]] materials for food production would also need to be provided. At first, most of these would have to be imported from Earth. {{cn|date=January 2018}} After that, feces recycling should reduce the need for imports.{{cn|date=January 2018}} One proposed recycling method would start by burning the cryogenic distillate, plants, garbage and sewage with air in an electric arc, and distilling the result.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The resulting carbon dioxide and water would be immediately usable in agriculture. The nitrates and salts in the ash could be dissolved in water and separated into pure minerals. Most of the nitrates, potassium and sodium salts would recycle as fertilizers. Other minerals containing iron, nickel, and silicon could be chemically purified in batches and reused industrially. The small fraction of remaining materials, well below 0.01% by weight, could be processed into pure elements with zero-gravity [[mass spectrometry]], and added in appropriate amounts to the fertilizers and industrial stocks. It is likely that methods would be greatly refined as people began to actually live in space habitats.

===Artificial gravity===
{{Main|Artificial gravity}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Long-term on-orbit studies have proven that zero gravity weakens bones and muscles, and upsets calcium metabolism and immune systems. Most people have a continual stuffy nose or sinus problems, and a few people have dramatic, incurable motion sickness. Most colony designs would rotate in order to use [[inertia]]l forces to [[Artificial gravity|simulate gravity]]. NASA studies with chickens and plants have proven that this is an effective physiological substitute for gravity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Turning one's head rapidly in such an environment causes a "tilt" to be sensed as one's inner ears move at different rotational rates. Centrifuge studies show that people get motion-sick in habitats with a rotational radius of less than 100 metres, or with a rotation rate above 3 rotations per minute. However, the same studies and statistical inference indicate that almost all people should be able to live comfortably in habitats with a rotational radius larger than 500 meters and below 1 RPM. Experienced persons were not merely more resistant to motion sickness, but could also use the effect to determine "spinward" and "antispinward" directions in the centrifuges.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Protection from radiation===
[[File:Mars Ice Home concept.jpg|thumb|300px|Langley's Mars Ice Dome design from 2016 for a Mars base, uses frozen water to enhance protection]]
Some very large space habitat designs could be effectively shielded from [[cosmic ray]]s by their structure and air.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Smaller habitats could be shielded by stationary (nonrotating) bags of rock.  Sunlight could be admitted indirectly via mirrors in radiation-proof louvres, which would function in the same manner as a [[periscope]].

:For instance, 4 metric tons per square meter of surface area could reduce radiation dosage to several mSv or less annually, below the rate of some populated [[background radiation|high natural background areas]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html "Mass Shielding"], Appendix E, ''Space Settlements: A Design Study''. NASA (SP-413), 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative concepts based on active shielding are untested yet and more complex than such passive mass shielding, but usage of magnetic and/or electric fields to deflect particles could potentially greatly reduce mass requirements.&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding&gt;{{cite web | url= http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/ | title= Spacecraft Shielding | author= Shepherd, Simon George | website= dartmouth.edu | publisher= Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College | accessdate= 3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If a space habitat is located at [[Lagrangian point#L4 and L5|L4 or&amp;nbsp;L5]], then its orbit will take it outside of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time (as happens with the Moon), putting residents at risk of [[Proton#Exposure|proton exposure]] from the [[solar wind]].
:See ''[[Health threat from cosmic rays]]''

===Heat rejection===
The colony is in a vacuum, and therefore resembles a giant thermos bottle. Habitats also need a [[radiator]] to eliminate heat from absorbed sunlight. Very small habitats might have a central vane that rotates with the colony. In this design, [[convection]] would raise hot air "up" (toward the center), and cool air would fall down into the outer habitat. Some other designs would distribute coolants, such as chilled water from a central radiator.

===Meteoroids and dust===
The habitat would need to withstand potential impacts from [[space debris]], [[meteoroid]]s, dust,&amp;nbsp;etc. Most meteoroids that strike the earth vaporize in the atmosphere. Without a thick protective atmosphere meteoroid strikes would pose a much greater risk to a space habitat.  [[Radar]] will sweep the space around each habitat mapping the trajectory of debris and other man-made objects and allowing corrective actions to be taken to protect the habitat.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;!-- on what basis is this claim made?  "will sweep ..."  and "allowing corrective action...".  Even in low-Earth orbit, these orbital speeds are thousands of meters per second, and there is no source to show that large habitats might easily avoid them with radar. --&gt;
In some designs (O'Neill/NASA Ames "Stanford Torus" and "Crystal palace in a Hatbox" habitat designs have a non-rotating cosmic ray shield of packed sand (~1.9m thick) or even artificial aggregate rock (1.7m ersatz concrete). Other proposals use the rock as structure and integral shielding (O'Neill, "the High Frontier". Sheppard, "Concrete Space Colonies"; Spaceflight, journal of the B.I.S.) In any of these cases, strong meteoroid protection is implied by the external radiation shell ~4.5tonnes of rock material, per square meter.
Suggestions have been made to layer such protections around a habitat, multiple thicknesses, up to such protection to equal an Earth city (which after all, is completely vulnerable to total obliteration at any second without notice, under the open sky. A small rock such as hit near Chelyabinsk in 2013 being too numerous and hard to detect for any mitigation scenario or advance warning.) With such a shell, mass of a colony goes up sharply, but it is only dumb structure -possibly non-rotating, and rock-dust as industrial slag is a free left-over from processing regolith for metals or volatiles extraction.
Note that Solar Power Satellites are proposed in the multi-gW ranges, and such energies and technologies would allow constant radar mapping of nearby 3D space out-to arbitrarily far away, limited only by effort expended to do so.
Proposals are available to move even kilometer-sized NEOs to high Earth orbits, and reaction engines for such purposes would move a space colony and any arbitrarily large shield, but not in any timely or rapid manner, the thrust being very low compared to the huge mass.

===Attitude control===
Most mirror geometries require something on the habitat to be aimed at the sun and so [[attitude control]] is necessary. The original O'Neill design used the two cylinders as [[momentum wheel]]s to roll the colony, and pushed the sunward pivots together or apart to use [[precession]] to change their angle.

==Considerations==

===Initial capital outlay===
Even the smallest of the habitat designs mentioned below are more massive than the total mass of all items that humans have ever launched into Earth orbit combined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Prerequisites to building habitats are either cheaper launch costs or a mining and manufacturing base on the Moon or other body having low [[delta-v]] from the desired habitat location.&lt;ref name="Pournelle, Jerrold E. 1977"/&gt;&lt;!--Sad to say, I don't have these at hand...but it's in there.--&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Location===
The optimal habitat orbits are still debated, and so [[orbital stationkeeping]] is probably a commercial issue. The lunar {{L4}} and {{L5}} orbits are now thought to be too far away from the moon and Earth. A more modern proposal is to use a two-to-one resonance orbit that alternately has a close, low-energy (cheap) approach to the Moon, and then to the Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} This provides quick, inexpensive access to both raw materials and the major market. Most colony designs plan to use [[tether propulsion|electromagnetic tether propulsion]], or [[mass driver]]s used as rocket motors. The advantage of these is that they either use no reaction mass at all, or use cheap reaction mass.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Conceptual studies==
[[File:Noordung space station.jpg|thumb|Description of a rotating wheel space station in [[Hermann Noordung]]'s ''The Problem of Space Travel'' (1929)]]

===O'Neill - The High Frontier===
Around 1970, near the end of [[Project Apollo]] (1961-1972), [[Gerard K. O'Neill]], an experimental physicist at [[Princeton University]], was looking for a topic to tempt his physics students, most of them [[freshmen]] in engineering. He hit upon the  idea of assigning them feasibility calculations for large space-habitats. To his surprise, the habitats seemed feasible even in very large sizes: cylinders {{convert|8|km|abbr=on|0}} in diameter and {{convert|32|km|abbr=on|0}} long, even if made from ordinary materials such as steel and glass. Also, the students solved problems such as radiation protection from cosmic rays (almost free in the larger sizes), getting naturalistic Sun angles, provision of power, realistic pest-free farming and orbital attitude control without reaction motors. O'Neill published an article about these colony concepts  in ''[[Physics Today]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref name=cos /&gt; (See the above illustration of such a colony, a classic "O'Neill Colony").  He expanded the article in his 1976 book ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]''.

====NASA Ames/Stanford 1975 Summer Study====
The result motivated [[NASA]] to sponsor a couple of summer workshops led by O'Neill.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | url= http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/SpaceSettlement/75SummerStudy/Table_of_Contents1.html | title= Space Settlements: A Design Study | year= 1975 | publisher= NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/spaceres/toc.html | title= Ames Summer Study on Space Settlements and Industrialization Using Nonterrestial Materials | year= 1977 | publisher= NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several concepts were studied, with sizes ranging from 1,000 to 10,000,000 people.&lt;ref name="Pournelle, Jerrold E. 1977"&gt;{{cite book | author= Pournelle, Jerrold E., Dr. | title= A Step Farther Out | year= 1980 | isbn= 978-0491029414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= O'Neill, Gerard K., Dr. | title= The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space | publisher= New York: William Morrow &amp; Company | year= 1977| title-link= The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heppenheimer, Fred, Dr. ''Habitats in Space''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Sad to say, I don't have these at hand...but it's in there.--&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} including versions of the [[Stanford torus]]. Three concepts were presented to NASA: the Bernal Sphere, the Toroidal Colony and the Cylindrical Colony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/nasa-ames-oneill-space-colonies-1975/index.html ''Space oddity: NASA's retro guide to future living'' May 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neill's concepts had an example of a payback scheme: construction of [[solar power satellite]]s from lunar materials. O'Neill did not emphasize the building of solar power satellites as such, but rather offered proof that orbital manufacturing from lunar materials could generate profits. He and other participants presumed that once such manufacturing facilities had started production, many profitable uses for them would be found, and the colony would become self-supporting and begin to build other colonies as well.

The concept studies generated a notable groundswell of public interest. One effect of this expansion was the founding of the [[L5 Society|L5&amp;nbsp;Society]] in the&amp;nbsp;U.S., a group of enthusiasts that desired to build and live in such colonies. The group was named after the space-colony orbit which was then believed to be the most profitable, a kidney-shaped orbit around either of Earth's lunar [[Lagrange point]]s 5 or&amp;nbsp;4.

====Space Studies Institute====
In 1977 O'Neill founded the [[Space Studies Institute]], which initially funded and constructed some prototypes of the new hardware needed for a [[space colonization]] effort, as well as producing a number of feasibility studies. One of the early projects, for instance, involved a series of functional prototypes of a [[mass driver]], the essential technology for moving [[ore]]s efficiently from the Moon to space colony orbits.

===NASA concepts===
Some NASA concept studies included:
* [[Bernal sphere#Island One|Island One]], a Bernal sphere habitat for about 10,000 - 20,000 people. 
* [[Stanford torus]]: an alternative to Island One.
* [[O'Neill cylinder]]: "Island Three", an even larger design (3.2 km radius and 32 km long).
* Lewis One:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://alglobus.net/NASAwork/papers/RNR-91-018/RNR-91-018.html| title=Lewis One Space Colony| first=Al| last=Globus| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cylinder of radius 250&amp;nbsp;m with a non rotating radiation shielding. The shielding protects the micro-gravity industrial space, too. The rotating part is 450m long and has several inner cylinders. Some of them are used for agriculture.
* Kalpana One, revised:&lt;ref name="Kalpana"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://alglobus.net/NASAwork/papers/2007KalpanaOne.pdf|title=The Kalpana One Orbital Space Settlement Revised|first=Al|last=Globus|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short cylinder with 250 m radius and 325 m length. The radiation shielding is 10 t/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and rotates. It has several inner cylinders for agriculture and recreaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kalpana One Orbital Space Settlement|url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/space/kalpana.htm|website=National Space Society|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryan|first1=Versteeg|title=Kalpana One Animation Video|url=http://www.spacehabs.com/kalpana-one-2/|website=spacehabs.com|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalpana One|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hingjP-BmvA|publisher=youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sized for 3,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Kalpana/KalpanaOne.html ''Kalpana One Space Settlement'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* A bola: a spacecraft or habitat connected by a cable to a [[counterweight]] or other habitat. This design has been proposed as a Mars ship, initial construction shack for a space habitat, and [[transhab|orbital hotel]]. It has a comfortably long and slow rotational radius for a relatively small station mass. Also, if some of the equipment can form the counter-weight, the equipment dedicated to artificial gravity is just a cable, and thus has a much smaller mass-fraction than in other concepts. For a long-term habitation, however, radiation shielding must rotate with the habitat, and is extremely heavy, thus requiring a much stronger and heavier cable.&lt;ref name="minimized" /&gt;
* Beaded habitats:&lt;ref name="minimized"&gt;{{cite conference | last= Curreri | first= Peter A. | title= A Minimized Technological Approach towards Human Self Sufficiency off Earth | conference= Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF) Conference | location= Albuquerque, NM | url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070032685_2007018823.pdf}} 11–15 February 2007. Retrieved 18 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This speculative design was also considered by the NASA studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/Chapt4.html|title="Space Settlements: A Design Study," Chapter 4.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small habitats would be mass-produced to standards that allow the habitats to interconnect. A single habitat can operate alone as a bola. However, further habitats can be attached, to grow into a "dumbbell" then a "bow-tie", then a ring, then a cylinder of "beads", and finally a framed array of cylinders. Each stage of growth shares more radiation shielding and capital equipment, increasing redundancy and safety while reducing the cost per person. This concept was originally proposed by a professional architect because it can grow much like Earth-bound cities, with incremental individual investments, unlike those that require large start-up investments. The main disadvantage is that the smaller versions use a large structure to support the radiation shielding, which rotates with them. In large sizes, the shielding becomes economical, because it grows roughly as the square of the colony radius. The number of people, their habitats, and the radiators to cool them grow roughly as the cube of the colony radius.

===Other concepts===

*Bubbleworld: The Bubbleworld or Inside/Outside concept was originated by [[Dandridge MacFarlan Cole|Dandridge M. Cole]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt; The concept calls for drilling a tunnel through the longest axis of a large asteroid of iron or nickel-iron composition and filling it with a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] substance, possibly water. A very large solar reflector would be constructed nearby, focusing solar heat onto the asteroid, first to weld and seal the tunnel ends, then more diffusely to slowly heat the entire outer surface. As the metal softens, the water inside expands and inflates the mass, while rotational forces help shape it into a cylindrical form. Once expanded and allowed to cool, it can be spun to produce artificial gravity by centrifugation, and the interior filled with soil, air and water. By creating a slight bulge in the middle of the cylinder, a ring-shaped lake can be made to form. Reflectors would allow sunlight to enter and to be directed where needed. This method would require a significant human and industrial presence in space to be at all feasible. The concept was popularized by [[science fiction]] author [[Larry Niven]] in his [[Known Space]] stories, describing such worlds as the primary habitats of the [[Belter (Niven)|Belters]], a civilization who had [[Colonization of the asteroids|colonized the asteroid belt]].
* [[Terrarium (space habitat)|Asteroid terrarium]]: a similar idea to the bubble world, the asteroid terrarium, appears in the novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', authored by [[hard science fiction]] writer [[Kim Stanley Robinson]].
*[[Bishop Ring (habitat)|Bishop Ring]]: a speculative design using [[carbon nanotube]]s, a Bishop Ring is a torus 1000&amp;nbsp;km in radius, 500&amp;nbsp;km in width, and with atmosphere retention walls 200&amp;nbsp;km in height. The habitat would be large enough that it could be "roofless", open to outer space on the inner rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.iase.cc/openair.htm | title= Open Air Space Habitats | first= Forrest | last= Bishop | website= iase.cc | publisher= Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering | year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[McKendree cylinder]]: another concept that would use carbon nanotubes, a McKendree cylinder is paired cylinders in the same vein as the Island Three concept, but each 460&amp;nbsp;km in radius and 4600&amp;nbsp;km long (versus 3.2&amp;nbsp;km radius and 32&amp;nbsp;km long in the Island Three).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title= Implications of Molecular Nanotechnology Technical Performance Parameters on Previously Defined Space System Architectures | conference= The Fourth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology | first= Thomas Lawrence | last= McKendree | location= Palo Alto, California, USA | url= http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/nano4/mckendreePaper.html#RTFToC17}} 9–11 November 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current projects==
The following projects and proposals, while not truly space habitats, incorporate aspects of what they would have and may represent stepping stones towards eventually building of space habitats.

The [[Nautilus-X]] Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV): this 2011 NASA proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle included an [[artificial gravity]] compartment intended to promote crew-health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years duration.  The [[gravity|partial-g]] [[torus|torus-ring]] [[centrifuge]] would utilize both standard metal-frame and [[Inflatable space habitat|inflatable]] spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to {{nowrap|0.69[[Standard gravity|g]]}} if built with the {{convert|40|ft}} diameter option.

The [[International Space Station|ISS]] [[Nautilus-X#ISS centrifuge demonstration|Centrifuge Demo]], also proposed in 2011 as a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle.  The structure would have an outside diameter of {{convert|30|ft}} with a {{convert|30|in}} ring interior cross-section diameter and would provide 0.08 to {{nowrap|0.51g}} partial gravity.  This test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a Sleep Module for ISS crew.

The [[Bigelow Commercial Space Station]] was announced in mid-2010. The initial build-out of the station is expected in 2014/2015. Bigelow has publicly shown space station design configurations with up to nine modules containing {{convert|100000|cuft|abbr=on}} of habitable space. Bigelow began to publicly refer to the initial configuration as "Space Complex Alpha" in October 2010.

==History==
The idea of space habitats either in fact or fiction goes back to the second half of the 19th century. "[[The Brick Moon]]", a fictional story written in 1869 by Edward Everett Hale, is perhaps the first treatment of this idea in writing. In 1903, space pioneer [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] speculated about rotating cylindrical space colonies, with plants fed by the sun, in ''Beyond Planet Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Tsiolkovsky. ''Beyond Planet Earth'' Trans. by Kenneth Syers.

==In fiction==
The space habitats have inspired a large number of fictional societies in [[science fiction]]. Some of the most popular and recognizable are in the Japanese [[Gundam]] universe, [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|the space station]] [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]] and [[Babylon 5 (space station)|the space station]] [[Babylon 5]].

The 2013 science-fiction movie ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'' takes place on both a ravaged [[Earth]], and a luxurious [[rotating wheel space station]] called Elysium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=80039|title=SDCC: 'Elysium' Viral Launches|work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=CraveOnline Media, LLC|date=July 20, 2011|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 epic film ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', the main character Joseph Cooper wakes up on a space station orbiting Saturn toward the movie's climax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2059">A '''thalamic stimulator''' is a relatively new medical device that can suppress [[tremor]]s, such as those caused by [[Parkinson's Disease]] or [[essential tremor]].  It was approved for use by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on August 4, 1997.  Installation is invasive, so it is typically only used when the tremors are incapacitating, and medication is ineffective.  Typically, one or more electrodes are implanted in the [[brain]], with [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] leads to a [[neurostimulator]], which may also be implanted.  The electrodes stimulate the area of the [[thalamus]], specifically the part of the brain that controls movement and muscle function.

It is notable that the presence of thalamic stimulators significantly changes [[ECG]] patterns, and prevents the use of [[MRI]].  It is sometimes regarded as a better alternative to [[pallidotomy]] or [[thalamotomy]] because it is non-permanent.  For optimal installation, the patient is awake during the procedure, and talks to the surgeon to find the best placement.  Once in place, the device can be activated and deactivated, for improved effectiveness during the day.

Risks arising from the operation are [[infection]], [[stroke]] and [[dysarthria]].

A fictional treatment of the device, out decades before the device itself, can be found in the novel ''[[The Terminal Man]]''.

'''Thomas van Aalten''' (born September 26, 1978 in [[Huissen]], [[Gelderland]]) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] writer. He made his debut with a story in the [[literature|literary]] magazine ''Zoetermeer'', at the age of 19. Van Aalten has written the novels ''Sneeuwbeeld'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Likkende vlammen, rottende schedels, instortende nieuwbouw |url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2000/04/08/2437513/Likkende_vlammen__rottende_schedels__instortende_nieuwbouw.html |work=[[Trouw]] |date=8 April 2000 |accessdate=24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tupelo'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De vervreemding is volledig |url=http://www.recensieweb.nl/recensie/1796/De+vervreemding+is+volledig.html |work=Recensieweb |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=24 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727075004/http://www.recensieweb.nl/recensie/1796/De+vervreemding+is+volledig.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sluit Deuren en Ramen'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boeken fictie |url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2003/05/24/2183993/BOEKEN_FICTIE.html |work=[[Trouw]] |date=24 May 2003 |accessdate=24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coyote'' (2006) and ''De Onderbreking'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De Onderbreking |url=http://llink.nl/obalive/viewpage.php?page=toonuitzending&amp;datum=2009-01-19 |work=[[LLiNK]] |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=24 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710114629/http://llink.nl/obalive/viewpage.php?page=toonuitzending&amp;datum=2009-01-19 |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several articles for magazines such as [[3VOOR12]], [[Passionate]], VARA TV Magazine, Revu and [[Vrij Nederland]]. Van Aalten's style is characterized by absurd dialogues, creepy atmospheres and strange characters. He is a [[F.C. St. Pauli]] enthusiast and fan of rock music like [[Motörhead]], [[The Sisters of Mercy]]. Van Aalten also often works together with Berlin-based burlesque filmmaker [[Edwin Brienen]].

His 'fifth novel' was a stunt; ''Exile'' appeared only on a mobile phone after sending an SMS text message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Roman alleen op mobieltje |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/multimedia/article405362.ece/Roman_alleen_op_mobieltje |work=[[De Volkskrant]] |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story contained comments on the abuse of new technologies.

'''Transcranial magnetic stimulation''' ('''TMS''') is a form of [[neurostimulation]]. TMS is a non-invasive procedure in which a changing [[magnetic field]] is used to cause [[electric current]] to flow in a small targeted region of the brain via [[electromagnetic induction]]. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator, or "coil", is placed on the [[scalp]].&lt;ref name="NICE2014"&gt;NiCE. January 2014 [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/IPG477 Transcranial magnetic stimulation for treating and preventing migraine]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  The coil is connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers a changing electric current to the coil.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;Michael Craig Miller for  Harvard Health Publications.

TMS is used diagnostically to measure the connection between the central nervous system and skeletal muscle to evaluate damage in a wide variety of disease states, including [[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[movement disorder]]s, and [[motor neuron disease]]s.&lt;ref name=diagnostic1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groppa | first1 = S | last2 = Oliviero | first2 = A | last3 = Eisen | first3 = A | last4 = Quartarone | first4 = A | last5 = Cohen | first5 = LG | last6 = Mall | first6 = V | last7 = Kaelin-Lang | first7 = A | last8 = Mima | first8 = T | last9 = Rossi | first9 = S | last10 = Thickbroom | first10 = GW | last11 = Rossini | first11 = PM | last12 = Ziemann | first12 = U | last13 = Valls-Solé | first13 = J | last14 = Siebner | first14 = HR | title = A practical guide to diagnostic transcranial magnetic stimulation: Report of an IFCN committee | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = 858–882 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinph.2012.01.010 | pmid = 22349304 | pmc = 4890546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses ==
The use of TMS can be divided into diagnostic and therapeutic uses.

=== Diagnosis ===
TMS can be used clinically to measure activity and function of specific brain circuits in humans.&lt;ref name=diagnostic1 /&gt; The most robust and widely accepted use is in measuring the connection between the [[primary motor cortex]] and a muscle to evaluate damage from stroke, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[movement disorder]]s, [[motor neuron disease]] and  injuries and other disorders affecting the [[facial nerve|facial]] and other [[cranial nerve]]s and the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref name=diagnostic1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rossini |first1=P| last2 = Rossi |first2=S| title = Transcranial magnetic stimulation: diagnostic, therapeutic, and research potential| journal = Neurology| volume = 68| issue = 7| pages = 484–488| year = 2007| pmid = 17296913| doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000250268.13789.b2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimyan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dimyan | first1 = MA | last2 = Cohen | first2 = LG | doi = 10.1177/1545968309345270 | title = Contribution of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to the Understanding of Functional Recovery Mechanisms After Stroke | journal = Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–135 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19767591| pmc =2945387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Nowak | first1=D| last2 = Bösl | first2=K| last3 = Podubeckà | first3=J| last4 = Carey | first4=J| title = Noninvasive brain stimulation and motor recovery after stroke| journal = Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience| volume = 28| issue = 4| pages = 531–544| year = 2010| pmid = 20714076| doi = 10.3233/RNN-2010-0552}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMS has been suggested as a means of assessing short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) which measures the internal pathways of the [[motor cortex]] but this use has not yet been validated.&lt;ref name=Kujirai&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kujirai | first1 = T. | last2 = Caramia | first2 = M.

=== Treatment ===
For [[neuropathic pain]], for which there is little effective treatment, high-frequency (HF) repetitive TMS (rTMS) appears effective.&lt;ref name=Lefaucher1 /&gt; Unlike vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation, rTMS does not require surgery or implantation of electrodes. And, unlike electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), rTMS doesn't cause seizures or require sedation with anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.williamsvillepsych.com/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation|title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)|last=Psychiatrist|first=The Local|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; For treatment-resistant [[major depressive disorder]], HF-rTMS of the left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC) appears effective and low-frequency (LF) rTMS of the right DLPFC has probable efficacy.&lt;ref name=Lefaucher1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AHRQ /&gt; The Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has endorsed rTMS for treatment resistant [[major depressive disorder|MDD]].&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

Practice and Partnerships Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of rTMS as an effective treatment for clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Slotema, C.W.|author2=Blom, J.

== Adverse effects ==
Although TMS is generally regarded as safe, risks increase for therapeutic rTMS compared to single or paired TMS for diagnostic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van, den Noort M, Lim S, Bosch P | year = 2014 | title = Recognizing the risks of brain stimulation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6215| page = 1307 | doi = 10.1126/science.346.6215.1307-a }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of therapeutic TMS, risks increase with higher frequencies.&lt;ref name = Rossi /&gt;

The greatest immediate risk is the rare occurrence of [[syncope (medicine)|syncope (fainting)]] and even less commonly, induced [[epileptic seizure|seizures]].&lt;ref name = Rossi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald2&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=PB|last2=Daskalakis|first2=ZJ|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2VFEAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Depressive Disorders|chapter=7. rTMS-Associated Adverse Events|pages=81–90|location=Berlin Heidelberg|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2013|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-36467-9|isbn=978-3-642-36466-2}} ''At'' [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other adverse short-term effects of TMS include discomfort or pain, transient induction of [[hypomania]], transient cognitive changes, transient hearing loss, transient impairment of working memory, and induced currents in electrical circuits in implanted devices.&lt;ref name = Rossi /&gt;

== Devices and procedure ==
During a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) procedure, a magnetic field generator, or "coil" is placed near the head of the person receiving the treatment.&lt;ref name=NICE2014 /&gt;{{rp|3}}  The coil produces small electric currents in the region of the brain just under the coil via [[electromagnetic induction]]. The coil is positioned by finding anatomical landmarks on the skull including, but not limited to, the [[inion]] or the [[nasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nauczyciel |first=C |last2=Hellier |first2=P |last3=Morandi |first3=X |last4=Blestel |first4=S |last5=Drapier |first5=D |last6=Ferre |first6=JC |last7=Barillot |first7=C |last8=Millet |first8=B |title=Assessment of standard coil positioning in transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression | journal=Psychiatry Research| date=30 April 2011 |volume=186|issue=2–3 |pmid=    20692709 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2010.06.012 |pages=232–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coil is connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers electric current to the coil.&lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt;

Most devices provide a shallow magnetic field that affects neurons mostly on the surface of the brain, delivered with coil shaped like the number eight.  Some devices can provide magnetic fields that can penetrate deeper, are used for '''deep transcranial magnetic stimulation''' (deep TMS), and have  different types of coils including the H-coil the C-core coil, and the circular crown coil; as of 2013 the H coil used in devices made by [[Brainsway]] were the most developed.&lt;ref name="Ber2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bersani|first1=FS|last2=Minichino|first2=A|last3=Enticott|first3=PG|last4=Mazzarini|first4=L|last5=Khan|first5=N|last6=Antonacci|first6=G|last7=Raccah|first7=RN|last8=Salviati|first8=M|last9=Delle Chiaie|first9=R|last10=Bersani|first10=G|last11=Fitzgerald|first11=PB|last12=Biondi|first12=M|title=Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment for psychiatric disorders: a comprehensive review.|journal=European Psychiatry|date=January 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=30–9|pmid=22559998|doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2012.02.006}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom's National Health Service ====
The United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) issues guidance to the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. NICE guidance does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Local NHS bodies ([[NHS primary care trust|primary care trusts]] and [[NHS hospital trust|hospital trusts]]) make decisions about funding after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether the procedure  represents value for money for the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;NICE [https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do About NICE: What we do]&lt;/ref&gt;

NICE evaluated TMS for severe depression (IPG 242) in 2007, and subsequently considered TMS for reassessment in January 2011 but did not change its evaluation.&lt;ref name=TMSdepress&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg242|title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation for severe depression (IPG242)|location=London, England|publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|date=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute found that TMS is safe, but there is insufficient evidence for its efficacy.&lt;ref name=TMSdepress /&gt;

In January 2014, NICE reported the results of an evaluation of TMS for treating and preventing migraine (IPG 477).  NICE found that short-term TMS is safe but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate safety for long-term and frequent uses.   It found that evidence on the efficacy of TMS for the treatment of migraine is limited in quantity, that evidence for the prevention of migraine is limited in both quality and quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg477|title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation for treating and preventing migraine|date=January 2014|location=London, England|publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetic field passes unimpeded through the skin and skull, inducing an oppositely directed current in the brain that activates nearby nerve cells in much the same way as currents applied directly to the cortical surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of psychophysiology |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge Univ.

The path of this current is difficult to model because the brain is irregularly shaped and electricity and magnetism are not [[Electrical conduction|conducted]] uniformly throughout its tissues.  The magnetic field is about the same strength as an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and the pulse generally reaches no more than 5 centimeters into the brain unless using '''deep transcranial magnetic stimulation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies.shtml | title = Brain Stimulation Therapies | accessdate = 2010-07-14 | date = 2009-11-17 | publisher = [[National Institute of Mental Health]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep TMS can reach up to 6&amp;nbsp;cm into the brain to stimulate deeper layers of the [[motor cortex]], such as that which controls leg motion.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite journal | last1 = Zangen | first1 = A. | last2 = Roth | first2 = Y. | last3 = Voller | first3 = B. | last4 = Hallett | first4 = M. | title = Transcranial magnetic stimulation of deep brain regions: Evidence for efficacy of the H-Coil | doi = 10.1016/j.clinph.2004.11.008 | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 116 | issue = 4 | pages = 775–779 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15792886| pmc = }}&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = YZ | last2 = Sommer | first2 = M | last3 = Thickbroom | first3 = G | last4 = Hamada | first4 = M| last5 = Pascual-Leonne | first5 = A | last6 = Paulus | first6 = W | last7 = Classen | first7 = J | last8 = Peterchev | first8 = AV | last9 = Zangen | first9 = A | last10 = Ugawa | first10 = Y | doi = 10.1016/j.brs.2008.09.007 | title = Consensus: New methodologies for brain stimulation | journal = Brain Stimulation | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–13 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20633398 | pmc = 5507351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism of action ===
From the [[Biot–Savart law]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int_C \frac{d\mathbf l \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
it has been shown that a current through a wire generates a magnetic field around that wire. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is achieved by quickly discharging current from a large [[capacitor]] into a coil to produce pulsed [[magnetic fields]] between 2 and 3 T.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;V. Walsh and A. Pascual-Leone, "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Neurochronometrics of Mind." Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; By directing the magnetic field pulse at a targeted area of the [[brain]], one can either [[depolarization|depolarize]] or [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarize]] neurons in the brain. The magnetic flux density pulse generated by the current pulse through the coil causes an electric field as explained by the [[Electromagnetic induction#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell-Faraday equation]],
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;
This electric field causes a change in the transmembrane current of the neuron, which leads to the depolarization or hyperpolarization of the neuron and the firing of an [[action potential]].&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt;

The exact details of how TMS functions are still being explored. The effects of TMS can be divided into two types depending on the mode of stimulation:
* Single or paired pulse TMS causes neurons in the neocortex under the site of stimulation to [[Depolarization|depolarize]] and discharge an [[action potential]]. If used in the [[primary motor cortex]], it produces muscle activity referred to as a [[Evoked potential#Motor evoked potentials|motor evoked potential]] (MEP) which can be recorded on [[electromyography]]. If used on the [[occipital cortex]], '[[phosphene]]s' (flashes of light) might be perceived by the subject. In most other areas of the cortex, the participant does not consciously experience any effect, but his or her behaviour may be slightly altered (e.g., slower reaction time on a cognitive task), or changes in brain activity may be detected using sensing equipment.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Alvaro Pascual-Leone|Pascual-Leone A]]; Davey N; Rothwell J; Wassermann EM; Puri BK | year = 2002 | title = Handbook of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation | publisher = Edward Arnold|location=London | isbn = 0-340-72009-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repetitive TMS produces longer-lasting effects which persist past the initial period of stimulation. rTMS can increase or decrease the excitability of the [[corticospinal tract]] depending on the intensity of stimulation, coil orientation, and frequency. The mechanism of these effects is not clear, though it is widely believed to reflect changes in synaptic efficacy akin to [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) and [[long-term depression]] (LTD).&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitzgerald | first1 = P | last2 = Fountain | first2 = S | last3 = Daskalakis | first3 = Z | doi = 10.1016/j.clinph.2006.06.712 | title = A comprehensive review of the effects of rTMS on motor cortical excitability and inhibition | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 117 | issue = 12 | pages = 2584–2596 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16890483| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coil types ===
The design of transcranial magnetic stimulation coils used in either treatment or diagnostic/experimental studies may differ in a variety of ways.  These differences should be considered in the interpretation of any study result, and the type of coil used should be specified in the study methods for any published reports.

The most important considerations include:
* the type of material used to construct the core of the coil
* the geometry of the coil configuration
* the biophysical characteristics of the pulse produced by the coil.

With regard to coil composition, the core material may be either a magnetically inert substrate (i.e., the so-called 'air-core' coil design), or possess a solid, ferromagnetically active material (i.e., the so-called 'solid-core' design).  Solid core coil design result in a more efficient transfer of electrical energy into a magnetic field, with a substantially reduced amount of energy dissipated as heat, and so can be operated under more aggressive duty cycles often mandated in therapeutic protocols, without treatment interruption due to heat accumulation, or the use of an accessory method of cooling the coil during operation.  Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself may also result in variations in the focality, shape, and depth of cortical penetration of the magnetic field.  Differences in the coil substance as well as the electronic operation of the power supply to the coil may also result in variations in the biophysical characteristics of the resulting magnetic pulse (e.g., width or duration of the magnetic field pulse).  All of these features should be considered when comparing results obtained from different studies, with respect to both safety and efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Transcranial Stimulation |veditors=Wassermann EM, Epstein CM, Ziemann U, Walsh V, Paus T, Lisanby SH |chapter=TMS Stimulator Design |author=Riehl M |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-856892-4 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YeKleGrKwC4C&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 13–23], [https://books.google.com/books?id=YeKleGrKwC4C&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 25–32] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different types of coils exist, each of which produce different magnetic field patterns. Some examples:
* round coil: the original type of TMS coil
* figure-eight coil (i.e., butterfly coil): results in a more focal pattern of activation
* double-cone coil: conforms to shape of head, useful for deeper stimulation
* four-leaf coil: for focal stimulation of peripheral nerves&lt;ref name=roth2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = BJ | last2 = MacCabee | first2 = PJ | last3 = Eberle | first3 = LP | last4 = Amassian | first4 = VE | last5 = Hallett | first5 = M | last6 = Cadwell | first6 = J | last7 = Anselmi | first7 = GD | last8 = Tatarian | first8 = GT | doi = 10.1016/0168-5597(94)90093-0 | title = In vitro evaluation of a 4-leaf coil design for magnetic stimulation of peripheral nerve | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Evoked Potentials Section | volume = 93 | pages = 68–74 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7511524  | pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* H-coil: for deep transcranial magnetic stimulation

Design variations in the shape of the TMS coils allow much deeper penetration of the brain than the standard depth of 1.5–2.5&amp;nbsp;cm.  Circular crown coils, Hesed (or H-core) coils, double cone coils, and other experimental variations can induce excitation or inhibition of neurons deeper in the brain including activation of motor neurons for the [[cerebellum]], legs and [[pelvic floor]].  Though able to penetrate deeper in the brain, they are less able to produce a focused, localized response and are relatively non-focal.&lt;ref name = Rossi /&gt;

== History ==
[[Luigi Galvani]] did pioneering research on the effects of electricity on the body in the late 1700s, and laid the foundations for the field of [[electrophysiology]].&lt;ref name=Horvath&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horvath|first1=JC|last2=Perez|first2=JM|last3=Forrow|first3=L|last4=Fregni|first4=F|last5=Pascual-Leone|first5=A|title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation: a historical evaluation and future prognosis of therapeutically relevant ethical concerns.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=March 2011|volume=37|issue=3|pages=137–43|doi=10.1136/jme.2010.039966|pmid=21106996|jstor=23034661}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that an [[electrical current]] had a corresponding [[magnetic field]], and that changing one, could change the other.&lt;ref name=Nooh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noohi|first1=S|last2=Amirsalari|first2=S|title=History, Studies and Specific Uses of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Treating Epilepsy.|journal=Iranian journal of child neurology|date=2016|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1–8|pmid=27057180|pmc=4815479}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work to directly stimulate the human brain with electricity started in the late 1800s, and by the 1930s [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been developed by Italian physicians [[Ugo Cerletti|Cerletti]] and [[Lucio Bini|Bini]].&lt;ref name=Horvath/&gt;  ECT became widely used to treat [[mental illness]] and became overused as it began to be seen as a "psychiatric panacea", and a backlash against it grew in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Horvath/&gt; Around that time Anthony T. Barker began exploring use of magnetic fields to alter electrical signalling in the brain, and the first stable TMS devices were developed around 1985.&lt;ref name=Horvath/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nooh/&gt; They were originally intended as diagnostic and research devices, and only later were therapeutic uses explored.&lt;ref name=Horvath/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nooh/&gt;  The first TMS devices were approved by the  [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in October 2008.&lt;ref name=Horvath/&gt;

== Research ==

TMS research in animal studies is limited due to early FDA approval of TMS treatment of drug-resistant depression. Because of this, there has been no specific coils for animal models. Hence, there are limited number of TMS coils that can be used for animal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.09.003 | volume=133 | title=Transcranial magnetic brain stimulation: Therapeutic promises and scientific gaps | journal=Pharmacology | pages=98–107 | year=2012 | author=Wassermann Eric M., Zimmermann Trelawny| pmc=3241868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some attempts in the literature showing new coil designs for mice with an improved stimulation profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TMAG.2014.2316479 | volume=50 | issue=9 | title=Thermal and Mechanical Analysis of Novel Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Coil for Mice | journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics | pages=1–5 | year=2014 | author=March Stephen D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Power appeared in dozens of films, often in [[swashbuckler]] roles or romantic leads. His better-known films include ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'', ''[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]'', ''[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]'', ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'', ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', ''[[The Black Rose]]'', and ''[[Captain from Castile]]''. Power's own favorite film among those that he starred in was ''[[Nightmare Alley (film)|Nightmare Alley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Northen Magill, editor, ''[American Film Guide]; Magill's American Film Guide. 4. NI - ST'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1983). {{ISBN|9780893562540}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though largely a [[matinee idol]] in the 1930s and early 1940s and known for his striking looks, Power starred in films in a number of genres, from drama to light [[comedy]]. In the 1950s he began placing limits on the number of films he would make in order to devote more time for theater productions. He received his biggest accolades as a stage actor in ''[[John Brown's Body (poem)|John Brown's Body]]'' and ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]''. Power died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 44.

==Family background and early life==
Power was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], in 1914, son of Helen Emma "Patia" (née Reaume) and the Irish-ancestry English-born US stage and screen actor [[Tyrone Power Sr.]], often known by his first name "Fred". Power was descended from a long Irish theatrical line going back to his great-grandfather, the Irish actor and comedian [[Tyrone Power (1795–1841)|Tyrone Power]] (1795–1841). Tyrone Power's sister, Ann Power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tyrone-power.com/biography_sister.html|title = Biography-Ann Power Hardenbergh|date = |access-date = |website = Biograpjy-Ann Power Hardenbergh|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/550987335639654881/&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 1915, after the family moved to California.   His mother was [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and her ancestry included the French-Canadian Reaume family and Germans from [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72897101.html REMEMBERING THE LOCAL STARS III.(LIVING)(Column) - The Cincinnati Post (Cincinnati, OH) | HighBeam Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Paul+and+Amanda+%28Brazee%29+Schuster+martin&amp;q=Amanda+Brazee+Schuster |title=Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788-1912 - S.J.

''Debrett Goes to Hollywood''. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-00588-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Power went to Cincinnati-area Catholic schools and graduated from [[Purcell Marian High School|Purcell High School]] in 1931.  Upon his graduation, he opted to join his father to learn what he could about acting from one of the stage's most respected actors.

==Career==

===1930s===
[[File:MadeleineCarrollTyronePowerLloydsofLondon.jpg|thumb|[[Madeleine Carroll]] with Power in his first leading role, ''[[Lloyd's of London (film)|Lloyd's of London]]'' (1936)]]

Power joined his father for the summer of 1931, after being separated from him for some years due to his parents' divorce. His father suffered a heart attack in December 1931, dying in his son's arms, while preparing to perform in ''The Miracle Man''. Tyrone Power Jr., as he was then known, decided to continue his pursuit of an acting career. He went door to door, trying to find work as an actor, and, while many contacts knew his father well, they offered praise for his father but no work for his son. He appeared in a bit part in 1932 in ''Tom Brown of  Culver'', a movie starring actor [[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]]. Power's experience in that movie did not open any other doors, however, and, except for what amounted to little more than a job as an extra in ''[[Flirtation Walk]]'', he found himself frozen out of the movies but making some appearances in community theater. Discouraged, he took the advice of a friend, Arthur Caesar, to go to New York to gain experience as a stage actor. Among the Broadway plays in which he was cast are ''Flowers of the Forest'', ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', and ''Romeo and Juliet''.

Power went to Hollywood in 1936. The director [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]] was impressed with his looks and poise, and he insisted that Power be tested for the lead role in ''[[Lloyd's of London (film)|Lloyd's of London]]'', a role thought already to belong to [[Don Ameche]]. Despite his own reservations, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] decided to give Power the role, once King and Fox editor [[Barbara McLean]] convinced him that Power had a greater screen presence than Ameche. Power was billed fourth in the movie but he had by far the most screen time of any actor. He walked into the premiere of the movie an unknown and he walked out a star, which he remained the rest of his career.

[[File:Tyrone Power in Marie Antoinette trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Power in a trailer for ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' ([[1938 in film|1938]])]]

Power racked up hit after hit from 1936 until 1943, when his career was interrupted by military service. In these years he starred in romantic comedies such as ''[[Thin Ice (1937 film)|Thin Ice]]'' and ''[[Day-Time Wife]]'', in dramas such as ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'', ''[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]'', ''[[Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake]]'', ''[[The Rains Came]]'' and ''[[In Old Chicago]]''; in musicals ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'', ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'', and ''[[Rose of Washington Square]]''; in the westerns ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939) and ''[[Brigham Young]]''; in the war films ''[[A Yank in the R.A.F.]]'' and ''[[This Above All]]''; and the swashbucklers ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and ''[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]''. ''Jesse James'' was a very big hit at the box office, but it did receive some criticism for fictionalizing and glamorizing the famous outlaw. The movie was shot in and around [[Pineville, Missouri]], and was Power's first location shoot and his first [[Technicolor]] movie. (Before his career was over, he had filmed a total of 16 movies in color, including the movie he was filming when he died.) He was loaned out once, to MGM for ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (1938). [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] was angry that MGM used Fox's biggest star in what was, despite billing, a supporting role, and he vowed to never again loan him out, though Power's services were requested for the role of Ashley Wilkes in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''; Joe Bonaparte in ''[[Golden Boy (film)|Golden Boy]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Spergel, Mark J. (1993) ''Reinventing Reality--The Art and Life of Rouben Mamoulian.'' The Scarecrow Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Paris in ''[[Kings Row|King's Row]]''; roles in several films produced by [[Harry Cohn]];&lt;ref&gt;Christian, Linda (1963). ''Linda, My Own Story''. Dell.&lt;/ref&gt; and to play Irving Thalberg in a planned production by [[Norma Shearer]] of ''[[The Last Tycoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Gavin (1990) ''Norma Shearer: A Biography''. Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Power was named the second biggest box office draw in 1939, surpassed only by [[Mickey Rooney]].&lt;ref&gt;''International Motion Picture Almanac, 1933-present'' (Annual). Quigley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
[[File:Tyrone Power Zorro2.jpg|thumb|Power and [[Basil Rathbone]] in their duelling scene from ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) (Note: The movie was shot in black and white; this is the colorized version.)]]

In 1940 the direction of Power's career  took a dramatic turn when his movie ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' was released. Power played the role of Don Diego Vega/Zorro, fop by day, bandit hero by night. The role had been made famous by Douglas Fairbanks in the 1920 movie of the same title. The film was a hit, and 20th Century Fox often cast Power in other swashbucklers in the years that followed. Power was a talented swordsman in real life, and the dueling scene in ''The Mark of Zorro'' is highly regarded. The great Hollywood swordsman, [[Basil Rathbone]], who starred with him in ''The Mark of Zorro'', commented, "Power was the most agile man with a sword I’ve ever faced before a camera. Tyrone could have fenced [[Errol Flynn]] into a cocked hat."

Power's career was interrupted in 1943 by military service. He reported to the [[United States Marine Corps]] for training in late 1942, but was sent back, at the request of 20th Century-Fox, to complete one more film, ''[[Crash Dive]]'', a patriotic war movie released in 1943. He was credited in the movie as Tyrone Power, U.S.M.C.R., and the movie served as a recruiting film.

==Military service==
In August 1942, Power enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He attended boot camp at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], then [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer's Candidate School]] at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], where he was commissioned  a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] on June 2, 1943. As he had already logged 180 solo hours as a pilot before enlisting, he was able to do a short, intense flight training program at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], [[Texas]]. The pass earned him his wings and a promotion to [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]. The Marine Corps considered Power over the age limit for active combat flying so he volunteered for piloting cargo planes that he felt would get him into active combat zones.&lt;ref&gt;p. 34 Myers, Robert H. ''Tyrone Power, Marine'' ''Leatherneck Magazine'' December 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1944, Power was assigned to [[VMR-352|Marine Transport Squadron (VMR)-352]] as a [[Curtiss C-46 Commando|R5C]] (Navy version of Army Curtiss Commando C-46) transport co-pilot at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]], [[North Carolina]].  The squadron moved to [[Marine Corps Air Station El Centro]] in California in December 1944. Power was later reassigned to [[VMR-353]], joining them on [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] in February 1945. From there, he flew missions carrying cargo in and wounded Marines out during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Battles of Iwo Jima (Feb-Mar 1945)]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa (Apr-Jun 1945)]].

For his services in the [[Pacific War]], Power was awarded the [[American Campaign Medal]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with two bronze stars, and the [[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Fdn, http://www.usmccca.org/archives/category/news, News Section, "Help Put Tyrone Power on a Stamp," March 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Power returned to the United States in November 1945 and was released from active duty in January 1946. He was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] in the [[Marine Forces Reserve|reserves]] on May 8, 1951.&lt;ref name=Shettle&gt;{{cite web

In the June 2001 ''Marine Air Transporter'' newsletter, Jerry Taylor, a retired Marine Corps flight instructor, recalled training Power as a Marine pilot, saying, "He was an excellent student, never forgot a procedure I showed him or anything I told him." Others who served with him have also commented on how well Power was respected by those with whom he served.&lt;ref name=MCATA&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Power died suddenly at age 44, he was buried with full military honors.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

==Post-war career==
Other than re-releases of his films, Power was not seen on screen again after his entry into the Marines until 1946, when he co-starred with [[Gene Tierney]] and [[Anne Baxter]] in ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', an adaptation of [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s [[The Razor's Edge|novel]] of the same title.

[[File:Tyrone Power Maureen O'Hara Black Swan 6.jpg|left|thumb|With [[Maureen O'Hara]] in the trailer for ''[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]'' (1942)]]

Next up for release was a movie that Power had to fight hard to make, the [[film noir]] ''[[Nightmare Alley (1947 film)|Nightmare Alley]]'' (1947). Darryl F. Zanuck was reluctant for Power to make the movie because his handsome appearance and charming manner had been marketable assets for the studio for years. Zanuck feared that the dark role might damage Power's image. Zanuck eventually agreed, giving Power A-list production values for what normally would be a B film. The movie was directed by [[Edmund Goulding]], and though it died at the box office, it was one of Power's favorite roles for which he received some of the best reviews of his career. However, Zanuck was horrified that his "darling boy" would be seen in such a film with a downward spiral. So, he did not publicize it and removed it from release after only a few weeks insisting that it was a flop. The film was released on DVD in 2005 after years of legal battles.

Zanuck quickly released another costume-clad movie, ''[[Captain from Castile]]'' (also 1947), directed by Henry King, who directed Power in eleven movies. After making a couple of light romantic comedies reuniting him with two actresses under contract to 20th Century Fox, ''[[That Wonderful Urge]]'' with Gene Tierney and ''[[The Luck of the Irish (1948 film)|The Luck of the Irish]]'' (both 1948) with Anne Baxter. After these films, Power once again found himself in two swashbucklers, ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (1950).

===1950s===
Power was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with his costume roles, and he struggled between being a star and becoming a great actor. He was forced to take on assignments that did not appeal to him, such movies as ''[[American Guerrilla in the Philippines]]'' (1950) and ''[[Pony Soldier]]'' (1952). In 1950 he traveled to England to play the title role in ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'' on stage at the London Coliseum, bringing in sellout crowds for twenty-three weeks. Another disappointing role for Power, ''[[Diplomatic Courier]]'' (1952) is a cold war drama, directed by [[Henry Hathaway]], but received very modest reviews. It took its place among several other American spy movies, released previously, with similar material.

Power's movies had been very profitable for Fox in the past, and as an enticement to renew his contract a third time, Fox offered him the lead role in ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953). He turned it down ([[Richard Burton]] was cast instead) and on 1 November 1952, he left on a ten-week national tour with ''[[John Brown's Body (poem)|John Brown's Body]]'', a three-person dramatic reading of [[Stephen Vincent Benét]]'s narrative poem, adapted and directed by [[Charles Laughton]], featuring Power, [[Judith Anderson]] and [[Raymond Massey]]. The tour culminated in a run of 65 shows between February and April 1953 at the [[New Century Theatre]] on Broadway. A second national tour with the show began in October 1953, this time for four months, and with Raymond Massey and Anne Baxter. In the same year, Power filmed ''[[King of the Khyber Rifles (film)|King of The Khyber Rifles]]'', a depiction of India in 1857, with [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] and [[Michael Rennie]].

Fox now gave Power permission to seek his own roles outside the studio, on the understanding that he would fulfill his fourteen-film commitment to them in between his other projects. He made ''[[The Mississippi Gambler (1953 film)|The Mississippi Gambler]]'' (1953) for [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]], negotiating a deal entitling him to a percentage of the profits. He earned a million dollars from the movie. Also in 1953, actress and producer [[Katharine Cornell]] cast Power as her love interest in the play ''[[The Dark is Light Enough (play)|The Dark is Light Enough]]'', a verse drama by British dramatist [[Christopher Fry]] set in Austria in 1848. Between November 1954 and April 1955, Power toured the United States and Canada in the role, ending with 12 weeks at the ANTA Theater, New York, and two weeks at the Colonial Theater, Boston. His performance in Julian Claman's ''A Quiet Place'', staged at the National Theater, Washington, at the end of 1955 was warmly received by the critics.

[[File:Tyrone Power in Witness for the Prosecution trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Power as the accused murderer in the 1957 adaptation of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'']]

''[[Untamed (1955 film)|Untamed]]'' (1955) was Tyrone Power's last movie made under his contract with 20th Century-Fox. The same year saw the release of ''[[The Long Gray Line]]'', a successful [[John Ford]] film for [[Columbia Pictures]]. In 1956, the year Columbia released ''[[The Eddy Duchin Story]]'', another great success for the star, he returned to England to play the rake Dick Dudgeon in a revival of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]]'s ''[[The Devil's Disciple]]'' for one week at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House]] in [[Manchester]], and nineteen weeks at the Winter Garden, London.

Power's old boss, Darryl F. Zanuck, persuaded him to play the lead role in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957), adapted from the [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] novel, with  [[Ava Gardner]] and Errol Flynn. This was his final film with Fox.  Released that same year were ''[[Seven Waves Away]]'' (US: ''Abandon Ship''), shot in Great Britain, and John Ford's ''[[The Rising of the Moon (film)|Rising of the Moon]]'' (narrator only), which was filmed in Ireland, both for Copa Productions.

For Power's last completed film role he was cast against type as the accused murderer Leonard Vole in the first film version of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957), directed by [[Billy Wilder]]. The critic for ''The National Post'', Robert Fulford, commented on Power's "superb performance" as "the seedy, stop-at-nothing exploiter of women." The movie was a well-received box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Tyrone Power 1946.jpg|thumb|Tyrone Power, by [[Yousuf Karsh]] (1946)]]

Power was one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors until he married French actress [[Annabella (actress)|Annabella]] (born Suzanne Georgette Charpentier on July 14, 1907). They had met on the 20th Century Fox lot around the time they starred together in the movie ''Suez''. Power adopted Annabella's daughter, Anne, before leaving for service. In an A&amp;E biography, Annabella said that Zanuck "could not stop Tyrone's love for me, or my love for Tyrone." [[J. Watson Webb Jr.|J. Watson Webb]], close friend and an editor at 20th Century Fox, maintained in the ''A&amp;E Biography'' that one of the reasons the marriage fell apart was Annabella's inability to give Power a son, yet, Webb said, there was no bitterness between the couple. In a March 1947 issue of ''Photoplay'', Power was interviewed and said that he wanted a home and children, especially a son to carry on his acting legacy. Annabella shed some light on the situation in an interview published in ''Movieland'' magazine in 1948. She said, "Our troubles began because the war started earlier for me, a French-born woman, than it did for Americans." She explained that the war clouds over Europe made her unhappy and irritable, and to get her mind off her troubles, she began accepting stage work, which often took her away from home. "It is always difficult to put one's finger exactly on the place and time where a marriage starts to break up," she said "but I think it began then. We were terribly sad about it, both of us, but we knew we were drifting apart. I didn’t think then—and I don’t think now—that it was his fault, or mine." The couple tried to make their marriage work when Power returned from military service, but they were unable to do so.

[[Image:Tyrone Power and Annabella.jpg|left|thumb|Power with [[Annabella (actress)|Annabella]], 1946. They were married in 1939 and divorced in 1948.]]

Following his separation from Annabella, Power entered into a love affair with [[Lana Turner]] that lasted for a couple of years. In her 1982 autobiography, Turner claimed that she became pregnant with Power's child in 1948, but chose to have an abortion.

On September 1, 1947, Power set out on a goodwill trip around the world, piloting his own plane, "The Geek."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nightmare Alley (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew with [[Robert N. Buck|Bob Buck]], an experienced pilot and war veteran.  Buck stated in his autobiography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = North Star over My Shoulder: A Flying Life|last = Buck|first = Bob|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 2005|isbn = 0743262301|location = New York, NY|pages = 295–368}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Power had a photographic mind, was an excellent pilot, and genuinely liked people. They flew with a crew to various locations in Europe and South Africa, often mobbed by fans when they hit the ground. However, in 1948 when "The Geek" reached Rome, Power met and fell in love with Mexican actress [[Linda Christian]]. Turner claimed that the story of her dining out with Power's friend [[Frank Sinatra]] was leaked to Power and that Power became very upset that she was "dating" another man in his absence. Turner also claimed that it could not have been a coincidence that Linda Christian was at the same hotel as Tyrone Power and implied that Christian had obtained Power's itinerary from 20th Century Fox.

Power and Christian were married on January 27, 1949, in the [[Church of Santa Francesca Romana]], with an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 screaming fans outside. Christian miscarried three times before giving birth to a baby girl, [[Romina Power|Romina Francesca Power]], on October 2, 1951. A second daughter, [[Taryn Power|Taryn Stephanie Power]], was born on September 13, 1953. Around the time of Taryn's birth, the marriage was becoming rocky. In her autobiography, Christian blamed the breakup of her marriage on her husband's extramarital affairs, but acknowledged that she had had an affair with [[Edmund Purdom]], which created great tension between Christian and her husband. They divorced in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After his divorce from Christian, Power had a long-lasting love affair with [[Mai Zetterling]], whom he had met on the set of ''Abandon Ship''.&lt;ref&gt;Zetterling, Mai (1986) ''All Those Tomorrows''. Grove.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he vowed that he would never marry again, because he had been twice burned financially by his previous marriages. He also entered into an affair with a British actress, Thelma Ruby.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby-Frye, Thelma, and Frye, Peter (1997),''Double or Nothing: Two Lives in the Theatre: The Autobiography of Thelma Ruby and Peter Frye''. Janus&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1957, he met [[Deborah Ann Minardos]]. They were married on May&amp;nbsp;7, 1958, and she became [[pregnant]] soon after with the son he had always wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tyrone-power.com/biography_debbie.html|title = Biography, ..."though he loved his daughters very much, he was hoping for a boy to carry on his name...

==Death==
In September 1958, Power and his wife Deborah went to [[Madrid]] and [[Valdespartera]], [[Spain]], to film the epic ''[[Solomon and Sheba]],'' to be directed by [[King Vidor]], co-starring [[Gina Lollobrigida]]. Power had filmed about 75 percent of his scenes when he was stricken by a massive heart attack while filming a dueling scene with his frequent co-star and friend, [[George Sanders]]. A doctor, Juan Olaguíbel, diagnosed Power's death as "fulminant [[angina pectoris]]."&lt;ref&gt;Canales, Luiz (2006). ''Imperial Gina''. Branden Publishing Co. {{ISBN|0-312-00588-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He died while being transported to the hospital in Madrid on November 15, 1958, aged 44.

[[File:Tyrone Power Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Grave of Tyrone Power at Hollywood Forever]]

Power was interred at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] (then known as Hollywood Cemetery) in a military service at noon on November 21, 1958. Flying over the service was [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]. Almost 20 years before, Tyrone had flown in King's plane to the set of ''Jesse James'' in [[Missouri]]. It was then that Power had his first experience of flying, which became a big part of his life, both in the U.S. Marines and as a civilian. In the foreword to Dennis Belafonte's ''The Films of Tyrone Power,'' King said, "Knowing his love for flying and feeling that I had started it, I flew over his funeral procession and memorial park during his burial, and felt that he was with me." Power was laid to rest beside a small lake in one of the most beautiful parts of the cemetery. His grave is marked by a unique tombstone, in the form of a marble bench. On the tombstone are the masks of comedy and tragedy, with the inscription, "Good night, sweet prince." At his grave, [[Laurence Olivier]] read the poem "[[John Gillespie Magee Jr.#High Flight|High Flight]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qunl.com/rees0008.html |title=Quotations |publisher=Qunl.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715140622/http://www.qunl.com/rees0008.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power's will, filed on December 8, 1958, contained a then-unusual provision. It stated his wish that, upon his death, his eyes be donated to the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation, for such purposes as the trustees of the foundation should deem advisable, including transplantation of the cornea to the eyes of a living person or for retinal study.

Deborah Power gave birth to their son, [[Tyrone Power Jr.|Tyrone Power IV]], on January 22, 1959, some two months after Power's death.

Tyrone Power is one of the top 100 box-office moneymakers of all time (adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;''International Motion Picture Almanac,'' Quigley Publishing Company. 1932-2010 (Annual)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

For Power's contribution to motion pictures, in 1960, he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], that can be found at 6747 Hollywood Blvd. On the 50th anniversary of his death, Power was honored by American Cinematheque with a weekend of films and remembrances by co-stars and family, and a memorabilia display. The event was held at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles from November 14–16, 2008.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"The Magnetic Tyrone Power," by Susan King, ''LA Times,'' November 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A large etched glass mural depicting Tyrone epic moments was also displayed. Look magazine Dec 2,1952 featured the art works with a four-page spread titled" Power's Pose for their Portrates.

Power is shown on the cover of [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in the [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|third row]].

The '''unidentified body on Christmas Island''' was actually found on a life raft in the [[Indian Ocean]], off  [[Christmas Island|that island]], in 1942. He is widely believed to originate from the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) cruiser [[HMAS Sydney (D48)|HMAS ''Sydney'']], which sank off [[Western Australia]] in November 1941, after a [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|mutually destructive battle]] with the German [[auxiliary cruiser]] [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|''Kormoran'']]. While 318 of 399 ''Kormoran'' personnel survived, ''Sydney'' was lost with no survivors from the 645 aboard. The locations of the shipwrecks were unknown until [[Search for HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|they were rediscovered in March 2008]].

The body was found on 6 February 1942. It is reported that an inquest was held on [[Christmas Island]], soon afterwards. His remains were buried with [[military honours]], in an [[unmarked grave]], in the Old European Cemetery on the island. Christmas Island was [[Battle of Christmas Island|captured]] by Japanese forces on 31 March 1942 and remained in their hands until 1945. Relevant records, including any relating to the inquest, appear to have been lost or destroyed during this period.

Eyewitnesses on Christmas Island believed that the float and sailor had come from ''Sydney''.&lt;ref name=Olson329/&gt; A post-war investigation by the RAN, including attempts to reconstruct the lost records by those who wrote them, determined that the body could possibly be a [[naval rating]].&lt;ref name=Olson330/&gt; Christmas Island's assistant harbour master, Captain E. Craig, stated that "the Carley float was typical of those in service with the RN and RAN".&lt;ref name=Olson330/&gt; A government inquiry concluded "on the balance of probability, that the body and the carley float&amp;nbsp;... were most likely from HMAS ''Sydney''."&lt;ref&gt;JCFADT, ''Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney'', p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

A RAN archaeological expedition in September&amp;ndash;October 2006 recovered the body. Although a [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA profile]] and other data about the man's background have been recovered from the remains, researchers have not been able to match this to known relatives of personnel from ''Sydney''.

==Discovery of the body==
During the late afternoon of 6 February 1942, lookouts on [[Christmas Island]] spotted an object out at sea.&lt;ref name=Olson328&gt;Olson, ''Bitter Victory'', p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Initially thought to be a Japanese submarine, closer inspection from a [[pilot boat]] found it was a [[carley float]] with a dead person inside. The float was towed ashore.&lt;ref name=Olson328/&gt;

With the island under threat of invasion, after brief examinations by the harbour master, the medical officer, and the man in charge of the radio station, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near [[Flying Fish Cove]].&lt;ref name=Winter241&gt;Winter, ''H.M.A.S. Sydney'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2Cole324.6&gt;Cole, ''The Loss of HMAS Sydney II'', vol. 2, pp. 324-6&lt;/ref&gt; Reports were written by these men; they were destroyed when Japanese forces occupied Christmas Island and later recreated from memory.&lt;ref name=2Cole324.6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frame203&gt;Frame, ''HMAS Sydney'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; An inquest was not convened until mid-February and was ongoing when evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March. It is unknown if the doctor on Christmas Island had performed an autopsy; if so it was never found.&lt;ref name=323.7&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 323.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial investigations &amp; research ===
A preliminary examination in 1942 by the island's medical officer, Dr J. Scott Clark, found that the deceased was reported to have been a young adult male [[Caucasian race|caucasoid]] who was tall by the standards of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains were partly [[decomposition|decomposed]]: its eyes, nose and all of the flesh from the right arm were missing and believed to have been consumed by fish or birds.&lt;ref name=Olson328.9&gt;Olson, ''Bitter Victory'', pp. 328-9&lt;/ref&gt; There are several accounts regarding clothing. According to the island's [[Harbourmaster|Harbour Master]], Captain J. R. Smith, the body was clothed in a blue [[overall|boilersuit]] which had been bleached white by exposure with four plain [[Snap fastener|press studs]] from neck to waist.&lt;ref name=Olson328.9/&gt; According to J.C. Baker, who was in charge of the radio station at Christmas Island, the body was clothed in a white boilersuit.&lt;ref name=323.7/&gt; The body was not carrying "[[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tags]]" or personal effects.

A shoe was found beside the body, which Clark did not believe belonged to the dead man.&lt;ref name=Olson328/&gt; Later recollections of the shoe varied: Clark stated that it was "probably branded "&lt;small&gt;CROWN BRAND PTY 4&lt;/small&gt;", although he had some doubts about "&lt;small&gt;CROWN&lt;/small&gt;" and "&lt;small&gt;4&lt;/small&gt;". Captain Smith, recalled a canvas shoe of a brand named "&lt;small&gt;McCOWAN PTY&lt;/small&gt;" or "&lt;small&gt;McEWAN PTY&lt;/small&gt;", which carried symbols representing a [[The Crown|crown]] and/or a [[broad arrow]]. A sergeant with the party who recovered the raft later contradicted the finding of a single shoe stating that a 'pair of boots' were found on the raft.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

In Smith's opinion, the life raft was a naval [[carley float]], which had come from ''Sydney''.&lt;ref name=Olson329/&gt; The wooden decking was manufactured and branded with the word "&lt;small&gt;PATENT&lt;/small&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 325&lt;/ref&gt; while the metal framework was branded "&lt;small&gt;LYSAGHT DUA-ANNEAL ZINC. MADE IN AUSTRALIA&lt;/small&gt;" inside.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The float had been damaged by gun or shellfire, with shrapnel embedded in the outer covering, and the underside was covered with barnacles and other marine growth, indicating that it had been at sea for some time.&lt;ref name=Olson329&gt;Olson, ''Bitter Victory'', p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 1949, the Director of Naval Intelligence wrote to the Director of Victualling in regard to whether the clothing (3a) and carley float (3b) could have come from the ''Sydney''. The Director of Naval Victualling replied to 3a in a hand written note that while a rating may have worn a blue boilersuit, suits with press studs "had never been adopted" by the navy. However, RAN officers purchased their own boilersuits which would be either white or brown in colour with press studs. Additionally, the shoes described "definitely" corresponded with RAN issue "provided they were leather not canvass." There is no record of a reply regarding the carley float.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy regarding raft ===
The RAN claimed that the covering of the carley float did not match those used by Australian warships and thus could not have come from ''Sydney''.   Historian [[Tom Frame (bishop)|Tom Frame]] was also sceptical regarding the raft's origins and stated that its connections to the ''Sydney'' were circumstantial.

For many years, other authors, like historian [[Barbara Winter]] (1984) and independent researcher [[Wes Olson]] (2000) disputed the official view put forward by the RAN. According to Olson, it was unclear how the RAN decided that the float cover was anomalous, as contemporary accounts of the float were often vague and/or contradicted each other.&lt;ref name=Olson330&gt;Olson, ''Bitter Victory'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, said Olson, the only available detail of the covering in eyewitness descriptions appeared to be that it was grey.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''Bitter Victory'', pp. 329-30.)&lt;/ref&gt; Winter suggested that the currents of the Indian Ocean would have propelled a carley float, launched at the location and time of the battle, to the vicinity of Christmas Island, at around the time of its discovery.&lt;ref name=Winter241/&gt; According to Olson, the rope used on the float and markings on the float were of naval origin, and the descriptions of marine growth on the float matched the period that a float from ''Sydney'' would have been in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''Bitter Victory'', pp. 331-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Olson claimed that evidence presented at the 1998 inquiry had changed Frame's mind.&lt;ref name=Frame203/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson330/&gt;

== Investigations since 1998 ==
===Recovery of the body===
The 1998 [[Joint committee|Joint Standing Committee]] for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into the loss of HMAS ''Sydney'' recommended that attempts be made to find the grave, to exhume the body and acquire DNA for comparison with relatives of personnel from ''Sydney'', to determine if the unknown sailor was from the cruiser.&lt;ref name="Cole, pp. 331-2"&gt;Cole, ''The Loss of HMAS Sydney II'', vol. 2, pp. 331-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAN performed an unsuccessful search of the graveyard in August–September 2001 and a second, successful search in October 2006.&lt;ref name=Mearns112&gt;Mearns, ''The Search for the Sydney'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, ''The Loss of HMAS Sydney II'', vol. 2, pp. 332&lt;/ref&gt; When it was found, the body was in an unusually-shaped coffin, which appeared to have been constructed around it as the body was buried "with legs doubled under at the knee," the same position it had been in when found on the raft, possibly due to mummification. In addition to human remains, [[press stud]]s and small fragments of clothing were found in the coffin.&lt;ref name=335.6&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 335.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an autopsy and the taking of samples from the body to assist in identification, the remains of the unknown sailor were reburied in the Commonwealth War Graves section in the [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] Cemetery with full military honours on 19 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Mearns, ''The Search for the Sydney'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, ''The Loss of HMAS Sydney II'', vol. 2, pp. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy and subsequent research===
Brain trauma caused by a [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shell fragment]] of German origin has been identified as the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, ''The Loss of HMAS Sydney II'', vol. 2, pp. 336-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billson 2007"&gt;Billson 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the unknown man's injuries, [[Bruce Billson]] (then Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) reported that:
:[[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] struck the front of the skull and lodged in the left forehead. In addition to this injury, the pathologist identified a second major skull injury, with bone loss on the left side of the skull, above and behind the left earhole, which is also believed to have occurred around the time of death... The analysis also identified multiple rib fractures, but it is unknown whether these occurred around the time of death or long after death with the settling of the grave. No other shrapnel or projectiles have been found elsewhere in the remains.&lt;ref name="Billson 2007"/&gt;

The fragment, which was thought initially to be a small-arms bullet, was found embedded in the man's skull during autopsy work in 2006.

Anatomical analysis indicated that the unknown sailor was aged between 22 and 31 when he died, was right-handed, had size 11 feet, and was tall for his generation — between {{convert|168.2|and|187.8|cm}}.

Bone [[isotope analysis]] shows that he had lived in eastern Australia — most likely NSW or Queensland — before enlistment and most probably grew up in a coastal area. The unknown sailor had acquired an unusual feature in both ankle joints, known as [[squatting facets]]; these indicated that he was more used to squatting than sitting on chairs.&lt;ref name=335.6/&gt; As squatting was unusual at the time in urban, western communities, it was speculated that the man had spent significant time:
* in a rural area of Australia;
* amongst members of an ethnic group in which squatting was more common than sitting (such as people from Asia or Eastern Europe), and/or;
* involved in a sporting or similar activity that required the ankles to be flexed towards the back of the thighs for prolonged periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://navalinstitute.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/headmark-132.pdf Greg Swinden, 2009, "The Long Journey Home: The Story of the Unknown HMAS Sydney Sailor", ''Headmark: Journal of the Australian Naval Institute'', p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to extract a DNA profile from the remains began in or before 2009, although the results were not published before the Cole Inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, ''The Loss of HMAS Sydney II'', vol. 2, pp. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the partial genetic profile recovered has since suggested that the man had red hair, blue eyes and pale skin, suggesting that he was of European descent. He belonged to a mitochondrial haplogroup — an ancient female line of descent — known as haplogroup J1c12.&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-11/navy-searches-answers-identify-unknown-sailor-hmas-sydney/7493144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boilersuit and shoe found with the body were, according to evidence provided by the Australian War Memorial, available to ship’s officers, commissioned warrant officers and warrant officers senior enough to have a watch keeping certificate.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 346 - 351&lt;/ref&gt; Tests on the remains of the boilersuit showed that the fabric had never been dyed, was probably white and the press studs were of a type manufactured by Carr Australia Pty Ltd in the 1930s and 1940s. RAN ''Dress Regulations'' published in the Navy List of December 1940 do not mention white boilersuits. There is evidence, however, that during the period, boilersuits were a popular working dress among RAN personnel. Many RAN engineer officers wore white boilersuits most of the time, and other officers, commissioned warrant officers and warrant officers also wore white boilersuits. Two former RAN officers recalled being issued with a white boilersuit twice a year, that these were fastened with four or five press studs and that some had press studs at the wrist, while others did not. Dress regulations for December 1940 state that RAN personnel on "foreign" (tropical) stations were issued with a pair of white canvas shoes, to be worn only on those stations. While veterans did not recall being issued with them or seeing them worn, photographs of RAN personnel from the period show some of them wearing white canvas shoes.

By 2014, the identity of the unknown sailor had been narrowed to 50 members of the crew of HMAS ''Sydney''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/mystery-hmas-sydney-sailor-narrowed-to-one-of-50-crew-20140103-309df.html |title=Mystery HMAS Sydney sailor narrowed to one of 50 crew |last=Smith |first=Bridie |date=4 January 2014 |work=SMH.com.au (The Sydney Morning Herald) |accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''verneshot''' (named after French author [[Jules Verne]]) is a hypothetical [[volcanic eruption]] event caused by the buildup of gas deep underneath a [[craton]]. Such an event may be forceful enough to launch an extreme amount of material from the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] into a [[sub-orbital]] [[trajectory]].

== Connection with mass extinctions ==

Verneshots have been proposed as a causal mechanism explaining the statistically unlikely contemporaneous occurrence of continental [[flood basalt]]s, [[mass extinction]]s, and "impact signals" (such as [[planar deformation features]], [[shocked quartz]], and [[iridium anomaly|iridium anomalies]]) traditionally considered definitive evidence of hypervelocity [[impact event]]s.&lt;ref name="Morgan_CME"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phipps Morgan |first1=J. |last2=Reston |first2=T. J. |last3=Ranero |first3=C. R. |date=15 January 2004 |title=Contemporaneous mass extinctions, continental flood basalts, and ‘impact signals’: are mantle plume-induced lithospheric gas explosions the causal link? |journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] |volume=217 |issue=3–4 |pages=263–284 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(03)00602-2 |url=http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/PeoplePlaces/Faculty/JPM/VerneshotEPSL2004.pdf |accessdate=30 June 2015 |bibcode=2004E&amp;PSL.217..263P }}&lt;!-- paywall url: linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/s0012821x03006022 --&gt; (First submitted 17 April 2003). For an informal introduction ''see'' [http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty/new-faculty/new-faculty-2004/Jason-Phipps-Morgan.cfm Professor Jason Phipps Morgan's faculty biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922215311/http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty/new-faculty/new-faculty-2004/Jason-Phipps-Morgan.cfm |date=22 September 2006 }} at Cornell University from May 2004: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I became interested in the causes of mass-extinctions, in particular worrying about the 'too-many-coincidences' problem that these periods appear to be associated (if we believe what's published in the mainstream literature) with BOTH extremely rare continental flood basalts and continental rifting, and even rarer 'impact signals' commonly presumed to come from large extraterrestrial bolide impacts. Our recently published Verneshot hypothesis is our best guess on how to explain these coincidences in a self-consistent causal manner."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The verneshot theory suggests that [[mantle plume]]s may cause heating and the buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] gas underneath continental [[lithosphere]]. If continental [[rift]]ing occurs above this location, an explosive release of the built up gas may occur, potentially sending out a column of crust and mantle into a globally dispersive, super-[[stratosphere|stratospheric]] trajectory. It is unclear whether such a column could stay coherent through this process, or whether the force of this process would result in it shattering into much smaller pieces before impacting. The pipe through which the magma and gas had travelled would collapse during this process, sending a shockwave at hypersonic velocity that would deform the surrounding [[craton]].

A verneshot event is likely to be related to nearby continental flood basalt events, which may occur before, during or after the verneshot event. This may help in searching for evidence for the results of verneshot events; however, it is also quite probable that most of such evidence will be buried underneath the basalt flows, making investigation difficult. J. Phipps Morgan and others have suggested that subcircular [[bouguer anomaly|Bouguer gravity anomalies]] recognized beneath the [[Deccan Traps]] may indicate the presence of verneshot pipes related to the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name ="Morgan_CME"/&gt;

If the Deccan Traps were the location of a verneshot event at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]], the strong iridium spike at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary could be explained by the iridium-rich nature of volatiles in the Reunion mantle plume, which is currently beneath [[Piton de la Fournaise]], but during the end Cretaceous was located beneath India in the area of the Deccan Traps; the verneshot event could potentially distribute the iridium globally.&lt;ref name ="Morgan_CME"/&gt;

== History ==

In 1865 [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' introduced the concept of a [[Ballistics|ballistic]] projectile escaping the Earth's gravity, from which Phipps Morgan and others derived the name "Verneshot" in their paper theorizing a connection between extinction events and cratonic gas ejection.

A cougar attack near [[North Bend, Washington]] on May 18, 2018 resulted in the first human death from a [[cougar]] attack in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in more than 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2018/05/cougar-kills-man-outside-seattle-escapes-forest-first-us-mountain-lion-fatality-decade/|title=Cougar kills man outside Seattle and escapes into the forest -- first US mountain lion fatality in a decade|date=May 19, 2018|website=Rawstory.com|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/cougar-attack-washington-state.html|title=Cougar Attacks Two Bicyclists in Washington State, Killing One|date=May 20, 2018|accessdate=May 20, 2018|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cougar initially attacked then fled.
