An '''active structure''' (also known as a '''smart''' or '''adaptive structure''') is a [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] structure with the ability to alter its configuration, form or properties in response to changes in the environment.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

The term active structure also refers to [[structure]]s that, unlike traditional [[engineering]] structures (e.g., bridges, buildings), require constant motion and hence power input to remain stable.{{fact|date=November 2016}} The advantage of active structures is that they can be far more massive than a traditional [[static structure]]: an example would be a [[space fountain]], a building that reaches into orbit.

==Function==
The result of the activity is a structure more suited for the type and magnitude of the load it is carrying. For example, an orientation change of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] could reduce the maximum stress or strain level, while a shape change could render a structure less susceptible to dynamic vibrations.{{fact|date=November 2016}} A good example of an adaptive structure is the human body where the [[skeleton]] carries a wide range of loads and the [[muscle]]s change its configuration to do so. Consider carrying a backpack. If the upper body did not adjust the [[centre of mass]] of the whole system slightly by leaning forward, the person would fall on his or her back.

An active structure consists of three integral components besides the load carrying part. They are the ''[[sensor]]s'', the ''[[Processor (computing)|processor]]'' and the ''[[actuator]]s''.{{fact|date=November 2016}} In the case of a [[human body]], the sensory nerves are the sensors which gather information of the environment. The brain acts as the processor to evaluate the information and decide to act accordingly and therefore instructs the muscles, which act as actuators to respond. In heavy engineering, there is already an emerging trend to incorporate activation into [[bridge]]s and [[dome]]s to minimize [[vibration]]s under wind and [[earthquake]] loads.

[[Aviation engineering]] and [[aerospace engineering]] have been the main driving force in developing modern active structures.{{fact|date=November 2016}} [[Aircraft]] (and [[spacecraft]]) require adaptation because they are exposed to many different environments, and therefore loadings, during their lifetime. Prior to launching they are subjected to gravity or dead loads, during
takeoff they are subjected to extreme dynamic and inertial loads and in-flight they need to be in a configuration which minimizes drag but promotes lift. A lot of effort has been committed into adaptive aircraft [[wing]]s to produce one that can control the separation of boundary layers and turbulence. Many space structures utilize adaptivity to survive extreme environmental challenges in space or to achieve precise accuracies. For example, space [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]s and [[mirror]]s can be activated to precise orientation. As space technology advances, some sensitive equipment (namely [[interferometric]] optical and [[infrared]] astronomical instruments) are required to be accurate in position as delicate as a few [[nanometre]]s, while the supporting active structure is tens of metres in dimensions.

==Design==
Human-made actuators existing in the market, even the most sophisticated ones, are nearly all one-dimensional.{{fact|date=November 2016}} This means they are only capable of extending and contracting along, or rotating about 1 axis. Actuators capable of movement in both forward and reverse directions are known as two-way actuators, as opposed to one-way actuators which can only move in one direction. The limiting capability of actuators has restricted active structures to two main types: ''active truss structures'', based on linear actuators, and ''manipulator arms'', based on rotary
actuators.

A good active structure has a number of requirements. First, it needs to be easily actuated. The actuation should be energy-saving. A structure which is very stiff and strongly resists morphing is therefore not desirable. Second, the resulting structure must have structural integrity to carry the design loads. Therefore the process of actuation should not jeopardize the structure's strength. More precisely, we can say: We seek an active structure where actuation of some members will lead to a geometry change without substantially altering its stress state. In other words, a structure that has both [[statical determinacy]] and [[kinematic determinacy]] is optimal for actuation.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

==Applications==
Active-control technology is applied in civil engineering, mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering. Although most civil engineering structures are static, active control is utilized in some civil structures for deployment against seismic loading, wind loading and environmental vibration.&lt;ref name=korkmaz&gt;S. Korkmaz (2011). A review of active structural control: challenges for engineering informatics. ''Computers &amp; Structures''. {{doi|10.1016/j.compstruc.2011.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, active control is proposed to be used for damage tolerance purposes where human intervention is restricted.&lt;ref name=korkmaz2&gt;S. Korkmaz et al. (2011). Determining control strategies for damage tolerance of an active tensegrity structure. ''Engineering Structures'', 33:6, p. 1930-1939. {{doi|10.1016/j.engstruct.2011.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korkmaz et al. demonstrated configuration of active control system for a damage tolerance and deployment of a bridge.&lt;ref name=korkmaz3&gt;S. Korkmaz et al. (2011). Configuration of control system for damage tolerance of a tensegrity bridge. ''Advanced Engineering Informatics''. {{doi|10.1016/j.aei.2011.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''affine monoid''' is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] that is finitely generated, and is [[isomorphic]] to a submonoid of a [[free abelian group]]  ℤ&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze"&gt;{{cite book |first=Winfried |last=Bruns |first2=Joseph |last2=Gubeladze |title=Polytopes, Rings, and K-Theory |publisher=Springer |series=Monographs in Mathematics |year=2009 |isbn=0-387-76356-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbgg1pFxW8YC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Affine monoids are closely connected to [[convex polyhedra]], and their associated [[algebra (ring theory)|algebras]] are of much use in the algebraic study of these geometric objects.

== Characterization ==
* Affine monoids are '''finitely generated'''. This means for a monoid &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt; m_1, \dots , m_n \in M &lt;/math&gt; such that  
:&lt;math&gt; M = m_1\mathbb{Z_+}+\dots + m_n\mathbb{Z_+} &lt;/math&gt;.

* Affine monoids are '''[[cancellation property|cancellative]]'''. In other words, 
:&lt;math&gt;x + y = x + z&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;y = z&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[binary operation]] on the affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

* Affine monoids are also '''[[Affine connection|torsion free]]'''. For an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;nx = ny&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt;.
* A subset &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that is itself a monoid with respect to the operation on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a '''submonoid''' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties and examples ===
* Every submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated. Hence, ''every'' submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is affine.
* The submonoid &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \mid y &gt; 0\} \cup \{(0,0)\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' finitely generated, and therefore ''not'' affine.
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two affine monoids is an affine monoid.

== Affine monoids ==

=== Group of differences ===
:If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid, it can be [[embedding|embedded]] into a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. More specifically, there is a unique group &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;, called ''the group of differences'', in which &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded.

==== Definition ====
*&lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as the set of equivalences classes &lt;math&gt;x - y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x - y = u - v&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x + v + z = u + y + z&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;(x-y) + (u-v) = (x+u) - (y+v)&lt;/math&gt; defines the addition.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;

*The '''rank''' of an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rank of a group]] of &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;
*If an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is given as a submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^r&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;gp(M) \cong \mathbb{Z}M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}M&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^r&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;

==== Universal property ====

*If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid, then the monoid [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\iota : M \to gp(M)&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\iota(x) = x + 0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following [[universal property]]:

:for any monoid homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi: M \to G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group, there is a unique group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi : gp(M) \to G&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \psi \circ \iota&lt;/math&gt;, and since affine monoids are cancellative, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding. In other words, ''every'' affine monoid can be embedded into a group.

=== Normal affine monoids ===

==== Definition ====
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid of an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then the submonoid
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{M}_N = \{x\in N \mid mx \in M, m \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the '''integral closure''' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;M = \hat{M_N}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is '''integrally closed'''
*The '''normalization''' of an affine monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the integral closure of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;. If the normalization of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; itself, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a '''normal''' affine monoid.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt;
* A monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a normal affine monoid if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_+M&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated and &lt;math&gt;M = \mathbb{Z}^r \cap \mathbb{R}_+M&lt;/math&gt; .

== Affine monoid rings ==
: ''see also: [[Group ring]]''

=== Definition ===

* Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be an affine monoid, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a commutative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Then one can form the '''affine monoid ring''' &lt;math&gt;R[M]&lt;/math&gt;. This is an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module with a free basis &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, so if &lt;math&gt;f \in R[M]&lt;/math&gt;, then 
: &lt;math&gt;f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}x_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f_i \in R, x_i \in M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In other words, &lt;math&gt;R[M]&lt;/math&gt; is the set of finite sums of elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connection to [[convex geometry]] ==
:Affine monoids arise naturally from convex polyhedra, [[convex cone]]s, and their associated discrete structures.

* Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a rational [[convex cone]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;C \cap L&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt; (Lemma 2.9, Gordan's lemma)
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_+M&lt;/math&gt; is a cone if and only if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid.
* If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a cone generated by the elements of &lt;math&gt;gp(M)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M \cap C&lt;/math&gt; is an affine monoid.
* Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a rational polyhedron, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; the [[recession cone]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; a lattice in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;P \cap L&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the affine monoid &lt;math&gt;C \cap L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gubeladze" /&gt; (Theorem 2.12)

In [[computer programming]], especially [[functional programming]] and [[type theory]], an '''algebraic data type''' is a kind of [[composite type]], i.e., a type formed by combining other types.

Two common classes of algebraic types are [[product type]]s (i.e., [[tuple]]s and [[record (computer science)|records]]) and [[sum type]]s (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions or ''variant types'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual003.html#toc7 Records and variants] - OCaml manual section 1.4{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[value (computer science)|values]] of a product type typically contain several values, called ''fields''.  All values of that type have the same combination of field types.  The set of all possible values of a product type is the set-theoretic product, i.e., the [[Cartesian product]], of the sets of all possible values of its field types.

The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called ''variants''.  A value of a variant type is usually created with a quasi-functional entity called a ''constructor''.  Each variant has its own constructor, which takes a specified number of arguments with specified types.  The set of all possible values of a sum type is the set-theoretic sum, i.e., the [[disjoint union]], of the sets of all possible values of its variants. [[Enumerated type]]s are a special case of sum types in which the constructors take no arguments, as exactly one value is defined for each constructor.

Values of algebraic types are analyzed with [[pattern matching]], which identifies a value by its constructor or field names and extracts the data it contains.

Algebraic data types were introduced in [[Hope (programming language)|Hope]], a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |quote=Presentations included Rod Burstall, Dave MacQueen, and Don Sannella on Hope, the language that introduced algebraic data types |title=A history of Haskell: being lazy with class |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1238856 |author1=Paul Hudak |author2=John Hughes |author3=Simon Peyton Jones |author4=Philip Wadler |booktitle=Proceedings of the third ACM SIGPLAN conference on History of programming languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the most common examples of  an algebraic data type is the singly linked list. A list type is a sum type with two variants, &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; for an empty list and &lt;code&gt;Cons ''x'' ''xs''&lt;/code&gt; for the combination of a new element ''x'' with a list ''xs'' to create a new list. Here is an example of how a singly linked list would be declared in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation of ''cons''truct. Many languages have special syntax for lists defined in this way. For example, Haskell and [[ML (programming language)|ML]] use &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Cons&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, and square brackets for entire lists. So &lt;code&gt;Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Nil))&lt;/code&gt; would normally be written as &lt;code&gt;1:2:3:[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell, or as &lt;code&gt;1::2::3::[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[1;2;3]&lt;/code&gt; in ML.

For a slightly more complex example, [[binary tree]]s may be implemented in Haskell as follows:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Tree = Empty
          | Leaf Int
          | Node Tree Tree
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt; represents an empty tree, &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; contains a piece of data, and &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; organizes the data into branches.

In most languages that support algebraic data types, it is possible to define [[parametric polymorphism|parametric]] types. Examples are given later in this article.

Somewhat similar to a function, a data constructor is applied to arguments of an appropriate type, yielding an instance of the data type to which the type constructor belongs. For example, the data constructor &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; is logically a function &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Tree&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that giving an integer as an argument to &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt; produces a value of the type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;. As &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments of the type &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; itself, the datatype is [[recursive type|recursive]].

Operations on algebraic data types can be defined by using [[pattern matching]] to retrieve the arguments. For example, consider a function to find the depth of a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;, given here in Haskell:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 depth :: Tree -&gt; Int
 depth Empty = 0
 depth (Leaf n) = 1
 depth (Node l r) = 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, a &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; given to &lt;code&gt;depth&lt;/code&gt; can be constructed using any of &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Leaf&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; and must be matched for any of them respectively to deal with all cases. In case of &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt;, the pattern extracts the subtrees &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; for further processing.

Algebraic data types are highly suited to implementing [[abstract syntax]].  For example, the following algebraic data type describes a simple language representing numerical expressions:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Expression = Number Int
                | Add Expression Expression
                | Minus Expression Expression
                | Mult Expression Expression
                | Divide Expression Expression
&lt;/source&gt;

An element of such a data type would have a form such as &lt;code&gt;Mult (Add (Number 4) (Minus (Number 0) (Number 1))) (Number 2)&lt;/code&gt;.

Writing an evaluation function for this language is a simple exercise; however, more complex transformations also become feasible.  For example, an optimization pass in a compiler might be written as a function taking an abstract expression as input and returning an optimized form.

==Explanation==
What is happening is that there is a datatype which can be ''one of several types of things''. Each ''type of thing'' is associated with an identifier called a ''constructor'', which can be viewed as a kind of tag for that kind of data. Each constructor can carry with it a different type of data. A constructor could carry no data (e.g., "Empty" in the example above), or one piece of data (e.g., “Leaf” has one Int value), or multiple pieces of data (e.g., “Node” has two Tree values).

To do something with a value of this Tree algebraic data type, it is ''deconstructed'' using a process termed ''pattern matching''. It involves ''matching'' the data with a series of ''patterns''. The example function "depth" above pattern-matches its argument with three patterns. When the function is called, it finds the first pattern that matches its argument, performs any variable bindings that are found in the pattern, and evaluates the expression corresponding to the pattern.

Each pattern above has a form that resembles the structure of some possible value of this datatype. The first pattern simply matches values of the constructor ''Empty''. The second pattern matches values of the constructor ''Leaf''. Patterns are recursive, so then the data that is associated with that constructor is matched with the pattern "n". In this case, a lowercase identifier represents a pattern that matches any value, which then is bound to a variable of that name — in this case, a variable “&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;” is bound to the integer value stored in the data type — to be used in the expression to evaluate.

The recursion in patterns in this example are trivial, but a possible more complex recursive pattern would be something like &lt;code&gt;&lt;source lang="lisp" enclose="none"&gt;Node (Node (Leaf 4) x) (Node y (Node Empty z))&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Recursive patterns several layers deep are used for example in balancing [[red-black tree]]s, which involve cases that require looking at colors several layers deep.

The example above is operationally equivalent to the following pseudocode:

 switch on (data.constructor)
   case Empty:
     return 0
   case Leaf:
     let n = data.field1
     return 1
   case Node:
     let l = data.field1
     let r = data.field2
     return 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)

The comparison of this with pattern matching will point out some of the advantages of algebraic data types and pattern matching. The first advantage is [[type safety]]. The pseudocode above relies on the diligence of the programmer to not access &lt;tt&gt;field2&lt;/tt&gt; when the constructor is a Leaf, for example. Also, the type of &lt;tt&gt;field1&lt;/tt&gt; is different for Leaf and Node (for Leaf it is &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;; for Node it is &lt;tt&gt;Tree&lt;/tt&gt;), so the type system would have difficulties assigning a static type to it in a safe way in a traditional [[record (computer science)|record]] data structure. However, in pattern matching, the type of each extracted value is checked based on the types declared by the relevant constructor, and how many values can be extracted is known based on the constructor, so it does not face these problems.

Second, in pattern matching, the compiler statically checks that all cases are handled. If one of the cases of the ''depth'' function above were missing, the compiler would issue a warning, indicating that a case is not handled. This task may seem easy for the simple patterns above, but with many complex recursive patterns, the task becomes difficult for the average human (or compiler, if it must check arbitrary nested if-else constructs) to handle. Similarly, there may be patterns which never match (i.e., are already covered by prior patterns), and the compiler can also check and issue warnings for these, as they may indicate an error in reasoning.

Do not confuse these patterns with [[regular expression]] patterns used in string pattern matching. The purpose is similar: to check whether a piece of data matches certain constraints, and if so, extract relevant parts of it for processing. However, the mechanism is very different. This kind of pattern matching on algebraic data types matches on the structural properties of an object rather than on the character sequence of strings.

==Theory==
{{main|Recursive data type}}

A general algebraic data type is a possibly recursive [[sum type]] of [[product type]]s. Each constructor tags a product type to separate it from others, or if there is only one constructor, the data type is a product type. Further, the parameter types of a constructor are the factors of the product type. A parameterless constructor corresponds to the [[empty product]]. If a datatype is recursive, the entire sum of products is wrapped in a [[recursive type]], and each constructor also rolls the datatype into the recursive type.

For example, the Haskell datatype:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;

is represented in [[type theory]] as
&lt;math&gt;\lambda \alpha. \mu \beta. 1 + \alpha \times \beta&lt;/math&gt;
with constructors &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nil}_\alpha = \mathrm{roll}\ (\mathrm{inl}\ \langle\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cons}_\alpha\ x\ l = \mathrm{roll}\ (\mathrm{inr}\ \langle x, l\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Haskell List datatype can also be represented in type theory in a slightly different form, thus:
&lt;math&gt;\mu \phi. \lambda \alpha. 1 + \alpha \times \phi\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
(Note how the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; constructs are reversed relative to the original.) The original formation specified a type function which body was a recursive type. The revised version specifies a recursive function on types. (The type variable &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is used to suggest a function rather than a ''base type'' like &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is like a Greek ''f''.) The function must also now be applied &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to its argument type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the body of the type.

For the purposes of the List example, these two formulations are not significantly different; but the second form allows expressing so-called [[nested data type]]s, i.e., those where the recursive type differs parametrically from the original. (For more information on nested data types, see the works of [[Richard Bird (computer scientist)|Richard Bird]], [[Lambert Meertens]], and Ross Paterson.)

In [[set theory]] the equivalent of a sum type is a [[disjoint union]], a set which elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).

'''Anal expulsiveness''' is the state of a person who exhibits cruelty, emotional outbursts, disorganization, self-confidence, artistic ability, generosity, rebelliousness and general carelessness.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kosslyn|first=S.|authorlink=Stephen Kosslyn|others=Rosenberg, R.|year=2004|title='Psychology: The brain, the person, the world|edition=2nd|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Pearson Education|ISBN=978-0-205-37609-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] theory claims the [[anal stage]] follows the [[oral stage]] of infant/early-childhood development. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the bowels but occasionally the bladder), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions, a time of [[toilet training]].  For a child in this stage of development, control of [[bowel movements]] is the stage at which the child can express autonomy by withholding, refusing to comply, or soiling himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magnavita|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Theories of Personality: Contemporary Approaches to the Science of Personality|page=90|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2002|ISBN=0-471-37890-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E3aXMMHoFQC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Anal+expulsive&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q1XMTOfjDY3rOabm9bAB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Anal%20expulsive&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with [[bullying]] parents regarding [[toilet training]] can produce a [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] in this stage, which can manifest itself in adulthood by a continuation of erotic pleasure in defecation.&lt;ref name="Sharan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharan|first=A.K.|title=

'''Zhuyin Fuhao''' ({{zh|t=注音符號|p=zhùyīn fúhào}}), '''Zhuyin''' ({{zh|t=注音}}), '''Bopomofo''' (ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) or '''Mandarin Phonetic Symbols''' is the major [[Transliteration of Chinese|Chinese transliteration]] system for [[Taiwanese Mandarin]]. It is also used to transcribe other [[varieties of Chinese]], particularly other varieties of [[Standard Chinese]] and related [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin dialects]], as well as [[Taiwanese Hokkien]].

Zhuyin Fuhao and Zhuyin are traditional terms, whereas Bopomofo is the colloquial term, also used by the [[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] and [[Unicode]]. Consisting of 37 characters and four [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] marks, it transcribes all possible sounds in Mandarin. Zhuyin was introduced in China by the [[Beiyang government|Republican Government]] in the 1910s and used alongside the [[Wade-Giles]] system, which used a modified [[Latin alphabet]]. The Wade system was replaced by [[Hanyu Pinyin]] in 1958 by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=2008-02-11 |title = Pinyin celebrates 50th birthday |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/news/242463.htm |accessdate = 2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1982.&lt;ref name="ISO1982"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=13682|title=ISO 7098:1982 – Documentation – Romanization of Chinese |accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Taiwan adopted Hanyu Pinyin as its official [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] system in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shih Hsiu-Chuan |work=Taipei Times |page=2 |date=18 Sep 2008 |title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bopomofo is still an official transliteration system there and remains widely used as an educational tool and for [[Chinese input methods for computers|electronic input methods]].

==Name==
The informal name "Bopomofo" is derived from the first four syllables in the conventional ordering of available syllables in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. The four Bopomofo characters ({{lang|zh|ㄅㄆㄇㄈ}}) that correspond to these syllables are usually placed first in a list of these characters. The same sequence is sometimes used by other speakers of Chinese to refer to other phonetic systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The original formal name of the system was ''Guóyīn Zìmǔ'' (&lt;small&gt;traditional&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|國音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;simplified&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|国音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Phonetic Alphabet of the [[Standard Mandarin|National Language]]") and ''Zhùyīn Zìmǔ'' (&lt;small&gt;traditional&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|註音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;simplified&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|注音字母}}}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Phonetic Alphabet" or "Annotated Phonetic Letters").&lt;ref name=GIO/&gt; It was later renamed ''Zhùyīn Fúhào'' (&lt;small&gt;traditional&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|注音符號}}}}, &lt;small&gt;simplified&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{nobreak|{{lang|zh|注音符号}}}}), meaning "phonetic symbols".

In official documents, Zhuyin is occasionally called "Mandarin Phonetic Symbols I" ({{nobreak|{{lang|zh|國語注音符號第一式}}}}), abbreviated as "MPS I" {{nobreak|({{lang|zh|注音一式}}).}}

In English translations, the system is often also called either ''Chu-yin'' or ''the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols''.&lt;ref name=GIO&gt;{{cite web|first=Government Information Office |last=The Republic of China government |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02PeopleandLanguage.htm |title=Taiwan Yearbook 2006: The People &amp; Languages |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509032222/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/02PeopleandLanguage.htm |archivedate=2007-05-09 |df= }} &amp;#124;Also available at&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=headlines&gt;{{cite web |author=Taiwan Headlines |publisher=Government Information Office, Taiwan(ROC) |url=http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=85286&amp;ctNode=10 |title=Taiwan Headlines: Society News: New Taiwanese dictionary unveiled}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[romanization of Chinese|romanized]] phonetic system was released in 1984 as [[Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II]] (MPS II).

== History ==
{{main article|Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation#Phonetic symbols}}

The [[Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation]], led by [[Wu Zhihui]] from 1912 to 1913, created a system called ''Zhuyin Zimu'',&lt;ref name=GIO /&gt; which was based on [[Zhang Binglin]]'s shorthand. A draft was released on July 11, 1913, by the Republic of China National Ministry of Education, but it was not officially proclaimed until November 23, 1928.&lt;ref name=GIO /&gt; It was later renamed first ''Guoyin Zimu'' and then, in April 1930, ''Zhuyin Fuhao''. The last renaming addressed fears that the alphabetic system might independently replace [[Chinese character]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John DeFrancis]]. ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]''. Honolulu, HI, USA: University of Hawaii Press, 1984. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use in Taiwan ==
[[File:Left arrow direction sign using bopomofo in Taipei Municipal Dunhua Elementary School 20160804.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Direction sign for children in Taipei including bopomofo]]
Zhuyin remains the predominant phonetic system in teaching reading and writing in [[elementary school]] in Taiwan. It is also one of the most popular ways to enter Chinese characters into computers and [[smartphone]]s and to look up characters in a dictionary.

In elementary school, particularly in the lower years, Chinese characters in textbooks are often annotated with Zhuyin as [[ruby character]]s as an aid to learning. Additionally, one children's newspaper in Taiwan, the ''[[Mandarin Daily News]]'', annotates all articles with Zhuyin ruby characters.

In teaching Mandarin, Taiwan institutions and some overseas communities use Zhuyin as a learning tool.

==Etymology==
[[File:Bopomofo.gif|right|thumb|200px|Table showing Zhuyin in [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]]]
[[File:Bopomofo in Regular, Handwritten Regular &amp; Cursive formats.jpg|thumb|Bopomofo in Regular, Handwritten Regular &amp; Cursive formats]]
The Zhuyin characters were created by [[Zhang Binglin]], and taken mainly from "[[Regular script|regularised]]" forms of ancient Chinese characters, the modern readings of which contain the sound that each letter represents. It is to be noted that the first consonants are articulated from the front of the mouth to the back, /b/, /p/, /m/, /f/, /d/, /t/, /n/, /l/ etc.

== Writing ==

===Stroke order===
Zhuyin is written in the same stroke order rule as Chinese characters. Note that ㄖ is written with three strokes, unlike the character from which it is derived (日, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: rì), which has four strokes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tonal marks ===

As shown in the following table, [[Mandarin phonology#Tones|tone]] marks for the second, third, and fourth tones are shared between bopomofo and [[Pinyin#Tones|pinyin]]. In bopomofo, the lack of a marker is used to indicate the first tone while a dot above indicates the fifth tone (also known as the neutral tone). In pinyin, a macron indicates the first tone and the lack of a marker indicates the fifth tone.

Unlike Hanyu Pinyin, Zhuyin aligns well with the hanzi characters in books whose texts are printed vertically, making Zhuyin better suited for annotating the pronunciation of vertically oriented Chinese text.

Zhuyin, when used in conjunction with Chinese characters, are typically placed to the right of the Chinese character vertically or to the top of the Chinese character in a horizontal print (see [[Ruby character]]).

Below is an example for the word "bottle" ({{zh|p=píngzi}}):

|}
|}

===Érhuà transcription===
[[Érhuà]]-ed words merge as a single syllable, which means {{lang|zh-Bopo|ㄦ}} is attached to the precedent syllable (like {{ruby-zh-b|歌兒|ㄍㄜㄦ}} gēr). In case the syllable uses other tones than 1st tone, the tone is attached to the penultimate syllable, but not to {{lang|zh-Bopo|ㄦ}} (e.g. {{ruby-zh-b|哪兒|ㄋㄚˇㄦ}} nǎr; {{ruby-zh-b|一|ㄧ}}{{ruby-zh-b|點兒|ㄉㄧㄢˇㄦ}} yīdiǎnr; {{ruby-zh-b|好|ㄏㄠˇ}}{{ruby-zh-b|玩兒|ㄨㄢˊㄦ}} hǎowánr). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Script/zhuyin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison ==

=== Pinyin ===
Zhuyin and [[pinyin]] are based on the same Mandarin pronunciations, hence there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two systems:

==Non-Standard Mandarin dialects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Three letters formerly used in non-standard dialects of Mandarin are now also used to write other [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]]. Some Zhuyin fonts do not contain these letters; see [[#External links|External links]] for [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] pictures.

In Taiwan, Bopomofo is used to teach [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], and is also used to transcribe it phonetically in contexts such as on storefront signs, karaoke lyrics, and film subtitles.

==Computer uses==

===Input method===
[[File:bopomofo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|thumb|An example of a Zhuyin keypad for Taiwan]]
Zhuyin can be used as an [[Chinese input methods for computers|input method for Chinese characters]]. It is one of the few input methods that can be found on most modern personal computers without the user having to download or install any additional software. It is also one of the few input methods that can be used for inputting Chinese characters on certain [[cell phone]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
[[File:Keyboard layout Zhuyin.svg|thumb|300px|none|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for Zhuyin on computers]]

===Unicode===
{{Main article|Bopomofo (Unicode block)|Bopomofo Extended|l2=Bopomofo Extended (Unicode block)}}
Zhuyin was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Zhuyin, called Bopomofo, is U+3100&amp;ndash;U+312F:
{{Unicode chart Bopomofo}}

Additional characters were added in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

The Unicode block for these additional characters, called Bopomofo Extended, is U+31A0&amp;ndash;U+31BF:

{{Unicode chart Bopomofo Extended}}

Unicode 3.0 also added the characters U+02EA and U+02EB, in the [[Spacing Modifier Letters]] block. These two characters are now (since Unicode 6.0) classified as Bopomofo characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scripts-6.0.0.txt|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/6.0.0/ucd/Scripts.txt|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chang Chun-ha''' (장준하, 張俊河, August 27, 1918 in [[Uiju County]] – August 17, 1975 in [[Uijeongbu]], [[Gyeonggi Province]]) was a [[Korea]]n independence and democracy activist who later became a journalist in South Korea.

==Military career==
When [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]], he participated in education activities and voluntarily joined the Japanese army called Sugada but he escaped the army in 1944 when he was in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]. His joining of Sugada army was only nominally voluntarily as it was forced by the Japanese army for Korean males to join the army.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He then was trained at China Central Officer School and became a warrant officer in the Chinese Central Army. In 1945, he visited [[Korean Liberation Army]] located in Suzhou and joined the army from the February as a commissioned officer. While serving the Korean liberation army, he participated activities with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS; the predecessor of the [[CIA]]). In November 1945, he came back to Korea via the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=임정귀국|url=http://www.ihs21.org/bbs/zboard.php?id=photo200&amp;page=6&amp;sn1=&amp;divpage=1&amp;sn=off&amp;ss=on&amp;sc=on&amp;select_arrange=headnum&amp;desc=asc&amp;no=99|publisher=1999 Institute of Historical Studies|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs21.org/bbs/zboard.php?id=photo200&amp;page=6&amp;sn1=&amp;divpage=1&amp;sn=off&amp;ss=on&amp;sc=on&amp;select_arrange=headnum&amp;desc=asc&amp;no=99]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
After returning to Korea, Chang worked as a secretary of [[Kim Gu]] and participated in [[Lee Beom-seok (Prime Minister)|Lee Beom-seok]]'s Chosun Ethnic Youth League. After the establishment of Republic of Korea, during the [[First Republic of South Korea]], he worked for the government as a secretary. In 1950, he was in charge of citizen spirit reformation in the Ministry of Education and Culture (문교부). In 1952, he was the directing manager of national ideology research institution. He also worked in two more positions in the Ministry of Education and Culture and founded a periodical called ''Sasangge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=사상계|url=http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view.do?docid=b11s0350a|publisher=브리태니커|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the [[Dong-in Literary Award]] in 1956. ''Sasangge'' acrimoniously denounced the [[자유당]] administration and became the starting fire of the 4.19 revolution. After the 4.19 revolution took place, he took positions in the Ministry of Munkyo during the second republic.

After the [[May 16 coup]], he opposed the South Korea–Japan conference and the sending of troops to [[Vietnam War]]. During the [[South Korean presidential election, 1967]], he made an issue out of the career of [[Yun Bo-seon]] on [[Park Chung-hee]]'s pro-Japanese and [[Workers' Party of South Korea]] activities. He was then sent into prison for insulting the head of the state. After he came out of prison, he worked with [[Yun Bo-seon]] and [[New Democratic Party (South Korea)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nahm|first=Andrew C.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Korea|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=148|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=hyukt3Lp7i8C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=shinmindang&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O31GU7b_LdC_kgWR1ICAAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shinmindang&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the [[Korean National Party]].

From 1975, when he was preparing to fight against the [[Park Chung-hee]] administration, he died mysteriously in [[Pocheon]], [[Gyeonggi-do]]. The South Korean government announced that Chang's death had been caused by loss of footing while climbing down a mountain. However, after Chang's death, continuous doubts were raised whether it was a homicide by Park's government. To such doubts, the Park administration declared the state of national emergency and arrested anyone who mentioned the death of Chang Chun-ha. The death of Chang Chun-ha has been re-investigated, but there have not been any clear conclusions yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park|first=Kyung-Man|title=Chang Chun-ha’s family hopes to know truth of his death after 37 years|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/547355.html|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=the Hankyoreh|date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Chang was awarded the 1962 [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Journalism, Literature, and the Creative Communication Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/newrmaf/main/awardees/filter/all/c/all/all/1 Awardees] [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16147">'''Collective self-esteem''' is a concept originating in the field of psychology that describes the aspect of an individual’s [[self-image]] that stems from how the individual interacts with others and the groups that the individual is a part of.  The idea originated during the research of [[Jennifer Crocker]], during which she was trying to learn about the connection between a person’s [[self-esteem]] and their attitude towards or about the group that the person is part of.

Collective self-esteem is talked about subjectively as a concept as well as measured objectively with various scales and assessments.  The data from such research is used practically to give importance and weight to the idea that most individuals benefit from being in a group setting for at least sometime as well as being able to identify with being a part of a group.

==History==

Jennifer Crocker and Riia Luhtanen were the first to study collective self-esteem.  They believed there was a relationship between people’s self-esteem and how they felt about groups they were a part of.  Crocker hypothesized that people who were high in the trait of collective self-esteem would be more likely to “react to threats to collective self-esteem by derogating [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-groups]] and enhancing the [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]].”&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt;
	The idea of collective self-esteem rose out of [[social identity theory]] (Tajfel &amp; Turner).&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt; Social identity theory focused on an individual’s personal beliefs about themselves and beliefs that stemmed from the groups they were part of.  Collective self-esteem described a more group-oriented idea of self-esteem.  It focused more on how groups, when they are threatened or perceive to be threatened will increase bias in favor of the in-group and increase prejudice toward the out-group.&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt; Crocker published a paper titled “Collective self-esteem and in-group bias.”  It was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.  
	Crocker developed a scale that consisted of four categories to measure collective self-esteem.&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt;    

1) Private collective self-esteem.  Positive evaluation of one’s group

2) Membership esteem.  How one sees him/herself in a group.  Is he/she a good member?  

3) Public collective self-esteem.  How the group one belongs to is evaluated by others.   

4) Importance to identity.  How important membership in a group is to self-concept. 

	The study concluded that prejudice and discrimination toward out-groups were not so much motivated by personal self-esteem needs but rather they were attempts to increase or enhance collective self-esteem.&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt;

==Research==

===Collective Self-Esteem Scale ===
The Collective Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) was developed by Luhtanen and Crocker as a measure to assess individuals’ social identity based on their membership in ascribed groups such as race, ethnicity, gender, and the like.&lt;ref name="Luhtanen" /&gt; The CSES has been one of the most widely used instruments in the field of psychology to assess collective group identity among racial and ethnic populations. In the initial CSES development study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques were used to examine the underlying factor structure of the proposed four-factor CSES. The preliminary prototype of the CSES consisted of 43 items. To shorten the instrument, Crocker and Luhtanen selected the 4 items with the highest factor loadings from each subscale to represent the final 16-item CSES. The actual scale is a list of statements that pertain to the person’s membership in a group or category and each is rated on a 7-point scale. The scoring is done through four subscales that are categorized as follows: 
1) Items 1, 5, 9, and 13 = Membership self-esteem. 
2) Items 2, 6, 10, and 14 = Private collective self-esteem. 
3) Items 3, 7, 11, and 15 = Public collective self-esteem. 
4) Items 4, 8, 12, and 16 = Importance to identity. 
First, reverse-score answers to items 2,4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 15, such that (1=7), (2=6), (3=5), (4=4), (5=3), (6=2), (7=1). Then sum the answers to the four items for each respective subscale score, and divide each by 4. 
Because the subscales measure distinct construct, it is strongly recommended against creating an overall or composite score for collective self-esteem.

===Race===
In the context of cross-cultural research using the CSES, Crocker Luhtanen, Blaine, and Broadnax explored the nature of collective self-esteem in Asian, Black, and White college students. Crocker et al. found that collective self-esteem was a significant predictor of psychological adjustment and that among the Black students in their sample, the correlation between public and private collective self-esteem was essentially zero. Based on this later finding, Crocker et al. surmised that Black college students might separate how they privately feel about their group from how they believe others may evaluate them.&lt;ref name="Branscombe" /&gt; This separation between public and private evaluations may represent an important survival strategy for Black Americans because of the prejudice and discrimination they face in the United States. The literature has suggested that Black Americans may generally feel good about their own racial group&lt;ref name="Verkuyten" /&gt; but still believe that external perceptions of their racial group may be negative or derogatory.&lt;ref name="Utsey" /&gt; This phenomenon might indicate a CSES factor structure for Black Americans that is different from that of other racial or ethnic groups in the United States.

===In-group and out-group bias===
Cremer et al. began a study expecting that people high in CSE engaged in indirect enhancement of the in-group. This finding suggests that predictions made by Social Identity Theory are more applicable to individuals with a high level of CSE. In this study, Cremer et al. found that participants identified more with the in-group than with the out-group. Participants high in CSE evaluated in-group members as fairer and more competent than participants low in CSE.&lt;ref name="Oosterwegel" /&gt; Cremer et al. also found that women expressed a higher level of CSE than men. These findings provide additional evidence that individuals high in CSE are more likely to engage in in-group distorting evaluations when there is a possible threat to their CSE.&lt;ref name="Cremer" /&gt; Applying the CSE scale in situations of a potential threat to the in-group (i.e., success or failure feedback), Crocker and Luhtanen found that, in contrast to people low in CSE, people high in CSE showed in-group favoritism, thereby indirectly enhancing the in-group. Individuals high in CSE will evaluate in-group members more positively than those low in CSE. The results concerning the in-group and outgroup evaluations seem to suggest that people with high CSE can be considered more confident about their esteemed social identity, making them search for more opportunities to enhance the collective self. As a result, those people will feel a greater need to evaluate their in-group members more positively (i.e., in-group favoritism) than people low in CSE. On the other hand, people low in CSE do not feel very confident about their social identity and, in order to avoid failure, they will consider out-group derogation as a more useful strategy to protect their social identity.

==Real-World Application==

Collective Self-Esteem can be seen in real-world applications through the use of [[Basking in reflected glory|BIRGing]] and CORFing.  Both different concepts but both effect and incorporate collective self-esteem into our everyday lives.

BIRGing (Basking In Reflected Glory) is when a person uses the association of another person’s success to boost his or her self-esteem or self-glory.  The act of BIRGing is often used to offset any threats made to a persons or a group’s self-esteem.  Sometimes, this act is actually made unknowingly and unintentional.  An example of BIRGing can be seen when your favorite sports team, say the University of Kansas men’s basketball team, has just won the national title.  You will notice when walking around campus or reading the local newspaper, you will be more likely to hear or read “We won!” or “We are the champs!” instead of "KU won!"

CORFing (Cutting Off Reflected Failure) can be seen in this same example, except when the team suffers a loss, the fans will change “we” to “they”.  For example, “They did not show enough heart” or “They really got outplayed today”. 

When someone uses BIRGing or CORFing, his or her collective self-esteem will be altered in either a positive or negative way and one must not only be careful on the frequency they are using these techniques, but also that these are often used unintentionally and can be taken out of context in many situations.  In an article titled “BIRGing and CORFing: From the Hardcourt to the Boardroom” by Kevin Meyer, the author provides an example of BIRGing and CORFing being used in the workplace for job security.  This can be seen when an employee aligns them self only with good projects or products and distances them self from poor outcomes and products. Employees must be careful when using these techniques often, because their coworkers may start to believe that that individual is only doing certain things to benefit him or herself and as Meyer states “throwing us under the bus” when hard times arise.&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;  Meyer also states “An effective leader must be willing to weather the storm, sharing in the collective successes but also standing up for their team when things don’t go to plan. For most, BIRG and CORF can be more difficult to accomplish in the workplace as our affiliation with a particular team or project is often more obvious”.&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;

One related topic to collective self-esteem is [[social identity theory]].  This theory is when an individual’s [[self-concept]] is formed by a particular social group. When individuals categorize themselves in these social groups they create this self-concept and self-esteem.  [[Prototype]]s and [[stereotype]]s are involved in the social identity theory. This theory can predict inter-group relations and behaviors. [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner]] created this theory to explain inter-group behavior. Tajfel and Turner felt that people innately categorize themselves into in-groups(8). Social identity theory correlates with collective self-esteem because an individual bases their self-esteem or self-concept off of group membership. Social identity theory is also related to [[self-categorization theory]].  Both collective self-esteem and social identity theory use groups to identify themselves and acquire self-esteem.

===In-group bias===
Another related topic is in-group bias, also known as [[in-group favoritism]]. This is simply when an individual has a preference for their own in-group. In-group is superiority is stressed. There is believed superiority over the out-group. A bias is formed for the in-group and the out-group is excluded. In-group bias is also related to [[group conflict]]. Tajfel and Turner in, An Integrative Theory of Inter-group Conflict discuss this.&lt;ref name="Tajfel" /&gt; Individuals who have in-group bias tend to reject negative information about the in-group and only accept and stress positive information. People who have in-group bias are more likely to have positive collective self-esteem. This could also result in increased collective self-esteem as well. Social identity theory is a major theoretical approach for the phenomenon of in-group bias. To go along with in-group bias is out-group bias, also known as [[out-group homogeneity]]. This is when people in the in-group view themselves as more diverse than the out-group, saying that they are more alike than them. There has been research done regarding this phenomenon with race.  Dickter and Bartholow did a study on, in-group and out-group attention biases revealed by event related brain potentials.&lt;ref name="Dickter" /&gt;  When looking at faces of other races (out-group) the brain interpreted them as similar and could not identify them, whereas facial recognition with same race (in-group) was easier for the brain and these faces appeared to be more diverse.&lt;ref name="Dickter" /&gt; Other examples of this are with sorority and fraternities, as well as gender. Both in-group and out-group bias are used to protect the collective self-esteem. Jane Elliot at a school in Iowa did a famous experiment done with in-group out-group bias. Dividing children into groups based on their eye color observed the prejudice that can occur with in-group, out-group bias. The in-group in this situation was blue-eyed children who proceeded to criticize children who were in the out-group, or did not have blue eyes. The roles were reversed but had the same results.&lt;ref name="Whitbourne" /&gt;

The world's poor are significantly more likely to have or incur a [[disability]] within their lifetime compared to more financially privileged populations. The rate of disability within impoverished nations is notably higher than that found in more [[developed countries]]. Though no one explanation entirely accounts for this connection, recently{{since when?|date=August 2014}} there has been a substantial amount of research illustrating the cycle by which poverty and disability are mutually reinforcing. Physical, cognitive, mental, emotional, sensory, or developmental impairments independently or in tandem with one another may increase one's likelihood of becoming impoverished, while living in poverty may increase one's potential of having or acquiring special needs in some capacity.

==Extent==
[[File:Disable begger in Dhaka.JPG|thumbnail|Man with disabilities in Bangladesh]]
A multitude of studies have been shown to demonstrate a significant rate of [[disability]] among individuals living in [[poverty]]. People with disabilities were shown by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] to comprise 15 to 20 percent of the poorest individuals in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."&gt;Elwan, A. (1999). Poverty and disability: A review of the literature. The World Development Report. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Former World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]] has stated that this connection reveals a link that should be broken. He stated, “People with disabilities in developing countries are over-represented among the poorest people. They have been largely overlooked in the development agenda so far, but the recent focus on poverty reduction strategies is a unique change to rethink and rewrite that agenda.”&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;The World Bank. (2011). Poverty and disability. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:20193783~menuPK:419389~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The link between disability and development has been further stressed by [[Judith Heumann]], the World Bank's first advisor for international [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]], who indicated that of the 650 million people living with disabilities today eighty percent live in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov"&gt;The Office of Policy Planning and Public Diplomacy. (2012). Special advisor Heumann's remarks on inclusive development.

[Social Impact]. RECOUP. Research Consortium on Educational Outcomes and Poverty (2005-2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department for International Development|United Kingdom Department for International Development]], 10,000 individuals with disabilities die each day as a result of extreme poverty, showing that the connection between these two constructs is especially problematic and deep-seated.&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is also present in developed countries, with the Disability Funders Network reporting that in the United States alone those with disabilities are twice as likely to live below the poverty line than those without special needs.&lt;ref name="Philanthropy"&gt;Dickson, J. (2011). Philanthropy's Blind Spot: The Disability Rights Movement. National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
According to the World Bank, “Persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic outcomes than persons without disabilities, such as less education, worse health outcomes, less employment, and higher poverty rates.”&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). Disability: Overview. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:21151218~menuPK:282706~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have demonstrated that these reduced outcomes may be attributed to a myriad of institutional barriers and other factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of disabilities in impoverished populations has been predicted to follow a cyclical pattern by which those who live in poverty are more likely to acquire a disability and those who have a disability are more likely to become impoverished.

===The vicious circle===
Experts from the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council attribute the connection between disability and poverty to many systemic factors that promote a “vicious circle.”&lt;ref name="Yeo"&gt;Yeo, R. &amp; Moore, K. (2003). Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: “Nothing about us, without us”. World Development 31, 571-590.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics affirm the mutually reinforcing nature of special needs and low socioeconomic status, showing that people with disabilities are significantly more likely to become impoverished and people who are impoverished are significantly more likely to become disabled. Barriers presented for those with disabilities can lead individuals to be deprived of access to essential resources, such as opportunities for education and employment, thus causing them to fall into poverty. Likewise, poverty places individuals at a much greater risk of acquiring a disability due to the general lack of health care, nutrition, sanitation, and safe working conditions that the poor are subject to.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt;

Experts assert that this cycle is perpetuated mainly by the lack of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] afforded to those living in poverty. The few options available to the poor often necessitate that these individuals put themselves in harms way, consequently resulting in an increase in the acquisition of preventable impairments.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Living in poverty is also shown to decrease an individual's access to preventative health services, which results in an increase in the acquisition of potentially preventable disabilities. In a study by [[Oxfam]], the organization found that well over half of the instances of childhood blindness and hearing impairment in Africa and Asia were considered preventable or treatable.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, H. (1999). Discussion paper for Oxfam: Disability as a development issue and how to integrate a disability perspective into the SCO. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate released by Oxfam provides further evidence of this vicious circle, finding that 100 million people living in poverty suffer from impairments acquired due to malnutrition and lack of proper sanitation.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

Discrimination
Prejudice held against individuals with disabilities, otherwise termed [[ableism]], is shown to be a significant detriment to the successful outcomes of persons in this population. According to one study following the lives of children with disabilities in South Africa, the children in the sample described "discrimination from other metal children and adults in the community as their most significant daily problem."&lt;ref name="Clacherty"&gt;Clacherty, G., Matsha, K., &amp; Sait, W. (2004). How do children with disabilities experience poverty, disability, and service? Cape Town, South Africa: Idasa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional forms of discrimination may lead disability to be more salient in already [[social exclusion|marginalized]] populations. Women and individuals belonging to certain ethnic groups who have disabilities have been found to more greatly suffer from discrimination and endure negative outcomes. Some researchers attribute this to what they believe is a “double rejection” of girls and women who are disabled on the basis of their sex in tandem with their special needs.&lt;ref name="Coleridge"&gt;Coleridge, P. (1993). Disability, liberation, and development. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes that accompany both of these attributes lead females with disabilities to be seen as particularly dependent upon others and serve to amplify the misconception of this population as burdensome.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; In a study done by Oxfam, the societal consequences of having a disability while belonging to an already marginalized population were highlighted, stating, “A disabled women suffers a multiple handicap. Her chances of marriage are very slight, and she is most likely to be condemned to a twilight existence as a non-productive adjunct to the household of her birth… it is small wonder that many disabled female babies do not survive.”&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Additionally, women with disabilities are particularly susceptible to abuse. A 2004 UN survey in Orissa, India, found that every women with disabilities in their sample had experienced some form of physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "&gt;United Nations. (2012). Fact sheet on persons with disabilities. Webaccessed: http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This double discrimination is also shown to be prevalent in more industrialized nations. In the United States, for example, 72 percent of women with disabilities live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; The intensified discrimination individuals with disabilities may face due to their sex is especially important to consider when taking into account that, according to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], women report higher incidences of disability than men.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Furthermore, the connection between disability and poverty holds particular significance for the world's women, with females accounting for roughly 70 percent of all individuals living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (2010). Integrating poverty and gender into health programs. The World Health Organization Webaccessed: http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/Nutritionmodule2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional discrimination also exists as there are policies existing in organizations that result in inequality between a disabled person and non-disabled person. Some of these organizations systematically ignore the needs of disabled people and some interfere in their lives as a means of social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Colin|date=1994|title=Institutional discrimination, disabled people and inter professional care|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2014.969831|journal=Journal of Interprofessional Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=203-212|doi=10.3109/13561829409010420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Another reason individuals living with disabilities are often impoverished is the high [[health care|medical costs]] associated with their needs. One study, conducted in villages in South India, demonstrated that the annual cost of treatment and equipment needed for individuals with disabilities in the area ranged from three days of income to upwards of two years' worth, with the average amount spent on essential services totaling three months worth of income.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, S., &amp; Harriss-White, B. (2001). ''The Economic Impact and Developmental Implications of Disability and Incapacity in Adulthood: a village study in South India''. Cambridge: Welfare, Demography, and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not take into account the unpaid work of caregivers who must provide assistance after these procedures and the opportunity costs leading to a loss of income during injury, surgery, and rehabilitation.
Studies reported by medical anthropologists Benedicte Ingstad and Susan Reynolds Whyte have also shown that access to medical care is significantly impaired when one lacks mobility. They report that in addition to the direct medical costs associated with special needs, the burden of transportation falls most heavily on those with disabilities. This is especially true for the rural poor whose distance from urban environments necessitates extensive movement in order to obtain health services.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;Ingstad, B. &amp; Whyte, S. R. (2007). ''Disability in Local and Global Worlds''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these barriers, both economic and physical, it is estimated that only 2 percent of individuals with disabilities have access to adequate rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;Leandro Despouy, 1993, Human Rights and Disabled Persons (Study Series 6), Centre for Human Rights Geneva and UN New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaccessibility of health care for those living in poverty has a substantial impact on the rate of disability within this population.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Individuals living in poverty face higher health risks and are often unable to obtain proper treatment, leading them to be significantly more likely to acquire a disability within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Financial barriers are not the only obstacles those living in poverty are confronted with. Research shows that matters of geographic inaccessibility, availability, and cultural limitations all provide substantial impediments to the acquisition of proper care for the populations of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, D. H., Garg, A., Bloom, G., Walker, D. G., Brieger, W. R., &amp; Rahman, H. (2008). "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Brieger2/publication/229569366_Poverty_and_Access_to_Health_Care_in_Developing_Countries/links/59e39a3a458515393d5b8faf/Poverty-and-Access-to-Health-Care-in-Developing-Countries.pdf Poverty and access to health care in developing countries]". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. doi:10.1196&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-specific ailments are particularly harmful for women living in poverty. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that each year 20 million women acquire disabilities due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth that could be significantly mitigated with proper pre-natal, childbirth, and post-natal medical care.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"&gt;DFID (2000). Disability, poverty, and development. The Department for International Development. Webaccessed: http://www.handicap-international.fr/bibliographie-handicap/4PolitiqueHandicap/hand_pauvrete/DFID_disability.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other barriers to care are present in the lack of treatments developed to target [[diseases of poverty]]. Experts assert that the diseases most commonly affecting those in poverty attract the least research funding. This discrepancy, known as the [[10/90 gap]], reveals that only 10 percent of global health research focuses on conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens, P. (2004) Diseases of poverty and the 10/90 gap. The World Health Organization. Webaccessed: http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Without a redistribution in research capital, it is likely that many of the diseases known to cause death and disability in impoverished populations will persist.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

===Institutional barriers===
Researchers assert that institutional barriers play a substantial role in the incidence of poverty in those with disabilities.

====[[Accessibility]]====
Physical environment may be a large determinant in one's ability to access ladders of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Imrie, R. (1996). Disability and the city: International perspectives. London: Chapman.&lt;/ref&gt; This "apartheid" has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt; Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="Clacherty"/&gt; Beyond physical accessibility, other potential excluding agents include a lack of [[Braille]], [[sign language]] and shortage of audio tape availability for those who are blind and deaf.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt;

====Education====
The roots of unemployment are speculated to begin with discrimination at an early age. [[UNESCO]] reports that 98 percent of children with disabilities in developing countries are denied access to formal education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, at least 40 million children with disabilities do not receive an education thus barring them from obtaining knowledge essential to gainful employment and forcing them to grow up to be financially dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; This is also reflected in a finding obtained by the [[World Development Report]] that 77 percent of persons with disabilities are illiterate.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."/&gt; This statistic is even more jarring for women with disabilities, with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] reporting that the global literacy rate for this population is a mere 1 percent.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; This may be attributed to the fact that, according to the World Health Organization, boys with disabilities are significantly more likely to receive an education than similarly abled girls.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"/&gt; Beyond simply the skills obtained, experts such as former World Bank advisor [[Judith Heumann]] speculate that the societal value of education and the inability of schools to accommodate special needs children substantially contributes to the discrimination of these individuals.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; It is important to note that the deprivation of education to individuals with special needs may not be solely an issue of discrimination, but an issue of resources. Children with disabilities often require [[Special education|specialized educational]] resources and teaching practices largely unavailable in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Action on Disability and Development (1998). ADD Uganda annual report. Kampala: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment====
Some sociologists have found a number of barriers to employment for individuals with disabilities. These may be seen in [[workplace discrimination|employer discrimination]], architectural barriers within the workplace, pervasive negative attitudes regarding skill, and the adverse reactions of customers.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, W.H., &amp; Wilder, E.I. (2005). Voices from the heartland: The needs and rights of individuals with disabilities. Brookline, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Edward Hall, "More disabled people are unemployed, in lower status occupations, on low earnings, or out of the labour market altogether, than non-disabled people."&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, R. &amp; Parr, H. (1999). Mind and body spaces: geographies of illness, impairment, and disability. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that roughly 386 million of the world's working age population have some form of disability, however, up to eighty percent of these employable individuals with disabilities are unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Statistics show that individuals with disabilities in both industrialized and developing countries are generally unable to obtain formal work. In India, only 100,000 of the country's 70 million individuals with disabilities are employed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; In the United States, 14.3 of a projected 48.9 million people with disabilities were employed, with two-thirds of those unemployed reporting that they were unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Similarly in Belgium, only 30 percent of persons with disabilities were able to find gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, R. (2000). [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf Disability issues, trends and recommendations for the World Bank]. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 45 percent of adults with disabilities were found to live below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliable data on the rate of unemployment for persons with disabilities has yet to be determined in most developing countries.

Sociologists Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer demonstrated that this exclusion of persons with disabilities from the paid labor market is a primary reason why the majority of this population experiences far greater levels of poverty and are more reliant on the financial support of others.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; In addition to the economic gains associated with employment, researchers have shown that participation in the formal economic sector reduces discrimination of persons with disabilities. One anthropologist who chronicled the lives of persons with disabilities in Botswana noted that individuals who were able to find [[informal sector|formal employment]] “will usually obtain a position in society equal to that of non-disabled citizens.”&lt;ref name="Ingstad"&gt;Ingstad, B. (1997). Community-based rehabilitation in Botswana. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the formal workplace is such a social space, the exclusion of individuals with disabilities from this realm is seen by some sociologists to be a significant impediment to social inclusion and equality.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Equity in employment has been strategized by some, such as sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters, to depend on heightened awareness of current barriers, wider use of assistive technologies that can make workplaces and tasks more accessible, more accommodating job development, and most importantly deconstructing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

Creating inclusive employment that better facilitates the participation of individuals with disabilities is demonstrated to have a significantly positive impact on not only the lives of these individuals, but also the economies of nations who implement such measures. The International Labour Organization estimates that the current exclusion of employable individuals with special needs is costing countries possible gains of 1 to 7 percent of their GDP.&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;International Labour Office. (2012). Employment for social justice and a fair globalization: Overview of ILO Programmes. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_140958.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The relationship between disability and poverty is seen by many to be especially problematic given that it places those with the greatest needs in a position where they have access to the fewest resources. Researchers from the [[United nations|United Nations]] and the [[Yale School of Public Health]] refer to the link between disability and poverty as a manifestation of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the assumption that this population is a drain of resources leads society to deny them access to avenues of success. Such exclusion of individuals on the basis of their special needs in turn denies them the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that disprove these stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Chamie, M., Me, A., &amp; Groce, N.E. (2000). Measuring the quality of life: Rethinking the World Bank's disability adjusted life years. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914180312/http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |archivedate=2000-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfam asserts that this negative cycle is largely due to a gross underestimation of the potential held by individuals with disabilities and a lack of awareness of the possibilities that each person may hold if the proper resources were present.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

The early onset of preventable deaths has been demonstrated as a significant consequence of disability for those living in poverty. Researchers show that families who lack adequate economic agency are unable to care for children with special medical needs, resulting in preventable deaths.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; In times of economic hardship studies show families may divert resources from children with disabilities because investing in their livelihood is often perceived as an investment caretakers cannot afford to make.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, B. (1999). Promoting the rights of the disabled children globally disabled children become adults: Some implications. Frome: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicte Ingstad, an anthropologist who studied families with a member with disabilities, asserted that what some may consider neglect of individuals with disabilities “was mainly a reflection of the general hardship that the household was living under."&lt;ref name="Ingstad" /&gt; A study conducted by Oxfam found that the rejection of a child with disabilities was not uncommon in areas of [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; The report went on to show that neglect of children with disabilities was far from a deliberate choice, but rather a consequence of a lack of essential resources. The study also demonstrated that services necessary to the well being of these children “are seized upon” when they are made available. The organization thus concludes that if families had the capacity to care for children with special needs they would do so willingly, but often the inability to access crucial resources bars them from administering proper care.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

==Current initiatives==
Initiatives on the local, national, and transnational levels addressing the connection between poverty and disability are exceedingly rare. According to the UN, only 45 countries throughout the world have anti-discrimination and other disability-specific laws.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Additionally, experts point to the Western world as a demonstration that the association between poverty and disability is not naturally dissolved through the development process. Instead, a conscious effort toward inclusive development is seen by theorists, such as Disability Policy expert Mark Priestley, as essential in the remediation process.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;Priestley, Mark. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrrpeMGQCLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Disability and the life course: Global perspectives]. NY, NY: University of Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights advocate [[James Charlton (activist)|James Charlton]] asserts that it is crucial to better incorporate the voices of individuals with disabilities into the decision making process.&lt;ref name="Nothing"&gt;Charlton, J.I. (2000). Nothing about us without us: Disability oppression and empowerment. London, England: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His literature on disability rights made popular the slogan, “Nothing about us without us,” evidencing the need to ensure those most affected by policy have an equitable hand in its creation. This need for agency is an issue particularly salient for those with special needs who are often negatively stereotyped as dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Nothing"/&gt; Furthermore, many who are part of the [[disability rights movement]] argue that there is too little emphasis on aid designed to eliminate the physical and social barriers those with disabilities face. The movement asserts that unless these obstacles are rectified, the connection between disability and poverty will persist.&lt;ref name=" Philanthropy "/&gt;

Employment is seen as a critical agent in reducing stigma and increasing capacity in the lives of individuals with disabilities. The lack of opportunities currently available is shown to perpetuate the vicious cycle, causing individuals with disabilities to fall into poverty. To address these concerns many recent initiatives have begun to develop more inclusive employment structures.&lt;ref name="ILO"/&gt; One example of this is the Ntiro Project for Supported and Inclusive Employment.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"&gt;Parmenter,T.R.(2011). Promoting training and employment opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. International Labour Office. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_167316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Located in South Africa, the project aims to eliminate the segragationist models prevalent in the country through coordinated efforts between districts, NGOs, and community organizations. The model stresses education and pairs individuals with intellectual disabilities with mentors until they have developed the skills necessary to perform their roles independently. The program then matches individuals with local employers. This gradualist model ensures that people who may have been deprived of the resources necessary to acquire essential skills are able to build their expertise and enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"/&gt;

The United Nations has been at the forefront of initiating legislation that aims to deter the current toll disabilities take on individuals in society, especially those in poverty. In 1982 the UN published the [[World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons]], which explicitly states "Particular efforts should be made to integrate the disabled in the development process and that effective measures for prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of opportunities are therefore essential."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=23&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine set stage for the UN Decade of the Disabled Person from 1983 to 1992, where, at its close, the General Assembly adopted the [[Standard Rules of the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/dissre00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Rules encourages states to remove social, cultural, economic, educational, and political barriers that bar individuals with disabilities from participating equally in society.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (2012). The convention in detail. Webaccessed: {{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612120639/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=222 |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that these movements on behalf of the UN helped facilitate more inclusive development policy and brought disability rights to the forefront.&lt;ref name="dfid_a"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new poverty agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics assert that the relationship between disability and poverty may be overstated. Cultural differences in the definition of disability, bias leading to more generous estimates on behalf of researchers, and the variability in incidences that are not accounted for between countries are all speculated to be part of this mischaracterization.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; These factors lead some organizations to conclude that the projection asserting 10 percent of the global population belongs to the disabled community is entirely too broad. Speculation over the projection of a 10 percent disability rate has led other independent studies to collect varying results. The [[World Health Organization]] updated their estimate to 4 percent for developing countries and 7 percent for industrialized countries. [[USAID]] maintains the initial 10 percent figure, while the United Nations works off half of that rate with a projection of 5 percent.&lt;ref name="dfid" /&gt; The percentage of the world's population with disabilities remains a highly contested matter.

The argument that development should be channeled to better the agency of individuals with disabilities has been contested on several grounds. First, critics argue that development is enacted to harness potential that most individuals in this population do not possess.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Second, the case that health care costs for many persons with special needs are simply too great to be shouldered by the government or [[NGO]]'s has been made, especially with regard to emerging economies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that investing in an individual's rehabilitation will result in substantial change in their agency. Lastly is the proposition of priorities. It is argued that most countries in need of extensive development must focus on health ails such as infant mortality, diarrhea, and malaria that are widespread killers not limited to a specific population.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

Critique with respect to potential solutions has also been made. In regards to implementing change through policy, critics have noted that the weak legal standing of United Nations' documents and the lack of resources available to aid in their implementation have resulted in a struggle to achieve the goals set forth by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="dfid_a" /&gt; Other studies have shown that policy on a national level has not necessarily equated to marked improvements within these countries. One such example is the United States where sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters purport that “the employment of disabled individuals has increased only marginally since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.”&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt; The smaller than anticipated impact of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] and other policy-based initiatives is seen as a critical flaw in legislation. This is because many issues surrounding disability, namely employment discrimination, are generally reconciled through the legal system necessitating that individuals engage in the often expensive process of litigation.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

[[File:Chief Justice John Marshall.jpeg|thumb|Chief Justice John Marshall]]
The '''Discovery doctrine''' is a concept of [[public international law]] expounded by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a series of decisions, most notably ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' in 1823.  Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] explained and applied the way that [[colonialism|colonial powers]] laid claim to lands belonging to foreign sovereign nations during the [[Age of Discovery]].  Under it, [[title (property)|title]] to lands lay with the government whose subjects travelled to and occupied a territory whose inhabitants were not subjects of a European Christian monarch. The doctrine has been primarily used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] possession of land in favor of colonial or post-colonial governments.

The 1823 case was the result of [[collusive lawsuit]]s where land speculators worked together to make claims to achieve a desired result.&lt;ref&gt;''How the Indians Lost Their Land: Law and Power on the Frontier'' Stuart Banner, 2005, pg 171-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Side of Efficiency: Johnson v. M'Intosh and the Expropriation of American Indian Lands'', Eric Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1065 2000, pg 148&lt;/ref&gt; John Marshall explained the Court's reasoning. The decision has been the subject of a number of law review articles and has come under increased scrutiny by modern legal theorists.

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States &amp; American Indians|last=Harjo|first=Susan Shown|publisher=[[National Museum of the American Indian]]|year=2014|isbn=9781588344786|location=Washington, DC|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States|last = Dunbar-Ortiz|first = Roxanne|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 2014|isbn =|location = Boston|pages = 197–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Johnson v. M'Intosh''==
{{main article|Johnson v. M'Intosh}}
The plaintiff Johnson had inherited land, originally purchased from the Piankeshaw tribes. Defendant McIntosh claimed the same land, having purchased it under a grant from the United States. It appears that in 1775 members of the Piankeshaw tribe sold certain land in the Indiana Territory to Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia and others. In 1805 the Piankeshaw conveyed much of the same land to [[William Henry Harrison]], governor of the Indiana Territory, thus giving rise to conflicting claims of title.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/Students/academics/journals/law-review/Issues/archives/upload/watson.pdf Watson, Blake A., "John Marshall and Indian Land Rights: A Historical Rejoinder to the Claim of “Universal Recognition” of the Doctrine of Discovery", ''Seton Hall Law Review'', Vol.36, 481]&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing whether the courts of the United States should recognize land titles obtained from Native Americans prior to American independence, the court decided that they should not. Chief Justice John Marshall had large real estate holdings that would have been affected if the case were decided in favor of Johnson.  Rather than remove himself from the case, however, the chief justice wrote the decision for a unanimous US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Report on Impact on Indigenous Peoples of the International Legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery |[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E%20C.19%202010%2013.DOC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312093507/https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E%20C.19%202010%2013.DOC |date=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
Marshall found that ownership of land comes into existence by virtue of discovery of that land, a rule that had been observed by all European countries with settlements in the New World. Legally, the United States was the true owner of the land because it inherited that ownership from Britain, the original discoverer.

Marshall noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe ... as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession. ... The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;[http://www.historytools.org/sources/Johnson-v-MIntosh.pdf Marshall, John. "Johnson v. M'Intosh", 21 U.S. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681, 8 Wheat. 543 (1823)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
{{PropertyLaw}}
Chief Justice Marshall noted the 1455 papal bull [[Romanus Pontifex]] approved [[Portugal]]'s claims to lands discovered along the coast of [[West Africa]], and the 1493 [[Inter Caetera]] had ratified [[Spain]]'s right to conquer newly found lands, after [[Christopher Columbus]] had already begun doing so,&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newcomb | first = Steve |date=Fall 1992 | title = Five Hundred Years of Injustice | journal = Shaman's Drum | pages = 18–20 | url = http://ili.nativeweb.org/sdrm_art.html | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but stated:
"Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the {{not a typo|Brazils}} by the same title."&lt;ref name=Marshall/&gt;

==United States law==
Marshall pointed to the exploration charters given to [[John Cabot]] as proof that the British had operated under the doctrine.&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;  The tribes which occupied the land were, at the moment of discovery, no longer completely [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and had no [[property]] rights but rather merely held a right of [[occupancy]].  Further, only the discovering nation or its successor could take possession of the land from the natives by conquest or purchase.

The doctrine was cited in other cases as well.  With ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', it supported the concept that tribes were not independent states but "domestic dependent nations".&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;  The decisions in ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'' and ''[[Duro v. Reina]]'' used the doctrine to prohibit tribes from criminally prosecuting first non-Indians, then Indians who were not a member of the prosecuting tribe.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html | title = Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law | accessdate = 2007-01-10 | last = Robertson | first = Lindsay G. |date=June 2001 | work = Native American Constitution and Law Digitization Project | publisher = The University of Oklahoma Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine has been cited by the US Supreme Court as recently as 2005, in City of Sherrill, NY v. Oneida Nation: "Under the 'doctrine of discovery...' fee title (ownership) to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign-first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States."

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery. In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legal critique ==
As the Piankeshaw were not party to the litigation, "no Indian voices were heard in a case which had, and continues to have, profound effects on Indian property rights."&lt;ref&gt;Dussias, Allison M., "Squaw Drudges, Farm Wives, and the Dann Sisters' Last Stand: American Indian Women’s Resistance to Domestication and the Denial of Their Property Rights", 77 N.C. L. REV. 637, 645 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Blake A. Watson of the University of Dayton School of Law finds Marshall's claim of "universal recognition" of the "doctrine of discovery" historically inaccurate.

In reviewing the history of European exploration Marshall did not take note of Spanish Dominican philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]]'s 1532 ''De Indis'' nor ''De Jure belli Hispanorum in barbaros''. Vitoria adopted from [[Thomas Aquinas]] the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'', and concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes, a position held previously by Palacios Rubios. His defense of American Indians was based on a scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Pagden, Anthony. ''Vitoria: Political Writings'', Cambridge University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall also overlooked more recent American experience, specifically [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]'s purchase of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Providence Plantation]]. In order to forestall Massachusetts and Plymouth designs on the land, Williams subsequently traveled to England to obtain a patent which referenced the purchase from the natives. The Royal Charter of Rhode Island issued by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] acknowledged the rights of the Indians to the land.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

Nor does Justice Marshall seem to have taken note of the policy of the Dutch West India Company which only conferred ownership rights in [[New Netherland]] after the grantee had acquired title by purchase from the Indian owners, a practice also followed by the Quakers in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

Watson and others, such as Robert Williams Jr. suggest that Marshall misinterpreted the "discovery doctrine" as giving exclusive right to lands discovered, rather than the exclusive right to treaty with the inhabitants thereof.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

== Contemporary advocacy efforts ==
Discovery doctrine has been severely condemned as socially unjust, racist, and in violation of basic and fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undesadspd.org/IndigenousPeoples/NewsandMedia/tabid/1615/news/259/Default.aspx Concluding session, Permanent Forum says impact of racist ‘Doctrine of Discovery’]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] noted Discovery doctrine "as the foundation of the violation of their (Indigenous people) human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E.C.19.2010.13%20EN.pdf|title=Preliminary study of the impact on indigenous peoples of the international legal construct known as the Doctrine of Discovery|publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=4 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]  Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called for a mechanism to investigate historical land claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/hr5088.doc.htm|title=Doctrine of Discovery|work=HR/5088|publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]|accessdate=21 November 2013|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] conducted on 8–17 August 2009, the bishops of the church adopted a resolution officially repudiating the discovery doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Schjonberg, Mary Frances.  [http://library.episcopalchurch.org/article/general-convention-renounces-doctrine-discovery "General Convention renounces Doctrine of Discovery"], ''Episcopal Life Online,'' 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] General Assembly in Phoenix, AZ, delegates of the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery and calling on Unitarian Universalists to study the Doctrine and eliminate its presence from the current-day policies, programs, theologies, and structures of Unitarian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/multiculturalism/dod&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, at its 29th [[General Synods of the United Church of Christ|General Synod]], the [[United Church of Christ]] followed suit in repudiating the doctrine in a near-unanimous vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/news/GS2013-Doctrine-of-discovery-repudiated.html  General Synod delegates overwhelmingly approve resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2016 Synod, 10-17 June in Grand Rapids, MI, delegates to the annual  general assembly of the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] rejected the Doctrine of Discovery as heresy in response to a study report on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebanner.org/news/2016/06/synod-2016-rejects-doctrine-of-discovery-as-heresy|title=Synod 2016 Rejects Doctrine of Discovery as Heresy|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, on November 3, a group of 500 clergy members publicly denounced the Doctrine of Discovery at the Standing Rock pipeline protests.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

Electronically reproduced audio and video is often processed to fit the original material with a wide dynamic range into a narrower recorded dynamic range that can more easily be stored and reproduced; This processing is called [[dynamic range compression]].

The human senses of [[Visual perception|sight]] and [[hearing]] have a very high dynamic range. A human cannot perform these feats of perception at both extremes of the scale at the same time. The eyes take time to adjust to different light levels, and the dynamic range of the human eye in a given scene is actually quite limited due to optical [[Glare (vision)|glare]]. The instantaneous dynamic range of human audio perception is similarly subject to [[Auditory masking|masking]] so that, for example, a whisper cannot be heard in loud surroundings.

A human is capable of hearing (and usefully discerning) anything from a quiet murmur in a [[soundproof]]ed room to the loudest heavy metal concert. Such a difference can exceed 100&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]] which represents a factor of 100,000 in [[amplitude]] and a factor 10,000,000,000 in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.paisley.ac.uk/~campbell/AASP/Aspects%20of%20Human%20Hearing.PDF |title=Aspects of Human Hearing |author=D.

== Audio ==
[[Audio engineer]]s use ''dynamic range'' to describe the ratio of the amplitude of the loudest possible [[Audio distortion|undistorted]] signal to the [[noise floor]], say of a [[microphone]] or [[loudspeaker]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballou Glen M., ''Handbook for Sound Engineers'', 3rd edition, Focal Press 2002, pp. 1107-1108&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic range is therefore the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) for the case where the signal is the loudest possible for the system. For example, if the ceiling of a device is 5&amp;nbsp;V (rms) and the noise floor is 10&amp;nbsp;µV (rms) then the dynamic range is 500000:1, or 114&amp;nbsp;dB:

:&lt;math&gt;20 \times \log_{10} \left(\frac{\rm 5\,V}{10 \, \mu \mathrm{V}}\right) = 20 \times \log_{10}(500000) = 20 \times 5.7 = 114 \,\mathrm{dB}&lt;/math&gt;

In digital audio theory the dynamic range is limited by [[quantization error]]. The maximum achievable dynamic range for a digital audio system with ''Q''-bit uniform quantization is calculated as the ratio of the largest sine-wave rms to rms noise is:&lt;ref name=seeber/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{DR_{ADC}} = 20 \times \log_{10} \left(\frac{2^Q}{1}\right) = \left ( 6.02 \cdot Q \right )\ \mathrm{dB} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, the usable dynamic range may be greater, as a properly [[dither]]ed recording device can record signals well below the noise floor.

The 16-bit [[compact disc]] has a theoretical undithered dynamic range of about 96&amp;nbsp;dB;&lt;ref name="Fries2005"/&gt;{{efn|The 96&amp;nbsp;dB figure is for a [[Triangle wave|triangle]] or [[sine wave]]. Dynamic range is 98 dB for [[sine wave]]&lt;ref name=seeber/&gt; (see [[Quantization (signal processing)#Quantization noise model|Quantization noise model]]).}} however, the ''perceived'' dynamic range of 16-bit audio can be 120&amp;nbsp;dB or more with [[Noise shaping|noise-shaped]] [[dither]], taking advantage of [[Equal-loudness contour|the frequency response of the human ear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html |title=24/192 Music Downloads ...and why they make no sense |last=Montgomery |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Montgomery |date=March 25, 2012 |website=xiph.org |accessdate=26 May 2013 |quote=With use of shaped dither, which moves quantization noise energy into frequencies where it's harder to hear, the effective dynamic range of 16 bit audio reaches 120dB in practice, more than fifteen times deeper than the 96dB claim. 120dB is greater than the difference between a mosquito somewhere in the same room and a jackhammer a foot away.... or the difference between a deserted 'soundproof' room and a sound loud enough to cause hearing damage in seconds. 16 bits is enough to store all we can hear, and will be enough forever. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707161555/http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html |archivedate=7 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Digital audio with undithered 20-bit quantization is theoretically capable of 120&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range. 24-bit digital audio affords 144&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range.&lt;ref name=HuberRunstein513/&gt; Most [[Digital audio workstation]]s process audio with 32-bit [[floating-point]] representation which affords even higher dynamic range and so loss of dynamic range is no longer a concern in terms of [[digital audio processing]]. Dynamic range limitations typically result from improper [[gain staging]], recording technique including [[ambient noise]] and intentional application of [[dynamic range compression]].

Dynamic range in analog audio is the difference between low-level thermal noise in the electronic circuitry and high-level signal saturation resulting in increased distortion and, if pushed higher, [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]].&lt;ref&gt;Huber, Runstein 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W9U7A-rSXtEC&amp;pg=PA416 pp. 416, 487] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120223132/https://books.google.com/books?id=W9U7A-rSXtEC&amp;pg=PA416 |date=2017-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple noise processes determine the noise floor of a system. Noise can be picked up from microphone self-noise, preamp noise, wiring and interconnection noise, media noise, etc.

Early 78 rpm phonograph discs had a dynamic range of up to 40&amp;nbsp;dB,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=308 Audio Engineering Society. E-Library. Jerry B. Minter. April 1956.

Vinyl microgroove phonograph records typically yield 55-65&amp;nbsp;dB, though the first play of the higher-fidelity outer rings can achieve a dynamic range of 70&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Recorded Music: Listening to Musical History |last=Day |first=Timothy |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-09401-9 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYdtlP6hvPoC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120223132/https://books.google.com/books?id=EYdtlP6hvPoC |archivedate=2017-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

German magnetic tape in 1941 was reported to have had a dynamic range of 60&amp;nbsp;dB,&lt;ref name="First100Years"/&gt; though modern day restoration experts of such tapes note 45-50&amp;nbsp;dB as the observed dynamic range.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aes.org/journal/suppmat/hess_2001_7.pdf |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |author=Richard L.

[[Compact Cassette]] tape performance ranges from 50 to 56&amp;nbsp;dB depending on tape formulation, with [[type IV tape]] tapes giving the greatest dynamic range, and systems such as [[XDR (audio)|XDR]], [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] and [[Dolby noise reduction system]] increasing it further. Specialized bias and record head improvements by Nakamichi and Tandberg combined with Dolby C noise reduction yielded 72&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range for the cassette.{{cn|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

The rugged elements of [[Dynamic microphone|moving-coil microphones]] can have a dynamic range of up to 140&amp;nbsp;dB (at increased distortion), while condenser microphones are limited by the overloading of their associated electronic circuitry.&lt;ref&gt;Huber, Runstein 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W9U7A-rSXtEC&amp;pg=PA127 p. 127] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120223132/https://books.google.com/books?id=W9U7A-rSXtEC&amp;pg=PA127 |date=2017-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical considerations of acceptable distortion levels in microphones combined with typical practices in a recording studio result in a useful operating range of 125&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name=Eargle/&gt;{{rp|75}}

In 1981, researchers at Ampex determined that a dynamic range of 118&amp;nbsp;dB on a dithered digital audio stream was necessary for subjective noise-free playback of music in quiet listening environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=11981 Audio Engineering Society.

Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the [[Audio Engineering Society]], that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out to get the noise floor.&lt;ref&gt;AES-6id-2000&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

== Video ==
When showing a movie or a game, a display is able to show both shadowy nighttime scenes and bright outdoor sunlit scenes, but in fact the level of light coming from the display is much the same for both types of scene (perhaps different by a factor of 10). Knowing that the display does not have a huge dynamic range, the producers do not attempt to make the nighttime scenes millions of times less bright than the daytime scenes, but instead use other cues to suggest night or day. A nighttime scene will usually contain duller colours and will often be lit with blue lighting, which reflects the way that the human eye sees [[Rod cells|colours at low light levels]].

[[Electronics]] engineers apply the term to: 
* the ratio of a specified maximum level of a [[parameter]], such as [[Power (physics)|power]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], [[voltage]]&lt;ref name=slyusar/&gt; or [[frequency]], to the minimum detectable value of that parameter. (See [[Audio system measurements]].)
* In a [[transmission system]], the ratio of the [[Overcurrent|overload]] level (the maximum [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] power that the system can tolerate without [[distortion]] of the signal) to the [[noise level]] of the system.
* In [[Digital data|digital]] systems or devices, the ratio of maximum and minimum signal levels required to maintain a specified [[bit error ratio]].
* Optimization of bit width of digital data path (according to the dynamic ranges of signal) can reduce the area, cost, and power consumption of digital circuits and systems while improving their performance. Optimal bit width of digital data path is the smallest bit width that can satisfy the required signal-to-noise ratio and avoid overflow at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Bin Wu, Jianwen Zhu, Farid Najm, ''Dynamic Range Estimation''.

*In audio and electronics applications, the ratio involved is often so huge that it is converted to a [[logarithm]] and specified in [[decibel]]s.&lt;ref name=slyusar/&gt;
* In digital antenna array before estimation Dynamic range of receivers should be use the correction of nonidentities of their magnitude and phase responses.&lt;ref name=slyusar/&gt; In this case the Dynamic range determine full limits  for use of receivers characteristics correction.

== Metrology ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
In [[metrology]], such as when performed in support of science, engineering or manufacturing objectives, dynamic range refers to the range of values that can be measured by a sensor or metrology instrument. Often this dynamic range of measurement is limited at one end of the range by saturation of a sensing signal sensor&lt;ref name=slyusar/&gt; or by physical limits that exist on the motion or other response capability of a mechanical indicator. The other end of the dynamic range of measurement is often limited by one or more sources of random [[noise]] or uncertainty in signal levels that may be described as defining the [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] of the sensor&lt;ref name=slyusar/&gt; or metrology device. When digital sensors or sensor signal converters are a component of the sensor or metrology device, the dynamic range of measurement will be also related to the number of binary digits (bits) used in a digital numeric representation in which the measured value is linearly related to the digital number. For example, a 12-bit digital sensor or converter can provide a dynamic range in which the ratio of the maximum measured value to the minimum measured value is up to 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; = 4096. With [[gamma correction]], this limitation can be relaxed somewhat; for example, the 8-bit encoding used in [[sRGB]] image encoding represents a maximum to minimum ratio of about 3000.

Metrology systems and devices may use several basic methods to increase their basic dynamic range. These methods include averaging and other forms of filtering, correction of receivers characteristics,&lt;ref name=slyusar/&gt; repetition of measurements, nonlinear transformations to avoid saturation, etc. In more advance forms of metrology, such as multiwavelength [[digital holography]], [[interferometry]] measurements made at different scales (different wavelengths) can be combined to retain the same low-end resolution while extending the upper end of the dynamic range of measurement by orders of magnitude.

== Music ==
In [[music]], ''dynamic range'' is the difference between the quietest and loudest volume of an [[musical instrument|instrument]], [[part (music)|part]] or piece of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=J.C.|last2=Rutledge|first2=J.C.|title=Multichannel dynamic range compression for music signals|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/543295/|website=IEEE XPlore|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=13 February 2017|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.1996.543295|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120223132/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/543295/|archivedate=20 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern recording, this range is often limited through [[dynamic range compression]], which allows for louder volume, but can make the recording sound less exciting or live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdmasteringservices.com/dynamicdeath.htm |title=The Death Of Dynamic Range |publisher=CD Mastering Services |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622150312/http://www.cdmasteringservices.com/dynamicdeath.htm |archivedate=2008-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamic range of music as normally perceived in a concert hall does not exceed 80&amp;nbsp;dB, and human speech is normally perceived over a range of about 40&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name=Eargle/&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Photography ==

[[Photography|Photographer]]s use "dynamic range" for the [[luminance]] range of a scene being photographed, or the limits of luminance range that a given [[digital camera]] or [[photographic film|film]] can capture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = High Dynamic Range Video | author1 = Karol Myszkowski | author2 = Rafal Mantiuk | author3 = Grzegorz Krawczyk | publisher = Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-59829-214-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PVPggnBIC-wC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=photography+luminance+dynamic-range+film#PPA16,M1 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140108014216/http://books.google.com/books?id=PVPggnBIC-wC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=photography+luminance+dynamic-range+film#PPA16,M1 | archivedate = 2014-01-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''opacity range'' of developed film images, or the "reflectance range" of images on photographic papers.

The dynamic range of [[digital photography]] is comparable to the capabilities of [[photographic film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://petapixel.com/2015/05/26/film-vs-digital-a-comparison-of-the-advantages-and-disadvantages/ |title=Film vs. Digital: A Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages |author=Michael Archambault |date=2015-05-26 |accessdate=2016-07-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617102152/http://petapixel.com/2015/05/26/film-vs-digital-a-comparison-of-the-advantages-and-disadvantages/ |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and both are comparable to the capabilities of the human eye.&lt;ref name=cambridge&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras-vs-human-eye.htm |title=Dynamic Range in Digital Photography |publisher=PetaPixel |accessdate=2016-07-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708040146/http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras-vs-human-eye.htm |archivedate=2016-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are photographic techniques that support higher dynamic range. 
*[[Graduated neutral density filter]]s are used to decrease the dynamic range of scene luminance that can be captured on [[photographic film]] (or on the [[image sensor]] of a [[digital camera]]): The filter is positioned in front of the lens at the time the exposure is made; the top half is dark and the bottom half is clear. The dark area is placed over a scene's high-intensity region, such as the sky. The result is more even exposure in the focal plane, with increased detail in the shadows and low-light areas. Though this doesn't increase the fixed dynamic range available at the film or sensor, it stretches usable dynamic range in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Magic of Digital Nature Photography | author = Rob Sheppard | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-57990-773-0 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=P39ysk_UwZcC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=graduated+neutral+density+filter+digital+image+sensor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Digital imaging]] algorithms have been developed to map the image differently in shadow and in highlight in order to better distribute the lighting range across the image. These techniques are known as [[Tone mapping#Purpose and methods|local tone mapping]], and usually involves overcoming the limited dynamic range of the sensor by selectively combining multiple exposures of the same scene in order to retain detail in light and dark areas. The same approach has been used in chemical photography to capture an extremely wide dynamic range: A three-layer film with each underlying layer at 1/100 the sensitivity of the next higher one has, for example, been used to record nuclear-weapons tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/mctl98-2/p2sec05.pdf ''The Militarily Critical Technologies List''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615151105/http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/mctl98-2/p2sec05.pdf |date=2010-06-15 }} (1998), pages II-5-100 and II-5-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer-grade [[image file formats]] sometimes restrict dynamic range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slrlounge.com/workshop/dynamic-range-and-raw-vs-jpeg/ |title=RAW vs. JPEG Overview |accessdate=2016-07-14 |publisher=SLR Lounge |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817061358/https://www.slrlounge.com/workshop/dynamic-range-and-raw-vs-jpeg/ |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe dynamic-range limitation in photography may not involve encoding, but rather reproduction to, say, a paper print or computer screen. In that case, not only local tone mapping, but also ''dynamic range adjustment'' can be effective in revealing detail throughout light and dark areas: The principle is the same as that of [[dodging and burning]] (using different lengths of exposures in different areas when making a photographic print) in the chemical darkroom. The principle is also similar to gain riding or automatic level control in audio work, which serves to keep a signal audible in a noisy listening environment and to avoid peak levels which overload the reproducing equipment, or which are unnaturally or uncomfortably loud.

If a camera sensor is incapable of recording the full dynamic range of a scene, [[high-dynamic-range imaging|high-dynamic-range]] (HDR) techniques may be used in postprocessing, which generally involve combining multiple exposures using software.

[[File:Ergodic hypothesis w reflecting rays.jpg|thumb|The question of ergodicity in a perfectly collisionless [[ideal gas]] with [[specular reflection]]s.]]
[[Image:Fruit fly trap.jpg|150px|thumb|This device can trap fruit flies, but if it trapped atoms when placed in gas that already uniformly fills the available [[phase space]], then both [[Liouville's_theorem_(Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] and the [[Perpetual_motion#Classification|second law of thermodynamics]] would be violated.]]
In [[physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], the '''ergodic hypothesis'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally due to L. Boltzmann. See part 2 of {{cite book|title=Vorlesungen über Gastheorie|year= 1898 |location=Leipzig|publisher=J. A. Barth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99IEAAAAYAAJ |oclc=01712811}} ('Ergoden' on p.89 in the 1923 reprint.) It was used to prove equipartition of energy in the kinetic theory of gases&lt;/ref&gt; says that, over long periods of time, the time spent by a system in some region of the [[phase space]] of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e., that all accessible microstates are [[equiprobable]] over a long period of time.

[[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's Theorem]] states that, for [[Hamiltonian dynamics|Hamiltonian]] systems, the local density of microstates following a particle path through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer moving with the ensemble (i.e., the [[Material derivative|convective time derivative]] is zero). Thus, if the microstates are [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] in [[phase space]] initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem does ''not'' imply that the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.

The ergodic hypothesis is often assumed in the [[statistical analysis]] of [[computational physics]]. The analyst would assume that the [[average]] of a process parameter over [[time]] and the average over the [[statistical ensemble]] are the same. This assumption that it is as good to simulate a system over a long time as it is to make many independent realizations of the same system is not always correct. (See, for example, the [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem|Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou experiment]] of 1953.)

Assumption of the ergodic hypothesis allows proof that certain types of perpetual motion machines of the [[Perpetual motion#Classification|second kind]] are impossible.  The figure above displays situations where the ergodic hypothesis does and does not hold for a simplistic model of an ideal gas.  If the walls are perfectly smooth and circular, the ergodic hypothesis does ''not'' hold.  If it was possible to construct a sort of ''tunnel'' whereby [[specular reflection]]s cause atoms to move from a less populated container to an identical one with greater density, this would allow the direct conversion of random [[thermal energy]] into useful [[Work (physics)|work]] in a way that does not require a [[heat engine|heat bath]].  But, by Liouville's theorem, if all regions of phase space are equally populated at time, t=0, then they are equally probable for all time.  No reflective 'trap' or [[Maxwell's demon]] (such as depicted in the figure) will 'unmix' a gas that has randomly filled both containers with equal density and pressure.

==Phenomenology==
In macroscopic systems, the timescales over which a system can truly explore the entirety of its own [[phase space]] can be sufficiently large that the thermodynamic equilibrium state exhibits some form of '''ergodicity breaking'''. A common example is that of spontaneous magnetisation in [[ferromagnetic]] systems, whereby below the [[Curie temperature]] the system preferentially adopts a non-zero magnetisation even though the ergodic hypothesis would imply that no net magnetisation should exist by virtue of the system exploring all states whose time-averaged magnetisation should be zero. The fact that macroscopic systems often violate the literal form of the ergodic hypothesis is an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].

However, complex disordered systems such as a [[spin glass]] show an even more complicated form of ergodicity breaking where the properties of the thermodynamic equilibrium state seen in practice are much more difficult to predict purely by symmetry arguments. Also conventional glasses (e.g. window glasses) violate ergodicity in a complicated manner. In practice this means that on sufficiently short time scales (e.g. those of parts of seconds, minutes, or a few hours) the systems may behave as ''solids'', i.e. with a positive shear modulus, but on extremely long scales, e.g. over millennia or eons, as ''liquids'', or with two or more time scales and ''plateaux''  in between.&lt;ref&gt;The introduction of the practical aspect of ergodicity breaking by introducing a "non-ergodicity time scale" is due to {{cite journal|first= R. G. |last=Palmer |title=Broken ergodicity |journal= Advances in Physics |volume =31|issue=6 |page= 669 |year=1982|bibcode = 1982AdPhy..31..669P |doi = 10.1080/00018738200101438 }}. Also related to these time-scale phenomena are the properties of [[ageing]] and the Mode-Coupling theory of {{cite book|first=W.|last= Götze|title=Dynamics of Glass Forming Liquids|publisher= Oxford Univ. Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ergodic theory]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] which deals with [[dynamical system]]s that satisfy a version of this hypothesis, phrased in the language of [[measure theory]].

'''Ethical arguments''' have arisen regarding [[torture]], and its debated value to [[society]]. Despite worldwide condemnation and the existence of treaty provisions that forbid it, some countries still use it. The [[ethical]] assertion that torture is a tool is at question.

==Premise==
{{see|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
The basic ethical debate is often presented as a matter of [[deontological]] versus [[utilitarian]] viewpoint. A utilitarian thinker may believe, when the overall outcome of lives saved due to torture are positive, torture can be justified; the intended outcome of an action is held as the primary factor in determining its merit or morality. The opposite view is the deontological, from Greek "deon" (duty), which proposes general rules and values that are to be respected regardless of outcome. However, if the outcome of policies allowing torture are uncertain (or if the outcome can not be definitely traced back to the use of torture) then there can be a utilitarian view that torture is wrong (see issues related to the ends justifying the means in analysis of the [[ticking time bomb scenario]]).

It has been suggested that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture indeed works in some instances to extract information/confession if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 |title=Terrorism and civil liberty: torture |work=[[The Economist]] |date=September 20, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Posner]], a highly influential judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, argued that "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary [[ticking time bomb scenario|to prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb]] in Times Square, torture should be used—and will be used—to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Posner |first=Richard |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-best-offense |title=The Best Offense |work=The New Republic |date=September 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some experienced intelligence officers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/8833108/Torture-is-not-wrong-it-just-doesnt-work-says-former-interrogator.html |title=Torture is not wrong, it just doesn't work, says former interrogator |work=The Telegraph |date=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-l-carle/zero-dark-thirty-torture_b_2395939.html |title=Glenn L. Carle: Zero Dark Thirty -- Torture Is the American Way? |work=Huffington Post |date=January 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have more recently come forward claiming that not only does torture not work, it can result in false information since people undergoing torture will say anything just to make the torture stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Rothrock | first= Col. John |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2302-2005Jan11.html |title=The Torture Myth |work=The Washington Post |date=January 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people also point to neuroscience to demonstrate that torture may further impair a person's ability to tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/09/21/the-tortured-brain.html |title=The Tortured Brain |work=The Daily Beast |date=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And the debate continues.

A utilitarian argument against torture is that the majority of tortures are employed not as a method of extracting information, but as a method of terrorizing and subjugating the population, enabling state forces to dispense with ordinary means of establishing innocence or guilt and with the whole legal apparatus altogether.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Therefore, it is better that a few individuals be killed by bombers than a much greater number—possibly thousands of innocent people—be tortured and murdered and legal and constitutional provisions destroyed. During the investigation of Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]]'s kidnapping, General [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] reportedly responded to a member of the security services who suggested torture against a suspect, "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue - 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Citation |authorlink=Alan M. Dershowitz |last=Dershowitz |first=A.M. |title=Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge |location=London |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2002 |page=134 |isbn=0-300-10153-8 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, torture has been reviled as an idea, yet employed as a tool and defended by its wielders, often in direct contradiction to their own averred beliefs.  Judicial torture was a common feature of the legal systems of many countries including all Civil Law countries in Europe until around the French Revolution.  This was part of ancient Greek and Roman Law theory that remained valid in Europe.  Roman Law assumed, for example, that slaves would not tell the truth in a legal court as they were always vulnerable to threats from their owners.  Their testimony could only be of value if it were extracted by a greater fear of torture.  Legal scholars were well aware of the problems of false testimony produced by the threat of torture.  In theory torture was not meant to produce a confession as such, but rather details of the crime or crime scene which only the guilty party would know.

The [[Spanish Inquisition]] is probably the most infamous example in which torture was used to extract information regarding allegations of [[heresy]]. In early modern times under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross examined.  When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the [[Tower of London]]. Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'' which was abolished in 1772).

The use of torture in Europe came under attack during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  [[Cesare Beccaria]]'s ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (1764) denounced the use of torture as cruel and contrary to reason.  The [[French Revolution]] abolished the use of torture in [[France]] and the French Armies carried abolition to most of the rest of [[Europe]].  The last European jurisdictions to abolish legal torture were [[Portugal]] (1828) and the canton of [[Glarus]] in [[Switzerland]] (1851).

Under codified legal systems such as France, torture was superseded with a legal system that is highly dependent on investigating magistrates and the confession remains ''The Queen of Proofs''.  Such magistrates are often under pressure to produce results.  It is alleged that in many cases police violence towards suspects has been ignored by the magistrates.  In the [[adversarial system]] of [[Common Law]] used throughout the English-speaking world, the experience is a different one. As the two parties have to convince a jury whether the defendant in a case is guilty or innocent of a crime, if the defence can persuade a jury that reasonable doubt exists over the credibility of a confession then the jury is likely to disregard the confession. If the defence can show that the confession was made under such duress that most people would make such a confession, then the jury is likely to question the confession's credibility. Usually the more duress that can be shown to have been used by law enforcement by the defence, the less weight most juries will place on confessions. In Britain partly to protect the individual against police brutality and partly to make confessions credible to a jury, all interviews with a suspect are audio taped on a machine which make two simultaneous copies one for the police and one for the defendant. In Northern Ireland, where society is more polarised than in the rest of the United Kingdom, which means that allegations of police brutality are perceived by sections of the community to carry more credence, interviews are video taped.

It has been alleged that in certain circumstances  torture, even though it is illegal, may have been used by some European countries. In "anti-terrorist" campaigns where information is needed for intelligence purposes, and not to obtain a confession for use in court, there is a temptation by the security forces, whether authorised by governments or not, to extract intelligence from alleged terrorists using any means available including the use of torture. Where there is a time component to a crime, for example in a kidnapping case, there is also a temptation for the police to try to extract information by methods which would nullify the use of such information in court.

==Debate==

===Proponents===
Some scholars have argued that the need for information outweighs the moral and ethical [[argument]]s against torture.

Two academics at [[Deakin University]] in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]], Professor [[Mirko Bagaric]], a Croatian born Australian based author and lawyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp?id=3915|title=Mirko Bagaric|work=On Line Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the head of Deakin University's Law School, and a fellow Deakin law lecturer, Julie Clarke, published a paper in the ''University of San Francisco Law Review'' arguing that when many lives are in imminent danger, "all forms of harm" may be inflicted on a suspect, even if this might result in "[[death|annihilation]]".The reasoning behind the proposal to legalise torture is that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bagaric |first=Mirko |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Clarke |first2=Julie |url=http://www.usfca.edu/lawreview/Vol39number3.htm |title=Not Enough Official Torture in the World?

{{quotation|as a society we would accept that one person being killed to save thousands is legitimate. ...&lt;br&gt;
Of course, it is far more repugnant to inflict harm on an innocent person than a wrongdoer''," said Professor Bagaric, "''But in some extreme cases, where it is almost certain someone has information that could prevent many lives being lost and there is no other way to obtain that information, the mere fact that they're not directly involved in creating that threat doesn't mean they can wash their hands of responsibility.}}

It was observed that Bagaric "was not the author of what he wrote, all he did was reintroducing Alan M. Dershowitz’ thesis, [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]]’s [Israeli] government legal adviser and the theorist of the legal torture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voltairenet.org/article30349.html Voltaire Network: Torture: the visible part of the iceberg] - 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also observed that Bagaric has written many pieces calling for men to be sentenced more than women for the same crime. This calls into question his ability to deal impartially with regard to crime and torture, which is mainly committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/01/why-we-should-close-womens-prisons-and-treat-their-crimes-more-fairly]&lt;/ref&gt;

When reviewing Alan Dershowitz's book, "''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge''" [[Richard Posner]], a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote
{{quotation|If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to [[Ticking time bomb scenario|prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb]] in Times Square, torture should be used - and will be used - to obtain the information. ... no one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility.|[[Richard Posner]], [[The New Republic]], September 2002&lt;ref name="Slackman NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hensher Independent" /&gt;}}

On December 20, 2005, [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.|Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] addressed the problem of whether [[torture]] should be used by American military forces in order to gain important information from terrorist suspects. Although he spoke out against any form of legal codification, he did state the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2005-12-20|title=Torture and the War on Terror: We Must Not Add Dirty Rules to Dirty Hands|work=AlbertMohler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Under certain circumstances, most morally sensitive persons would surely allow interrogators to yell at prisoners and to use psychological intimidation, sleep deprivation, and the removal of creature comforts for purposes of obtaining vital information. In increasingly serious cases, most would likely allow some use of pharmaceuticals and more intensive and manipulative psychological techniques. In the most extreme of conceivable cases, most would also allow the use of far more serious mechanisms of coercion – even what we would all agree should be labeled as torture.&lt;br&gt;
...I would argue that we cannot condone torture by codifying a list of exceptional situations in which techniques of torture might be legitimately used. At the same time, I would also argue that we cannot deny that there could exist circumstances in which such uses of torture might be made necessary.}}

===Opponents===
Many experts argue that torture is an unreliable means of obtaining useful information.&lt;ref name="Slackman NYT"&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Slackman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/weekinreview/16slac.html |title=What's Wrong With Torturing a Qaeda Higher-Up? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=16 May 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, many states have used torture not to extract information, but as a means of terrorising their populations or specific communities. [[Frantz Fanon]], in "[[The Wretched of the Earth]]" reports the French in Algeria using "preventative torture" on entirely innocent people to stop them doing anything in future.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In most countries torture is illegal, and this being so, outside the normal framework for establishing guilt or innocence. Therefore, an abnormally large proportion of torture victims are either innocent (apart from membership of target communities) or of mistaken identity. For example, [[Khalid el-Masri]], an innocent German citizen was kidnapped and tortured, having been mistaken for [[Al-Qaida]] chief [[Khalid al-Masri]]. The [[Red Cross]] in Iraq estimated that 80% of detainees at [[Abu Ghraib]] were the "wrong people".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004 05/003886.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the article by Professor Bagaric and Mrs Clarke, [[Amnesty International]] [[spokesman|spokeswoman]] Nicole Bieske, who is also a [[lawyer]], was stunned by the idea of regulating torture.
{{quotation|It's astonishing and appalling that somebody would hold this opinion in relation to such a fundamental issue as torture, and to be justifying it on moral as well as pragmatic grounds...&lt;ref name="ML-17May"&gt;Minchin,Liz.

Professor Bagaric and Mrs Clarke submitted the paper to an American law journal because of:
{{quotation|the kind of emotive comments that I've had here in Australia, saying that this view is horrendous, unthinking, and irresponsible.&lt;ref name="ML-17May"/&gt;}}

[[Joe Navarro]], one of the F.B.I.’s top experts in questioning techniques, told The New Yorker,

:“Only a psychopath can torture and be unaffected. You don’t want people like that in your organization. They are untrustworthy, and tend to have grotesque other problems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/070219fa_fact_mayer | title=Whatever it takes.

Toleration of torture and arbitrary detention has been likened to a "cancer of democracy" in a book of the same title by [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], which begins to undermine all other aspects of a state's legitimacy. On the 20th anniversary of the coming into force of the United Nations Convention against Torture, Philip Hensher writes "Civilization is at once compromised if, in defense of other freedoms, it decides to regress, to accept the possibility of torture as it is seen in the movies."&lt;ref name="Hensher Independent"&gt;{{Citation |first=Philip |last=Hensher |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article2710613.ece |title=Hollywood is helping us learn to love torture |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=26 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ticking time bomb scenario==
{{Main|Ticking time bomb scenario}}

In law enforcement, one perceived argument is the necessity of force to extract information from a suspect when regular interrogation yields no results and time is of the essence, as can be seen in the most frequently cited theoretical example is the "[[ticking time bomb]]" scenario, where a known terrorist has planted a [[nuclear bomb]]. In such circumstances, it has been argued, that not to use torture would be wrong, and by others that using torture would change society in a manner which would be worse.

The obvious rebuttal to this stance is that no such scenario has ever existed. In addition, those situations resembling such a case were resolved without the need to torture any suspect. Furthermore, it is asked whether torture would be limited to suspects, or whether one could torture the family and friends of this detainee to make him compliant.

*Supporters cite cases where torture has worked:

:In the case of [[Magnus Gäfgen]], who was suspected of kidnapping 11-year-old [[Jakob von Metzler]] and arrested in October 2002 by German police. Police surveillance had observed Gäfgen pick up a €1 million ransom demanded from the von Metzler family and proceed to go on a spending spree.  After the ransom was paid, the boy was not released. Fearing for the boy's safety Frankfurt's deputy police chief, [[Wolfgang Daschner]], had Gäfgen arrested and when he would not talk threatened to cause Gäfgen severe pain.  Gäfgen told police where he had hidden von Metzler's body.  In this case torture was threatened, but not used, to extract information that, in other circumstances, could have saved a boy's life. The ethical question is whether this can ever be justified. Wolfgang Daschner felt that in the circumstances it was justified. German Chancellor Merkel, in an interview on January 9, 2006 in reference to the Metzler case stated "The public debate showed that the overwhelming majority of citizens believed that even in such a case, the end does not justify the means. That is also my position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,394180,00.html|title=SPIEGEL Interview: Merkel: Guantanamo Mustn't Exist in Long Term|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=9 January 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Opponents, on the other hand, cite cases of rampant abuse: for example, in [[Chile]] and [[Argentin]]a in the 1970s and 1980s thousands of people "[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]" and were tortured or killed or both.

Beyond that, another reason is that torture fails to elicit the expected information because the subject is saying anything interrogators want to hear to stop the ordeal (or deliberately lies to waste the interrogators' time and make it more likely the bomb will go off), or worse: the detainee is innocent. By adopting a "the ends justifies the means" approach this would allow nine innocent people to be tortured as long as the tenth offered a full confession.

It has been estimated that as few as two dozen of the 600 detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] had any potential intelligence value even if it could be obtained from them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/politics/21GITM.html U.S. Said to Overstate Value of Guantánamo Detainees]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Free Will''''' is a 2012 book by American [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and author [[Sam Harris]]. Harris argues that the truth about the human [[mind]] (that [[free will]] is an [[illusion]]) does not undermine [[morality]] or diminish the importance of [[political freedom|political]] and [[Liberty|social]] freedom, and can as well as should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Free Will,’ by Sam Harris|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/books/review/free-will-by-sam-harris.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2012-07-13|access-date = 2015-10-31|issn = 0362-4331|first = Daniel|last = Menaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book Review: Sam Harris’ Free Will|url = http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-03-book-review-sam-harris-free-will|website = American Humanist Association|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will This Post Make Sam Harris Change His Mind About Free Will?|url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/will-this-post-make-sam-harris-change-his-mind-about-free-will/|website = blogs.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How free is the will?

==Overview==
Harris says the idea of free will "cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality" and is incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012). [http://www.philosophynews.com/post/2012/05/15/An-Analysis-of-Sam-Harris-Free-Will.aspx "An Analysis of Sam Harris' Free Will"]. Philosophy News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|title=Free Will and "Free Will"|url=https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/free-will-and-free-will|publisher=SamHarris.Org|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harris, science "reveals you to be a biochemical puppet."&lt;ref&gt;Nahmias, Eddy (August 13, 2012). [https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/does-contemporary-neuroscience-support-or-challenge-reality-free-will "Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?"] Big Questions Online.&lt;/ref&gt; People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Even without free will, consciousness has an important role to play in the choices we make. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.

==Critique==

The '''history of measurement systems in India''' begins in early [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] with the earliest surviving samples dated to the [[5th millennium BCE]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254&gt;Iwata, 2254&lt;/ref&gt; Since early times the adoption of standard weights and measures has reflected in the country's [[Indian architecture|architectural]], [[Folk culture|folk]], and [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgical artifacts]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; A complex system of weights and measures was adopted by the [[Maurya empire]] (322&amp;ndash;185 BCE), which also formulated regulations for the usage of this system.&lt;ref name=Allchin217/&gt; Later, the [[Mughal empire]] (1526&amp;ndash;1857) used standard measures to determine land holdings and collect land tax as a part of Mughal land reforms.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt; The formal [[metrication in India]] is dated to 1st october 1958 when the [[Indian Government]] adopted the [[International System of Units|International System of Units (SI)]].&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti390/&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Harrappan artefacts 08.JPG|thumb|Indus Valley Civilisation weights and measures - [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]
Standard weights and measures were developed by the Indus Valley Civilisation.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; The centralised weight and measure system served the commercial interest of Indus merchants as smaller weight measures were used to measure luxury goods while larger weights were employed for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer265&gt;Kenoyer, 265&lt;/ref&gt; Weights existed in multiples of a standard weight and in categories.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer265/&gt;  [[Technical standard]]isation enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in [[angular measurement]] and measurement for construction.&lt;ref name=Baber_b&gt;Baber, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform units of length were used in the planning of towns such as [[Lothal]], [[Surkotada]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Dholavira|Dolavira]], [[Harappa]], and [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached [[Persia]] and [[Central Asia]], where they were further modified.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254_quote&gt;In the third millennium BCE the Indus measuring system was further developed in the ancient regions of Iran and Afghanistan -- Iwata, 2254.&lt;/ref&gt; Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights unearthed from the Indus civilisation:

{{Quotation|1=A total of 558 weights were excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and [[Chanhudaro|Chanhu-daro]], not including defective weights. They did not find statistically significant differences between weights that were excavated from five different layers, each measuring about 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in depth. This was evidence that strong control existed for at least a 500-year period. The 13.7-g weight seems to be one of the units used in the Indus valley. The notation was based on the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[decimal]] systems. 83% of the weights which were excavated from the above three cities were cubic, and 68% were made of [[chert]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt;}}[[Image:HinduMeasurements.svg|thumb|200px|Hindu units of time—largely of mythological and ritual importance—displayed on a [[logarithmic scale]].]]

[[Ruler]]s made from [[Ivory]] were in use by the Indus Valley Civilisation prior to 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=Whitelaw14/&gt; Excavations at Lothal (2400 BCE) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about {{convert|1/16|in}}.&lt;ref name=Whitelaw14&gt;Whitelaw, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Whitelaw (2007)—on the subject of a ruler excavated from the Mohenjo-daro site—writes that: 'the Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32&amp;nbsp;inches (33.5&amp;nbsp;mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy—to within 0.005 of an inch. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.'&lt;ref name=Whitelaw15&gt;Whitelaw, 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Indus civilisation constructed [[pan balance]]s made of [[copper]], [[bronze]], and [[ceramic]]s.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; One excavated pan balance from Mohenjo-daro (2600&amp;ndash;1900 BCE) was constructed using a cord-pivot type fulcrum, a bronze beam, and two pans.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; A number of excavated surveying instruments and measuring rods have yielded evidence of early [[Indian cartography|cartographic activity]].&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1301-1302&gt;Schwartzberg, 1301&amp;ndash;1302&lt;/ref&gt;

Weights and measures are mentioned throughout the religious and secular works of the Vedic period in India.&lt;ref name=Sharma&amp;Bhardwaj_320/&gt; Some sources that mention various units of measurement are ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'', ''[[Apastamba|Apastamba Sutra]]'', and the ''Eight Chapters'' of the grammarian [[Pāṇini]].&lt;ref name=Sharma&amp;Bhardwaj_320&gt;Sharma &amp; Bhardwaj, 320&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomers]] kept a [[panchanga|pañcānga]] for calculations of ''[[tithi]]'' (lunar day), vāra (weekday), [[nakshatra|naksatra]] (asterism), and ''karan'' (half lunar day) for social and religious events.&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind&gt;See Sarma (2008) in ''Astronomy in India''.&lt;/ref&gt; Klostermaier (2003) states that: "Indian astronomers calculated the duration of one ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]'' (a cycle of the universe during which all the heavenly bodies return to their original positions) to be 432,00,00,000 years."&lt;ref name=Klostermaier03&gt;Klostermaier (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Maha Janapadas period—High Middle Ages (400 BCE&amp;ndash;1200 CE)==

[[Steelyard balance]]s—found in India since the 4th century BCE—have been excavated from the archaeological sites of [[Gandhara]] and [[Amravati]].&lt;ref name=Sharma&amp;Bhardwaj_332&gt;See Sharma &amp; Bhardwaj, pages 332 and 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of a complex system of weights and measures existing in use for multiple purposes under the central control of the [[Maurya|Maurya administration]] (322&amp;ndash;185 BCE) is found in the ''[[Arthashastra]]''.&lt;ref name=Allchin217/&gt; Archaeologist [[Frank Raymond Allchin]] outlines the details of the measurement systems of the Maurya state:

{{Quotation|1=The Arthashastra offers a wealth of evidence for the wide varieties of standardised weights and measures of the time. Officers were appointed to control their use and standardisation. The measurements include those of length, divided into several series, rising from those below the standard ''[[aṅgula]]'', defined as the 'middle joint of the middle finger of a man of average size'; to those above, including the [[span (length)|span]] and the [[cubit]], and ending with the rod (''danda'') or bow (''dhanus'') of around 180 cm; and above this measurement of longer distance, the ''goruta'' or ''krosa'' and the ''[[yojana]]''. Various special measurements are mentioned, for instance for digging [[moat]]s, making roads or city walls. Measurements of capacity were set on different standards, for revenue, trade, payments, or palace purposes: these were applicable for both liquids and solids. Weights, too, were in several series: for precious substances there were three, for [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[diamond]]s; another series was for weights and general purposes. Weights should be made of iron or of stone from the Mekhala hills. Considerable attention is given to the types of weighing machines employed: one is a balance (''tula'') with two pans, for which ten different sizes are recommended for weighing different quantities; and another a sort of steelyard, in two sizes. A steelyard is used as a symbol on the ''negama'' coins from [[Taxila]], suggesting their clear mercantile connotation. Equal attention is given to the measurement of time, based on the device named the ''nalika'', being the time taken for one ''adhaka'' of water to flow out of a pot through a hole of the same diameter as that of a wire 4 angulas long, made from 4 ''[[masa]]s'' of gold.&lt;ref name=Allchin217&gt;Allchin, 217&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depiction of equal arm balances is found in the art of [[Ajanta caves|Ajanta cave (No. 17)]] in the [[Maharashtra]] state.&lt;ref name=Sharma&amp;Bhardwaj_333&gt;Sharma &amp; Bhardwaj, 333&lt;/ref&gt; Beams of steelyard balances have been unearthed from the 8th century CE archaeological sites at [[Sirpur Group of Monuments|Sirpur]] and [[Arang]].&lt;ref name=Sharma&amp;Bhardwaj_333/&gt; The research conducted by [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|Abū Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Bīrūn]], an Islamic scholar who undertook one of the first studies of India's traditions in his ''Tahriq-e-Hind'', also reflect on the regular usage of the steelyard in India.&lt;ref name=Sharma&amp;Bhardwaj_334&gt;Sharma &amp; Bhardwaj, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Middle Ages—Republic of India (1200 CE&amp;ndash;1947 CE onwards)==

The [[China|Chinese]] merchant [[Ma Huan]] (1413&amp;ndash;51) outlines the standardised weight and currency system in place at the port city of [[Cochin]].&lt;ref name=Chaudhuri223/&gt; Ma Huan noted that gold coins, known as ''fanam'', or locally known as "panam",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=a S. Bartholomaeo|first=Paulinus|authorlink=Paulinus of St. Bartholomew|title=A voyage to the East Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nUOAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1800|publisher=printed by J.

The [[Mughal empire]] (1526&amp;ndash;1857) undertook central agrarian reforms, under which statistical data was compiled by the local ''quanungo'' officials on instructions from then revenue minister [[Todar Mal]].&lt;ref name=Richard84&gt;Richard, 84&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of these reforms, [[Akbar the Great]] (1556&amp;ndash;1605) enforced practical standardisation in the empire's weight and measure system.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt; The Mughal measurement system measured land in terms of ''[[Guz|gaz]]'' and ''[[bigha]]''.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt; The measure of agricultural output was the ''man''.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt; Todar Mal's reforms were resisted by large land holders in India, following which the land of these ''[[zamindar]]s'' was placed under the control of the Mughal treasury.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt; Mughal surveying parties used standardised bamboo rods with iron joints to clearly record land according to the standard imperial land measures.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt; These records were later used to collect land revenue corresponding to the land holdings.&lt;ref name=Richard84/&gt;

[[England|British]] units of measurement were adopted in India as first the [[East India Company]] and later [[British raj|colonial rule]] gained foothold.&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti390/&gt; The [[Republic of India]] adopted the metric system on 1st october 1958.&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti390&gt;Chakrabarti, 390&lt;/ref&gt; However, the traditional units still prevail in some areas.&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti391/&gt; Chakrabarti (2007) holds that: 'Yet a few areas have still remained untouched by the metric system. In the land-measuring system in India, possibly one of the most complex and archaic systems, we follow different sets of measuring units and systems in different parts of the country. Different State governments have tried to standardise this by introducing a suitable metric system through which official transactions take place and official records are kept. But the land dealings are still done in a number of archaic units. It appears that people are satisfied and comfortable with them.'&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti391&gt;Chakrabarti, 391&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''human spirit''' is a component of human [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[art]], and [[knowledge]] - the spiritual or mental part of humanity. While the term can be used with the same meaning as "human soul",  human spirit is sometimes used to refer to the impersonal, universal or higher component of human nature in contrast to [[soul]] or '''''psyche''''' which can refer to the ego or lower element. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity.

In the models of [[Daniel A. Helminiak]] and [[Bernard Lonergan]], human spirit is considered to be the mental functions of [[awareness]], [[insight]], [[understanding]], [[judgement]] and other reasoning powers.  It is distinguished from the separate component of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] which comprises the entities of [[emotion]], [[image]]s, [[memory]] and [[Personality type|personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL9hwUBJm18C |title=The human core of spirituality: mind as psyche and spirit |author=Daniel A. Helminiak |isbn=978-0-7914-2950-1 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Teske views human spirit as a [[social construct]] representing the qualities of purpose and [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] which transcend the individual human.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6i5ynN9qX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA189 |title=The human person in science and theology |chapter=The Social Construction of the Human Spirit |author=John Teske |isbn=978-0-567-08692-1 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the human spirit and soul==
According to  historian [[Oswald Spengler]], a distinction between Spirit and Soul has been made by the West and earlier civilizations which influenced its development.&lt;ref name = "spengler"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Spengler
|first=Oswald
|title=The Decline of the west(An abridged edition)
|chapter= vol2, chpt: 3 &amp; 8
|year=1922
|isbn=1-4000-9700-2
|publisher= Vintage Books, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The human spirit can be seen as the heavenly component of  human's non material makeup -  the part that is impersonal or universal.  Whereas souls are the personal element unique to each individual.  As Spengler writes in ''[[The Decline of the West]]'':

{{cquote| ... more important than all this is the opposition of Spirit and Soul (Hebrew: ''ruach'' and ''nephesh'', Persian: ''ahu'' and ''urvan'', Mandasan: ''monuhmed'' and ''gyan'', Greek: ''pneuma'' and ''psyche'') which first comes out in the basic feeling of the prophetic religions, then pervades the whole of Apocalyptic, and finally forms and guides the world-contemplations of the awakened Culture - as seen with Philo, Paul and Plotinus, Gnostics and Mandeans, Augustine and the Avesta, Islam and the Kabbalah. ''Ruach'' means originally "wind" and ''nephesh'' "breath."  The ''nephesh'' is always in one way or another related to the bodily and earthly, to the below, the evil, the darkness. Its effort is the "upward." The ''ruach'' belongs to the divine, to the above, to the light. Its effects in man when it descends are the heroism of a Samson, the holy wrath of an Elijah, the enlightenment of the judge (e.g. Solomon passing judgment) and all kinds of divination and ecstasy. It is poured out. As in Isaiah xi, x, the Messiah becomes the incarnation of the ''ruach''.&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;}}

In Christianity, the [[Bible]] identifies humanity's three basic elements: spirit, soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%205:23&amp;version=NIV 1 Thes 5:23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians emphasise  that the human spirit is the 'real person', the very core of a person's being, the essential seat of their existence. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, it is their human spirit that is transformed as they become 'new creatures' in Jesus Christ. The soul which is the seat of the will, mind and emotions does not get converted but needs to be renewed on a daily basis through the recommended Christian disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 1 Cor 6:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 2 Cor 5:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV Rom 12:2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, Muslims are viewed as having their own spirits, but one that in a sense is one with God's spirit. For [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]], the perception of unity this idea led to was important for the emergence of the "consensus" that maintained harmony in Islamic culture, especially during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;

'''Joseph Raya''' (August 15, 1916 – June 10, 2005), born in [[Zahlé, Lebanon]], was a prominent [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]] [[archbishop]], theologian, civil rights advocate and author. He served as metropolitan of [[Akko]], [[Haifa]], [[Nazareth]] and All [[Galilee]] from 1968 until 1974 and was particularly known for his commitment to seeking reconciliation between Christians, Jews and Muslims. He was also a leading advocate of celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]] in [[vernacular]] languages.

==Life==

===Early life===
Joseph-Marie Raya was born to Almez and Mikhail Raya of Zahle and was the seventh of eight children.&lt;ref name="Sabada 2006, p. 55"&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing his elementary education at the Oriental College he studied in Paris before entering St. Anne's seminary in [[Jerusalem]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Sabada 2006, p. 55"/&gt; He was ordained a priest of the Melkite Catholic Church on July 20, 1941. He later taught at the Patriarchal College on Queen Nazli Street in [[Cairo]]. Raya was expelled from Egypt in 1948 by [[King Farouk]] for defending the rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;Sabana (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States in 1949.

===Birmingham and the civil rights movement===
After serving as assistant pastor of St. Ann's Melkite Catholic Church in [[Woodland Park, New Jersey]], he was appointed pastor of St. George Melkite Greek Catholic Church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1952. His championing civil rights brought him into close friendship with Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Raya marched several times at King's side and suffered three times at the hands of the [[Ku Klux Klan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; including one occasion when he was kidnapped and severely beaten by three Klansmen.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Defying the threat of excommunication issued by Roman Catholic Archbishop [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]], Raya helped King and other civil rights demonstrators organize protests and marches throughout Alabama during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 67-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Toolen Criticizes Presence of Priests, Sisters in Demonstrations". ''Catholic Week'', March 19, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Raya went on to found [[Saint Moses the Black]] Mission, the first Eastern Catholic mission for African Americans, located in downtown Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also very close to social justice activist [[Catherine Doherty]], and he became the first Associate Priest of her [[Madonna House Apostolate]] in [[Combermere, Ontario]], Canada, on July 1, 1959. When he became Archbishop of Nazareth he ordained her husband [[Eddie Doherty]] to the priesthood.

===Advocate of the vernacular for liturgical services===
As a priest in Alabama, Raya advocated for younger generations to have church services in their own languages, and translated the Gospels, Missal, and Byzantine Divine Liturgy into English. Raya created a controversy when he invited Bishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]], the famous television Catholic personality,  to celebrate the Pontifical Byzantine Divine Liturgy in English in 1958 at the Melkite National Convention. Bishop Sheen celebrated the Liturgy in English on television, inspiring some Catholics to renew calls for widespread use of the vernacular but raising the ire of traditionalists.

The Roman Catholic archbishop of Mobile, Alabama, [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]], banned Raya from celebrating the Divine Liturgy in English in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Pope John XXIII]] intervened in March 1960 at the request of Melkite Patriarch [[Maximos IV Sayegh]] to decide the question in favor of the Byzantine custom of celebrating the Divine Mysteries in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Raya's liturgical translation was declared the official English translation for the Catholic Byzantine rites.

Patriarch Maximos IV recognized Raya's successes by elevating him to the dignity of [[Archimandrite|Grand Archimandrite]] of [[Jerusalem]] and appointing him a member of the Melkite patriarchal delegation to the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In a significant break with tradition, the church fathers of Vatican II decided to allow widespread use of vernacular in the Catholic Church. After completing his work at Vatican II Raya continued to translate Melkite works into English. In 1968, with Baron Jose de Vinck of Alleluia Press in New Jersey, he authored ''Byzantine Daily Worship'', a compendium in English of the Divine Liturgy, Office of the Hours, and the sacraments.

===Episcopate===
Following his appointment as archbishop of [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], [[Haifa]], [[Nazareth]] and All [[Galilee]] on October 20, 1968, Archbishop Joseph led a peaceful demonstration of thousands of Arabs and Jews in Israel seeking justice for the villages of [[Kafr Bir'im]] and [[Iqrit]] in Upper Galilee that had been depopulated in 1948, and then destroyed. Iqrit was the hometown of his second successor, Archbishop [[Elias Chacour]]. He sought justice through non-violent means and called upon Palestinians to be good citizens of Israel.

Describing Raya's actions, Father John Catoir wrote in 1969:

{{quote|They (Christian Arabs) are in no mood for brotherhood talks, but (Raya) commands them to stop hating the Jews, to purge their hearts of hatred and contention which breeds only misery and further suffering.

At the closing session of the Israeli parliament he thundered to the Jewish representatives, alternating between French, Arabic, and English for all to understand, that they have done to the Arabs some of the very same things they themselves lament so bitterly in their own history of persecution.

It is quite a thing to see a living prophet in action, challenging the inflamed passions of ancient enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 84-85 (excerpted from Catoir, John ''A Prophet in Action'', 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August, 1972 he ordered all churches in his eparchy closed one Sunday to mourn for "the death of justice in Israel" as the two villages remained dispossessed. Explaining his position, Raya said:

{{quote|No end justifies injustice -- even if that end seems to be the good of the state or of a nation. If you base security on denial of justice, no amount of money can guarantee that security. Not even an army as strong as all of the legions of Rome will be able to insure it.&lt;ref&gt;Nester, Marie Yaroshak. ''We Are God's People,'' p. 87. God With Us Publications, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As archbishop, Raya was a controversial figure. While many admired his charismatic style and ecumenical leadership, some Arabs and members of the church hierarchy resented his overtures to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Resigns". ''The Jerusalem Post'', 30 September 1974, as referenced in Sabada, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Raya was opposed to the Melkite Holy Synod's proposal to internationalize Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; He also upset the Vatican with his aggressive campaign for the return of the Bir'im and Ikrit refugees and the sale of church land to impoverished Moslem farmers.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Raya on reported rift with Vatican 'No one can make me resign'". ''The Jerusalem Post'', March 1973, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Raya's letter of resignation declared that the Church hierarchy forced his decision to leave his post.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Israel considered him dangerous, but when he resigned Prime Minister Golda Meir begged him to reconsider.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Raya's resignation came as a shock to many. The local Christian Youth Club collected several thousand signatures asking him to reconsider,&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders in Israel and abroad voiced disappointment. Yoram Kaniuk described their thoughts on the archbishop, describing Raya as "incomprehensible. The great majority of people viewed him with suspicion. Because he failed to conform to generally accepted notions ... Unusual people, deeply religious men, men of morals we won't understand. Bishop Raya was out of step. He bore Israel no animosity. He cared for and looked after his spiritual flock."&lt;ref&gt;"Two Bishops in Israel - One was a Friend!" ''Heritage Newspaper'', Southwest Jewish Press, Nov. 8, 1974, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Departing his post, Raya used his final pastoral letter to underscore his ecumenical approach:

{{quote|I came to the Holy Land to give. And behold! I was overwhelmed by what I received! I came to enrich and purify! And behold! I was the one to be enriched and purified. I loved the family of the Lord. His family are both the Jews and the Arabs. I held the Muslims, the Druze, the Jew, the Christian, everyone believer and unbeliever, in the same embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Raya, Joseph. Pastoral Letter, September 1974, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After resigning his archbishopric on July 13, 1974, Raya moved to [[Madonna House Apostolate|Madonna House]] in Combermere, Ontario, Canada. At some time between his resignation and 1975 he suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and had a [[quadruple bypass]] operation in Lexington, Kentucky. From his home in Combermere he lectured and wrote on Byzantine spirituality at various places,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=1071|title=Peace and Conflict Monitor, Archbishop Joseph Raya – Apostle of Peace and Love|website=www.monitor.upeace.org|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; among them [[Fordham University]]'s John XXIII Ecumenical Center in [[The Bronx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLpXKsNeVYC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=John+XXIII+Ecumenical+Center,+bronx&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qf5TrvLAaC&amp;sig=-9J5k2Pfyi-GrYy3Mb2HEb6DZa0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSpKaaktjcAhVLEawKHd2dBDoQ6AEwAXoECA8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20XXIII%20Ecumenical%20Center,%20bronx&amp;f=false|title=Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works|last=Dionysius|date=1987|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809128389|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Patriarchal Major Seminary at Raboue in Antelias, Lebanon. He returned to Lebanon in 1985 to assist the Diocese of Beirut with Archbishop Habib Bacha. In 1987 he assumed interim leadership of the Archdiocese of Paneas in [[Marjayoun|Marjayoun, Lebanon]], which had been destroyed by the 1974 − 1991 [[Lebanese civil war]]. He moved back to Canada after the completion of this assignment and retired at Madonna House in 1990. Raya died on June 10, 2005, at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in Barry's Bay, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonnahouse.org/restoration/2005/06/archbishop_joseph_m_raya_has_.html |title=Archbishop Joseph M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Journaliste en danger''' ('''JED''') is an independent, non partisan [[non-profit organization]] ({{lang-fr|association à but non lucratif}}) founded on November 20, 1998 in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], on the initiative of a group of [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Congolese]] [[journalist]]s for the defence and promotion of the [[press freedom]] in DR Congo. 

JED was founded out of the concern that press freedom was being violated and that journalists had become victims of unfair justice. JED is not an association reserved solely for journalists, but rather a wholly independent and open structure to all those who feel like having a vocation to defend and promote their right to inform and to be informed freely without any restriction. 

Since May 2003, JED has been active in eight other [[Central Africa]]n countries: [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Congo Brazzaville]], [[Gabon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], The [[Central African Republic]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Chad]].

JED is a member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of non-governmental organisations that monitors [[freedom of expression]] worldwide and defends journalists, writers, internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to [[freedom of expression]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8566">While a `type` is a description of a specific set of values, a `kind` is a descripton of a specific quantity of `types` as in 1, 2, 3, etc. Some `type` constructors, such as a `Monad`, require only one `type` to be able to fully construct a new `type` while others may require two or three `types` to completely construct/describe their `type`. Still, another `type` constuctor may return a `type` constructor that requires even more `types`. Note, that the function `type` constructor, `-&gt;`, has a `kind` of 2 and is shown as, `(* -&gt; *)`, where `*` represents a `kind`. The idea of kinds generalizes the notion of generics.

In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''kind''' is the type of a [[type constructor]] or, less commonly, the type of a [[higher-order type operator]]. A kind system is essentially a [[simply typed lambda calculus]] "one level up", endowed with a primitive type, denoted &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and called "type", which is the kind of any [[data type]] which does not need any [[parametric polymorphism|type parameters]].

A kind is sometimes confusingly described as the "type of a [[data type|(data) type]]", but it is actually more of an [[arity]] specifier. Syntactically, it is natural to consider polymorphic types to be type constructors, thus non-polymorphic types to be [[nullary]] type constructors. But all nullary constructors, thus all monomorphic types, have the same, simplest kind; namely &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

Since higher-order type operators are uncommon in [[programming language]]s, in most programming practice, kinds are used to distinguish between data types and the types of constructors which are used to implement [[parametric polymorphism]]. Kinds appear, either explicitly or implicitly, in languages whose type systems account for parametric polymorphism in a programatically accessible way, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]&lt;!-- have to check Scala, but I bet it allows parametric polymorphism --&gt;.&lt;ref name="higherkinds"&gt;[https://adriaanm.github.com/files/higher.pdf Generics of a Higher Kind]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "type", is the kind of all [[data type]]s seen as [[nullary]] type constructors, and also called proper types in this context. This normally includes function types in [[functional programming language]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[unary function|unary]] [[type constructor]], e.g. of a [[list type]] constructor.
* &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] type constructor (via [[currying]]), e.g. of a [[pair type]] constructor, and also that of a [[function type]] constructor (not to be confused with the result of its application, which itself is a function type, thus of kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;(* \rightarrow *) \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a higher-order type operator from unary type constructors to proper types.&lt;ref&gt; Pierce (2002), chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds in Haskell ==
(''Note'': Haskell documentation uses the same arrow for both function types and kinds.)

[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s kind system&lt;ref name="haskell98"&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1 Kinds - The Haskell 98 Report]&lt;/ref&gt; has just two rules:{{Vague|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--does this mean it prohibits higher order type operators? I can't tell from the report. --&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "type" is the kind of all [[data type]]s.
* &lt;math&gt;k_1 \rightarrow k_2&lt;/math&gt; is the kind of a [[unary function|unary]] [[type constructor]], which takes a type of kind &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and produces a type of kind &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;.

An inhabited type (as proper types are called in Haskell) is a type which has values. For instance, ignoring [[type class]]es which complicate the picture, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; is a value of type &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt; is a value of type &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Ints). Therefore, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; have kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, but so does any function type, for instance &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;.

A type constructor takes one or more type arguments, and produces a data type when enough arguments are supplied, i.e. it supports [[partial application]] thanks to currying.&lt;ref name=haskell-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 4 Declarations and Binding|url=http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch4.html#x10-65017x3|work=Haskell 2010 Language Report|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miran|first=Lipovača|title=Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!|url=http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses|work=Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Haskell achieves parametric types. For instance, the type &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; (list) is a type constructor - it takes a single argument to specify the type of the elements of the list. Hence, &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Ints), &lt;code&gt;[Float]&lt;/code&gt; (list of Floats) and even &lt;code&gt;[&amp;#91;Int&amp;#93;]&lt;/code&gt; (list of lists of Ints) are valid applications of the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; type constructor. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; is a type of kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, applying it to &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; results in &lt;code&gt;[Int]&lt;/code&gt;, of kind &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;. The 2-[[tuple]] constructor &lt;code&gt;(,)&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;, the 3-tuple constructor &lt;code&gt;(,,)&lt;/code&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow * \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; and so on.
&lt;!-- needs rewriting to say what it really wants to  say, that is how kind inference is performed, but note that no kind polymorphism is allowed, so it's not quite the same.
The way kinds govern types is analogous to the way types govern values. If an expression &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_1 \to t_2&lt;/math&gt; (that is, it is a function which accepts a type &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and produces a type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the result of the function application &lt;math&gt;f \ x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly if an expression &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_1 \rightarrow k_2&lt;/math&gt;, and type &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the result of the type application &lt;math&gt;t_1 \ t_2&lt;/math&gt; has kind &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

=== Kind inference ===

Standard Haskell does not allow [[polymorphic kind]]s. This is in contrast to [[parametric polymorphism]] on types, which is supported in Haskell.  For instance, in the following example:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree z  = Leaf | Fork (Tree z) (Tree z)
&lt;/source&gt;

the kind of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; could be anything, including &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, but also &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; etc. Haskell by default will always infer kinds to be &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, unless the type explicitly indicates otherwise (see below). Therefore the type checker will reject the following use of &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
type FunnyTree = Tree []     -- invalid
&lt;/source&gt;

because the kind of &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;math&gt;* \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt; does not match the expected kind for &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;, which is always &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

Higher-order type operators are allowed however. For instance:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data App unt z = Z (unt z)
&lt;/source&gt;

has kind &lt;math&gt;(* \rightarrow *) \rightarrow * \rightarrow *&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;code&gt;unt&lt;/code&gt; is expected to be a unary data constructor, which gets applied to its argument, which must be a type, and returns another type.

[[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] has the extension &lt;code&gt;PolyKinds&lt;/code&gt;, which, together with &lt;code&gt;KindSignatures&lt;/code&gt;, allows polymorphic kinds. For example:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree (z :: k) = Leaf | Fork (Tree z) (Tree z)
type FunnyTree = Tree []     -- OK
&lt;/source&gt;

In GHC 8.0.1, types and kinds can merged using the experimental compiler option &lt;code&gt;-XTypeInType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XTypeInType&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Signalisationbilinguelimousin.jpg|thumb|[[French language|French]]/[[Occitan language|Occitan]] bilingual [[Traffic sign|signs]] in [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]].]]
[[France]] has one [[official language]], the [[French language]].  The [[French government]] does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications.  In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the [[European Union]] and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]].  The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Besides French, there exist many other vernacular minority [[languages of France]], both in [[European France]], in [[Overseas France]], and in French [[overseas territories]].  These languages are recognized by article 75-1 of the [[Constitution of France|French constitution]].&lt;ref name="regionsqu"&gt;Article 75-1: (a new article): "Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France" ("Regional languages belong to the patrimony of France"). See [[:fr:Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008|Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In France proper, [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have an official status in the regions where they are spoken.  The 1999 report&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/lang-reg/rapport_cerquiglini/langues-france.html Les langues de la France, Report of Bernard Cerquiglini]&lt;/ref&gt; written for the French government by [[Bernard Cerquiglini]] identified 75 languages (including just [[#Endangered_languages|eight]] in continental France proper) that would qualify for recognition were the government to ratify the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (currently only signed but not ratified).

== History ==
The [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] of 1539 made French the administrative language of the kingdom of France for legal documents and laws. Previously, official documents were written in medieval [[Latin]], which was the language used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

===Académie française===
The [[Académie française]] was established in 1635 to act as the official authority on the usages, vocabulary, and grammar of the French language, and to publish an [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|official dictionary of the French language]]. Its recommendations however carry no legal power and are sometimes disregarded even by governmental authorities. In recent years the Académie has tried to prevent the [[Anglicisation]] of the French language.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/index.html La langue française » La politique linguistique aujourd'hui] on the site of [[Académie française]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
Prior to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, French kings did not take a strong position on the language spoken by their subjects. However, in sweeping away the old provinces, [[parlement]]s and laws, the Revolution strengthened the unified system of administration across the state. At first, the revolutionaries declared liberty of language for all citizens of the Republic; this policy was subsequently abandoned in favour of the imposition of a common language which was to do away with the other languages of France. Other languages were seen as keeping the peasant masses in [[obscurantism]].

The new idea was expounded in the ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the [[patois]] and to universalise the use of the French language''. Its author, [[Henri Grégoire]], deplored that France, the most advanced country in the world with regard to politics, had not progressed beyond the [[Tower of Babel]] as far as languages were concerned, and that only three million of the 25 million inhabitants of France spoke a pure [[Parisian French]] as their native tongue. The lack of ability of the population to understand the language in which were the political debates and the administrative documents was then seen as antidemocratic.

The report resulted the same year in two laws which stated that the only language tolerated in France in public life and in schools would be French. Within two years, the French language had become the symbol of the national unity of the French State. However, the Revolutionaries lacked both time and money to implement a language policy.

===Third Republic===
In the 1880s, the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] sought to modernize France, and in particular to increase [[literacy]] and general knowledge in the population, especially the rural population, and established free compulsory [[primary education]]. The choice of French for education seemed natural, given that it was the only language widely spoken in France in which a sizable number of newspapers and historical, scientific etc. books were available. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The only language allowed in primary school was French. All other languages were forbidden, even in the schoolyard, and transgressions were severely punished.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge 2001: 218&lt;/ref&gt; After 1918, the use of [[German language|German]] in [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was outlawed. In 1925, [[Anatole de Monzie]], Minister of public education, stated that "for the linguistic unity of France, the [[Breton language]] [[language death|must disappear]]." As a result, the speakers of minority languages began to be [[vergonha|ashamed when using their own language]] – especially in the educational system – and over time, many families stopped teaching their language to their children and tried to [[language shift|speak only French with them]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In neighbouring [[Belgium]], a parallel [[Francization of Brussels|policy to expand the use of standard French also took place]].

===Fourth Republic===
The 1950s were also the first time the French state recognised the right of the regional languages to exist. A law allowed for the teaching of [[regional language]]s in secondary schools, and the policy of repression in the primary schools came to an end. The Breton language began to appear in the media during this time.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Fifth Republic===
The French government allowed in 1964 for the first time one and a half minutes of Breton on regional television. But even in 1972, president [[Georges Pompidou]] declared that "there is no place for minority languages in a France destined to make its mark on Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language and Nationalism in Europe |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Barbour |editor2-first=Cathie |editor2-last=Carmichael |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780191584077 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the constitution was amended to state explicitly that "the language of the Republic is French."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture |editor-last=Hewitt |editor-first=Nicholas |last= |first= |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521794657 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qczzKXFmPCYC&amp;pg=PA141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.senat.fr/evenement/revision/92-554.html |title=Loi constitutionnelle n° 92-554 du 25 juin 1992 |author= |language=French |year=2013 |origyear=1992 |publisher=[[Senate of France]] |work=Senat.fr |accessdate=28 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for providing software and related technical documentation to its employees in English only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |title=American Bar Association Report: French court fines US company for not using French language in France |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073213/http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Toubon Law]].

In 2008, a revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles.&lt;ref name="regionsqu" /&gt;

==== The debate about the Council of Europe’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ====
In 1999 the Socialist government of [[Lionel Jospin]] signed the [[Council of Europe]]’s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but it was not ratified. The [[Constitutional Council of France]] declared that the Charter contains  unconstitutional provisions since the Constitution states that the language of the Republic is French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/1999/99-412-dc/decision-n-99-412-dc-du-15-juin-1999.11825.html Décision n° 99-412 DC du 15 juin 1999]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a European [[Treaty|convention]] (ETS 148) adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical [[regional language|regional]] and [[minority language|minority]] languages in [[Europe]], ratified and implemented by 25 States, but not by France, {{As of|2014|lc=on}}. The charter contains 98 articles of which signatories must adopt a minimum of 35 (France signed 39).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The signing, and the failure to have it ratified, provoked a public debate in French society over the charter.

More recently, in a letter to several deputies dated 4 June 2015, [[François Hollande]] announced the upcoming filing of a constitutional bill for the ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vers un projet de loi constitutionnelle pour ratifier la Charte des langues régionales |url=https://lemonde.fr/politique/article/2015/06/04/vers-un-projet-de-loi-constitutionnelle-pour-ratifier-la-charte-des-langues-regionales_4647527_823448.html |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=[[Le Monde]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30 July 2015, the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]] gave an unfavorable opinion on the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=de Montvalon |first1=Jean-Baptiste |title=Nouvel obstacle à la ratification de la Charte des langues régionales |url=https://lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/08/01/les-langues-regionales-bientot-reconnues-par-la-constitution_4707451_3224.html |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=[[Le Monde]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 27 October 2015, the [[Senate (France)|Senate]] rejected the draft law on ratification of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] driving away the assumption of Congress for the adoption of the constitutional reform which would have given the value and legitimacy to regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Sénat dit non à la Charte européenne des langues régionales |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/actu/politique/article/le-senat-rejette-le-projet-de-loi-de-ratification-de-la-charte-europeenne-des-langues-regionales-741405 |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=1 November 2015 |work=franceinfo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority languages and endangered languages ==
Excluding the languages spoken in the [[Région d'outre-mer|overseas regions]] and other overseas territories, and the languages of recent immigrants, the following languages are spoken by sizeable minorities in France:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=FR Languages of France]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Romance languages]]: [[Caló language|Caló]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Langue d'oïl|Oïl languages]] (other than French), [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish]]), [[Gallo language|Gallo]].
* [[Germanic languages]]: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Flemish]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]].
* [[Celtic languages]]: [[Breton language|Breton]].
* [[Vasconic languages]]: [[Basque language|Basque]].
* [[Romani languages]].

The non-French [[Oïl languages]] and Franco-Provençal are highly endangered; because of their similarity to standard French, their speakers conformed {{clarify|text=in orthography, or in phonological production?|date=October 2017}} much more readily. The other languages are still spoken but are all considered endangered.

In the 1940s, more than one million people spoke Breton as their main language. The countryside in western [[Brittany]] was still overwhelmingly Breton-speaking. Today, about 170,000 people are able to speak Breton (around 8% of the population in the traditionally Breton speaking area), most of whom are elderly. Other regional languages have generally followed the same pattern; Alsatian and Corsican have resisted better, while Occitan has followed an even worse trend.

Accurate information on the state of language use is complicated by the inability (due to constitutional provisions) of the state to ask language use questions in the [[census]].

Since the rejection of ratification of the European Charter, French governments have offered token support to regional languages within the limits of the law. The ''Délégation générale à la langue française'' ([[General Delegation for the French language and the languages of France|General delegation of the French tongue]]) has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had "et aux langues de France" (...and languages of France) added to its title.

The French government hosted the first ''Assises nationales des langues de France'' in 2003{{citation needed span|text=|date=January 2012}}, but this national round table on the languages of France served to highlight the contrast between cultural organisations and language activists on the one hand and the state on the other.

The [[decentralization]] has not extended to giving power in language policy to the regions.

== Opposition to language policy ==
[[Image:Col de Teghime et D81.jpg|thumb|This roadsign in Corsica has had the non-Corsican placenames defaced by [[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica|FLNC]] supporters ]]
France presents itself as a big country struggling for [[cultural diversity]] against the predominance of [[English language|English]] in international affairs. According to French republican ideology (see also [[Laïcité]]), all ''citizens'' are equal and therefore no ''groups'' may exercise extra rights; this is an idea stemming from the [[French Revolution]], contrasting with the previous situation in which many groups had special rights and privileges.

This policy of cultural homogeneity has been challenged from both the right wing and the left wing. In the 1970s, nationalist or regionalist movements emerged in regions such as Brittany, Corsica and Occitania. Even though they remain a minority, networks of schools teaching France's regional languages have arisen, such as the [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]] in [[Brittany]], the [[Ikastola]] in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]], the [[Calandreta]] in [[Occitania]], and the [[La Bressola]] schools in [[Northern Catalonia]].

Despite popular demand for official recognition, regional language teaching is not supported by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3077&amp;Itemid=1 Meet the French, strong supporters of regional languages – Eurolang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109222240/http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3077&amp;Itemid=1 |date=2014-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in certain areas, such as Brittany, regional councils maintain bilingual public schools as far as it is within the law. Other Breton education is provided by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] schools and private schools, Dihun and [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]], respectively.  In 2011, only 14,000 pupils were enrolled in French-Breton bilingual schools, although this number reflected an increase of around 30% from the year 2006, when the number of pupils was just over 11,000.  The Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg also reported in 2011 that a further 16,000 students from early childhood to adulthood were learning Breton as a second language (at primary schools, collèges, lycées, university or evening courses), bringing the total number of Breton learners to at least 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofis-bzh.org/fr/enseignement/index.php Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg - L'enseignment]&lt;/ref&gt;

A long campaign of defacing road signs led to the first bilingual road signs in the 1980s. These are now increasingly common in Brittany, because of the help given by the [[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]] in bilingualizing many road, town hall and other official signs.

As far as the media are concerned, there is still little Breton to be found on the airwaves, although since 1982 a few Breton-speaking radio stations have been created on an associative basis. The launching of the Breton [[TV Breizh]] in 2000 was intended to offer wider coverage of Breton. However, Breton-language programme schedules gradually decreased in favour of French-language broadcasting, until in 2010 they totally disappeared.

In Corsica, the 1991 "Joxe Statute", in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [[Corsican Assembly]], and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsu. At the primary school level Corsu is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level,&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.ac-corse.fr/lcc_20/file/1890/ Dispositif académique d’enseignement de la langue corse dans le premier degré, année scolaire 2010-2011], Academy of Corsica&lt;/ref&gt; but is required at the [[University of Corsica Pascal Paoli|University of Corsica]].

There is some opposition to the [[Loi Toubon]] mandating the use of French (or at least a translation into French) in commercial advertising and packaging, as well as in some other contexts.

'''Michael Steven Harper''' (March 18, 1938 &amp;ndash; May 7, 2016) was an American [[poet]] and English professor at [[Brown University]], who was the [[Poet Laureate]] of [[Rhode Island]] from 1988 to 1993.  His poetry was influenced by [[jazz]] and [[history]].&lt;ref name="msaap"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/277 | title=Michael S. Harper | publisher=Academy of American poets | accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the influences which shaped his writing, he said that the most important lesson he learned from musicians was phrasing, the authenticity of phrasing, and the transcendence and spiritual mastery. He published ten books of poetry, two of which—''Dear John, Dear Coltrane'' (1970) and ''Images of Kin'' (1977)—were nominated for the [[National Book Award]]. Many of his poems have been included as examples of [[African-American literature]] and [[jazz poetry]] in various anthologies.

==Early life and education==
Harper was born in Brooklyn as the first of three children&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=2551758 | title=Walter Warren Harper, obituary | work=Los Angeles Times | date=August 26, 2004 | accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a lower-middle-class black family. His maternal grandfather, Roland Johnson, was a well-respected Canadian physician and was the delivery doctor for Harper at their home.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6754&amp;context=iowareview|title=Office Hours: A Memoir and an Interview with Michael S. Harper|last=Treseler|first=Heather|date=2009|work=The Iowa Review|via=Iowa Research Online|volume=39|issue=3|&lt;!--archive-url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6754&amp;conia=text=iowareview|archive-date=|dead-url=|--&gt;access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the primary influence in his early decision to pursue pre-med at Los Angeles City College.

His father Walter (who went by his middle name, Warren) was the originator of "overnight" mail and worked as a post office supervisor. His mother Katherine Louise, née Johnson was a medical secretary. Of his parents Harper once remarked, "My parents did not have much money, but they had a great record collection."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.msu.idm.oclc.org/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA393210803&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=moreheadstu&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w#|title=Into the underworld with Michael S. Harper|last=Makari|first=George|date=|website=|work=The Worcester Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would of course later influence his work, blending poetry with jazz.

His younger brother Jonathan Paul was born in 1941 and died in a motorcycle accident in 1977. His younger sister, Katherine Winifred, was born in 1943. They grew up in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]], a north-central portion of Brooklyn, until his family moved in 1951 to their [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] in Los Angeles, where he attended [[Dorsey High School]].&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; As a teenager, Harper was eager to get out of his father's house and into his own, marking his desire to work, create and learn on his own terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1955, he attended [[Los Angeles City College]], initially enrolling in pre-med courses and later literature, graduating in 1959 with an associate of arts degree. At the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences (now [[California State University, Los Angeles]], he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English studies in 1961.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; While there he worked part-time in the post office and called this experience his "real education".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He joined the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]], where he largely resisted the movement of writing in syllabics, which he called "incredibly mechanical". During his time in Iowa City Harper said, "Most of the things I learned…had nothing to do with the Workshop"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; given the uprising of the Civil Rights Movement at that time. He earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="msaap" /&gt;

==Career==
He taught English at [[Contra Costa College]] in San Pablo, California and his poems appeared in small magazines. In 1968, he became poet in residence at [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] and taught at [[Reed College]] both in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Later that year, he entered a manuscript in the U.S. Poetry Prize Competition, submitted by Gwendolyn Brooks. Although he did not win, Brooks calls his work her “clear winner.” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harper said Brooks gave him his career. With Brooks behind him, his book was published by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and reviewed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1970 with a cover essay by [[Ralph Ellison]]. In 1996 Brooks presented Harper with the George Kent Poetry Award for Honorable Amendments.

In 1970, he taught at [[California State University|California State College]] in [[Hayward, California]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He joined the English faculty at [[Brown University]], where he taught literature courses and poetry workshops to undergraduates. Students referred to him as "MSH", "the Chief", and "the Big Man".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He remained there until retiring in December 2013&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and was the longest serving professor of English and Literary Arts at that institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://brown.edu/academics/literary-arts/about/faculty/michael-harper/michael-harper Michael S. Harper, University Professor, Brown University.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2016}}

In 1993, [[Nathan Scott (composer)|Nathan A. Scott]] wrote in the ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' that "Harper has created a body of work which, though it has won much respect and admiration, deserves to be far more widely known than it is."&lt;ref name="naspe"&gt;{{cite web | title=Afro-American Poetry | publisher=Princeton University Press and MJF Books | work=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics | date=1993 | author=Nathan A. Scott Jr | editor1=Preminger, Alex|editor2=T. V. F. Brogan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 25}}

Shortly after his retirement from Brown, former student George Makari remarked that Harper "deeply entered our personal lives, challenged us to rethink who we thought we were, [and] asked us to leave behind childhood and enter a kind of creative crisis."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Harper was married and had a daughter, Rachel, who is also a [http://rachelmharper.com writer], and two sons, Roland and Patrice. He later divorced.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He lived in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] until his death on May 7, 2016.&lt;ref name="msaap"/&gt;
Harper had two children who died at birth, which inspired several of his early poems, including the famous "Nightmare Begins Responsibility". .&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/arts/michael-s-harper-poet-with-a-jazz-pulse-dies-at-78.html?_r=1 |title=Michael S. Harper, Poet With a Jazz Pulse, Dies at 78 | work=NY Times | date=May 10, 2016 | accessdate=May 16, 2016 | author=Grimes, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Harper wrote about important and historically influential African-Americans, including [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. He said in a 2000 interview with [[Terry Gross]], that the most important thing he learned from musicians was phrasing, the authenticity of phrasing, and the transcendence and spiritual mastery.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=477927149 | title=Remembering Michael S. Harper, A Poet With An Ear For Jazz | publisher=NPR | date=May 13, 2016| people=David Bianculli, Terry Gross | medium=radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper often wrote about his wife, Shirley (commonly referred to as "Shirl"), their children, and  their ancestors, as well as friends and various black historical and cultural figures.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}  On poetry, Harper stated: "A good poem is a true poem. Often it cannot be distilled into a slogan, or an easy thesis."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This relates to much of his work, most notably "Blue Ruth: America" (1971) in which the nation is portrayed in a hospital bed. In a 2009 interview, he commented on the need for public rhetoric, noting that people had trouble with President Barack Obama because he spoke about consequential things when most were used to "sound bites".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Micronized rubber powder''' (MRP) is classified as fine, dry, powdered elastomeric [[crumb rubber]] in which a significant proportion of particles are less than 100&amp;nbsp;µm and free of foreign particulates (metal, fiber, etc.). MRP particle size distributions typically range from 180&amp;nbsp;µm to 10&amp;nbsp;µm. Narrower distributions can be achieved depending on the classification technology.

==MRP source materials==

MRP is typically made from vulcanized elastomeric material, most often from end-of-life tire material, but can also be produced from post-industrial [[nitrile]] rubber, [[ethylene propylene diene monomer|ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)]], [[butyl]] and natural rubber compounds.

==Characteristics==

MRP is a free flowing, black rubber powder that disperses into a multitude of systems and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayyer|first=Ravi|title=Evaluation of micronized rubber powders with cost/performance benefits|url=http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/display_article.php?id=956952|publisher=Rubber World|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its micron size, MRP can be incorporated into multiple polymers, and provides a smooth surface appearance on finished products.  In some cases, in order to improve compatibility with host materials, the MRP is given a chemical treatment to activate, or “make functional” the surface of the powder particles.  This is referred to as functionalized MRP or FMRP.

MRP represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most basic rubber processing technology converts end-of-life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire-derived fuel and civil engineering projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA: Tire-Derived Fuel |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326030623/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm |archivedate=26 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into [[crumb rubber]], also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA: Ground Rubber Applications |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/ground.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220052729/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/ground.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MRP is a micron-size material that is produced in various sizes, including 80 mesh and down to 300 mesh. MRP is virtually metal and fiber-free, enabling its use in a wide range of advanced products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welch|first=Mary|title=Rubber Powder Supplier Gains Traction With Global Sales, Green Solution|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/article/26726/rubber-powder-supplier-gains-traction-with-global-sales-green-solution/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Global Atlanta|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Applications==

MRP is used as a compound extender to offset the use of natural rubber and synthetic polymers as well as act as a process aid in material production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Kuk|title=Study on powder utilization of waste tires as a filler in rubber compounding|journal=[[Rubber Chemistry and Technology]]|date=Nov–Dec 1998|volume=71|issue=5|pages=1028|doi=10.5254/1.3538508|last2=Burford|first2=R. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, MRP can reduce formulation costs, because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, According to some estimates, MRP offers up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/why_use_micronized_rubber/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

MRP also can improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used.  For example, the smaller particle sizes of MRP are known to increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions.  However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

Due to its size and composition, MRP can be incorporated into more advanced and higher-value applications than [[crumb rubber]]. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products.  It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Guangyu |author2=Song, Yingdeng |author3=Xiolin, Li |author4=Zhang, Liqun|title=Noise-reducing performance of rubber powder modified asphalt pavement materials|journal=China Synthetic Rubber Industry|year=2011|volume=34|issue=4|pages=314–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; coatings, and sealants.  MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade [[Polypropylene|polypropylene (PP)]], [[high-density polyethylene|high-density polyethylene (HDPE)]] and [[nylon]]s. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in [[thermoplastic elastomers|thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)]] and [[thermoplastic]] [[vulcanizate]]s (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications.

Currently, the leading producer of MRP is [[Lehigh Technologies]], which utilizes a cryogenic turbo mill process with more than 100 million pounds of annual production capacity. MRP produced by Lehigh has set high benchmarks for performance in a range of applications with customers and third-party research institutions, including several studies on increased asphalt performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willis|first=J.

== Safety==

Numerous U.S. and European studies have found [[crumb rubber]] and MRP meet standards for human health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCRAP TIRE MARKETS IN THE  UNITED STATES 9th BIENNIAL REPORT|url=http://www.genan.eu/Files/Filer/pdf/Scrap_Tire_Markets_In_The_Unites_States.pdf|publisher=Rubber Manufacturers Association|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, an [[EPA]] study found that [[crumb rubber]] in field turfs and playgrounds contained concentrations of materials below harmful levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited EPA Study Finds Low Level of Concern in Samples of Recycled Tires from Ballfield and Playground Surfaces|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/c8d28e3f9f3ca0a4852576880053bed4!OpenDocument|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrine is located just to the west of [[Toyokuni Shrine (Kyoto)|Toyokuni Shrine]], the [[Shinto]] shrine honoring Hideyoshi in Kyoto.

==History==
[[File:Mimizuka-M1773.jpg|thumb|upright|left]]
Traditionally, [[samurai|Japanese warriors]] brought back the heads of enemies slain on the battlefield as proof of their deeds.  [[Rhinotomy|Nose collection]] in lieu of heads became a feature of the second Korean invasion.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;{{rp|p. 195}} &lt;ref name="Hawley158"/&gt; Remuneration was paid to soldiers by their ''[[daimyō]]'' commanders based on the severed heads upon submission to collection stations, where inspectors meticulously counted, recorded, salted and packed the noses bound for Japan.&lt;ref name="Hawley475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawley494"/&gt; However, because of the number of civilians killed along with soldiers, and crowded conditions on the ships that transported troops, it was far easier to just bring back noses instead of whole heads.&lt;ref name="Hawley158"/&gt; Hideyoshi was especially insistent upon receiving noses of people his samurai had killed as proof that his men really were killing people in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98'', London: Osprey, 2008 p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese chroniclers on the second invading campaign mention that the ears hacked off the faces of the massacred were also of ordinary civilians&lt;ref name="Wakizaka"/&gt; mostly in the provinces [[Gyeongsang]], [[Jeolla]], and [[Chungcheong]].&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 475–476}}  In the second invasion [[Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi's]] orders were thus:
{{cquote|Mow down everyone universally, without discriminating between young and old, men and women, clergy and the laity—high ranking soldiers on the battlefield, that goes without saying, but also the hill folk, down to the poorest and meanest—and send the heads to Japan.&lt;ref name="Hawley465"/&gt;}}
One hundred and sixty-thousand Japanese troops had gone to Korea where they had taken 185,738 Korean heads and 29,014 Chinese ones, a grand total of 214,752.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;{{rp|p. 230}}&lt;ref name="ZGR"/&gt;  As some might have been discarded, it is improbable to enumerate how many were killed in total during the war.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt;

Adopted from Turnbull (2002)&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;]] --&gt;The Mimizuka was dedicated September 28, 1597.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt; Though the exact reasons as to its construction are not entirely known, scholars contend that during the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] demanded his commanders show receipts of their martial valor in the destruction, dispatching congratulatory letters to his high-ranking warriors in the field as evidence of their service.  Hideyoshi then ordered the relics entombed in a shrine on the grounds of [[Hōkō-ji (Kyoto)|Hokoji Temple]], and set Buddhist priests to work praying for the repose of the souls of the hundreds of thousands of Koreans from whose bodies they had come; an act that chief priest [[Saishō Jōtai]] (1548–1608) in a fit of toadyism would hail as a sign of Hideyoshi's "great mercy and compassion."&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Samuel |last=Hawley |title=The Imjin War: Japan's Sixteenth Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China |year=2005 |page=501 |isbn=89-954424-2-5 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shrine initially was known as {{nihongo|''hanazuka''|鼻塚}}, Mound of Noses, but several decades later this would come to be regarded as too cruel-sounding a name, and would be changed to the more euphonious but inaccurate {{nihongo|''mimizuka''|耳塚}}, Mound of Ears, the misnomer by which it is known to this day.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elisonas&gt;{{Cite book|first3=Jurgis |last3=Elisonas |title=The Inseparable Trinity: Japan's Relations with China and Korea, (''in'' The Cambridge History of Japan.

===Effect on modern foreign relations===
The Mimizuka is almost unknown to the Japanese public unlike to the Koreans.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; The British historian Stephen Turnbull called the Mimizuka "...Kyoto's least mentioned and most often avoided tourist attraction".&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98'', London: Osprey, 2008 p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque, which was later removed, stood in front of the Ear Mound in the 1960s with the passage, "One cannot say that cutting off noses was so atrocious by the standard of the time."  Most guidebooks do not mention the Ear Mound, and only a few Japanese or foreign tourists visit the site.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; The majority of visiting tourists are Korean&amp;nbsp;– Korean tour buses are often seen parked near the Ear Mound.

In 1982, not a single Japanese school [[textbook]] mentioned the Ear Mound.  As of 1997, the mound is referred to in about half of all high-school history textbooks according to Shigeo Shimoyama, an official of [[Jikkyo (publisher)|Jikkyo]], a publishing company.  The publisher released the first Japanese text book mentioning the Ear Mound in the mid-1980s.  The Education Ministry of Japan at that time opposed the description as "too vivid" and pressured the publisher to reduce the tone and also to praise Hideyoshi for religiously dedicating the Ear Mound to store the spirits of the killed people.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

In the 1970s under the [[Park Chung-hee]] administration, some of the officials of the South Korean government asked Japan to level the monument.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt; However, most Koreans said that the mound should stay in Japan as a reminder of past savagery.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt;
Activity since the 1990s is aptly conveyed thus:&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 585–586}}
{{cquote|In 1990 a Korean Buddhist monk named Pak Sam-jung traveled to Kyoto and, with the support of a private local organization, concluded a ceremony in front of the tomb to comfort the spirits residing there and guide them home to Korea.  Over the next six years the Japanese organization that hosted this event spearheaded a drive to get the mimizuka itself sent home, submitting a petition bearing twenty-thousand signatures to Kyoto city officials, and pledging to bear the cost of excavating the contents of the tomb and shipping them to Korea, together with the nine-meter-high earthen mound and the stone pagoda on top.  When Pak Sam-jung returned to Kyoto in 1996, the tomb's return seemed imminent. "These noses were cut off as trophies of war for Toyotomi Hideyoshi," he announced upon leaving Seoul.  "They have been there in Kyoto for four-hundred years. It is now our duty to see them returned to Korea to assuage the grief of the 126,000 people whose remains are buried there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In the end the necessary permission to move the mimuzuka was not forthcoming from the Japanese government. It was decided that, as an officially designated national cultural asset, the tomb should stay where it was. It remains in Kyoto to this day, little known and not often visited, and not well marked for tourists. It is just west of [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Toyokuni Shrine (Kyoto)|Toyokuni Jinja]], the Shinto shrine dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was deified as a [[kami]] after his death. Funding from the government is insufficient to care for the site, so the work is done by local residents, who volunteer to cut the grass and tidy up the grounds.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;}}

On September 28, 1997, the 400th anniversary of the Mimizuka, a ceremony was held in respect for those killed, which people of all nationalities and faiths attended. The current caretaker of Mimizuka as of August 2009 is Shimizu Shirou (清水四郎).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="만행 사과하고파"..."귀무덤" 지킨 日노인|date=2009-08-14|url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200908140228|accessdate=2009-12-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608203248/http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200908140228|archivedate=2011-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"From the start the offensive to pacify the provinces of [[Gyeongsang]], [[Jeolla]], and [[Chungcheong]] was accompanied by the most horrific atrocities perpetrated against the region’s civilian population.  People were killed almost daily well outside the time frame of any significant battle, and their noses hacked off by the hundreds, even the thousands. We know this because the units responsible, ever mindful of recording the proof of their valor, kept meticulous records and receipts, some of which have survived to this day ."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Wakizaka"&gt;In Turnbull, Stephen (2002), p. 197. Japanese monk Keinen noted that atrocities against the civilian population was just another phase in the military operation. "From early dawn of the following morning we gave chase and hunted them in the mountains and scoured the villages for the distance of one day's travel. When they were cornered we made a wholesale slaughter of them. During a period of ten days we seized 10,000 of the enemy, but we did not cut off their heads.

'''Nemesis''' is a [[hypothetical astronomical objects|hypothetical]] [[red dwarf]]&lt;ref name=Leader/&gt; or [[brown dwarf]],&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; originally postulated in 1984 &lt;ref&gt;{{M. Davis, P. Hut, and R. Muller, “Extinction of species by periodic comet showers,” Nature 308, 715 (1984).}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be orbiting the [[Sun]] at a distance of about 95,000 [[astronomical unit|AU]] (1.5 [[light-year]]s),&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; somewhat beyond the [[Oort cloud]], to explain a perceived [[Extinction event#Patterns in frequency|cycle of mass extinctions]] in the [[history of Earth|geological record]], which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raup1984/&gt; {{As of|2012}}, more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified.&lt;ref name="DwarfArchives"/&gt; There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf.&lt;ref name="space2012"/&gt; The majority of [[Sun|solar]]-type stars are single.&lt;ref name=Deepak2010/&gt; The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary, trinary, or multiple-star systems associated with clusters of stars, rather than the single-star systems that tend to be seen most often.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In a 2017 paper, Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a [[binary system]] at the time of its formation, leading them to suggest "there probably was a Nemesis, a long time ago.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/06/13/new-evidence-that-all-stars-are-born-in-pairs/|title=New evidence that all stars are born in pairs|date=2017-06-13|work=Berkeley News|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadavoy|first=Sarah I.|last2=Stahler|first2=Steven W.|date=2017-05-03|title=Embedded binaries and their dense cores|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/469/4/3881/3795556%7Cjournal=Monthly|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=469|issue=4|pages=3881–3900|doi=10.1093/mnras/stx1061|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago, meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions, [[Douglas Vakoch]] told ''[[Business Insider]]'', adding that "If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days, its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion, rather than the threatening Nemesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stars-form-in-pairs-nemesis-theory-2018-4|title=All stars in the universe may form in pairs — but we can't find the sun's missing 'Nemesis'|last=Levine|first=David|date=2018-06-19|website=Business Insider|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent theories suggest that other forces, like close [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passage of other stars]], or the angular effect of the galactic gravity plane working against the outer solar orbital plane, may be the cause of orbital perturbations of some outer Solar System objects.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt; In 2011, Coryn Bailer-Jones analyzed craters on the surface of the Earth and reached the conclusion that the earlier findings of simple periodic patterns (implying periodic comet showers dislodged by a hypothetical Nemesis star) were [[statistical artifact]]s, and found that the crater record shows no evidence for Nemesis.&lt;ref name="Myth2011"/&gt; However, in 2010, [[Adrian Melott|A.L. Melott]]&lt;!--position?--&gt; and R.K. Bambach&lt;!--position?--&gt; found evidence in the fossil record confirming the extinction event periodicity originally claimed by Raup &amp; Sepkoski in 1984, but at a higher confidence level and over a time period nearly twice as long.&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt; The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ([[IRAS]]) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The [[2MASS]] [[astronomical survey]], which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect an additional star or brown dwarf in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Space2010-03"/&gt;

Using newer and more powerful infrared telescope technology which is able to detect brown dwarfs as cool as 150 [[kelvin]]s out to a distance of 10 [[light-year]]s from the Sun,&lt;ref name="browndwarf"/&gt; the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE survey) has not detected Nemesis.&lt;ref name="Morrison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick2011v1"/&gt; In 2011, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], a senior scientist at NASA known for his work in risk assessment of near Earth objects, has written that there is no confidence in the existence of an object like Nemesis, since it should have been detected in infrared sky surveys.&lt;ref name="Morrison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA20140307"/&gt;

==Claimed periodicity of mass extinctions==
In 1984, [[paleontologists]] [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published a paper claiming that they had identified a statistical periodicity in extinction rates over the last 250 million years using various forms of [[Time series|time series analysis]].&lt;ref name=Raup1984/&gt; They focused on the extinction intensity of [[fossil]] families of marine [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[protozoans]], identifying 12 [[extinction event]]s over the time period in question. The average time interval between extinction events was determined as 26 million years. At the time, two of the identified extinction events ([[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene]] and [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event|Eocene–Oligocene]]) could be shown to coincide with large impact events. Although Raup and Sepkoski could not identify the cause of their supposed periodicity, they suggested a possible non-terrestrial connection. The challenge to propose a mechanism was quickly addressed by several teams of astronomers.&lt;ref name=Whitmire1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis1984/&gt;

In 2010, Melott &amp; Bambach re-examined the fossil data, including the now-improved dating, and using a second independent database in addition to that Raup &amp; Sepkoski had used. They found evidence for a signal showing an excess extinction rate with a 27-million-year periodicity, now going back 500 million years, and at a much higher statistical significance than in the older work. They also determined that this periodicity is inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis. The change from 26 to 27 million years is expected based on a 3% "stretch" in the geological timescale since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt;

==Development of the Nemesis hypotheses==
Two teams of [[astronomer]]s, Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson IV, and [[Marc Davis (astronomer)|Marc Davis]], [[Piet Hut]], and [[Richard A. Muller]], independently published similar [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain Raup and Sepkoski's extinction periodicity in the same issue of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Whitmire1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis1984/&gt; This hypothesis proposes that the Sun may have an undetected [[Binary Star|companion star]] in a highly elliptical orbit that periodically disturbs [[comet]]s in the [[Oort cloud]], causing a large increase of the number of comets visiting the inner Solar System with a consequential increase of [[impact event]]s on Earth. This became known as the "Nemesis" or "Death Star" hypothesis.

If it does exist, the exact nature of Nemesis is uncertain. Muller suggests that the most likely object is a [[red dwarf]] with an [[apparent magnitude]] between 7 and 12,&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; while Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson argue for a [[brown dwarf]].&lt;ref name="Whitmire1984"/&gt; If a red dwarf, it would exist in [[star catalog]]s, but it would only be confirmed by measuring its [[parallax]]; due to orbiting the Sun it would have a low [[proper motion]] and would escape detection by older proper motion surveys that have found stars like the 9th-magnitude [[Barnard's star]]. (The proper motion of Barnard's star was detected in 1916.)&lt;ref name="EEB"/&gt; Muller expects Nemesis to be discovered by the time parallax surveys reach the 10th magnitude.&lt;ref name="Muller2002"/&gt;

Muller, referring to the date of a recent extinction at 11 million years before the present day, posits that Nemesis has a [[semi-major axis]] of about {{convert|1.5|ly}}&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; and suggests it is located (supported by Yarris, 1987) near [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], based on a hypothetical orbit derived from original [[aphelion]]s of a number of atypical long-period comets that describe an orbital arc meeting the specifications of Muller's hypothesis. Richard Muller's most recent paper relevant to the Nemesis theory was published in 2002.&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; In 2002, Muller speculated that Nemesis was [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] 400 million years ago by a [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing star]] from a circular orbit into an orbit with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.7.&lt;ref name="Muller2002"/&gt;

==Orbit of Sedna==
[[File:Oort cloud Sedna orbit.svg|thumb|300px|Sedna orbit compared to the Solar System and Oort cloud]]

The [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] has an extra-long and unusual elliptical orbit around the Sun,&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; ranging between 76 and 937 AU. Sedna's orbit is estimated to last between 10.5 and 12 thousand years. Its discoverer, [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] of Caltech, noted in a ''Discover'' magazine article that Sedna's location seemed to defy reasoning: "Sedna shouldn't be there", Brown said. "There's no way to put Sedna where it is. It never comes close enough to be affected by the Sun, but it never goes far enough away from the Sun to be affected by other stars."&lt;ref name="discover2006"/&gt; Brown therefore postulated that a massive unseen object may be responsible for Sedna's anomalous orbit.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; This line of inquiry eventually led to the hypothesis of [[Planet Nine]].

Brown has stated that it is more likely that one or more non-companion stars, passing near the Sun billions of years ago, could have pulled Sedna out into its current orbit.&lt;ref name="discover2006"/&gt; In 2004, Kenyon forwarded this explanation after analysis of Sedna's orbital data and computer modeling of possible ancient non-companion star passes.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt;

==Past, current, and pending searches for Nemesis==
Searches for Nemesis in the infrared are important because cooler stars comparatively shine more brightly in infrared light. The [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]]'s [[Leuschner Observatory]] failed to discover Nemesis by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |title=An Astrometric Search for a Stellar Companion to the Sun |last=Perlmutter |first=Saul |authorlink=Saul Perlmutter |date=1986 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ([[IRAS]]) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The [[2MASS]] [[astronomical survey]], which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect a star, or brown dwarf, in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; If Nemesis exists, it may be detected by [[Pan-STARRS]] or the planned [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]] astronomical surveys.

In particular, if Nemesis is a [[red dwarf]] or a [[brown dwarf]], the [[WISE mission]] (an infrared sky survey that covered most of our solar neighborhood in movement-verifying [[parallax]] measurements) was expected to be able to find it.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; WISE can detect 150-kelvin brown dwarfs out to 10 [[light-year]]s. But the closer a brown dwarf is, the easier it is to detect.&lt;ref name="browndwarf"/&gt; Preliminary results of the WISE survey were released on April 14, 2011.&lt;ref name=NASA2011-117/&gt; On March 14, 2012, the entire catalog of the WISE mission was released.&lt;ref name="fullrelease"/&gt; In 2014 WISE data ruled out a [[Saturn]] or larger-sized body in the Oort cloud out to ten thousand AU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/nasas-wise-survey-finds-thousands-of-new-stars-but-no-planet-x/ NASA's WISE Survey Finds Thousands of New Stars, But No 'Planet X']&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculations in the 1980s suggested that a Nemesis object would have an irregular orbit due to  perturbations from the galaxy and passing stars. The Melott &amp; Bambach work&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt; shows an extremely regular signal, inconsistent with the expected irregularities in such an orbit. Thus, while supporting the extinction periodicity, it appears to be inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis, though of course not inconsistent with other kinds of [[substellar object]]s. According to a 2011 NASA news release, "recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals, and thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed."&lt;ref name="Tyche2011-060"/&gt;

[[File:NumberSetinC.svg|thumb|[[Subset]]s of the [[complex numbers]].]]
A '''number''' is a [[mathematical object]] used to [[counting|count]], [[measurement|measure]] and also [[nominal number|label]]. The original examples are the [[natural number]]s [[1]], [[2]], [[3]], [[4]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=number, n. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/129082 |journal=OED Online |language=en-GB |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notational [[symbol]] that represents a number is called a [[numeral system|numeral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=numeral, adj. and n. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/129111 |journal=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with [[telephone number]]s), for ordering (as with [[serial number]]s), and for codes (as with [[ISBN]]s). In common usage, ''number'' may refer to a symbol, a [[numeral (linguistics)|word]], or a [[mathematical abstraction]].

In [[mathematics]], the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include [[0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/history-of-zero/ |title=The Origin of Zero |last=Matson |first=John |work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-05-16 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[negative number]]s,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6HlhlBuQUgC&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A History of Mathematics: From Mesopotamia to Modernity |last=Hodgkin |first=Luke |date=2005-06-02 |publisher=OUP Oxford |year= |isbn=9780191523830 |location= |pages=85–88 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rational number]]s such as [[one half|{{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}}}]] and {{math|−{{sfrac|2|3}}}}, [[real number]]s&lt;ref&gt;T.K. Puttaswamy, "The Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians", pp. 410–11.&amp;nbsp;In: {{citation |title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-western Mathematics |year=2000 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|editor1-last=Selin|editor2-last=D'Ambrosio|editor1-first=Helaine|editor2-first=Ubiratan|editor1-link=Helaine Selin|editor2-link=Ubiratan D'Ambrosio |isbn=1-4020-0260-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[square root of 2|{{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}]] and [[pi|{{pi}}]], and [[complex numbers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Descartes |first=René |title=La Géométrie &amp;#124; The Geometry of René Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26400 |year=1954 |authorlink=René Descartes |origyear=1637 |page= |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-60068-8 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extend the real numbers by adding a [[imaginary unit|square root of {{math|−1}}]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Calculation]]s with numbers are done with [[arithmetical operations]], the most familiar being [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], and [[exponentiation]]. Their study or usage is called [[arithmetic]]. The same term may also refer to [[number theory]], the study of the properties of numbers.

Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Gilsdorf"&gt;Gilsdorf, Thomas E. ''Introduction to Cultural Mathematics: With Case Studies in the Otomies and Incas'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Restivo"&gt;Restivo, S. ''Mathematics in Society and History'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Nov 30, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Western society, the number [[13 (number)|13]] is regarded as unlucky, and "a [[1,000,000|million]]" may signify "a lot."&lt;ref name="Gilsdorf" /&gt; Though it is now regarded as [[pseudoscience]], [[numerology]], the belief in a mystical significance of numbers, permeated ancient and medieval thought.&lt;ref name="Ore"&gt;Ore, Oystein. ''Number Theory and Its History'', Courier Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerology heavily influenced the development of [[Greek mathematics]], stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.&lt;ref name="Ore" /&gt;

During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the [[hypercomplex number]]s, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. Today, number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and the application of the term "number" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.&lt;ref&gt;Gouvea, Fernando Q. ''[[The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]], Chapter II.1, "The Origins of Modern Mathematics"'', p. 82. Princeton University Press, September 28, 2008. {{isbn|978-0691118802}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerals==
{{main article|Numeral system}}
Numbers should be distinguished from '''numerals''', the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chrisomalis |first=Stephen |date=2003-09-01 |title=The Egyptian origin of the Greek alphabetic numerals |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/egyptian-origin-of-the-greek-alphabetic-numerals/B21F16056A89CCDF000EE98CAC4E43AE |journal=Antiquity |volume=77 |issue=297 |pages=485–96 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00092541 |issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the superior [[Arabic numeral system]] around the late 14th century, and the Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOxl71w-jHEC&amp;pg=PA192 |title=The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Volume 1 |last2=Crossley |first2=Pamela |last3=Headrick, |first3=Daniel |last4=Hirsch |first4=Steven |last5=Johnson |first5=Lyman |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2010 |isbn=1439084742 |page=192 |quote=Indian mathematicians invented the concept of zero and developed the "Arabic" numerals and system of place-value notation used in most parts of the world today |first1=Richard |last1=Bulliet}}{{better source|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient  [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] around 500 AD.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning2" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Classification}}Main classification==
{{Redirect|Number system|systems for expressing numbers|Numeral system}}
{{See also|List of types of numbers}}Numbers can be classified into [[set (mathematics)|sets]], called '''number systems''', such as the [[natural numbers]] and the [[real numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens – welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden – zu einem Ganzen." [http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The major categories of numbers are as follows:&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 200px;"
|+ Main number systems
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
![[Natural number|Natural]]
| 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used.
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

![[Complex number|Complex]]
|''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers and ''i'' is a formal square root of&amp;nbsp;−1
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

There is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by [[abuse of notation#Equality vs. isomorphism|abuse of notation]]), because each of these number systems is [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]] to a proper subset of the next one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Natural numbers===
{{Main article|Natural number}}
[[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1]]
The most familiar numbers are the [[natural number]]s (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with&amp;nbsp;1 (0 was not even considered a number for the [[Ancient Greeks]].) However, in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, [[set theory|set theorists]] and other mathematicians started including&amp;nbsp;0 ([[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]], i.e. 0&amp;nbsp;elements, where&amp;nbsp;0 is thus the smallest [[cardinal number]]) in the set of natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{MathWorld|title=Natural Number|id=NaturalNumber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |title=natural number |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=4 October 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including&amp;nbsp;0 or not. The [[mathematical symbol]] for the set of all natural numbers is '''N''', also written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and sometimes &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt; when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.

In the [[base 10]] numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Base System |url=https://www.chalkstreet.com/aptipedia/knowledgebase/base-system/ |website=www.chalkstreet.com |date=29 June 2016 | access-date = 31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this base&amp;nbsp;10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a [[place value]] of&amp;nbsp;1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.

In [[set theory]], which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Suppes |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Suppes |title=Axiomatic Set Theory |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1972 |page=1 |isbn=0-486-61630-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number&amp;nbsp;3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in [[Peano Arithmetic]], the number&amp;nbsp;3 is represented as sss0, where s is the "successor" function (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;3 is the third successor of&amp;nbsp;0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent&amp;nbsp;3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.

===Integers===
{{Main article|Integer}}
The [[negative number|negative]] of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces&amp;nbsp;0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a [[minus sign]]). As an example, the negative of&amp;nbsp;7 is written&amp;nbsp;−7, and {{nowrap|7 + (−7) {{=}} 0}}. When the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including&amp;nbsp;0), the result is defined as the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''' also written [[Blackboard bold|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.]] Here the letter Z comes {{ety|de|Zahl|number}}. The set of integers forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with the operations addition and multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Mathworld|Integer|Integer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural numbers form a [[subset]] of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as '''positive integers''', and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as '''non-negative integers'''.

===Rational numbers===
{{Main article|Rational number}}
A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} represents ''m'' parts of a whole divided into ''n'' equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|2|4}} are equal, that is:
: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2} = {2 \over 4}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general,
:&lt;math&gt;{a \over b} = {c \over d}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;{ a \times d} = {c \times b}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' is greater than ''n'' (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than&amp;nbsp;1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to&amp;nbsp;1 and can also be positive, negative, or&amp;nbsp;0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers, since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator&amp;nbsp;1. For example&amp;nbsp;−7 can be written&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|−7|1}}. The symbol for the rational numbers is '''Q''' (for ''[[quotient]]''), also written [[Blackboard bold|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Real numbers===
{{Main article|Real number}}

The symbol for the real numbers is '''R''', also written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt; They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the [[number line]]. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by  a [[minus sign]], e.g. -123.456.

Most real numbers can only be ''approximated'' by [[decimal]] numerals, in which a [[decimal point]] is placed to the right of the digit with place value&amp;nbsp;1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents {{sfrac|123456|1000}}, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its [[fractional part]] has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis, or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a [[repeating decimal]]. Thus {{sfrac|3}} can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.{{overline|3}}.

It turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. A famous irrational real number is the number [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of any circle to its [[diameter]]. When pi is written as
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = 3.14159265358979\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
as it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that [[proof that pi is irrational|{{pi}} is irrational]]. Another well known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[square root of 2]], that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions {{nowrap|( 1 trillion {{=}}  10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1,000,000,000,000 )}} of digits.

Not only these prominent examples, but [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting [[rounding|rounded]] or [[truncation|truncated]] real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only [[countably many]]. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always  have a [[margin of error]]. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to {{sfrac|1234555|10000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|1234565|10000}} (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to {{sfrac|123456|1000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|123457|1000}} (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called [[significant digits]]. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001&amp;nbsp;meters. If the sides of a [[rectangle]] are measured as 1.23&amp;nbsp;meters and 4.56&amp;nbsp;meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between {{nowrap|5.614591 square meters}} and {{nowrap|5.603011 square meters}}. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not ''significant''. Therefore the result is usually rounded to 5.61.

Just as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, [[0.999...]], 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number&amp;nbsp;1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places, or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000... . Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost non-9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example 99.999... = 100. 

The real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the [[least upper bound]] property.

It can be shown that any [[ordered field]], which is also [[completeness of the real numbers|complete]], is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an [[algebraically closed field]], because they do not include a solution (often called a [[square root of minus one]]) to the algebraic equation &lt;math&gt; x^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Complex numbers===
{{Main article|Complex number}}
Moving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the [[complex number]]s. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quadratic function|quadratic]] polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a [[square root]] of&amp;nbsp;−1, denoted by ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'', a symbol assigned by [[Leonhard Euler]], and called the [[imaginary unit]]. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\,a + b i&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the [[complex plane]], a [[vector space]] of two real [[dimension]]s. In the expression {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, the real number ''a'' is called the [[real part]] and ''b'' is called the [[imaginary part]]. If the real part of a complex number is&amp;nbsp;0, then the number is called an [[imaginary number]] or is referred to as ''purely imaginary''; if the imaginary part is&amp;nbsp;0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a [[Gaussian integer]]. The symbol for the complex numbers is '''C''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the complex numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], meaning that every [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has a [[zero of a function|root]] in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which is [[complete space|complete]], but unlike the real numbers, it is not [[total order|ordered]]. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that ''i'' is greater than&amp;nbsp;1, nor is there any meaning in saying that ''i'' is less than&amp;nbsp;1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack of a [[total order]] that is [[ordered field|compatible with field operations]].

==Subclasses of the integers==

===Even and odd numbers===
{{main article|Even and odd numbers}}
An '''even number''' is an integer that is "evenly divisible" by two, that is [[Euclidean division|divisible by two without remainder]]; an '''odd number''' is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term "evenly divisible" is now almost always shortened to "[[divisibility|divisible]]".) Any odd number ''n'' may be constructed by the formula {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2''k'' + 1,}} for a suitable integer ''k''. Starting with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 0,}} the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number ''m'' has the form {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2''k''}} where ''k'' is again an [[integer]]. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.

===Prime numbers===
{{main article|Prime number}}
A '''prime number''' is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belong to [[number theory]].  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called [[Goldbach's conjecture]].

The question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. A proof appears in [[Euclid's Elements]].

===Other classes of integers===
Many subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[perfect number]]s. For more examples, see [[Integer sequence]].

==Subclasses of the complex numbers==

===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===
[[Algebraic number]]s are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called [[irrational number]]s. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a [[monic polynomial]] equation with integer coefficients are called [[algebraic integer]]s.

===Computable numbers===
{{Main article|Computable number}}
A '''computable number''', also known as ''recursive number'', is a [[real number]] such that there exists an [[algorithm]] which, given a positive number ''n'' as input, produces the first ''n'' digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using [[μ-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machines]] or [[λ-calculus]]. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a [[polynomial]], and thus form a [[real closed field]] that contains the real [[algebraic number]]s.

The computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.

The set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, [[almost all]] real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.

==Extensions of the concept==

===''p''-adic numbers===
{{main article|p-adic number|l1=''p''-adic number}}
The ''p''-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what [[radix|base]] is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a [[prime number]] base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the ''p''-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.

The elements of an [[algebraic function field]] over a [[finite field]] and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see [[Function field analogy]]). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The ''p''-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.

===Hypercomplex numbers===
{{main article|hypercomplex number}}
Some number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called [[hypercomplex number]]s. They include the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', introduced by Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], in which multiplication is not [[commutative]], the [[octonion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[associative]] in addition to not being commutative, and the [[sedenion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[Alternative algebra|alternative]], neither associative nor commutative.

===Transfinite numbers===
{{main article|transfinite number}}
For dealing with infinite [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the natural numbers have been generalized to the [[ordinal number]]s and to the [[cardinal number]]s. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.

===Nonstandard numbers===
[[Hyperreal number]]s are used in [[non-standard analysis]]. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *'''R'''), denote an [[ordered field]] that is a proper [[Field extension|extension]] of the ordered field of [[real number]]s '''R''' and satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. This principle allows true [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about '''R''' to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *'''R'''.

[[Superreal number|Superreal]] and [[surreal number]]s extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form [[field (mathematics)|fields]].

A [[relation number]] is defined as the class of [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] consisting of all those relations that are similar to one member of the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |authorlink=Bertrand_Russell |title=Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |year=1919 |page=56 |ISBN=0-415-09604-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=unclear definition that is red linked. Is this notion notable enough for appearing here?|date=November 2014}}

==History==

===First use of numbers===
{{main article|History of ancient numeral systems}}
Bones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are [[tally marks]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshak, A., ''The Roots of Civilisation; Cognitive Beginnings of Man’s First Art, Symbol and Notation'', (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London: 1972), 81ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.

A tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern [[decimal]] notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.

The first known system with place value was the [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Mesopotamian base&amp;nbsp;60]] system ([[circa|ca.]] 3400&amp;nbsp;BC) and the earliest known base&amp;nbsp;10 system dates to 3100&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptpapyrus.html#berlin |title=Egyptian Mathematical Papyri – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora |publisher=Math.buffalo.edu |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero {{anchor|History of zero}}===
The first known documented use of zero dates to AD 628, and appeared in the ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]'', the main work of the [[Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]].  He treated&amp;nbsp;0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including [[division by zero|division]]. By this time (the 7th&amp;nbsp;century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as [[Khmer numerals]], and documentation shows the idea later spreading to [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]].

[[File:Khmer Numerals - 605 from the Sambor inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The number 605 in [[Khmer numerals]], from an inscription from 683 AD. An early use of zero as a decimal figure.]]

Brahmagupta's Brahmasphuṭasiddhanta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as 'Zero plus a positive number is the positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number'. The Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.

The use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in [[place-value system]]s. Many ancient texts used&amp;nbsp;0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word ''nfr'' to denote zero&amp;nbsp;balance in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry accounting]]. Indian texts used a [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|Shunye}} or {{lang|sa|shunya}} to refer to the concept of ''void''. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |title=Historia Matematica Mailing List Archive: Re: [HM&amp;#93; The Zero Story: a question |publisher=Sunsite.utk.edu |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112073735/http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[Pāṇini]] (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the [[Ashtadhyayi]], an early example of an [[formal grammar|algebraic grammar]] for the Sanskrit language (also see [[Pingala]]).

There are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the Brahmasphutasiddhanta.

Records show that the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] seemed unsure about the status of&amp;nbsp;0 as a number: they asked themselves "how can 'nothing' be something?" leading to interesting [[philosophical]] and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of&amp;nbsp;0 and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of&amp;nbsp;0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether&amp;nbsp;{{num|1}} was a number.)

The late [[Olmec]] people of south-central [[Mexico]] began to use a symbol for zero, a shell [[glyph]], in the New World, possibly by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} but certainly by 40&amp;nbsp;BC, which became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]]. Mayan arithmetic used base&amp;nbsp;4 and base&amp;nbsp;5 written as base&amp;nbsp;20. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base&amp;nbsp;4, base&amp;nbsp;5 "finger" abacus.

By 130 AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for&amp;nbsp;0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was the first ''documented'' use of a true zero in the Old World. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of his ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' (''Almagest''), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[omicron]] (otherwise meaning&amp;nbsp;70).

Another true zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, {{lang|la|nulla}} meaning ''nothing'', not as a symbol. When division produced&amp;nbsp;0 as a remainder, {{lang|la|nihil}}, also meaning ''nothing'', was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of [[Easter]]). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.

===Negative numbers {{anchor|History of negative numbers}}===
{{further information|History of negative numbers}}
The abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100–50 BC in China.  ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive [[coefficient]]s, black for negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Staszkow |first=Ronald |author2=Robert Bradshaw |title=The Mathematical Palette (3rd ed.) |publisher=Brooks Cole |year=2004 |page=41 |isbn=0-534-40365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century AD in [[Greece]]. [[Diophantus]] referred to the equation equivalent to {{nowrap|4''x'' + 20 {{=}} 0}} (the solution is negative) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation gave an absurd result.

During the 600s, negative numbers were in use in [[India]] to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]'' 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today. However, in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century in India, [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara]] gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value "is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots."

[[Europe]]an mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, although [[Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter&amp;nbsp;13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', 1202) and later as losses (in {{lang|la|Flos}}). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David Eugene |authorlink=David_Eugene_Smith |title=History of Modern Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1958 |page=259 |isbn=0-486-20429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] during the 15th&amp;nbsp;century. He used them as [[exponent]]s, but referred to them as "absurd numbers".

As recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as [[René Descartes]] did with negative solutions in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

===Rational numbers {{anchor|History of rational numbers}}===
It is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to [[prehistoric times]]. The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used their [[Egyptian fraction]] notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Kahun Papyrus]]. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of [[number theory]]. The best known of these is [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], dating to roughly 300&amp;nbsp;BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the [[Sthananga Sutra]], which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.

The concept of [[decimal fraction]]s is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to [[pi]] or the [[square root of 2]]. Similarly, Babylonian math texts had always used sexagesimal (base&amp;nbsp;60) fractions with great frequency.

===Irrational numbers {{anchor|History of irrational numbers}}===
{{further information|History of irrational numbers}}
The earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] [[Sulba Sutras]] composed between 800 and 500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-link=Helaine Selin |title=Mathematics across cultures: the history of non-Western mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2000 |page=451 |isbn=0-7923-6481-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to [[Pythagoras]], more specifically to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]], who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |chapter=Horace and the Monuments: A New Interpretation of the Archytas ''Ode'' |author=Bernard Frischer |editor=D.R. Shackleton Bailey |editorlink=D. R. Shackleton Bailey |page=83 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-674-37935-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century brought final European acceptance of [[negative number|negative]] integral and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] numbers. By the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since [[Euclid]]. In 1872, the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil [[E. Kossak]]), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]],'' 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]] was brought about. In 1869, [[Charles Méray]] had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of [[real number]]s, separating all [[rational number]]s into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] (''Crelle'', 101), and Méray.

The search for roots of [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations was an important development, the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] ([[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] 1799, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] 1824) showed that they could not be solved by [[nth root|radicals]] (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of [[algebraic numbers]] (all solutions to polynomial equations). [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] (1832) linked polynomial equations to [[group theory]] giving rise to the field of [[Galois theory]].

[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of [[Euler]], and at the opening of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by [[Druckenmüller]] (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and Günther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with [[determinant]]s, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], and Günther, in the theory of Kettenbruchdeterminanten.

===Transcendental numbers and reals {{anchor|History of transcendental numbers and reals}}===
{{further information|History of π}}

The existence of transcendental numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bogomolny |first=A. |authorlink=Cut-the-Knot |title=What's a number? |work=Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first established by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] (1844, 1851). [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] proved in 1873 that ''e'' is transcendental and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proved in 1882 that π is transcendental. Finally, [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor]] showed that the set of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]], so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.

===Infinity and infinitesimals {{anchor|History of infinity and infinitesimals}}===
{{further information|History of infinity}}
The earliest known conception of mathematical [[infinity]] appears in the [[Yajur Veda]], an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, "If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity." Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the [[Jain]] mathematicians c. 400&amp;nbsp;BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.

[[Aristotle]] defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between [[actual infinity]] and [[potential infinity]]—the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' discussed the idea of [[bijection|one-to-one correspondences]] between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by [[Georg Cantor]]; in 1895 he published a book about his new [[set theory]], introducing, among other things, [[transfinite number]]s and formulating the [[continuum hypothesis]].

In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of [[hyperreal numbers]] represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about [[infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].

A modern geometrical version of infinity is given by [[projective geometry]], which introduces "ideal points at infinity", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing.

===Complex numbers {{anchor|History of complex numbers}}===
{{further information|History of complex numbers}}
The earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the {{nowrap|1st century AD}}, when he considered the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]]. They became more prominent when in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]]. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.

This was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When [[René Descartes]] coined the term "imaginary" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See [[imaginary number]] for a discussion of the "reality" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\left ( \sqrt{-1}\right )^2 =\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=-1&lt;/math&gt;
seemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab},&lt;/math&gt;
which is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
in the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to guard against this mistake.

The 18th century saw the work of [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. [[De Moivre's formula]] (1730) states:
:&lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^{n} = \cos n \theta + i\sin n \theta &lt;/math&gt;
while [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]] (1748) gave us:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + i\sin \theta = e ^{i\theta }. &lt;/math&gt;

The existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until [[Caspar Wessel]] described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in [[John Wallis|Wallis]]'s ''De Algebra tractatus''.

Also in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] studied [[Gaussian integer|complex numbers of the form]] {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integral, or rational (and ''i'' is one of the two roots of {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 {{=}} 0}}). His student, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], studied the type {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bω''}}, where ''ω'' is a complex root of {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 0.}} Other such classes (called [[cyclotomic fields]]) of complex numbers derive from the [[roots of unity]] {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 0}} for higher values of ''k''. This generalization is largely due to [[Ernst Kummer]], who also invented [[ideal number]]s, which were expressed as geometrical entities by [[Felix Klein]] in 1893.

In 1850 [[Victor Alexandre Puiseux]] took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of [[mathematical singularity|essential singular points]]. This eventually led to the concept of the [[extended complex plane]].

===Prime numbers {{anchor|History of prime numbers}}===
[[Prime number]]s have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the ''Elements'' to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and presented the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.

In 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] used the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the [[Renaissance]] and later eras.

In 1796, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] conjectured the [[prime number theorem]], describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859. The [[prime number theorem]] was finally proved by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la Vallée-Poussin]] in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.

'''''On the Waterfront''''' is a 1954 American [[crime drama]] film directed by [[Elia Kazan]], and written by [[Budd Schulberg]]. It stars [[Marlon Brando]], and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], Pat Henning and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The soundtrack score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was suggested by "Crime on the Waterfront" by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November–December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{AFI film|51286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film focuses on [[union violence]] and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[extortion]], and [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].

''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success, and received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, winning eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]], and in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.

In 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
[[American Mafia|Mob]]-connected union boss Johnny Friendly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) gloats about his iron-fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]] know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play "D and D" ("deaf and dumb"), accepting their subservient position, rather than risking the danger and shame of informing.

Terry Malloy ([[Marlon Brando]]) is a dockworker whose brother Charley "the Gent" ([[Rod Steiger]]) is Friendly's right-hand man. Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer, until Friendly had Charley instruct him to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting against him. Terry is used to coax Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), a popular dockworker, into an ambush, preventing Joey from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry assumed that Friendly's enforcers were only going to "lean" on Joey to pressure him into silence, and is surprised when Joey is killed.

Joey's sister Edie ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), angry about her brother's death, shames "waterfront priest" Father Barry ([[Karl Malden]]) into fomenting action against the mob-controlled union. Friendly sends Terry to attend and inform on a dockworkers' meeting Father Barry holds in the church, which is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape the violence, and is smitten with her. Another dockworker, Timothy J. "Kayo" Dugan (Pat Henning), who agrees to testify after Father Barry promises unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.

Although Terry resents being used as a tool in Joey's death, and despite Father Barry's impassioned "sermon on the docks" reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a [[Calvary]], Terry is at first willing to remain "D and D", even when [[subpoena]]ed to testify. However, when Edie, unaware of Terry's role in her brother's death, begins to return Terry's feelings, Terry is tormented by his awakening conscience and confesses the circumstances of Joey's death to Father Barry and Edie. Horrified, Edie breaks up with him.

As Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry with a good job and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who blames his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. In what has become an iconic scene, Terry reminds Charley that had it not been for the fixed fight, Terry's prizefighting career would have bloomed. "I coulda' been somebody. I coulda' been a contender", laments Terry to his brother, "Instead of a bum, which is what I am – let's face it." Charley gives Terry the gun, and advises him to run. Terry flees to Edie's apartment, where she first refuses to let him in, but finally admits her love for him. Friendly, having had Charley watched, has Charley murdered and his body hung in an alley as bait to lure Terry out to his death, but Terry and Edie both escape the attempt on Terry's life.

After finding Charley's body, Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry prevents it by blocking Terry's line of fire and convincing Terry to fight Friendly by testifying instead. Terry proceeds to give damaging testimony implicating Friendly in Joey's murder and other illegal activities, causing Friendly's mob boss to cut him off and Friendly to face [[indictment]].

After the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. Terry is shunned by his former friends and by a neighborhood boy who had previously looked up to him. Refusing Edie's suggestion that they move away from the waterfront together, Terry shows up during recruitment at the docks. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did. The confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witness the confrontation, show their support for Terry by refusing to work, unless Terry is working, too, and pushing Friendly into the river. Encouraged by Father Barry and Edie, the badly injured Terry forces himself to his feet and enters the dock, followed by the other workers. A soaking wet and face-scarred Friendly, now left with nothing, swears revenge on them all, but his threats fall on deaf ears as they enter the garage, and the door closes behind them.

==Production==
===Screenplay and political context===
The film is widely considered to be [[Elia Kazan]]'s answer to those who criticized him for identifying eight (former) Communists in the film industry before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) in 1952. One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally entitled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{cn|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie "pro-American". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archivedate=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After rewriting the script, Schulberg and Kazan approached [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who eventually told them he did not like a single thing about the script, asking, "Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?" This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer [[Sam Spiegel]], who set up a deal with Columbia. Spiegel was insistent on Schulberg delivering a perfect screenplay, and barraged the writer with changes and suggestions, to the frustration of Schulberg.

Schulberg's script nonetheless went through a number of changes before reaching the screen. In an early draft, the Terry Malloy character was not an ex-pug dockworker, but a cynical investigative reporter, as well as an older, divorced man.

===Real-life basis for characters===

Terry Malloy's fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DeVincenzo, who testified before a real-life [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Commission]] about activities on the Hoboken Docks and suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DeVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with [[Columbia Pictures]] over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DeVincenzo claimed to have recounted his story to screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings. Schulberg attended DeVincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.

The character of Father Barry was based on the real-life "waterfront priest" [[John M. Corridan|Father John M. Corridan]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and graduate of [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|west side of Manhattan]]. Father Corridan was interviewed extensively by Schulberg, who also wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, ''Waterfront Priest'' by Allen Raymond.

The character of Johnny Friendly was partially based on [[International Longshoremen's Association]] boss [[Michael Clemente]]. Friendly also had aspects of former [[Murder, Inc.]] head [[Albert Anastasia]], who was a top enforcer for the crime family that ran the Hoboken docks, the Luciano{{spnd}}later Genovese{{spnd}}family. In 1979, Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.

===Casting===
According to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had "a handshake deal"{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a "more Brando-like" actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade Spiegel that "an actor like Marlon Brando" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterwards, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had already been signed for that role.

The part of Edie Doyle was offered to [[Grace Kelly]], who turned it down, preferring to make ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Kazan said in his autobiography ''A Life'' that the choice of an actress to play Edie Doyle was narrowed down to [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]]. There was something well-bred about Montgomery that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie,{{cn|date=January 2018}} who was raised on the waterfront in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. He gave the part to Saint.

The role of Terry's older brother Charley was originally offered to [[Lawrence Tierney]], who asked for too much money, so the role went to [[Rod Steiger]]. Despite playing Terry's older brother, Steiger was one year younger than Brando.

Several of the labor boss' men in the film, including [[Abe Simon]] as Barney, [[Tony Galento]] as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tillio, were former professional [[heavyweight]] boxers in real life.

===Filming locations===
''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.&lt;ref name=movielove&gt;{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A. H. Weiler called the film "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals".&lt;ref&gt;Weiler, A. H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/29/movies/19540729waterfront.html?_r=0 "Movie Review: On the Waterfront"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (July 29, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a critical score of 98% with an average rating of 9.2/10 and a critical consensus of "With his electrifying performance in Elia Kazan's thought-provoking, expertly constructed melodrama, Marlon Brando redefined the possibilities of acting for film and helped permanently alter the cinematic landscape".&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_waterfront/ |title=On the Waterfront |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legacy'''

In 1989, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. It is also on the [[Vatican's list of films|Vatican's list of 45 greatest films]], compiled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.usccb.org/movies/vaticanfilms.shtml |title=Vatican Best Films List |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
{{Anchor|Video|DVD|DVD release}} The first home video release of the film was by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]] in 1982, on VHS and Beta. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's "Studio Heritage Collection", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette "Contender: Mastering the Method", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]]. 

The 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: "In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10702">The '''open-question argument''' is a philosophical [[argument]] put forward by British philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] in [http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.13 §13] of ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903),&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to refute the equating of the property of goodness with some non-moral property, X, whether naturalistic (e.g. [[Hedonism|pleasure]]) or supernatural (e.g. [[Divine command theory|God's command]]). That is, Moore's argument attempts to show that no moral property is identical to a natural property.&lt;ref&gt;

 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RUicWaTjPJUC&amp;pg=PA230
}}, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument takes the form of syllogistic [[modus tollens]]:

: Premise 1: If X is (analytically equivalent to) good, then the question "Is it true that ''X'' is good?" is meaningless.

: Premise 2: The question "Is it true that ''X'' is good?" is not meaningless (i.e. it is an open question).

: Conclusion: X is not (analytically equivalent to) good.

The type of question Moore refers to in this argument is an identity question, "Is it true that X is ''Y''?"  Such a question is an ''open question'' if a conceptually competent speaker can question this; otherwise the question is ''closed.''  For example, "I know he is a vegan, but does he eat meat?" would be a closed question.  However, "I know that it is pleasurable, but is it good?" is an open question; the question cannot be deduced from the conceptual terms alone.

The open-question argument claims that any attempt to identify morality with some set of observable, natural properties will always be an open question (unlike, say, a horse, which can be defined in terms of observable properties).  Moore further argued that if this is true, then moral facts cannot be reduced to natural properties and that therefore [[ethical naturalism]] is false.  Put another way, what Moore is saying is that any attempt to define good in terms of a naturalistic property fails because all definitions can be transformed into closed questions (the subject and predicate being conceptually identical; it is given in language itself that the two terms mean the same thing); however, all purported naturalistic definitions of good are transformable into open questions.  It is still controversial whether good is the same thing as pleasure, etc.  Shortly before (in section §11), Moore said if good is defined as pleasure (or any other naturalistic property) "good" may be substituted for "pleasure" anywhere it occurs.  However, "pleasure is good" is a meaningful, informative statement; but "good is good" (after making the substitution) is an empty, non-informative tautology.

==Objections and rejoinders==

===Begging the question===

The idea that Moore [[Begging the question|begs the question]] (i.e. assumes the conclusion in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 |last1= Miller |first1= Alexander
 |year= 2003
 |title= An Introduction to Contemporary Metaethics
 |publisher= Polity
 |edition= 2nd
 |isbn= 978-0745646596
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since analytic equivalency, for two objects X and Y, logically results in the question "Is it true that X is Y?" being meaningless (by Moore's own argument), to say that the question is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore begs the question in the second premise. He assumes that the question is a meaningful one (i.e. that it is an open question). This begs the question and the open-question argument thus fails.

In response to this, the open-question argument can be reformulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copp|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Darwall-Gibbard-Railton reformulation argues for the impossibility of equating a moral property with a non-moral one using the internalist theory of motivation.


This evidently presupposes the internalist theory of motivation (i.e. a belief can itself motivate), in contrast to the externalist theory of motivation, also known as the Humean theory of motivation (i.e. both a belief and a desire are required to motivate). If internalism is true, then the OQA avoids begging the question against the naturalist, and succeeds in showing that the good cannot be equated to some other property.

The argument is also contested on the grounds of the supremacy of internalism. Internalism is supported by the [[belief–desire–intention model]] of motivation, whereby desire (i.e. that some proposition ought to be made or kept true) and belief (i.e. that some proposition is true) combine to form intention, and thereby, action. To argue for the special motivational effects of moral beliefs is to commit the fallacy of [[special pleading]].

===Meaningful analysis===

The main assumption within the open-question argument can be found within premise 1. It is assumed that analytic equivalency will result in meaningless analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copp|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if we understand Concept C, and Concept C* can be analysed in terms of Concept C, then we should grasp concept C* by virtue of our understanding of Concept C. Yet it is obvious that such understanding of Concept C* only comes about through the analysis proper. Mathematics would be the prime example: mathematics is tautological and its claims are true by definition, yet we can develop new mathematical conceptions and theorems. Thus, X (i.e. some non-moral property) might well be analytically equivalent to the good, and still the question of "Is ''X'' good?" can be meaningful. Ergo premise 1 does not hold and the argument falls.

===Frege sense–reference distinction===
{{Main|Sense and reference}}

Sense and reference are two different aspects of some terms' [[Meaning (linguistic)|meanings]]. A term's ''reference'' is the ''object'' to which the term refers, while the term's ''sense'' is the ''way'' that the term refers to that object.  

There is a difference between the sense of a term and its reference (i.e. the object itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copp|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we can understand a claim like "goodness is identical with pleasure" as an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identity claim similar to "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O". The question "This is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O but is it water?" is intelligible and so, in that limited sense, whether or not water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is an open question; note that this does not address the issue of significance. But that does not lead us to conclude that water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an identity claim that is known to be true ''a posteriori'' (i.e., it was discovered via empirical investigation).  Another example is "redness" being identical to certain phenomena of electromagnetism.  This is discovered by empirical investigation. Similarly, many moral naturalists argue that "rightness" can be discovered as an ''a posteriori'' truth, by investigating the different claims, like that of pleasure being the good, or of duty being the good.

This is done by invoking rightness and wrongness to explain certain empirical phenomena, and then discovering ''a posteriori'' whether maximizing utility occupies the relevant explanatory role.&lt;ref&gt;

}}, p. 28. &lt;!-- Original editor did not specify which edition. Using 1st. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, they argue that since right actions contingently have certain effects e.g. being causally responsible for a tendency towards social stability—so it follows we can fix the term "right" refer to the empirical description "the property of acts, whatever it is, that is causally responsible for their tendency towards social stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFollette|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  With this description for "right," we can then investigate which acts accomplish this: e.g. those actions that maximize utility.  We can then conclude that we have learned that "right" refers to "maximizing utility" through ''a posteriori'' means.

The Frege sense–reference distinction can be understood in layman's terms by using the analogy of the Masked Man.&lt;ref&gt;Fyfe, A. : Desire Utilitarianism, {{cite web|url=http://www.alonzofyfe.com/article_du.shtml |accessdate=September 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420155930/http://alonzofyfe.com/article_du.shtml |archivedate=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A citizen living on the frontiers of the Wild West is told by the sheriff that his brother is the Masked Man who has recently been robbing banks. The citizen protests that he understands who his brother is, and who the Masked Man is supposed to be, and can meaningfully ask, "Is my brother the Masked Man?" Obviously, analytic equivalency is of no relevance here. The matter is an empirical one, which the citizen must investigate a posteriori. The absurdity of dismissing the claim as such is apparent.

However, the above account of a sort of ''a posteriori'' moral search is unsatisfactory in that normal value, and not moral value, can be used to explain the relevant events. Normal value arises from the relationship between desire and a state of affairs. People tend also to objectify such value, into categorical moral value, though this is fallacious. So, a situation that can be explained by the existence of real moral value (e.g. the fulfillment of preferences, the tendency towards social stability) can also be explained by non-moral value. This explanation is far simpler, given the ontological difficulties surrounding moral value. As J. L. Mackie argued with his [[argument from queerness]], moral values (i.e. oughts) that exist in the natural world (of facts), is highly queer, and we ought to favour a completely naturalistic explanation instead.&lt;ref&gt;

}}. &lt;!-- Originally published by Pelican Books in 1977. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with the ''a posteriori'' moral search is that we lack an epistemic account of how we access moral facts. This is the epistemic aspect of Mackie's argument from queerness.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Mackie|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Failing such an account, the postulation of moral value will be egregious.

[[File:Getty Villa exterior.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Getty Villa]] representing life at otium (leisure) of an ancient Roman villa]] 
'''''Otium''''', a [[Latin]] abstract term, has a variety of meanings, including leisure time in which a person can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's [[retirement]] after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing "active public life". ''Otium'' can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (''negotium'') or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (''i.e.'' speaking, writing, philosophy). It had particular meaning to businessmen, diplomats, philosophers and poets.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Julia Conaway |last1=Bondanella |year=2008 |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/clj/BondanellaAbstract.html |title=Petrarch's Rereading of Otium in ''De vita solitaria'' |journal= Comparative Literature |publisher=[[American Comparative Literature Association]] |volume=60 |number=1 |pages=14–28 |accessdate=9 November 2011 |doi=10.1215/-60-1-14 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman soldiers at rest.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Representation of ancient Roman soldiers at rest]]
According to historian Carl Deroux in his work ''Studies in Latin literature and Roman history'', the word ''otium'' appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia.&lt;ref&gt;Deroux, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius' first use of the term ''otium'' around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed ''otium negotiosum'' (free time to do what one wanted) and ''otium otiosum'' (idle wasteless free time).&lt;ref name="Langis2"&gt;''[http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S&amp;R_2008_Langis.pdf Leisure, Idleness and Virtuous Activity in Shakespearean Drama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514084059/http://www.marietta.edu/departments/English/OVSC/Select_Papers/2008/Taft_S%26R_2008_Langis.pdf# |date=14 May 2014 }}'' by Unhae Langis, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aulus Gellius]], while discussing the word ''praeterpropter'' ("more or less") quotes a fragment of [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', which contrasts ''otium'' with ''negotium'' repeatedly.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2007.01.0071:book=19:chapter=10 19, 10]. For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as "more or less" ''living''.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant appearance of the word in [[Latin literature]] occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the ''Iphigenia'' of [[Ennius]], where it is contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Ennius, frg. XCIX in the edition of Jocelyn, ''otio qui nescit uti | plus negoti habet quam cum est negotium in negotio'', rendered by Jocelyn: "the man who has no job to do and does not know how to employ the resulting leisure has more difficulty than when there is difficulty in a job on hand". For this fragment as the first instance of ''otium'' in the extant literature, see Eleanor Winsor Leach, "''Otium'' as ''Luxuria'': Economy of Status in the Younger Pliny's ''Letters''," ''Arethusa'' 36 (2003), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of ''otium'' was never a direct translation of the Greek word "schole", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. ''Otium'' is an example of the usage of the term "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war.&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"&gt;Sadlek, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (''i.e.'', winter months, weather not permitting war).&lt;ref name="Sadlek33"/&gt; This was associated with ''otium otiosum'' (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was ''otium negotiosum'' (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying [[hobby]] or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was ''otium privatum'' (private leisure), equal to ''negotium'' (a type of business).&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract "Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium" by Brian Vickers], p. 6 ''The first recorded use of the term is in a fragment from a soldiers' chorus in Ennius' Iphigenia (c. 190 BC), whose preservation we owe to that philologian's ragbag, the Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius (c. 150 AD) - he cites it as an example of the usage of the word praeterpropter (19.10.12). The soldiers are unoccupied, resting and bored, wanting to return home. They distinguish between otium negotiosum, leisure with a satisfying occupation, which takes place in the city, around the hearth, and otium otiosum, unoccupied and pointless leisure, such as their prolonged stay in the countryside, which they find disorientating. Andre argues that otium originally had military, not pastoral associations, referring to the enforced inactivity that coincided each year with the dead months of winter (especially January and February), unsuitable for war, farming or fishing.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest citation for ''otium'' is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 17-24, The tragedy is [[Ennius]]'s ''Iphigenia'', ''apud'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0071%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D10 19, 10] (a discussion of a different word in the same fragment).&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (''otium'') than to be idle doing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons&lt;ref name="Bernard16"&gt;Bernard, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; - a time for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Even though originally ''otium'' was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons,&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"&gt;Bright, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler, pp 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of ''otium'' as a waste of time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of ancient Roman considered ''otium'' a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paoli, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and [[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]] point out the only legitimate form of ''otium'' was transpired with intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Almasi, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; ''Otium'' was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (''negotium'') and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek philosophers ==
[[File:Epikur2.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Epicurus]] ]]

The favorable sense of ''otium'' in [[Cicero]]nian Latin reflects the Greek term {{lang|grc|σχολή}} (''skholē'', "leisure", a meaning retained in [[Modern Greek]] as σχόλη, ''schólē''); "leisure" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the [[kalos kagathos|Athenian gentleman]]: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became "discussion", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. [[Plato]] (and his contemporaries, if the ''[[Greater Hippias]]'' be not authentic) brought ''schole'' into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the ''Greater Hippias'', it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henry Smith, ''The new nobility: A prolegomenon to Plato's "Greater Hippias"'' 2007; pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the [[Academy]], they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the [[New Academy]] of [[Carneades]] practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;The Academy lasted nearly a thousand years; different authors divide its history differently. For the text, see, ''inter permulta alia'', R. J. Hankinson, ''The Skeptics'', pp. 86-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] and [[Dicaearchus]], students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"/&gt;

Roman Epicureans used ''otium'' for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"&gt;Haase, p. 2265&lt;/ref&gt; An Epicurean proverb {{cquote|
''It is better to lie on the naked ground and be at ease, than to have a golden coach and a rich table and be worried.''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenmeyer, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The phrase "to be at ease" can have the meaning "to be of good cheer" or "to be without fear" {{mdash}} these being interdependent. The [[Epicurean]] idea of ''otium'' favors contemplation,&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (''i.e.'' sailors). The rustic ''otium'' concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism.  The active city public life of ''negotium'' and an ''otium'' of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].

[[Epicurus]]'s philosophy was contrary to [[Stoicism|Hellenistic Stoicism]]. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of ''otium''.&lt;ref name="Haase, p. 2265"/&gt; The concept of the Epicurean ''otium'' (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in [[Epicureanism|Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden]]. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first–century historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in "The Garden" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean ''otium'' and the  Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of ''otium'' (''i.e.'' private or public; contemplation or "employment"; ''otium'' or ''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Republic ==
In early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, ''otium'' is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to ''officium'', "office, duty" than to ''negotium'' ('business"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then ''otium'' meant "leisure" while ''negotium'' meant "non-leisure" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of ''otium'' was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. ''Otium '' and ''negotium'' was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of ''otium'' was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter,&lt;ref&gt;Andre, pp. 20-22,  35-36, 79-81, 421, 434-437&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the business (''negotium'') of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual ''otium.''&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Andre shows that the beauty of the individual ''otium'' poses rest.&lt;ref&gt;Andre, p. 514 ''beaute de l'otium individuel poesie du repos.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Maccius Plautus]] in his play ''[[Mercator (play)|Mercator]]'' says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim ''tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames'' (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0102%3Aact%3D3%3Ascene%3D2 T.

[[File:CiceroEpistulaeAdFamiliaresVenice1547page329Detail.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Cicero busy at work]]

[[Cicero]] speaks of himself, with the expression ''otium cum dignitate'', that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life.&lt;ref name="297549 JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Chaim |last1=Wirszubski |journal=The [[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=44|year=1954 |pages=1–13|title=Cicero's CVM Dignitate Otivm: A Reconsideration |jstor=637589 |doi=10.2307/297549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/637589 AUCTORITAS, DIGNITAS, OTIUM]&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ousted from  each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for "worthy leisure". During this time he composed ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', a series of books on [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"&gt;Stroup, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero defines ''otium'' as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) - a type of "public health".&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt; It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book ''On Duties'' that when the city life becomes [[Frustration|too much]], one should retreat to the country for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Prosperetti, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''otium cum dignitate'' in Cicero's ''Pro Sestio'' was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some.&lt;ref&gt;Wirszubski, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero says in ''Pro Sestio'', XLV., 98{{cquote|
''Id quod est praestantissimum, maximeque optabile omnibus sanis et bonis et beatis, cum dignitate otium.''&lt;br /&gt;That which stands first, and is most to be desired by all happy, honest and healthy-minded men, is ease with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Harbottle, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and ''otium''. In one passage of ''[[De Oratore]]'' he explains that [[Philistus]] spent his retirement writing history as his ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book ii. 13.57&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say in ''De Oratore'' Book iii that other men passed their ''otium'' of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, [[knucklebones]], dice games or just games they made up. Others that were "retired" from public life for whatever reason devoted their ''otium cum seritio'' (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Book iii.15.57&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian [[Klaus Bringmann]] shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a [[hypocrite]] while in ''otium''  because of his sense of duty to serve the state.&lt;ref&gt;Colish, pp. 77-78 ''Cicero on "otium"...

It means the well-earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (''desidia'') had derogatory implications and unqualified ''otium'' was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with ''negotia publica'', participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''off.'' 3.1; ''Brut.'' 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish between plain "idleness" and aristocratic ''otium homestum'', ''otium liberale'' or ''otium cum dignitate'', writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to ''res publica'' (the general public).  These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc. 1.5; 5.105; ''fam'' 1.9.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Cat.'' 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero praises [[Cato the Elder]] for his respectful use of ''otium'' in  his expression ''non minus otii quam negotii'' (no less for doing nothing than business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x | volume=4 | title=Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium | year=1990 | journal=Renaissance Studies | pages=1–37 [7] | last1 = Vickers | first1 = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero was associating ''otium'' with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that [[Scipio Africanus]] claimed he was ''never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.''&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Cicero in his ''[[De Officiis]]'' (book III 1-4) further says of Scipio Africanus ''Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a [[goad]].''  Cicero's idea of ''otium cum dignitate'' (leisure with dignity) is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of "free time" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (''otium'') available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of [[hobby|hobbies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bereday, p. 60 &amp; 156&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero has a number of different concept versions for ''otium''. In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (''maximos labores'') should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Vasaly, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catullus]], a late [[Roman Republic]] poet, in his poems shows that the significance of ''otium'' of the middle Republican time of [[autonomy]] into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark ''otium'' with erotic influence.&lt;ref name="Stroup, p. 61"/&gt;

=== Imperial Rome ===
[[File:GNM - Römische Villa.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reconstruction of a Roman villa]]
The imperial dictatorship by [[Augustus]] during the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (''otium'') because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 123, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The home of choice (''domus'') then became the countryside [[villa]] as the rise of the [[Roman Empire]] made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Greek-style architecture became their new [[Roman villa|villa otium]] outside of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/arts/12iht-otium.1.16069552.html?pagewanted=all |title=The pursuit of leisure and the rise of the Roman villa|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman times the "otium villa " was a [[Dionysian]] idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (''otium'') in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (''negotium'').&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The "villa with a garden" and "villa by the sea" was associated with ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
The life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a "superior world" of living.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Roman poet [[Statius]] writes of a "otium villa" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work ''[[Silvae]]'': ''It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure,  non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...''&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Silvae'' 3.5.85-87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Younger]] exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in ''otium'' of the time by the life he lived from his "otium villas". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bath, take naps and occasionally hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |title=The Roman Villa |access-date=18 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620235350/http://www.virginia.edu/president/kenanscholarship/work/archive_files/penley_chiang/HTML%20Pages/Villa%20Pages/Villa%20-%20ROMAN.htm# |archive-date=20 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibullus]] was an [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Elegiac couplet|elegiac]] poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his [[Tibullus#Extant works|existing first two books of poetry]] he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]] as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, ''adsiduus labor'', and military service (''militia''). He shows in his poetry that originally ''otium'' was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons.&lt;ref name="Bright, p. 217"/&gt; Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (''interdum'') and therefore inserts ''otium'' (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life.&lt;ref name="Myers73"&gt;Myers, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ''ignobile otium'' (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Lee-Stecum, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of ''otium''. He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]] as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward ''otium''. The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that ''otium'' is not really "free time", but a study of other matters (''i.e.'', reading, writing) other than political and career gains.&lt;ref&gt;Trapp, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancik, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by ''otium liberale'' (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De otio, De brevitate vitae, De tranquillitate animi, ep.'' 82.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''epp.'' 1.22; 9.3&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of ''otium ruris'' (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''epod.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''g.'' 2.475–540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''dial.'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'' describes retirement from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Erskine, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on ''otium'' (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to ''negotium''.&lt;ref name="Bernard16"/&gt;

These are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of ''De Otio'':
# virtue, freedom and happiness by reasoning.
# the military metaphor.
# that the virtuous person chooses ''statio'', a specific place for doing one's 'employment'.
# ''otium'' (leisure) is still ''negotium'' (business) even if withdrawal from public activity.
# that the virtuous person's ''otium'', as a citizen of the universe, is the field for the performance of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later writers ===

[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|125px|&lt;center&gt;Augustine studying]]

While Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of [[Athenodorus of Soli|Athenodorus]]'s ''De Tranquillitate'' it is basically different. In ''De Otio 3.5'' Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in ''De Tranquillitate'' the theme is peace of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Motto, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] reminded Romans of ''otium philosophandi'', a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that ''otium'' was the prerequisite for contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of ''otium'' that [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described ''Christianae vita otium'' as the Christian life of leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of ''otium'' as the [[deadly sin]] of [[acedia]] (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated ''otium'' as meaning to serve God through deep thought.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt; Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify ''otium''.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary, ''Trin.'' 1.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; These same Christian writers also showed ''otium ruris'' (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic ''propositum''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulinus of Nola, ''ep.'' 5.4; ''carm.'' 10.166&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine describes the monastic life as ''otium sanctum'' (sanctified leisure or approved leisure).&lt;ref name="Enarrations"&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/augustine/textstrans.html |title=Enarrations on the Psalms |page=220.3 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - ''negotium'') and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - ''otium'').&lt;ref name="Prosperetti 48"&gt;Prosperetti, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrarch]], 14th-century poet and [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]], discusses ''otium'' in his ''[[De vita solitaria]]'' as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees ''otium'' not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship.&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;

[[File:Francesco Petrarca00.jpg|thumb|100 px|left|&lt;center&gt;Petrarca]]

Petrarch considered solitude (''i.e.'', rural setting, "villa otium", [[Philippe de Cabassoles#The best friend of Petrarch|his Vaucluse home]]) and its relationship to ''otium'' as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said "no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it."&lt;ref&gt;Kleist, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of ''otium'':

{{cquote|''...&amp;nbsp;ought it not to be my first aim to have my leisure as remote from idleness as my life is from active affairs?''&lt;ref name="Petrarch Otium"/&gt;}}
Petrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in ''otium'' (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's ''Vetus Itala'' in ''De otio religioso'' where in [[Christianity]] it was associated with contemplation and ''vacatio'' (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with ''videre'' (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of ''otium'' as ''vacate et videte'' (be still and see—a form of [[meditation]], contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Marvell]]’s seventeenth-century poem [[The Garden (poem)|The Garden]] is a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] of nine [[stanzas]] in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to ''otium''. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows ''otium'' to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized ''otium'' with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.&lt;ref name="Vickers5"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x/abstract |title=Leisure and Idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium |journal=Renaissance Studies |first1=Brian |last1=Vickers |authorlink=Brian Vickers (literary scholar) |doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1990.tb00408.x |publisher=The [[Society for Renaissance Studies]] ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |volume=4 | issue = 1 |pages=1–37 |origyear=March 1990 |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}; page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripe apples drop about my head; &lt;br /&gt;
The luscious clusters of the vine &lt;br /&gt;
Upon my mouth do crush their wine; &lt;br /&gt;
The nectarine and curious peach &lt;br /&gt;

Waves in its plumes the various light.

== Private life and public life meanings ==
Private life meaning of ''otium'' meant personal [[retirement]]—the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of "active public life". One would not be a historian in this case.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=637589 |title= Auctoritas, Dignitas, Otium |first1=J. P. V. D. |last1=Balsdon |authorlink= |doi= |publisher= Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=43–50 |date=May 1960 }}; page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In public life ''otium'' meant public peace and relief after war.&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war).&lt;ref name="Balsdon47"/&gt; This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the ''[[status quo]]'': acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Sestio'' 98; cf. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''Pascal's mugging''' is a [[thought-experiment]] demonstrating a problem in expected utility maximization. A [[rational agent]] should choose actions whose outcomes, when weighed by their probability, have higher [[utility]]. But some very unlikely outcomes may have very great utilities, and these utilities can grow faster than the probability diminishes. Hence the agent should focus more on vastly improbable cases with implausibly high rewards; this leads first to counter-intuitive choices, and then to incoherence as the utility of every choice becomes unbounded.

The name refers to [[Pascal's Wager]], but unlike the wager does not require infinite rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Olle Häggström]]|title=[[Olle Häggström#Here Be Dragons|Here Be Dragons]]|location=3.10: Cryonics|date=2016|isbn=978-0198723547}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sidesteps many objections to the Pascal's Wager dilemma that are based on the nature of infinity.&lt;ref name="bostrom" /&gt;

==Problem statement==
In one description,&lt;ref name="bostrom" /&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] is accosted by a mugger who has forgotten his weapon. However, the mugger proposes a deal: the philosopher gives him his wallet, and in exchange the mugger will return twice the amount of money tomorrow. Pascal declines, pointing out that it is unlikely the deal will be honoured. The mugger then continues naming higher rewards, pointing out that even if it is just one chance in 1000 that he will be honourable, it would make sense for Pascal to make a deal for a 2000 times return. Pascal responds that the probability for that high return is even lower than one in 1000. The mugger argues back that for any low probability of being able to pay back a large amount of money (or pure utility) there exists a finite amount that makes it rational to take the bet – and given human fallibility and philosophical scepticism a rational person must admit there is at least ''some'' non-zero chance that such a deal would be possible. In one example, the mugger succeeds by promising Pascal 1,000 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]] happy days of life. Convinced by the argument, Pascal gives the mugger the wallet.

The term "Pascal's mugging" to refer to this problem was originally coined by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] in the [[Less Wrong]] forum.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky"&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky, Pascal's Mugging: Tiny Probabilities of Vast Utilities. Less Wrong, 19 October 2007. http://lesswrong.com/lw/kd/pascals_mugging_tiny_probabilities_of_vast/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bostrom"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/pascal.pdf |title=Pascal's mugging |journal=Analysis |year=2009 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=443–445 |doi=10.1093/analys/anp062 |jstor=40607655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of Yudkowsky's examples, the mugger succeeds by saying "give me five dollars, or I'll use my magic powers from outside [[the Matrix]] to run a [[Turing machine]] that simulates and kills &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow3&lt;/math&gt; people". Here, the number &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow3&lt;/math&gt; uses [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]; writing the number out in base 10 would require enormously more writing material than there are atoms in the known universe.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky" /&gt;

Moreover, in many reasonable-seeming decision systems, "Pascal's mugging" causes the expected utility of any action to fail to converge, as an unlimited chain of successively dire scenarios similar to Pascal's mugging would need to be factored in.&lt;ref name="de blanc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marray"&gt;Kieran Marray, Dealing With Uncertainty in Ethical Calculations of Existential Risk, Presented at The Economic and Social Research Council Climate Ethics and Climate Economics Workshop Series: Workshop Five - Risk and the Culture of Science, May 2016 http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/climateethicseconomics/documents/papers-workshop-5/marray.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences and remedies==

Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that Pascal's mugging, like Pascal's wager, suggests that giving a superintelligent artificial intelligence a flawed decision theory could be disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199678112|chapter=Choosing the Criteria for Choosing}} "Decision Theory" section.&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal's mugging may also be relevant when considering low-probability, high-stakes events such as [[existential risk]] or charitable interventions with a low probability of success but extremely high rewards. Common sense seems to suggest that spending effort on too unlikely scenarios is irrational.

One advocated remedy might be to only use bounded utility functions: rewards cannot be arbitrarily large.&lt;ref name="de blanc"&gt;De Blanc, Peter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19192">The '''peak–end rule''' is a [[psychological heuristic]] in which people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience. The effect occurs regardless of whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant. According to the heuristic, other information aside from that of the peak and end of the experience is not lost, but it is not used. This includes net pleasantness or unpleasantness and how long the experience lasted. The peak–end rule is thereby a specific form of the more general [[extension neglect]] and [[duration neglect]].

==Overview==
The peak–end rule is an elaboration on the snapshot model of remembered utility proposed by [[Barbara Fredrickson]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]. This model dictates that an event is not judged by the entirety of an experience, but by prototypical moments (or ''snapshots'')  as a result of the [[representativeness heuristic]].&lt;ref name="duration_neglect" /&gt; The remembered value of snapshots dominates the actual value of an experience. Fredrickson and Kahneman theorized that these snapshots are actually the average of the most affectively intense moment of an experience and the feeling experienced at the end.&lt;ref name="by_moments" /&gt; The effects of the duration of an experience upon retrospective evaluation are extremely slight. Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled this phenomenon ''duration neglect''.&lt;ref name="duration_neglect" /&gt; The peak–end rule is applicable only when an experience has definite beginning and end periods.

==Research and examples==

A 1993 study titled "When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End" by Kahneman, Fredrickson, Charles Schreiber, and Donald Redelmeier provided groundbreaking evidence for the peak–end rule. Participants were subjected to two different versions of a single unpleasant experience. The first trial had subjects submerge a hand in 14&amp;nbsp;°C water for 60 seconds. The second trial had subjects submerge the other hand in 14&amp;nbsp;°C water for 60 seconds, but then keep their hand submerged for an additional 30 seconds, during which the temperature was raised to 15&amp;nbsp;°C. Subjects were then offered the option of which trial to repeat. Against the law of [[temporal monotonicity]], subjects were more willing to repeat the second trial, despite a prolonged exposure to uncomfortable temperatures. Kahneman et al. concluded that "subjects chose the long trial simply because they liked the memory of it better than the alternative (or disliked it less)."&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt;

Similarly, a 1996 study by Kahneman and Redelmeier assessed patients' appraisals of uncomfortable [[colonoscopy]] or [[lithotripsy]] procedures and correlated the remembered experience with real-time findings. They found that patients consistently evaluated the discomfort of the experience based on the intensity of pain at the worst (peak) and final (end) moments. This occurred regardless of length or variation in intensity of pain within the procedure.&lt;ref name=pain /&gt;

Another study by Kahneman and [[Ziv Carmon]] identified a boundary condition for the peak–end rule. Participants interacted with a computer program that had them wait to be served, while assessing their satisfaction as they were waiting. Kahneman and Carmon found that how participants felt at the final moment of the experience was a good predictor of their responses when they were asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences. For example, participants who felt very dissatisfied during much of the experience but were satisfied in the final few seconds (because the waiting line moved faster than expected toward the end) summarized the experience as satisfying. Kahneman and Carmon concluded that real time experiences that are based on expectations are discounted after the fact if those expectations are unfulfilled.&lt;ref name="simulated_queues" /&gt;

A third study by Kahneman, Redelmeier, and Joel Katz corroborated and expanded upon the discoveries made in the 1996 study. Colonoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups. One underwent a colonoscopy procedure wherein the scope was left in for three extra minutes, but not moved, creating a sensation that was uncomfortable, but not painful. The other group underwent a typical colonoscopy procedure. Kahneman et al. found that, when asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences, patients who underwent the longer procedure rated their experience as less unpleasant than patients who underwent the typical procedure. Moreover, the patients in the prolonged discomfort group were far more likely to return for subsequent procedures because a less painful end led them to evaluate the procedure more positively than those who faced a shorter procedure.&lt;ref name="memories_of_colonoscopy" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Memory bias for more emotional events (i.e., why the peak is memorable) ===
People exhibit better memory for more intensely emotional events than less intensely emotional events. The precise cause of this is unclear, but it has been demonstrated, for decades, across a wide variety of surveys and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Retention of affective material: Effects of intensity of affect on retrieval.|url = |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 64–80|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/h0032790|first = Satrajit|last = Dutta|first2 = Rabindra N.|last2 = Kanungo|first3 = Vaira|last3 = Freibergs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ochsner2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ochsner|first1=Kevin N.|title=Are affective events richly recollected or simply familiar? The experience and process of recognizing feelings past|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2000|volume=129|issue=2|pages=242–261|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.129.2.242|pmid=10868336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morewedge2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Least Likely of Times How Remembering the Past Biases Forecasts of the Future|url =|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2005|pmid = 16102065|pages = 626–630|volume = 16|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01585.x|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Daniel T.|last2 = Gilbert|first3 = Timothy D.|last3 = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people do not always recognize that the events that they remember are more emotionally intense than the "average" event of its kind. This failure to correct for the atypicality of extreme memories can lead people to believe those extreme moments are representative of the "set" being judged. [[Boston Red Sox]] fans asked to recall any one game they saw when the Red Sox won, for example, tended to recall the best game they could remember. They only realized this game was unrepresentative of past winning games by the Red Sox if they were explicitly asked to recall the best game they could remember, as evidenced by their subsequent [[Affective forecasting|''affective forecasts'']].&lt;ref name="Morewedge2005" /&gt; This bias for more intense emotional experiences is evident in ''[[Nostalgia|nostalgic preferences]]''. People asked to recall a television show or movie from the past tend to recall the most enjoyable show or movie that they can remember, and use this extreme example to rate all shows from its era unless they are also able to spontaneously recall shows or movies that are worse than the first show or movie they remember.&lt;ref name=Morewedge2013&gt;{{Cite journal|title = It Was a Most Unusual Time: How Memory Bias Engenders Nostalgic Preferences|url = |journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date = 2013|pages = 319–326|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/bdm.1767|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recency bias in memory (i.e., why the end is memorable) ===
People exhibit serial position effects such that they have better memory for ''both'' the beginning and end of sequences, phenomena known as [[Primacy effect|primacy bias]] and [[recency bias]], respectively. A paper by Garbinsky, Morewedge, and Shiv (2014) found evidence that for extended hedonic experiences, better memory for the end of the experience than the beginning (recency &gt; primacy) can be attributed to memory [[Interference theory|interference effects]].&lt;ref name=Garbinsky2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interference of the End Why Recency Bias in Memory Determines When a Food Is Consumed Again|url = |journal = Psychological Science|date = 2014|pmid = 24894582|pages = 1466–1474|volume = 25|issue = 7|doi = 10.1177/0956797614534268|first = Emily N.|last = Garbinsky|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Baba|last3 = Shiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a person eats potato chips, for example, the formation of a new memory of the most recently eaten chip makes it harder for them to recall how the previously eaten chips tasted. Garbinsky and colleagues found that (1) recency effects better predicted recalled enjoyment of a small meal (e.g., eating 5 or 15 chips) than did primacy effects, (2) that people had a worse memory for the first bite of the meal than the last bite of the meal, but (3) providing people with their ratings of the first bite lead them to use their enjoyment of that first bite as much as their enjoyment of the last bite when rating their overall enjoyment of the meal.

==Applications==

===Business===
Since most consumer interactions have set beginnings and ends, they fit the peak–end model. As a consequence, negative occurrences in any consumer interaction can be counteracted by establishing a firmly positive peak and end. This can be accomplished through playing music customers enjoy, giving out free samples, or paying a clerk to hold the door for patrons as they leave. As Scott Stratten has suggested, "A really great salesperson who helps with an exchange can erase negative experiences along the way. The long wait in line and the bad music in the changing room are forgotten".&lt;ref name="StrattenKramer2012" /&gt; However, as research by Talya Miron-Shatz suggests, retrospective evaluations of day-long experiences do not appear to follow the peak–end rule, which brings into question the applicability of this rule to approximately day-length consumer–business interactions, such as hotel stays.&lt;ref name="boundary_conditions" /&gt;

===Vacations===
In 2006, a study was carried out at the [[University of Canterbury]] in Christchurch, New Zealand, analyzing the implications of the peak–end rule on the perceived happiness experienced on vacations. The study found that participants' remembered overall happiness was approximately predicted by the peak–end rule, although it was actually better predicted by their happiness during the "most memorable or most unusual 24-h period".&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006 /&gt; Still, the duration of a vacation appeared to have negligible effects on remembered happiness.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; The results of the study could be applied to choosing more economical durations for vacations.

===Medical procedures===
The peak–end rule is particularly salient in regard to medical procedures, since it suggests that it is preferable to have longer procedures that include a period of decreased discomfort than to have shorter procedures.&lt;ref name="boundary_conditions" /&gt; In particular, the rule "suggests that the memory of a painful medical treatment is likely to be less aversive if relief from the pain is gradual than if relief is abrupt".&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt; Furthermore, the quality of a remembered procedure can drastically influence medical futures. If people recall necessary but onerous procedures more positively, then they are more likely to return for repeat procedures later in life.
However, factoring the effect of the peak–end rule upon evaluations of medical procedures is problematic, since adding a period of decreasing pain to a procedure is still added pain.  Even though this certainly yields a better memory of the process, the patient still endures more pain than is strictly necessary.&lt;ref name="memories_of_colonoscopy" /&gt; Doctors and patients are forced to confront the choice between objectively less painful forms of treatment and forms of treatment that will be remembered more favorably. Kahneman claims that "it is safe to assume that few patients will agree to expose themselves to pain for the sole purpose of improving a future memory".&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt;

==Criticism==
Critiques of the peak–end rule typically derive from its conflation of a complex mental evaluation into a simplistic framework. A 2008 study found some support for the peak–end rule, but also found that it was "not an outstandingly good predictor" of remembered experiential value, and that the happiness of the most memorable part of an experience predicted remembered happiness better than did the happiness of the peak or of the end.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; Additionally, the extreme effect of peaks fades more rapidly over time, causing peaks to be recalled less positively and troughs recalled less negatively over time. [[Episodic memory]] endures for only a few weeks; at some point, mental accounting shifts over to [[semantic memory]], leading to potential over-valuation of the "end" and diminished weighting of the peak.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Additionally, memories that are available for evaluation may change due to the fading affect associated with memory or differing goals in recall.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; Goal orientation or initial expectations can also affect the weighting of a peak or an end, causing an end to be over-weighted as the culmination of a goal.&lt;ref name="by_moments" /&gt; Finally, Ariely and Carmon have theorized that evaluations of past events are affected by feelings at the time of evaluation.&lt;ref name=ArielyCarmon2000/&gt;

A '''poppy''' is a [[flowering plant]] in the subfamily Papaveroideae of the family [[Papaveraceae]]. Poppies are [[herbaceous plant]]s, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', is the source of the crude drug [[opium]] which contains powerful medicinal [[alkaloid]]s such as [[morphine]] and has been used since ancient times as an [[analgesic]] and [[narcotic]] [[medicine|medicinal]] and [[recreational drug]]. It also produces [[Poppy seed|edible seeds]]. Following the [[trench warfare]] in the poppy fields of [[Flanders]] during [[World War I]], poppies have become a symbol of [[Remembrance Day|remembrance]] of soldiers who have died during wartime.

==Description==
Poppies are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]] or short-lived [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants. Some species are [[monocarpic]], dying after flowering. Poppies can be over a metre tall with flowers up to 15 centimetres across. Flowers of species (not cultivars) have 4 to 6 petals, many [[stamen]]s forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any color and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the [[bud]] and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. In the temperate zones, poppies bloom from spring into early summer.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, J.E., Chadwick, A.F. and Craker L.E.

Elsevier, Amsterdam and New York. {{ISBN|0444996265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most species secrete latex when injured. [[Bee]]s use poppies as a [[pollen source]]. The [[pollen]] of the oriental poppy, ''[[Papaver orientale]]'', is dark blue, that of the field or corn poppy (''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'') is grey to dark green.&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Hodges|title=The pollen loads of the honeybee|year=1952|publisher=Bee Research Association Ltd., London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opium poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', grows wild in eastern and southern Asia, and South Eastern Europe. It is believed that it originated in the Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy. In: Robbelon, G., Downey, R.K., Ashri, A.(eds.), Oil Crops of the World.

[[Image:Lest we forget.jpg|thumb|Poppy (Canadian version) worn on the lapel]]
The flowers of most poppy species are attractive and are widely cultivated as annual or perennial [[ornamental plant]]s. This has resulted in a number of commercially important cultivars, such as the Shirley poppy, a cultivar of ''Papaver rhoeas'' and semi-double or double (flore plena) forms of the opium poppy ''Papaver somniferum'' and oriental poppy (''Papaver orientale''). Poppies of several other genera are also cultivated in gardens. A few species have other uses, principally as sources of drugs and foods. The [[opium poppy]] is widely cultivated and its worldwide production is monitored by international agencies. It is used for production of dried latex and [[opium]], the principal precursor of narcotic and analgesic [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[codeine]]. [[Poppy seeds]] are rich in oil, carbohydrates, calcium and protein. [[Poppyseed oil|Poppy oil]] is often used as cooking oil, salad dressing oil, or in products such as margarine. Poppy oil can also be added to spices for cakes, or breads. Poppy products are also used in different paints, varnishes, and some cosmetics.&lt;ref name="Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393"&gt;Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy.

=== Medicine ===
Ancient Egyptian doctors would have their patients eat seeds from a poppy to relieve pain. [[Poppy seed]]s contain small quantities of both morphine and [[codeine]],&lt;ref&gt;Meadway, C., George, S. and Braithwaite, R. (1998) Opiate concentration following the ingestion of poppy seed products – evidence for 'the poppy seed defence'. Forensic Science International 96, 29–38&lt;/ref&gt; which are pain-relieving drugs that are still used today. Poppy seeds and fixed oils can also be nonnarcotic because when they are harvested about twenty days after the flower has opened, the morphine is no longer present.&lt;ref name="Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393" /&gt;

===Advertising===
In Mexico, [[Grupo Modelo]], the makers of [[Corona (beer)|Corona]] beer, used red poppy flowers in most of its advertising images until the 1960s.

Artificial poppies (called "Buddy Poppies") are used in the veterans' aid campaign by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], which provides money to the veterans who assemble the poppies and various aid programs to veterans and their families.&lt;ref name="vfw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vfw.org/index.cfm?fa=cmty.levelc&amp;cid=127|title=Veterans of Foreign Wars Buddy Poppy Website|author=|date=|website=vfw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
Poppies have long been used as a symbol of sleep, peace, and death: Sleep because the opium extracted from them is a sedative, and death because of the common blood-red color of the red poppy in particular. In Greek and Roman myths, poppies were used as offerings to the dead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 173, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poppies used as emblems on [[headstone|tombstones]] symbolize eternal sleep. This symbolism was evoked in the children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', in which a magical poppy field threatened to make the protagonists sleep forever.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

BBC News. Retrieved 6 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
A second interpretation of poppies in [[Classical mythology]] is that the bright scarlet color signifies a promise of resurrection after death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], ''The Greek Myths'', 24. 15 p. 96, {{ISBN|0-14-001026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Remembrance poppy|poppy of wartime remembrance]] is ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'', the red-flowered corn poppy. This poppy is a common [[weed]] in Europe and is found in many locations, including [[Flanders]], which is the setting of the famous poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]" by the Canadian surgeon and soldier [[John McCrae]]. In Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legion.org/troops/216371/legion-family-flower-remembrance|title=Legion Family flower of remembrance|author=|date=|website=The American Legion}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, artificial poppies (plastic in Canada, paper in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Malta and New Zealand) are worn to commemorate those who died in war. This form of commemoration is associated with Remembrance Day, which falls on November 11. In Canada, Australia and the UK, poppies are often worn from the beginning of November through to the 11th, or Remembrance Sunday if that falls on a later date. In New Zealand and Australia, soldiers are also commemorated on ANZAC day (April 25),&lt;ref name="Seal2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Seal|title=Inventing Anzac: the digger and national mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z40eykeP_IMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=18 September 2010|year=2004|publisher=Univ. of Queensland Press|isbn=978-0-7022-3447-7|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the poppy is still commonly worn around Remembrance Day. Wearing of poppies has been a custom since 1924 in the United States. Miss [[Moina Michael]] of Georgia is credited as the founder of the Memorial Poppy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Moina Michael|url=http://www.cal-mum.com/poppy.htm#Moina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BookInc2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=World Book|author2=Inc|title=The World Book dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPW_pTjpeCQC&amp;pg=PA1622|accessdate=18 August 2010|year=2003|publisher=World Book.com|isbn=978-0-7166-0299-6|pages=1622–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United States of America Congressional Record"&gt;{{cite book|title=United States of America Congressional Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbK9zpJ1ipEC&amp;pg=PA10121|accessdate=18 August 2010|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=10121–|id=GGKEY:8F7NFQJ525R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red-flowered poppy is unofficially considered the national flower of the Albanians in Albania, Kosovo and elsewhere. This is due to its red and black colors, the same as the colors of the flag of Albania.

The California poppy, ''[[Eschscholzia californica]]'', is the state flower of California.

The powerful symbolism of ''Papaver rhoeas'' has been borrowed by various advocacy campaigns, such as the [[White Poppy]] and [[Simon Topping]]'s black poppy.

==History and Influence==
''Papaver somniferum'' was domesticated by [[Old Europe (archaeology)|the indigenous people]] of Western and Central Europe between 6000 and 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Jared Diamond]] | date = 1997 | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] | publisher = W W Norton &amp; Co | isbn = 0-393-03891-2 | page = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed that its origins may come from the Sumerian people, where the first use of opium was recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=M J|date=1993-06-15|title=A brief history of opiates, opioid peptides, and opioid receptors.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC46725/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=90|issue=12|pages=5391–5393|issn=0027-8424|pmid=8390660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poppies and opium made made their way around the world along the [[Silk Road|silk road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deamuseum.org/ccp/opium/history.html|title=Opium Poppy: History|website=www.deamuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juglets resembling poppy seed pods have been discovered with trace amounts of opium and the flower appeared in jewelry and on art pieces in Egypt, dated 1550-1292 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3198|title=Brooklyn Museum|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://melbakes.pl/baza-wiedzy/pochodzenie-i-historia-maku/|title=Pochodzenie i historia maku - Baza wiedzy - Melbake's - Najlepsze ziarna|website=melbakes.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eradication of poppy cultivation came about in the early 1900's through international conferences due to safety concerns associated with the production of opium. In the 1970's the American [[war on drugs]] targeted Turkish production of the plant, leading to an more negative popular opinion of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evered|first=Kyle T.|date=7 September 2011|title=Poppies Are Democracy!” A Critical Geopolitics of Opium Eradication and Reintroduction in Turkey|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00098.x|journal=Geographical Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=299–315|doi=10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00098.x|issn=0016-7428|via=Weiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-attentive processing''' is the subconscious accumulation of information from the environment.&lt;ref name="Atienza"&gt;Atienza, M., Cantero, J. L., &amp; Escera, C. (2001). Auditory information processing during human sleep as revealed by event-related brain potentials. Clinical Neurophysiology, 112(11), 2031-2045.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Van der Heijden, A. H. C. (1996). Perception for selection, selection for action, and action for perception. Visual Cognition, 3(4), 357-361.&lt;/ref&gt;  All available information is pre-attentively processed.&lt;ref name="Van" /&gt; Then, the brain filters and processes what is important.  Information that has the highest salience (a stimulus that stands out the most) or relevance to what a person is thinking about is selected for further and more complete analysis by conscious (attentive) processing.&lt;ref name="Atienza" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Van" /&gt; Understanding how pre-attentive processing works is useful in advertising, in education, and for prediction of [[Cognition|cognitive ability]].

== Pure-capture and contingent-capture ==

The reasons are unclear as to why certain information proceeds from pre-attentive to attentive processing while other information does not.  It is generally accepted that the selection involves an interaction between the salience of a stimulus and a person’s current intentions and/or goals.&lt;ref&gt;Egeth, H. E., Yantis, S. (1997). Visual attention: Control, representation, and time course. Annual Review of Psychology, 48, 269-297.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two models of pre-attentive processing are pure-capture and contingent-capture.&lt;ref name="Folk"&gt;Folk, C. L., &amp; Remington, R. (2006). Top-down modulation of preattentive processing: Testing the recovery account of contingent capture. Visual Cognition, 14, 445-465.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The "pure-capture" model focuses on stimulus salience.&lt;ref name="Tollner"&gt;Tollner, T., Zehetleitner, M., Gramann, K., &amp; Muller, H. J. (2010). Top-down weighting of visual dimensions: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence. Vision Research, 50(14), 1372-1381.&lt;/ref&gt; If certain properties of a stimulus stand out from its background, the stimulus has a higher chance of being selected for attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; This is sometimes referred to as "bottom-up" processing, as it is the properties of the stimuli which affect selection. Since things that affect pre-attentive processing do not necessarily correlate with things that affect attention, stimulus salience may be more important than conscious goals. For example, pre-attentive processing is slowed by sleep deprivation while attention, although less focused, is not slowed.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, A., Deouell, L. Y., &amp; Bentin, S. (2001). Is pre-attentive processing compromised by prolonged wakefulness? Effects of total sleep deprivation on the mismatch negativity. Psychophysiology, 38, 787-795.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, when searching for a particular visual stimulus among a variety of visual distractions, people often have more trouble finding what they are looking for if one or more of the distractions is particularly salient.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; For example, it is easier to locate a bright, green circle (which is salient) among distractor circles if they are all grey (a bland color) than it is to locate a green circle among distractor circles if some are red (also salient colour). This is thought to occur because the salient red circles attract our attention away from the target green circle. However, this is difficult to prove because when given a target (like the green circle) to search for in a laboratory experiment, participants may generalize the task to searching for anything that stands out, rather than solely searching for the target.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; If this happens, the conscious goal becomes finding anything that stands out, which would direct the person’s attention towards red distractor circles as well as the green target. This means that a person’s goal, rather than the salience of the stimuli, could be causing the delayed ability to find the target.

The "contingent-capture" model emphasizes the idea that a person’s current intentions and/or goals affect the speed and efficiency of pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; The brain directs an individual’s attention towards stimuli with features that fit in with their goals. Consequently, these stimuli will be processed faster at the pre-attentive stage and will be more likely to be selected for attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Tollner" /&gt; Since this model focuses on the importance of conscious processes (rather than properties of the stimulus itself) in selecting information for attentive processing, it is sometimes called "top-down" selection.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt;  In support of this model, it has been shown that a target stimulus can be located faster if it is preceded by the presentation of a similar, priming stimulus.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; For example, if an individual is shown the color green and then required to find a green circle among distractors, the initial exposure to the color will make it easier to find the green circle. This is because they are already thinking about and envisioning the color green, so when it shows up again as the green circle, their brain readily directs its attention towards it. This suggests that processing an initial stimulus speeds up a person’s ability to select a similar target from pre-attentive processing. However, it could be that the speed of pre-attentive processing itself is not affected by the first stimulus, but rather that people are simply able to quickly abandon dissimilar stimuli, enabling them to re-engage to the correct target more quickly.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; This would mean that the difference in reaction time occurs at the attentive level, after pre-attentive processing and stimulus selection has already taken place.

== Vision ==
Information for pre-attentive processing is detected through the five senses. In the visual system, the receptive fields at the back of the eye ([[retina]]) transfer the image via [[axon|axons]] to the [[thalamus]], specifically the [[lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Meng"&gt;Meng, X., &amp; Wang, Z. (2009). A pre-attentive model of biological vision. IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, 3, 154-158.&lt;/ref&gt;  The image then travels to the [[visual cortex|primary visual cortex]] and continues on to be processed by the [[visual cortex|visual association cortex]].  At each stage, the image is processed with increasing complexity.  Pre-attentive processing starts with the [[retina]]l image; this image is magnified as it moves from [[retina]] to the cortex of the brain.&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt;  Shades of light and dark are processed in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate nuclei]] of the [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt;  Simple and complex cells in the brain process boundary and surface information by deciphering the image's contrast, orientation, and edges.&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt;  When the image hits the [[fovea centralis|fovea]], it is highly magnified, facilitating object recognition. The images in the [[peripheral vision|periphery]] are less clear but help to create a complete image used for scene perception.&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. A., Carney, T., Barghout-Stein, L., &amp; Tyler, C. W. (1997, June). Seven models of masking. In Electronic Imaging'97 (pp. 13-24). International Society for Optics and Photonics. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Barghout-Stein, Lauren. On differences between peripheral and foveal pattern masking. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 1999. &lt;/ref&gt;

Visual scene segmentation is a pre-attentive process where stimuli are grouped together into specific objects against a background.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum"&gt;Appelbaum, L. G., &amp; Norcia, A. M. (2009). Attentive and pre-attentive aspects of figural processing. Journal of Vision, 9(11), 1-12. {{doi|10.1167/9.11.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure and background regions of an image activate different processing centres: figures use the [[occipital lobe|lateral occipital areas]] (which involve object processing) and background engages dorso-medial areas.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kourtzi, Z., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (2000). Cortical regions involved in perceiving object shape. Journal of Neuroscience, 20, 3310-3318.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Visual pre-attentive processing uses a distinct memory mechanism.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher"&gt;Krummenacher, J., Grubert, A., &amp; Müller, H. J. (2010). Inter-trial and redundant-signals effects in visual search and discrimination tasks: Separable pre-attentive and post-selective effects. Vision Research, 50(14), 1382-1395. {{doi|10.1016/j.visres.2010.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a stimulus is presented consecutively, the stimulus is perceived at a faster rate than if different stimuli are presented consecutively.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt;  The theory behind this is called the dimension-weighting account (DWA) where each time a specific stimulus (i.e. color) is presented it contributes to the weight of the stimuli.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt; More presentations increase the weight of the stimuli, and therefore, subsequently decrease the reaction time to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt;  The dimensional-weighting system, which calculates pre-attentive processing for our visual system, codes the stimulus and thus directs attention to the stimulus with the most weight.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt; 

Visual pre-attentive processing is also involved in the perception of emotion.&lt;ref name="Balconi"&gt;Balconi, M., &amp; Mazza, G. (2009). Consciousness and emotion: ERP modulation and attentive vs. pre-attentive elaboration of emotional facial expressions by backward masking. Springer Science, 33, 113-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Human beings are social creatures and are very adept at critiquing facial expressions.  We have the ability to unconsciously process emotional stimuli and equate the stimuli, such as a face, with meaning.&lt;ref name="Balconi" /&gt;

== Audition ==
The auditory system is also very important in accumulating information for pre-attentive processing. When a person’s eardrum is struck by incoming sound waves, it vibrates. This sends messages, via the [[cochlear nerve|auditory nerve]], to the brain for pre-attentive processing. The ability to adequately filter information from pre-attentive processing to attentive processing is necessary for the normal development of social skills.&lt;ref name="Seri"&gt;Seri, S., Pisani, F., Thai, J. N., &amp; Cerquiglini, A. (2007). Pre-attentive auditory sensory processing in autistic spectrum disorder. Are electromagnetic measurements telling us a coherent story? International Journal of Psychophysiology, 63(2), 159-163.&lt;/ref&gt; For acoustic pre-attentive processing, the [[temporal lobe|temporal cortex]] was believed to be the main site of activation, however, recent evidence has indicated involvement of the [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] as well.&lt;ref name="Habermeyer"&gt;Habermeyer, B., Herdener, M., Esposito, F., Hilti, C. C., Klarhofer, M., di Salle, F., Wetzel, S., et al. (2009). Neural correlates of pre-attentive processing of pattern deviance in professional musicians. Human Brain Mapping, 30, 3736-3747.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klamer"&gt;Klamer, D., Svensson, L., Fejgin, K., &amp; Palson, E. (2011). Prefrontal NMDA receptor antagonism reduces impairments in pre-attentive information processing. European Neuropsychopharmacology, 21(3), 248-253.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] is predominantly associated with attentional processing, but it may also be involved in pre-attentive processing of complex and/or salient acoustic stimuli.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermeyer" /&gt;  For example, detecting slight variations in complex musical patterns has been shown to activate the right ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Habermeyer" /&gt;

It has been shown that in acoustic pre-attentive processing there is some degree of [[lateralization of brain function|lateralization]].&lt;ref name="Zaehle"&gt;Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Herrmann, C. S., Meyer, M. (2009). Pre-attentive spectro-temporal feature processing in the human auditory system. Brain Topography, 22, 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt; The left hemisphere responds more to temporal acoustic information whereas the right hemisphere responds to the frequency of auditory information.&lt;ref name="Zaehle" /&gt;  Also, there is [[lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] in the perception of speech which is left hemisphere dominant for pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref&gt;Sorokin, A., Alku, P., &amp; Kujala, T. (2010). Change and novelty detection in speech and non-speech sound streams. Brain Research, 1327, 77-90. {{doi|10.1016/j.brainres.2010.02.052}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multisensory integration ==
	Vision, sound, smell, touch, and taste are processed together pre-attentively when more than one sensory stimuli are present.&lt;ref name="Fairhall"&gt;Fairhall, S. L., &amp; Macaluso, E. (2009). Spatial attention can modulate audiovisual integration at multiple cortical and subcortical sites. European Journal of Neuroscience, 29, 1247-1257.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[multisensory integration]] increases activity in the [[superior temporal sulcus]] (STS), [[thalamus]], and [[superior colliculus]].&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;  Specifically, the pre-attentive process of [[multisensory integration]] works jointly with attention to activate brain regions such as the [[superior temporal sulcus|STS]].&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;  [[Multisensory integration]] seems to give a person the advantage of greater comprehension if both auditory and visual stimuli are being processed together.&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;  But it is important to note that [[multisensory integration]] is affected by what a person pays attention to and their current goals.&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;

== Plasticity ==
	Training can lead to changes in activity and brain structures involved in pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Habermeyer"/&gt; Professional musicians, in particular, show larger ERP ([[Event-related potential]]) responses to deviations in auditory stimuli and have possibly related structural differences in their brains ([[transverse temporal gyrus|Heschl’s gyrus]], [[corpus callosum]], and [[corticospinal tract|pyramidal tracts]]).&lt;ref name="Habermeyer" /&gt;  This plasticity of pre-attentive processing has also been shown in perception.  Using EEG ([[electroencephalography]]) methods in pre-attentive colour perception, a study observed how easy it was for bilinguals to adapt to the linguistic constructs of a different culture.&lt;ref name="Athanasopoulos"&gt;Athanasopoulos, P., Dering, B., Wiggett, A., Kuipers, J., &amp; Thierry, G. (2010). Perceptual shift in bilingualism: Brain potentials reveal plasticity in pre-attentive colour perception. ''Cognition'', 116(3), 437-443. {{doi|10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that pre-attentive processes are not hard-wired but malleable.&lt;ref name="Athanasopoulos" /&gt;

== Deficits ==
Deficits in the transition from pre-attentive processing to attentive processing are associated with disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[autism]].&lt;ref name="Seri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tales"&gt;Tales, A., Haworth, J., Wilcock, G., Newton, P., &amp; Butler, S. (2008). Visual mismatch negativity highlights abnormal pre-attentive visual processing in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychologia, 46(5), 1224-1232.&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormal [[prefrontal cortex]] function in [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] results in the inability to use pre-attentive processing to recognize familiar auditory stimuli as non-threatening.&lt;ref name="Klamer" /&gt;  [[schizophrenia|Schizophrenics]] with positive symptoms have a greater capability of pre-attentively processing emotionally negative odors.&lt;ref name="Pause"&gt;Pause, B. M., Hellman, G., Goder, R., Aldenhoff, J. B., &amp; Ferstl, R. (2008). Increased processing speed for emotionally negative odors in schizophrenia. International Journal of Psychophysiology,  70, 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This heightened ability to distinguish odors seems to be involved in their hypersensitivity to threatening situations.&lt;ref name="Pause" /&gt; [[Alzheimer's disease]] is typically thought to affect high-level brain functioning (like memory) but can also have negative impacts on visual pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Tales" /&gt; Some of the difficulties with social interaction seen in [[autism|autistics]] may be due to an impairment in filtration of pre-attentive auditory information.&lt;ref name="Seri" /&gt; For example, they often have difficulty following a conversation as they cannot distinguish which parts are important and are easily distracted by other sounds.

'''Privacy-invasive software''' is [[computer software]] that ignores [[user (computing)|user]]s’ [[privacy]] and that is distributed with a specific intent, often of a [[commerce|commercial]] nature. Three typical examples of privacy-invasive software are [[adware]], [[spyware]] and [[content hijacking]] programs.

== Background ==
In a digital setting, such as the Internet, there are a wide variety of [[data privacy|privacy]] threats. These vary from the tracking of user activity (sites visited, items purchased etc.), to [[mass marketing]] based on the retrieval of personal information ([[spam (electronic)|spam]] offers and [[telemarketing]] calls are more common than ever), to the distribution of information on lethal technologies used for, e.g., acts of [[terrorism|terror]].

Today, software-based privacy-invasions occur in numerous aspects of Internet usage. [[Spyware]] programs set to collect and distribute user information secretly download and execute on users’ workstations. [[Adware]] displays [[advertising|advertisements]] and other commercial content often based upon personal information retrieved by spyware programs. System monitors record various actions on computer systems. [[Keylogger]]s record users’ keystrokes in order to monitor user behavior. Self-replicating malware downloads and spreads disorder in systems and networks. Data-harvesting software programmed to gather [[e-mail]] addresses have become conventional features of the Internet, which among other things results in that spam e-mail messages fill networks and computers with unsolicited commercial content. With those threats in mind, we hereby define privacy-invasive software as:

== Definition ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::{{cquote|''Privacy-invasive software is a category of software that ignores users’ right to be left alone and that is distributed with a specific intent, often of a commercial nature, which negatively affect[s] its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldt|first1=Martin|title=Privacy-Invasive Software Exploring Effects and Countermeasures|journal=Blekinge Institute of Technology Licentiate Dissertation Series|date=2007|volume=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this context, ''ignoring users’ right to be left alone'' means that the software is unsolicited and that it does not permit users to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent personally identifiable data is gathered, stored or processed by the software. ''Distributed'' means that it has entered the computer systems of users from (often unknown) [[server (computing)|server]]s placed on the [[Internet]] infrastructure. ''Often of a commercial nature'' means that the software (regardless of type or quality) is used as a tool in some sort of a commercial plan to gain revenues.

== Problem with the spyware concept ==

In early 2000, [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] formulated the first description of [[spyware]] after realizing software that stole his personal information had been installed on his computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Gibson | title=GRC  OptOut -- Internet Spyware Detection and Removal | publisher=[[Gibson Research Corporation]] | url=http://www.grc.com/optout.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition reads as follows:

::{{cquote|''Spyware is any software which employs a user’s Internet connection in the background (the so-called ‘backchannel’) without their knowledge or explicit permission.''}}

This definition was valid in the beginning of the spyware evolution. However, as the spyware concept evolved over the years it attracted new kinds of behaviours. As these behaviours grew both in number and in diversity, the term spyware became hollowed out. This evolution resulted in that a great number of synonyms sprang up, e.g. thiefware, scumware, trackware, and [[badware]]. It is believed that the lack of a single standard definition of spyware depends on the diversity in all these different views on what really should be included, or as Aaron Weiss put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Weiss | first=A. | title=Spyware Be Gone | work=ACM netWorker |volume=9 |issue=1 | place=ACM Press, New York, USA | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::{{cquote|''What the old-school intruders have going for them is that they are relatively straightforward to define. Spyware, in its broadest sense, is harder to pin down. Yet many feel, as the late Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said, ‘I know it when I see it.’.''}}

Despite this vague comprehension of the essence in spyware, all descriptions include two central aspects. The degree of associated user [[consent]], and the level of negative impact they impair on the user and their computer system (further discussed in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5 in {{Harv |Boldt|2007a}}). Because of the diffuse understanding in the spyware concept, recent attempts to define it have been forced into compromises. The [[Anti-Spyware Coalition]] (ASC) which is constituted by public interest groups, trade associations, and anti-spyware companies, have come to the conclusion that the  term spyware should be used at two different abstraction levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=ASC | title=Anti-Spyware Coalition | url=http://www.antispywarecoalition.org | date = 2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the low level they use the following definition, which is similar to Steve Gibson’s original one:

::{{cquote|''In its narrow sense, Spyware is a term for tracking software deployed without adequate notice, consent, or control for the user.''}}

However, since this definition does not capture all the different types of spyware available they also provide a wider definition, which is more abstract in its appearance:

::{{cquote|''In its broader sense, spyware is used as a synonym for what the ASC calls ‘Spyware (and Other Potentially Unwanted Technologies)’. Technologies deployed without appropriate user consent and/or implemented in ways that impair user control over:
1) Material changes that affect their user experience, privacy, or system security; &lt;br /&gt;
2) Use of their system resources, including what programs are installed on their computers; and/or &lt;br /&gt;
3) Collection, use, and distribution of their personal or other sensitive information.''}}

Difficulties in defining spyware, forced the ASC to define what they call ''Spyware (and Other Potentially Unwanted Technologies)'' instead. This includes any software that does not have the users’ appropriate consent for running on their computers. Another group that has tried to define spyware is a group called [[StopBadware|StopBadware.org]], which consists of actors such as [[Harvard Law School]], [[Oxford university|Oxford University]], [[Google]], [[Lenovo]], and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=StopBadware.org | title=StopBadware.org | url=http://www.stopbadware.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their result is that they do not use the term spyware at all, but instead introduce the term ''badware''. Their definition thereof span over seven pages, but the essence looks as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=StopBadware.org Guidelines |title=StopBadware.org Software Guidelines |url=http://www.stopbadware.org/home/guidelines |work=StopBadware.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001515/http://www.stopbadware.org/home/guidelines |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::{{cquote|''An application is badware in one of two cases:
1) If the application acts deceptively or irreversibly. &lt;br /&gt;
2) If the application engages in potentially objectionable behaviour without: first, prominently disclosing to the user that it will engage in such 
behaviour, in clear and non-technical language, and then obtaining the user's affirmative consent to that aspect of the application.''}}

Both definitions from ASC and StopBadware.org show the difficulty with defining spyware. We therefore regard the term spyware at two different abstraction levels. On the lower level it can be defined according to Steve Gibsons original definition. However, in its broader and in a more abstract sense the term spyware is hard to properly define, as concluded above.

== Introducing the term, &amp;#8220;privacy-invasive software&amp;#8221; ==
A joint conclusion is that it is important, for both software vendors and users, that a clear separation between acceptable and unacceptable software behaviour is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Bruce | first=J. | title=Defining Rules for Acceptable Adware | work=Proceedings of the 15th Virus Bulletin Conference | place=Dublin, Ireland | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Sipior | first=J.C. | title=A United States Perspective on the Ethical and Legal Issues of Spyware | work=Proceedings of 7th International Conference on Electronic Commerce | place=Xian, China | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is the subjective nature of many spyware programs included, which result in inconsistencies between different users beliefs, i.e. what one user regards as legitimate software could be regarded as a spyware by others. As the spyware concept came to include increasingly more types of programs, the term got hollowed out, resulting in several synonyms, such as trackware, evilware and badware, all negatively emotive. We therefore choose to introduce the term ''privacy-invasive software'' to encapsulate all such software. We believe this term to be more descriptive than other synonyms without having as negative connotation. Even if we use the word ''invasive'' to describe such software, we believe that an invasion of [[privacy]] can be both desired and beneficial for the user as long as it is fully [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]], e.g. when implementing specially user-tailored services or when including personalization features in software. [[File:Privacy-Invasive Software Classification.png|thumb|300px|right|A three-by-three matrix classification of privacy-invasive software showing legitimate, spyware and malicious software. {{Harv|Boldt|2010|p=110}}]]

The work by Warkentins et al. (described in Section 7.3.1 in {{Harv |Boldt|2007a}}) can be used as a starting point when developing a classification of privacy-invasive software, where we classify privacy-invasive software as a combination between ''user consent'' and ''direct negative consequences''. User consent is specified as either ''low'', ''medium'' or ''high'', while the degree of direct negative consequences span between ''tolerable'', ''moderate'', and ''severe''. This classification allows us to first make a distinction between legitimate software and spyware, and secondly between spyware and malicious software. All software that has a low user consent, ''or'' which impairs severe direct negative consequences should be regarded as malware. While, on the other hand, any software that has high user consent, ''and'' which results in tolerable direct negative consequences should be regarded as legitimate software. By this follows that spyware constitutes the remaining group of software, i.e. those that have medium user consent or which impair moderate direct negative consequences. This classification is described in further detail in Chapter 7 in {{Harv |Boldt|2007a}}.

In addition to the direct negative consequences, we also introduce ''indirect negative consequences''. By doing so our classification distinguishes between any negative behaviour a program has been designed to carry out (direct negative consequences) and security threats introduced by just having that software executing on the system (indirect negative consequences). One example of an indirect negative consequence is the exploitation risk of [[Software vulnerability|software vulnerabilities]] in programs that execute on users’ systems without their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Saroiu | first=S. | last2=Gribble | first2=S.D. | last3=Levy | first3=H.M. | title=Measurement and Analysis of Spyware in a University Environment | work=Proceedings of the 1st Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) | place=San Francisco, USA | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to malware ==
The term privacy-invasive software is motivated in that software types such as adware and spyware are essentially often defined according to their actions instead of their distribution mechanisms (as with most malware definitions, which also rarely correspond to motives of, e.g., business and commerce). The overall intention with the concept of privacy-invasive software is consequently to convey the commercial aspect of unwanted software contamination. The threats of privacy-invasive software consequently do not find their roots in totalitarianism, malice or political ideas, but rather in the free market, advanced technology and the unbridled exchange of electronic information. By the inclusion of purpose in its definition, the term privacy-invasive software is a contribution to the research community of privacy and security.

== History ==

=== Internet goes commercial ===
In the mid-1990s, the development of the Internet increased rapidly due to the interest from the general public. One important factor behind this accelerating increase was the 1993 release of the first browser, called [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Andreessen | first=M. | title=NCSA Mosaic Technical Summary | publisher=National Center for Supercomputing Applications | place=USA | year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the birth of the graphically visible part of the Internet known as the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) that was introduced in 1990.  Commercial interests became well aware of the potential offered by the WWW in terms of electronic commerce especially because the restrictions on the commercial use of the Internet were removed which opened the space for companies to use the web as a platform to advertise and sell their goods. Thus, shortly after, companies selling goods over the Internet emerged, i.e. pioneers such as book dealer [[Amazon.com]] and CD retailer [[CDNow|CDNOW.com]], which both were founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Rosenberg | first=R.S. | title=The Social Impact of Computers | edition=3rd | publisher= Place=Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego CA | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the following years, personal computers and [[broadband]] connections to the Internet became more commonplace. Also, the increased use of the Internet resulted in that [[e-commerce]] transactions involved considerable amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Abhijit | first=C. | last2= Kuilboer | first2=J.P. | title=E-Business &amp; E-Commerce Infrastructure: Technologies Supporting the E-Business Initiative | publisher=McGraw Hill | place= Columbus, USA | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As competition over customers intensified, some e-commerce companies turned to questionable methods in their battle to entice customers into completing transactions with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=CDT | title=Following the Money | publisher=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology | url=https://www.cdt.org/files/privacy/20060320adware.pdf | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Shukla | first=S. | last2=Nah | first2=F.F. | title=Web Browsing and Spyware Intrusion | work=Communications of the ACM | volume=48 |issue=8 | pages=85 | place=New York, USA | year=2005 | doi = 10.1145/1076211.1076245}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened ways for illegitimate actors to gain revenues by stretching the limits used with methods for collecting personal information and for propagating commercial advertisements. Buying such services allowed for some e-commerce companies to get an advantage over their competitors, e.g. by using advertisements based on unsolicited commercial messages (also known as [[E-mail spam|spam]]) {{Harv |Jacobsson|2004}}.

=== Commercially motivated adverse software ===
The use of questionable techniques, such as [[Spam (electronic)|Spam]], were not as destructive as the more traditional malicious techniques, e.g. [[computer virus]]es or [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]. Compared to such malicious techniques the new ones differed in two fundamental ways. First, they were not necessarily illegal, and secondly, their main goal was gaining money instead of creating publicity for the creator by reaping digital havoc. Therefore, these techniques grouped as a “grey”{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}area next to the already existing “dark”{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} side of the Internet.

Behind this development stood advertisers that understood that Internet was a “merchant’s utopia”,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} offering huge potential in global advertising coverage at a relatively low cost. By using the Internet as a global notice board, e-commerce companies could market their products through advertising agencies that delivered [[online ads]] to the masses. In 2004, online advertisement yearly represented between $500 million and $2 billion markets, which in 2005 increased to well over $6 billion-a-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=McFedries | first=P. | title=The Spyware Nightmare | publisher=in IEEE Spectrum, Volume 42, Issue 8 | place=Nebraska, USA | year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Zhang | first=X. | title=What Do Consumers Really Know About Spyware? | publisher=ACM | work=Communications of the ACM | volume=48 |issue=8 | pages=44 | year=2005 | doi = 10.1145/1076211.1076238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger online advertising companies report annual revenues in excess of $50 million each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=CNET | title=The Money Game: How Adware Works and How it is Changing | publisher=CNET Anti Spyware Workshop, San Francisco, US | place= | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of this development such companies distributed their ads in a [[broadcast]]-like manner, i.e. they were not streamlined towards individual users’ interests. Some of these ads were served directly on Web sites as banner ads, but dedicated programs, called [[adware]], soon emerged. Adware were used to display ads through [[pop-up ad|pop-up]] windows without depending on any Internet access or Web pages.

=== The birth of spyware ===
In the search for more effective advertising strategies, these companies soon discovered the potential in ads that were targeted towards user interests. Once targeted online ads started to appear, the development took an unfortunate turn. Now, some advertisers developed software that became known as [[spyware]], collecting users’ personal interests, e.g. through their [[Internet privacy#Browsing profiles|browsing habits]]. Over the coming years spyware would evolve into a significant new threat to Internet-connected computers, bringing along reduced system performance and security. The information gathered by spyware were used for constructing user profiles, including personal interests, detailing what users could be persuaded to buy. The introduction of online advertisements also opened a new way to fund software development by having the software display advertisements to its users. By doing so the software developer could offer their software “free of charge”, since they were paid by the advertising agency. Unfortunately, many users did not understand the difference between “free of charge” and a “free gift”, where difference is that a free gift is given without any expectations of future compensation, while something provided free of charge expects something in return. A dental examination that is provided free of charge at a dentist school is not a free gift. The school expects gained training value and as a consequence the customer suffers increased risks. As adware were combined with spyware, this became a problem for computer users. When downloading software described as “free of charge” the users had no reason to suspect that it would report on for instance their Internet usage, so that presented advertisements could be targeted towards their interests.
 
Some users probably would have accepted to communicate their browsing habits because of the positive feedback, e.g. “offers” relevant to their interests. However, the fundamental problem was that users were not properly informed about neither the occurrence nor the extent of such monitoring, and hence were not given a chance to decide on whether to participate or not. As advertisements became targeted, the borders between adware and spyware started to dissolve, combining both these programs into a single one, that both monitored users and delivered targeted ads. The fierce competition soon drove advertisers to further “enhance” the ways used for serving their ads, e.g. replacing user-requested content with sponsored messages instead, before showing it to the users.

=== The arms-race between spyware vendors ===
As the chase for faster financial gains intensified, several competing advertisers turned to use even more illegitimate methods in an attempt to stay ahead of their competitors. This targeted advertising accelerated the whole situation and created a “gray” between conventional adds that people chose to see, such as subscribing to an Internet site &amp; adds pushed on users through "pop-up adds" or downloaded adds displayed in a program itself.
&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/privacy-invasive-software |title=Privacy Invasive Software in SpyWareLoop.com |author=Vincentas |newspaper=''Spyware Loop'' |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013525/http://www.spywareloop.com/news/privacy-invasive-software |archivedate=9 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This practice pushed Internet advertising closer to the “dark” side of Spam &amp; other types of invasive, privacy compromising advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Görling | first=S. | title=An Introduction to the Parasite Economy | publisher=In Proceedings of EICAR | place=Luxemburg | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this development, users experienced infections from unsolicited software that crashed their computers by accident, change application settings, harvested personal information, and deteriorated their computer experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pew |first=Internet |title=The Threat of Unwanted Software Programs is Changing the Way People use the Internet |work=PIP Spyware Report July 05 |publisher=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Spyware_Report_July_05.pdf |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713160443/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Spyware_Report_July_05.pdf |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time these problems led to the introduction of countermeasures in the form of anti-spyware tools.

These tools purported to clean computers from spyware, adware, and any other type of shady software located in that same “gray” area. This type of software can lead to false positives as some types of legitimate software came to be branded by some users as "Spyware" (i.e. Spybot: Search &amp; Destroy identifies the ScanSpyware program as a Spybot.) These tools were designed similarly to anti-[[malware]] tools, such as [[antivirus software]]. Anti-spyware tools identify programs using signatures (semantics, program code, or other identifying attributes). The process only works on known programs, which can lead to the false positives mentioned earlier &amp; leave previously unknown spyware undetected. To further aggravate the situation, a few especially illegitimate companies distributed fake anti-spyware tools in their search for a larger piece of the online advertising market. These fake tools claimed to remove spyware, but instead installed their own share of adware and spyware on unwitting users’ computers. Sometimes even accompanied by the functionality to remove adware and spyware from competing vendors. Anti-Spyware has become a new area of online vending with fierce competition.

New spyware programs are being added to the setting in what seems to be a never-ending stream, although the increase has levelled out somewhat over the last years. However, there still does not exist any consensus on a common spyware definition or classification, which negatively affects the accuracy of anti-spyware tools. As mentioned above, some spyware programs remain undetected on users' computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Good | first=N. | title=User Choices and Regret: Understanding Users’ Decision Process about Consentually Acquired Spyware | publisher=I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society, Volume 2, Issue 2 | place=Columbus, USA | year=2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=MTL | title=AntiSpyware Comparison Reports | publisher=Malware-Test Lab | place=http://www.malware-test.com/antispyware.html | year=2006}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers of anti-spyware programs officially state that the fight against spyware is more complicated than the fight against [[computer virus|viruses]], [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], and [[computer worm|worms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Webroot |title=Differences between Spyware and Viruses |publisher=Webroot Software |work=Spysweeper.com |url=http://research.spysweeper.com/differences.html |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001180224/http://research.spysweeper.com/differences.html |archivedate=2007-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicted future development ==
There are several trends integrating computers and software into people’s daily lives. One example is traditional media-oriented products which are being integrated into a single device, called [[Home theater PC|media centres]]. These media centres include the same functionality as conventional television, [[DVD]]-players, and stereo equipment, but combined with an Internet connected computer. In a foreseeable future these media centres are anticipated to reach vast consumer impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=CES | title=International Consumer Electronics Association | url=http://www.cesweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Newman | first=M.W. | title=Recipes for Digital Living | work=IEEE Computer | place=Vol. 39, Issue 2 | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this setting, spyware could monitor and surveillance for instance what television channels are being watched, when/why users change channel or what [[DVD]] movies users have purchased and watch. This is information that is highly attractive for any advertising or media-oriented corporation to obtain. This presents us with a probable scenario where spyware is tailored towards these new platforms; the technology needed is to a large extent the same as is used in spyware today.

Another interesting area for spyware vendors is the increasing amount of mobile devices being shipped. Distributors of advertisements have already turned their eyes to these devices. So far this development have not utilized the geographic position data stored in these devices. However, during the time of this writing companies are working on [[GPS]]-guided ads and coupons destined for mobile phones and hand-held devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Business 2.0 Magazine | title=20 Smart Companies to Start Now | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/09/01/8384349/index.htm | date=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, development of location-based marketing that allow advertising companies to get access to personal geographical data so that they can serve geographically dependent ads and coupons to their customers. Once such geographic data is being harvested and correlated with already accumulated personal information, another privacy barrier has been crossed.

The '''Revised NEO Personality Inventory''' ('''NEO PI-R''') is a [[Personality test|personality inventory]] that examines a person's [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] personality traits ([[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]]).  In addition, the NEO PI-R also reports on six subcategories of each Big Five personality trait (called [[facet (psychology)|facets]]).

Historically, development of the Revised NEO PI-R began in 1978 with the publication of a personality inventory by [[Paul Costa Jr|Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|McCrae]].  These researchers published three updated versions of their personality inventory in 1985, 1990, and 2010 which are called the '''NEO PI''', NEO PI-R (or Revised NEO PI), and '''NEO PI-3''', respectively. The revised inventories feature updated [[Psychometrics#Standards of quality|norms]].

The inventories have both longer and shorter versions with the full NEO PI-R consisting of 240 items and providing detailed facet scores, whereas the shorter '''NEO-FFI''' (NEO Five-Factor Inventory) has only 60 items (12 per domain).  The test was originally developed for use with adult men and women without overt [[psychopathology]]. It has also been found to be valid for use with children.

==History==
In the 1970s, [[Paul Costa Jr|Paul Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|Robert McCrae]] were researching age-related changes in personality. Costa and McCrae reported that they began by looking for the broad and agreed-upon traits of ''Neuroticism'' (N) and ''Extraversion'' (E), but cluster analyses led them to a third broad trait, ''Openness to Experience'' (O).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = P. T. | last2 = McCrae | first2 = R. R. | year = 1976 | title = Age differences in personality structure: A cluster analytic approach | url = | journal = Journal of Gerontology | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 564–570 | pmid = 950450 | doi=10.1093/geronj/31.5.564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of the inventory, which was published in 1978, included only those three factors. The inventory was then called the '''Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Inventory''' ('''NEO-I'''). This version would be included in the Augmented Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED292030.pdf|title = Normal human aging: The Baltimore longitudinal study of aging|last = Shock|first = Nathan W.|date = 1984|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = Greulich|first2 = Richard C.|last3 = Costa|first3 = Paul T.|last4 = Andres|first4 = Reubin|last5 = Lakatta|first5 = Edward G.|last6 = Arenberg|first6 = David|last7 = Tobin|first7 = Jordan D.|location = Bethesda, MD|publisher = National Institute of Health|type = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on data from the Baltimore study, Costa and McCrae recognized two additional factors: ''Agreeableness'' (A) and ''Conscientiousness'' (C).&lt;ref name="Costa, P. T. 1985"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The NEO personality inventory manual|last = Costa|first = Paul T.|date = 1985|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |first2 = Robert R.|last2 = McCrae|location = Odessa, FL|publisher = Psychological Assessment Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in 1985 they published the first manual for the NEO that included all five factors, which are now known as the Big Five personality traits. Costa and McCrae renamed their instrument the '''NEO Personality Inventory''' ('''NEO PI'''). In this version, "NEO" was now considered part of the name of the test and was no longer an acronym. The assessment at this time included six [[Facet (psychology)|facet]] sub-scales for the three original factors (N, E, &amp; O).&lt;ref name="Costa, P. T. 1985"/&gt; This naming convention continued with the third version, with the '''Revised NEO Personality Inventory''', published in 1990,{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}} being referred to as '''NEO PI-R'''.

Research began to accumulate that indicated that the five factors were sufficiently broad and useful. There were also calls for a more detailed view of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The optimal level of measurement for personality constructs|last = Briggs|first = S. R.|publisher = Springer-Verlag|year = 1989|isbn = |location = NY|pages = 246–260|work = Personality psychology: Recent trends and emerging directions|editor-last = Buss|editor-first = D. M.|editor2-last = Cantor|editor2-first = N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Costa and McCrae published a Revised NEO manual which included six facets for each factor (30 in total).&lt;ref name="Costa, P. T. 1992 PI"&gt;Costa, P. T., Jr., &amp; McCrae, R. R. (1992). NEO PI-R professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid- to late-1990s, Costa and McCrae came to understand that some items on the NEO PI-R were outdated or too difficult for many test-takers to understand. Research also began to show that the NEO PI-R had the potential to be used with adolescents and children as young as 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCrae R. R. |author2=Costa P. T. |author3=Martin T. A. | year = 2005 | title = The NEO PI-3: A more readable revised NEO personality inventory | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 261–270 | doi = 10.1207/s15327752jpa8403_05 | pmid = 15907162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of using the NEO with young people led Costa and McCrae in 2002 to administer the NEO PI-R to over 1,900 high school students.&lt;ref name="2010 manual"&gt;McCrae, R. R., &amp; Costa, P. T., Jr., (2010). NEO Inventories: Professional manual. Lutz, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The research identified 48 "problem" items that reflected either participant difficulties with item wording and/or low [[Cronbach's alpha|corrected item total correlations]] (CITCs). Alternative items were developed to replace the "problem" items; the revised instrument was administered to new samples&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt; The NEO PI-R and a revised version of the instrument were administered to 500 adolescents, 635 adults, and 449 middle school age children (12-13 year old).&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt; For both the adolescent and adult sample, the item/facet correlations were higher for the revised version of the NEO than for NEO PI-R.&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt; In addition, the internal consistency, factor structure, and tests of [[Convergent validity|convergent]] and [[discriminant validity]] suggested that the revised version could be used with middle school children.&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt; Of the original 48 "problem" items, 37 were improved in terms of clarity and/or CITC. In 2005, Costa and McCrae published the latest version of the NEO Inventories, '''NEO PI-3'''. The new version included revisions of 37 items.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; With the creation of the NEO PI-3, Costa and McCrae intended to make the inventory accessible to a wider portion of the population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCrae|first=Robert R.|last2=Martin|first2=Thomas A.|last3=Costa|first3=Paul T.|date=2005-12-01|title=Age Trends and Age Norms for the NEO Personality Inventory-3 in Adolescents and Adults|url=http://asm.sagepub.com/content/12/4/363|journal=Assessment|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=363–373|doi=10.1177/1073191105279724|issn=1073-1911|pmid=16244117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The improved readability of the NEO PI-3 compared to the NEO PI-R allowed the newer measure to be used with younger populations and adults with lower educational levels. Additionally, with the replacement of the 37 items, the psychometric properties of the NEO PI-3 were slightly improved over the NEO PI-R.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to increasing the readability of the NEO PI, the NEO PI-3 added a glossary of less familiar terms to aid in administration.&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt;

==Forms and administration==
In the most recent publication, there are two forms for the NEO, self-report (form S) and observer-report (form R) versions. Both forms consist of 240 items (descriptions of behavior) answered on a five-point [[Likert scale]]. Finally, there is a 60-item inventory, the NEO FFI. There are paper and computer versions of both forms.

The manual reports that administration of the full version should take between 30 and 40 minutes. Costa and McCrae reported that an individual should not be evaluated if more than 40 items are missing. They also state that despite the fact that the assessment is "balanced" to control for the effects of acquiescence and nay-saying, that if more than 150 responses, or fewer than 50 responses, are "agree" or "strongly agree," the results should be interpreted with caution.

Scores can be reported to most test-takers on "Your NEO Summary," which provides a brief explanation of the assessment, and gives the individuals domain levels and a strengths-based description of three levels (high, medium, and low) in each domain. For example, low N reads "Secure, hardy, and generally relaxed even under stressful conditions," whereas high N reads "Sensitive, emotional, and prone to experience feelings that are upsetting." For profile interpretation, facet and domain scores are reported in T scores and are recorded visually as compared to the appropriate norming group.&lt;ref name="Costa, P. T. 1985" /&gt;

==Reliability==
The [[internal consistency]] of the NEO scales was assessed on 1,539 individuals.&lt;ref name="2010 manual"/&gt; The internal consistency of the NEO PI-R was high, at: N = .92, E = .89, O = .87, A = .86, C = .90. The internal consistency of the facet scales ranged from .56 to .81. The internal consistency of the NEO PI-3 was consistent with that of the NEO PI-R, with ''α'' ranging from .89 to .93 for the five domains. Internal consistency coefficient from the facets, with each facet scale comprising fewer items than each of the Big Five scales, were necessarily smaller, ranging from .54 to .83.&lt;ref name="2010 manual"/&gt;

For the NEO FFI (the 60 item domain only version) the internal consistencies reported in the manual were: N = .79, E = .79, O = .80, A = .75, C = .83. In the literature, the NEO FFI is used more often, with investigators using the NEO PI-R usually using the items from just the domains they are interested in. Sherry et al. (2007) found internal consistencies for the FFI to be as follows: N = .85, E = .80, O = .68, A = .75, C = .83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.07.026 | last1 = Sherry | first1 = S.

The NEO has been translated into many languages. The internal consistency coefficients of the domain scores of a translation of the NEO that has been used in the Philippines are satisfactory. The alphas for the domain scores range from .78 to .90,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00207590143000315 | last1 = Church | first1 = A. T. | last2 = Katigbak | first2 = M.

The test-retest reliability of the NEO PI-R has also been found to be satisfactory. The test-retest reliability of an early version of the NEO after 3 months was: N = .87, E = .91, O = .86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0191-8869(83)90146-0 | last1 = McCrae | first1 = R. R. | last2 = Costa | first2 = P. T. | year = 1983 | title = Joint factors in self-reports and ratings: Neuroticism, extraversion and openness to experience | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 245–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The test-retest reliability for over 6 years, as reported in the NEO PI-R manual, was the following: N = .83, E = .82, O = .83, A = .63, C = .79. Costa and McCrae pointed out that these findings not only demonstrate good reliability of the domain scores, but also their stability (among individuals over the age of 30).

== Effect of age ==
Although individual differences (rank-order) tend to be relatively stable in adulthood, there are maturational changes in personality that are common to most people (mean-level changes). Most cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that neuroticism, extraversion, and openness tend to decline, whereas agreeableness and conscientiousness tend to increase during adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Validity==
Costa and McCrae reported in the NEO manual research findings regarding the convergent and discriminant validity of the inventory. Examples of these findings include the following:
* For the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], Introversion is correlated with the NEO [[Facet (psychology)|facet]] Warmth at −0.61, and with the NEO facet Gregariousness at −0.59. Intuition is correlated with the NEO facet Fantasy at 0.43 and with the NEO facet Aesthetics at 0.56. Feeling is correlated with the NEO facet Tender-mindedness at 0.39.
* For the [[Self-Directed Search]] (a personality inventory developed by [[John L. Holland]] for careers work), Artistic is correlated with the NEO facet Aesthetic at 0.56, Investigative is correlated with the NEO facet Ideas at 0.43, and Social is correlated with the NEO facet Tender-mindedness at 0.36.

A number of studies evaluated the [[criterion validity]] of the NEO. For example, Conard (2005) found that Conscientiousness significantly predicted the GPA of college students, over and above using SAT scores alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2004.10.003 | last1 = Conard | first1 = M.

Neuroticism was related to the "emotional exhaustion" dimension of burnout, and Agreeableness, with the "personal accomplishment" burnout dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Critiques==

Critical reviews of the NEO PI-R were published in the 12th edition of the [[Mental Measurements Yearbook]] (MMY). The NEO-Pi-R (which only measures 57% of the known trait variance in the normal personality sphere alone) has been severely criticized both in terms of its factor analytic/construct validity and its psychometric properties.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., Stankov, L., &amp; Cattell, R.B. (1995). Measurement and statistical models in the study of personality and intelligence.  In D.H. Saklofske &amp; M. Zeidner (Eds.), ''International Handbook of Personality and Intelligence'' (pp. 417-446). New York: Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-44749-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (2008).

Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers. {{ISBN|9-781412-946513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widiger criticized the NEO for not controlling for social desirability bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Review of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory|last = Widiger|first = Thomas A.|publisher = Buros Institute of Mental Measurements|year = 1995|isbn = 0-910674-40-X|location = Lincoln, NE|pages = |editor-last = Conoley|editor-first = Jane Close|editor2-last = Impara|editor2-first = James C.|work = The Twelfth Mental Measurements Yearbook|edition = }} Retrieved from Mental Measurements Yearbook database.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that test developers cannot assume participants will be honest, especially in settings where it benefits people to present themselves in a better light (e.g., forensic or personnel settings). Ben-Porath and Waller pointed out that the NEO Inventories could be improved with the addition of controls for dishonesty and social desirability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ben-Porath Y.

Juni, in another review of the NEO PI-R for the MMY, praised the NEO PI-R for including both self- and other-report scales, making it easier for psychologists to corroborate information provided by a client or research participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Review of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory|last = Juni|first = S.|publisher = Buros Institute of Mental Measurements|year = 1995|isbn = 0-910674-40-X|location = Lincoln, NE|pages = |editor-last = Conoley|editor-first = Jane Close|editor2-last = Impara|editor2-first = James C.|work = The Twelfth Mental Measurements Yearbook|edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Juni criticized the NEO PI-R for its conceptualization using the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality. Juni argued that the existence of the FFM was phenomenological and atheoretical, the model gaining popularity as a result of the influence of the authors (McCrae and Costa) in the psychological community. The NEO PI-R has also been criticized because of its market-oriented, proprietary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy Paul, A. (2004). ''The cult of personality: How personality tests are leading us to miseducate our children, mismanage our companies, and misunderstand ourselves''. New York: Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the expense involved in using proprietary personality inventories such as the NEO, other researchers have contributed to the development of the [[International Personality Item Pool]] (IPIP); IPIP items and scales are available free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Lewis|date=1999|title=A broad-bandwidth, public-domain, personality inventory measuring the lower-level facets of several five-factor models.|url=http://projects.ori.org/lrg/PDFs_papers/A%20broad-bandwidth%20inventory.pdf|journal=Personality psychology in Europe|location=Tilburg, The Netherlands|publisher=Tilburg University Press|volume= 7|pages=7–28|via=Lewis R. Goldberg Personality Research Online Full-Text Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative versions==

A shortened version of NEO PI-R has been published. The shortened version is the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). It comprises 60 items and is designed to take 10 to 15 minutes to complete; by contrast, the NEO PI-R takes 45 to 60 minutes to complete. The NEO-FFI was revised in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the publication of the NEO PI-3 in 2005, a revised version of the NEO-FFI was also published.&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt; The revision of the NEO-FFI involved the replacement of 15 of the 60 items. The revised edition is thought to be more suitable for younger individuals.&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt; The new version had a stronger factor structure and increased reliability.&lt;ref name="2010 manual" /&gt;

Additionally, an even shorter measure of personality has been developed. It is called the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI). It too assesses the Big Five personality traits. The TIPI can be used in situations in which time is limited. Gosling et al. collected data comparing the TIPI to longer, multiple-item scales, and determined the TIPI to be [[Psychometrics|psychometrically]] inferior. However, they also identified a number of the TIPI's strengths. First, Gosling et al.  found acceptable correlations with more widely used [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] measures. Second, their data suggested the TIPI has adequate test-retest reliability. Third, the data's correlations between the TIPI and criterion variables resemble the correlations found in research with longer Big-Five measures. They suggested the TIPI may, thus, be useful when very brief measures of personality are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Cross-cultural research==
Evidence of the NEO scales' stability in different countries and cultures can be considered evidence of its validity. A great deal of cross-cultural research has been carried out on the Five-Factor Model of Personality. Much of the research has relied on the NEO PI-R and the shorter NEO-FFI.

Rolland, on the basis of the data from a number of countries, asserted that the neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness dimensions are cross-culturally valid.&lt;ref&gt;Rolland, J. P. (2000, July). Cross-cultural validity of the five factor model of personality. Paper presented at the XXVIIth International Congress of Psychology, Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; Rolland further advanced the view that the extraversion and agreeableness dimensions are more sensitive to cultural context. Age differences in the five-factors of personality across the adult life span are parallel in samples from Germany, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.35.2.466 | last1 = McCrae | first1 = R.

McCrae, Terracciano et al. (2005) further reported data from 51 cultures. Their study found a cross-cultural equivalency between NEO PI-R five factors and [[Facet (psychology)|facets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.407 | last1 = McCrae | first1 = R.

With the recent development of the NEO PI-3, cross-cultural research will likely begin to compare the newer version with the NEO PI-R. Piedmont and Braganza (2015) compared the NEO PI-R to the NEO PI-3 using an adult sample from India.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=Ralph L.|last2=Braganza|first2=Dinesh J.| year = 2015|title=Psychometric evaluation of responses to the NEO PI-3 in a multi-ethnic sample of adults in India.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pas0000135|journal=Psychological Assessment|volume=27|issue=4|pages=1253–1263|doi=10.1037/pas0000135}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used an English version of the NEO PI-3 in order to measure its utility in individuals who speak English as a second language. Piedmont and Braganza found that the NEO PI-3 had slightly higher item/total correlations and better test-retest reliability than the NEO PI-R. They suggested that the NEO PI-3 has the potential to be utilized with those who do not speak English as their first language.

== Brain and genetics ==
The NEO PI-R has been used in research pertaining to both (a) [[genotype]] and personality and (b) [[brain]] and personality. Such studies, however, have not always been conclusive. For example, one study found some evidence for an association between NEO PI-R [[Facet (psychology)|facets]] and [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in the [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] gene,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a study published in [[Science (journal)|Science]], Lesch et al. (1996) found a relationship between the [[serotonin transporter]] [[gene]] regulatory region ([[5-HTTLPR]]) and the neuroticism subscale. Individuals with a shorter [[allele]] had higher neuroticism scores than individuals with the longer allele. The effect was significant for heterozygotes and even stronger for people homozygous for the shorter allele. Although the finding is important, this specific gene contributes to only 4% of the phenotypic variation in neuroticism. The authors concluded that "if other genes were hypothesized to contribute similar gene dosage effects to anxiety, approximately 10 to 15 genes might be predicted to be involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''right to personal identity''' is recognised in international law through a range of declarations and conventions. From as early as birth, an individual’s identity is formed and preserved by registration or being bestowed with a name. However, [[personal identity]] becomes more complex as an individual develops a conscience. But [[human rights]] exist to defend and protect individuality, as quoted by [http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/people/jill-marshall Professor Jill Marshall]: "Human rights law exist to ensure that individual lifestyle choices are protected from majoritarian or populist infringement."&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexity of personal identity, it is preserved and encouraged through privacy, personality rights and the right to self-expression.

==Concept and history==

The right to personal identity begins with the [[right to life]]. It is only through existing that individuals can cultivate their identity. Nevertheless, since ancient Greek philosophy, humans have been recognised with a "soul", making them more than physical bone and flesh. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] was created to preserve the biological and philosophical elements of human beings since its establishment in 1948. Therefore, the notion of individual identity and personality has been encouraged and preserved from the birth of human rights. However, throughout the years there have been developments towards the protection of personal identity through avenues that manifest identity such as private life, expression rights, personality rights and the right to know your biological origin.

==Private life==

Article 8 of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has been interpreted to include "personal identity" within the meaning of "private life." &lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v the UK'' (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8 protects against unwanted intrusion and provides for the respect of an individual's private space. Professor Marshall explains that this is important to be uninterrupted and to "think reflectively without interference is to be in control of one’s own faculties,"&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "Human Rights Law and Personal Identity", ''Taylor and Francis'', 2014 at 36.&lt;/ref&gt; as Macklem puts it: "independence of mind."&lt;ref&gt;T Macklem,"Independence of Mind", ''Oxford: OUP'', 2006 at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This protection of inner privacy allows individuals to develop and cultivate their personal identity. "Private life" has also be interpreted to protect the development of relationships.The ECHR highlighted in the case of ''Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook'' the significance of relationships concerning the "emotional field" and "the development of one’s own personality."&lt;ref&gt;''Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook'' XIX [1976] at 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect of privacy comes respect for personal autonomy, which Article 8 has also been interpreted to protect.&lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v the UK'' (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://echr-online.info/article-8-echr/ ECHR Online] states that the scope of Article 8 is to "embrace personal autonomy" and the freedom to make choices without the interference of the state to develop one’s own personal life. As illustrated by the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy], through protecting a person’s autonomy,  a person’s identity is also protected, as both are integral to each other.

==Expression rights==

The Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 and Article 10 of the ECHR give everyone the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Macklem explains that "[[freedom of expression]] is not merely the freedom to communicate one’s voice to others. It is more importantly the freedom to develop a distinctive voice of one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;T Macklem, "Independence of Mind", ''Oxford: OUP'', 2006 at 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Articles 19 and 10 encourage the manifestation of personal identity. In the case of ''Handyside v UK'' the court stated "Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of such a society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of every man."&lt;ref&gt;''Handyside v United Kingdom'' (App 5493/72) ECHR 7 December 1976 at 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of expression not only endorses individuals to participate and contribute to public life but it also gives them the opportunity to discover who they personally are.

Article 9 of the ECHR also provides the right to freedom (and the manifestation) of thought, conscience and religion. According to [[John Locke|Locke]], thought and consciousness establish personal identity, for these are the foundations of who a person is. In addition, a person’s beliefs also contribute to internal and external identity.&lt;ref&gt;S Weinberg, "Locke on Personal Identity", ''Philosophy Compass'' University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at 399.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some believe women who have freely chosen to wear the Islamic headscarf or full-face veil are expressing their religious beliefs and personal identity. This has led to much debate and controversy within states which have banned the wearing of full-face veils in public.

===Full-face veils===

As of 2011, both Belgium and [[French ban on face covering|France]] have banned the full-face Islamic veil in public places. The ban occurred under the administration of [[President Sarkozy]], who stated that veils oppressed women and were [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13038095 "not welcome"] in France. But Marshall highlights that the ban is disproportionate and it is not government's place to determine what women should wear especially when it misrecognises her and disrespects her identity and personality.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; While France explains that the intentions of the ban were to promote public order and secularism, ''Arslan v Turkey'' held that Article 9 had been violated&lt;ref&gt;''Arslan and Others'' v Turkey Application. 41135/98 Judgement 23 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and that France has failed to recognise the intrinsic worth of women who freely choose to wear such veils.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 69.&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated under Article 1 of the Declaration of Human Rights, all beings are born equal and therefore have equal worth. Finally, [[Amnesty International]] has repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The issue of the full-face veil ban in France and Belgium illustrates the extent of legal protection an individual has on their personal identity. Being empowered to make self-determined choices, such as freely choosing to wear a full-face veil to illustrate beliefs, Marshall believes, is an interpreted concept of human dignity and human freedom, allowing each woman's identity to be legally recognised.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The enjoyment of these rights and freedoms in the ECHR are protected under Article 14, and "shall be secured without discrimination regardless of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."

However, these are the opinions of only some scholars. This is a contested issue and others believe that the banning of full-face veils is about liberating females to express their sexuality and providing them the opportunity to show the world who they truly are.&lt;ref&gt;J Selby, "Un/veiling Women’s Bodies: Secularism and Sexuality in Full-face Veil Prohibitions in France and Quebec" ''SAGE Journals'' Vol. 43(3) 2014 at 441.&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects also promote and encourage personal identity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Personality rights===
The right to have and develop a personality is addressed in Article 22 of the UDHR: "Everyone is entitled to the realisation of the rights needed for one’s dignity and the free development of their personality." Article 29 also protects the right to develop one’s personality: "[e]veryone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible." Manuc explains that personality rights can be defined as those expressing the quintessence of the human person, and are intrinsic to being human.&lt;ref&gt;L Manuc "Features and Evolution References to Personality Rights" ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' Vol 4(1) 2012 at 362.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights recognise the "spirit" within an individual and have developed from the issues of privacy. Personality rights emerged from the German legal system in the late twentieth century to seek distance from the horrors of Naziism.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a mechanism to improve tort law surrounding privacy, as illustrated in the ''Criminal Diary''&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Diary'' Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; case.

The case concerned the issue of personality structure and having the right to determine oneself. Ederle explained this as a right individuals have to choose how to be related in the world. Through the help of the [[German Constitutional Court]], an individual can actively seek and create an intimate sphere so his personality can develop and be protected. Some states see no need for a specific law to personality, as their system of law possesses a different foundation for personality protection.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Diary'' Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989) at 381.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, France, South Africa and England have an all-embracing law that protects an individual’s interest concerning physical integrity, feelings, dignity and privacy and identity.&lt;ref&gt;J Neethling, "Personality Rights: a comparative overview", ''The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa'' Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 213.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in addition to substantial protection to personality through privacy, the Netherlands and Austria also recognise a general right to personality.&lt;ref&gt;J Neethling, "Personality Rights: a comparative overview", ''The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa'' Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood and biological right===
The [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx Convention on the Rights of the Child]&lt;/ref&gt; stresses the value and importance of a child’s identity. Giroux and De Lorenzi separate the understanding of identity into two parts: static and dynamic. The static aspects of identity concern attributes that make one visible to the outside world, for example, physical features, sex, name, genetics, and nationality.&lt;ref&gt;M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, ""Putting the Child First": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity", ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' Vol. 27, 2011 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic aspects include morals and religious and cultural characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, ""Putting the Child First": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity", ''Canadian Journal of Family Law'' Vol. 27, 2011 at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 7, a child has a right to have a "legal" identity by being registered, and has a right to a name and a nationality. These protect mainly the static aspects of identity. However, Article 8 protects and encourages the child’s dynamic aspects of identity through preserving his or her identity in relation to nationality, name and family relations. Article 8 illustrates the state’s duty to protect this right, both passively and actively.&lt;ref&gt;J Doek, "Article 8: The Right to Preservation of Identity" ''A Commentary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child'' (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoof Publishers, 2006) at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 7 and 8 developed to confront the issues of children in political struggles and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;K O’Donovan, "Real" Mothers for Abandoned Children" ''Law Society Review'' 2002 at 36.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Gelman v Urugnay''&lt;ref&gt;''Gelman v Urugnay'', Series C No. 221 (IACrtHR), 24 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; concerned the kidnapping of Maria Gelman which prevented her from developing relationships with her parents and concealing her true identity from her. 193 states have ratified the convention, making it the most-ratified convention in history, including all United Nation members except the United States, Somalia and South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;TEACHUnicef, "The Convention on the Rights of a Child" ''TeachUNICEF Debate Source Book'' at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity is also within people's genes as evidenced by debates concerning anonymity for gamete donation.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, in the UK, donor-received people can contact their donor once over 18 to find out where they have come from and prevent genealogical bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority'' Act 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are global differences towards the debate; for example, in Canada and the United States there are no regulations, whereas in Switzerland the donor must be willing to be identified, and in France, anonymity is forced.&lt;ref&gt;T Hampton, "Anonymity of Gamete Donations Debated" ''JAMA'' Vol. 294, No. 21 2005 at 2681.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
There are some scholars who believe the right to identity must be treated with caution.&lt;ref&gt;L Bently, "Identity and the Law" in G Walker and E Leedham-Green (eds) ''Identity: The Darwin College Lecture Series'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) at 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosemary Coombe expressed her concerns of personal identity becoming property as there is the belief that through marginalising identity, it could be accepted as private and exclusive property.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Bently is also concerned with this idea and highlights his worry through a quote from the ''Du Boulay'' case: "Property rights in 'identity'… have the potential to curtail the liberties of those who wish to build their own identities, in whatever way, and for whatever reason."&lt;ref&gt;''Belisle Du Boulay v Jules Rene Hermenegilde Du Boulay '' (1869) LR 2 PC 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe that enshrining personal identity into the law is restricting people's choices and flexibility to transform and change who they are.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 237.&lt;/ref&gt; However, human rights can also perform the contrary and protect individuals' choices on personal identity. While developing personal identity comes down to the individual to manifest character and work out 'who they are,' Marshall highlights that jurisprudence has evolved to create a positive obligation on states to provide social conditions such as private and personality rights to be respected, demonstrating that the international audience  acknowledges that legal recognition is necessary to allow individuals to choose how they want to live and who they are.&lt;ref&gt;J Marshall, "The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice", ''International Journal of Law in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''romantic friendship''',  '''passionate friendship''', or '''affectionate friendship''' is a very close but typically non-[[Human sexuality|sexual]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] between [[friend]]s, often involving a degree of physical closeness beyond that which is common in the contemporary [[Western world|Western]] [[Society|societies]]. It may include for example [[holding hands]], [[cuddling]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, giving [[massages]], and sharing a bed, or [[co-sleeping]], without [[sexual intercourse]] or other physical sexual expression.

In historical scholarship, the term may be used to describe a very close relationship between people of the same sex during a period of history when [[homosexuality]] did not exist as a social category. In this regard, the term was coined in the later 20th century in order to retrospectively describe a type of relationship which until the mid 19th century had been considered unremarkable but since the second half of the 19th century had become more rare as [[physical intimacy]] between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety.{{sfn|Faderman|1998|pp=231-313}} Romantic friendship between women in Europe and North America became especially prevalent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of [[female education]] and a new rhetoric of [[sexual difference]].{{sfn|Rupp|2009|p=127}}

==Historical examples==
The study of historical romantic friendship is difficult because the primary source material consists of writing about love relationships, which typically took the form of love letters, poems, or philosophical essays rather than objective studies.{{sfn|Faderman|1998|ps=&amp;nbsp;''passim.''}} Most of these do not explicitly state the sexual or nonsexual nature of relationships; the fact that homosexuality was taboo in Western European cultures at the time means that some sexual relationships may be hidden, but at the same time the rareness of romantic friendship in modern times means that references to nonsexual relationships may be misinterpreted, as alleged by [[Lillian Faderman|Faderman]], [[Stephanie Coontz|Coontz]], [[E. Anthony Rotundo|Anthony Rotundo]], [[Douglas Bush]], and others.

===Shakespeare and Fair Youth===
{{Main|Sexuality of William Shakespeare}}

The content of Shakespeare's works has raised the question of whether he may have been bisexual.
Although twenty-six of [[Shakespeare's sonnets]] are love poems addressed to a married woman (the "[[Shakespeare's sonnets#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]"), one hundred and twenty-six are addressed to an adolescent boy (known as the "[[Shakespeare's sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]]"). The amorous tone of the latter group, which focus on the boy's beauty, has been interpreted as evidence for Shakespeare's bisexuality, although others interpret them as referring to intense friendship or fatherly affection, not sexual love.

Among those of the latter interpretation, in the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition, Douglas Bush writes:
{{quotation|Since modern readers are unused to such ardor in masculine friendship and are likely to leap at the notion of homosexuality… we may remember that such an ideal, often exalted above the love of women, could exist in real life, from Montaigne to Sir Thomas Browne, and was conspicuous in Renaissance literature.{{sfn|Crompton|2003|p=379}}{{verify source|date=May 2016}}}}

Bush cites [[Montaigne]], who distinguished male friendships from "that other, licentious [[Greek love]]",&lt;ref&gt;Rollins 1:55; Bush cited Montaigne's 1580 work "On Friendship," in which the exact quote was: "And this other Greeke licence is justly abhorred by our customes." {{harvnb|Montaigne|1580|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence of a platonic interpretation.

===Montaigne and Etienne de La Boétie===
The French philosopher [[Montaigne]] described the concept of romantic friendship (without using this English term) in his essay "On Friendship." In addition to distinguishing this type of love from homosexuality ("this other Greek licence"), another way in which Montaigne differed from the modern view&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]'s 1865 essay "On Queen's Gardens" is a good example of the later view that emotionality was a female province; Kate Millet analyzes this essay in ''Sexual Politics'' (1969, 1970, 1990, 2000), University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|0-252-06889-0}}. Many modern books such as Carmen Renee Berry's ''Girlfriends: Invisible Ties'' (1998), Wildcat Canyon Press, {{ISBN|1-885171-20-X}}, argue that intensity in friendship is a female capacity.&lt;/ref&gt; was that he felt that friendship and platonic emotion were a primarily masculine capacity (apparently unaware of the custom of female romantic friendship which also existed):

{{quotation|Seeing (to speake truly) that the ordinary sufficiency of women cannot answer this conference and communication, the nurse of this sacred bond: nor seem their minds strong enough to endure the pulling of a knot so hard, so fast, and durable.{{sfn|Montaigne|1580|p=4}}}}

Lesbian-feminist historian [[Lillian Faderman]] cites Montaigne, using "On Friendship" as evidence that romantic friendship was distinct from homosexuality, since the former could be extolled by famous and respected writers, who simultaneously disparaged homosexuality. (The quotation also furthers Faderman's beliefs that gender and sexuality are [[Social construction|socially constructed]], since they indicate that each sex has been thought of as "better" at intense friendship in one or another period of history.)

===Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed===
{{Main|Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln}}

Some historians have used the relationship between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Joshua Speed]] as another example of a relationship that modern people see as ambiguous or possibly gay, but which was most likely{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to have been a romantic friendship. Lincoln and Speed lived together, shared a bed in their youth{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and maintained a lifelong friendship. [[David Herbert Donald]] pointed out that men at that time often shared beds for financial reasons; men were accustomed to same-sex nonsexual intimacy, since most parents could not afford separate beds or rooms for male siblings. Anthony Rotundo notes that the custom of romantic friendship for men in America in the early 19th century was different from that of Renaissance France, and it was expected that men would distance themselves emotionally and physically somewhat after marriage; he claims that letters between Lincoln and Speed show this distancing after Lincoln married Mary Todd.{{r|Rotundo (1985)}} Such distancing is still practiced today.{{sfn|Geller|2001|pp=320–23}}

==Biblical and religious evidence==
Proponents of the romantic friendship hypothesis also make reference to the [[Bible]]. Historians like Faderman and Robert Brain{{sfn|Brain|1976}} believe that the descriptions of relationships such as [[David and Jonathan]] or Ruth and Naomi in this religious text establish that the customs of romantic friendship existed and were thought of as virtuous in the ancient [[Near East]], despite the simultaneous taboo on homosexuality.

The relationship between [[King David]] and [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], son of [[King Saul]], is often cited as an example of male romantic friendship; for example, Faderman uses 2 Samuel 1:26 on the title page of her book: "Your love was wonderful to me, passing the love of women."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 1:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and her [[mother-in-law]] [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] are the female Biblical pair most often cited as a possible romantic friendship, as in the following verse commonly used in same-sex [[wedding]] ceremonies:
{{quotation|Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; where you die I will die, and there will I be buried.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth to Naomi, Ruth 1:15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Faderman writes that women in Renaissance and Victorian times made reference to both Ruth and Naomi and "Davidean" friendship as the basis for their romantic friendships.{{sfn|Faderman|1981|pp=67, 121}}

While some authors, notably [[John Boswell]], have claimed that ecclesiastical practice in earlier ages blessed "same sex unions", the accurate interpretation of these relationships rests on a proper understanding of the mores and values of the participants, including both the parties receiving the rite in question and the clergy officiating at it. Boswell himself concedes that past relationships are ambiguous; when describing Greek and Roman attitudes, Boswell states that "[A] consensual physical aspect would have been utterly irrelevant to placing the relationship in a meaningful taxonomy."{{sfn|Boswell|1995|p=76}} Boswell's own interpretation has been thoroughly critiqued, notably by Brent D. Shaw, himself a homosexual, in a review written for the New Republic:

{{quotation|Given the centrality of Boswell's "new" evidence, therefore, it is best to begin by describing his documents and their import. These documents are liturgies for an ecclesiastical ritual called [[adelphopoiesis]] or, in simple English, the "creation of a brother." Whatever these texts are, they are not texts for marriage ceremonies. Boswell's translation of their titles (akolouthia eis adelphopoiesin and parallels) as "The Order of Celebrating the Union of Two Men" or "Office for Same-Sex Union" is inaccurate. In the original, the titles say no such thing. And this sort of tendentious translation of the documents is found, alas, throughout the book. Thus the Greek words that Boswell translates as "be united together" in the third section of the document quoted above are, in fact, rather ordinary words that mean "become brothers" (adelphoi genesthai); and when they are translated in this more straightforward manner, they impart a quite different sense to the reader.

Such agreements and rituals are "same-sex" in the sense that it is two men who are involved; and they are "unions" in the sense that the two men involved are co-joined as "brothers." But that is it. There is no indication in the texts themselves that these are marriages in any sense that the word would mean to readers now, nor in any sense that the word would have meant to persons then: the formation of a common household, the sharing of everything in a permanent co-residential unit, the formation of a family unit wherein the two partners were committed, ideally, to each other, with the intent to raise children, and so on.

Although it is difficult to state precisely what these ritualised relationships were, most historians who have studied them are fairly certain that they deal with a species of "ritualised kinship" that is covered by the term "brotherhood." (This type of "brotherhood" is similar to the ritualised agreements struck between members of the Mafia or other "men of honour" in our own society.) That explains why the texts on adelphopoiesis in the prayerbooks are embedded within sections dealing with other kinship-forming rituals, such as marriage and adoption. Giovanni Tomassia in the 1880s and Paul Koschaker in the 1930s, whose works Boswell knows and cites, had already reached this conclusion.{{r|Shaw (1994)}}}}

Historian Robert Brain has also traced these ceremonies from Pagan "blood brotherhood" ceremonies through medieval Catholic ceremonies called "gossipry" or "siblings before God," on to modern ceremonies in some Latin American countries referred to as "[[compadre|compadrazgo]]"; Brain considers the ceremonies to refer to romantic friendship.{{sfn|Brain|1976|p=75–107}}

== Romantic friendships in women's colleges ==
As the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|American suffrage movement]] succeeded in gaining rights for white middle- and upper-class women, heterosexual marriage became less of a necessity, and many more women went to college and continued to live in female-centric communities after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=12|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-women peer culture formed at [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] allowed students to create their own social rules and hierarchies, to become each other's leaders and heroes, and to idolize each other. These idolizations often took the forms of romantic friendships, which contemporaries called "smashes", "crushes" and "spoons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=19|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of "smashing" involved one student showering another with gifts: notes, chocolates, sometimes even locks of hair. When the object of the student's affections was wooed and the two of them began spending all their time together, the "aggressor" was perceived by her friends as "smashed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahli|first=Nancy Ann|date=1979|title=Smashing: Women's Relationships before the Fall|url=|journal=Chrysalis|volume=8|pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, "crush" gradually replaced the term "smash", and generally signified a younger girl's infatuation with an older peer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=166|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Susan Van Dyne has documented an "intimate friendship" between Mary Mathers and Frona Brooks, two members of the [[Smith College]] class of 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyne|first=Susan Van|date=2016|title="Abracadabra": Intimate Inventions by Early College Women in the United States|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.42.2.0280|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=42|issue=2|pages=280–310|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.42.2.0280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathers and Brooks exchanged tokens of affection, relished time spent alone together, and celebrated an anniversary.

Romantic friendships kindled in women's colleges sometimes continued after graduation, with women living together in "[[Boston marriages]]" or cooperative houses. Women who openly committed themselves to other women often found acceptance of their commitment and lifestyle in academic fields, and felt comfortable expressing their feelings for their same-sex companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=190|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the century, smashes and crushes were considered an essential part of the women's college experience, and students who wrote home spoke openly about their involvement in romantic friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43475535|title=Alma mater : design and experience in the women's colleges from their nineteenth-century beginnings to the 1930s|last=Lefkowitz.|first=Horowitz, Helen|date=1993|publisher=University of Massachuchusetts Press|year=|isbn=0870238698|edition= 2nd|location=Amherst|pages=66|oclc=43475535}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, however, public opinion had turned against crushes as the American public began to realize that [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] might not be dependent on men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22906565|title=Odd girls and twilight lovers : a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century America|last=Lillian,|first=Faderman,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0231074883|location=New York|pages=35|oclc=22906565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in 1990s American gay and lesbian subculture==
Several small groups of advocates and researchers have advocated for the renewed use of the term, or the related term [[Boston marriage]], today. Several [[lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[feminist]] authors (such as [[Lillian Faderman]], [[Stephanie Coontz]], Jaclyn Geller and Esther Rothblum) have done academic research on the topic;{{sfn|Rothblum|1993}} these authors typically favor the [[social constructionist]] view that [[sexual orientation]] is a modern, culturally constructed concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Faderman's introduction in the 1998 edition of ''Surpassing the Love of Men''; Coontz's ''The Way We Never Were'' has as its thesis the social construction of a variety of family and relationship traditions, whereas Geller advocates for the abolition of marriage and a renewed focus on friendship for feminist reasons ({{harvnb|Geller|2001}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7650">In [[design of experiments]], '''single-subject design''' or '''single-case research design''' is a research design most often used in applied fields of psychology, education, and human behavior in which the subject serves as his/her own control, rather than using another individual/group. Researchers use single-subject design because these designs are sensitive to individual organism differences vs group designs which are sensitive to averages of groups. Often there will be large numbers of subjects in a research study using single-subject design, however—because the subject serves as their own control, this is still a single-subject design.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in applied research.&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
The following are requirements of single-subject designs:&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, pp. 103–10&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Continuous assessment:''' The behavior of the individual is observed repeatedly over the course of the intervention. This ensures that any treatment effects are observed long enough to convince the scientist that the treatment produces a lasting effect.
* '''Baseline assessment:''' Before the treatment is implemented, the researcher is to look for behavioral trends. If a treatment reverses a baseline trend (e.g., things were getting worse as time went on in the baseline but the treatment reversed this trend) then this is powerful evidence suggesting (though not proving) a treatment effect. 
* '''Variability in data:''' Because behavior is assessed repeatedly, the single-subject design allows the researcher to see how consistently the treatment changes behavior over time. Large-group statistical designs do not typically provide this information because repeated assessments are not usually taken and the behavior of individuals in the groups are not scrutinized; instead, group means are reported.

==Phases within single-subject design==
* '''Baseline''': this phase is one in which the researcher collects data on the dependent variable without any intervention in place.  
* '''Intervention''': this phase is one in which the researcher introduces an independent variable (the intervention) and then collects data on the dependent variable.
* '''Reversal''': this phase is one in which the researcher removes the independent variable (reversal) and then collects data on the dependent variable.

It is important that the data are stable (steady trend and low variability) before the researcher moves to the next phase. Single-subject designs produce or approximate three levels of knowledge: (1) descriptive, (2) correlational, and (3) causal.&lt;ref&gt;Tripodi, T. (1998). ''A Primer on Single-Subject Design for Clinical Social Workers.'' Washington, DC: National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexibility of the design==
Single-subject designs are preferred because they are highly flexible and highlight individual differences in response to intervention effects.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, C.K. (1986). Flexibility of Single-subject Experimental Designs. Part III: Using Flexibility to Design or Modify Experiments. ''The Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders'', 51(3), 214–25&lt;/ref&gt; In general, single-subject designs have been shown to reduce interpretation bias for counselors when doing therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, D.J. &amp; Tai, W. (2001). Reducing Biases in Clinical Judgment with Single-Subject Treatment Design. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(3), 196–206 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of data==
In order to determine the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, the researcher will graph the data collected and visually inspect the differences between phases. If there is a clear distinction between baseline and intervention, and then the data returns to the same trends/level during reversal, a functional relation between the variables is inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, C.L. &amp; Harris, S.R. (1999). Case Studies, Single-Subject Research, and N of 1 Randomized Trials. Comparisons and Contrasts. ''American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation'', 78(2), 170–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, visual inspection of the data demonstrates results that statistical tests fail to find.&lt;ref&gt;Bobrovitz, C.D. &amp; Ottenbacher, K.J. (1998). Comparison of Visual Inspection and Statistical Analysis of Single-Subject Data in Rehabilitation Research. ''Journal of Engineering and Applied Science'', 77(2), 94–102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishith, P.; Hearst, D.E.; Mueser, K.T. &amp; Foa, E. (1995). PTSD and Major Depression: Methodological and Treatment Considerations in a Single-Case Design. ''Behavior Therapy'', 26(2), 297–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers utilizing single-subject design begin with ''graphic analysis''. During the baseline, data are repeatedly collected and then graphed on the behavior of interest. This provides a visual representation of the subject's behavior before application of the intervention. It is critical that several (three to five is often recommended&lt;ref&gt;Alberto, P.A. &amp; Troutman, A.C. (2006). ''Applied behavior analysis for teachers (7th ed.)''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;) data points are collected during baseline to allow the researcher to describe the effects on the target behavior during intervention.

In interpreting, the general strategy of all single-subject research is to use the subject as their own control. Experimental logic argues that the subject's baseline behavior would match its behavior in the intervention phase unless the intervention does something to change it. This logic then holds to rule out confound, one needs to replicate. It is the within-subject replication and allows for the determination of functional relationships. Thus the goal is:
* Demonstration
* Verification
* Replication

==Limitations==
Research designs are traditionally preplanned so that most of the details about to whom and when the intervention will be introduced are decided prior to the beginning of the study. However, in single-subject designs, these decisions are often made as the data are collected.&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are no widely agreed-upon rules for altering phases, so—this could lead to conflicting ideas as to how a research experiment should be conducted in single-subject design.

The major criticism of single-subject designs are:
* '''Carry-over effects''': Results from the previous phase carry-over into the next phase.
* '''Order effects''': The ordering (sequence) of the intervention or treatment affects what results.
* '''Irreversibility''': In some withdrawal designs, once a change in the independent variable occurs, the dependent variable is affected. This cannot be undone by simply removing the independent variable.
* '''Ethical problems''': Withdrawal of treatment in the withdrawal design can at times present ethical and feasibility problems.

==History==
Historically, single-subject designs have been closely tied to the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">'''Situational analysis''' (or '''Situational logic''') is a concept advanced by [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in his [[The Poverty of Historicism]]. ''Situational analysis'' is a process by which a social scientist tries to reconstruct the problem situation confronting an agent in order to understand that agent's choice.

[[Noretta Koertge|Koertge]] (1975) provides a helpful clarificatory summary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This use of this summary is from Boumans and Davis (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

:First provide a description of the situation: 
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''Agent A was in a situation of type C''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
:This situation is then analysed
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''In a situation of type C, the appropriate thing to do is X.''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:The rationality principle may then be called upon:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;''agents always act appropriately to their situation''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Sobol sequences''' (also called LP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; sequences or (''t'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') sequences in base&amp;nbsp;2) are an example of quasi-random [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s. They were first introduced by the Russian mathematician [[Ilya M. Sobol]] (Илья Меерович Соболь) in 1967.&lt;ref name=Sobol67&gt;Sobol,I.M.

(1967), "Distribution of points in a cube and approximate evaluation of integrals". ''Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz.'' '''7''': 784–802 (in Russian); ''U.S.S.R Comput. Maths. Math. Phys.'' '''7''': 86–112 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

These sequences use a base of two to form successively finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension.

== Good distributions in the ''s''-dimensional unit hypercube ==

Let ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' = [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; be the ''s''-dimensional unit hypercube, and ''f'' a real integrable function over ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;''. The original motivation of Sobol was to construct a sequence ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' so that
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) = \int_{I^s} f &lt;/math&gt;
and the convergence be as fast as possible.

It is more or less clear that for the sum to converge towards the integral, the points ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' should fill ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' minimizing the holes. Another good property would be that the projections of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' on a lower-dimensional face of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' leave very few holes as well. Hence the homogeneous filling of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not qualify because in lower dimensions many points will be at the same place, therefore useless for the integral estimation.

These good distributions are called (''t'',''m'',''s'')-nets and (''t'',''s'')-sequences in base ''b''. To introduce them, define first an elementary ''s''-interval in base ''b'' a subset of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{j=1}^s \left[ \frac{a_j}{b^{d_j}}, \frac{a_j+1}{b^{d_j}} \right], &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are non-negative integers, and &lt;math&gt; a_j &lt; b^{d_j} &lt;/math&gt; for all ''j'' in {1, ...,s}.

Given 2 integers &lt;math&gt;0\leq t\leq m&lt;/math&gt;, a (''t'',''m'',''s'')-net in base ''b'' is a sequence ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''b&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' points of ''I&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Card} P \cap \{x_1, ..., x_{b^m}\} = b^t&lt;/math&gt; for all elementary interval ''P'' in base ''b'' of hypervolume ''λ''(''P'') = ''b&lt;sup&gt;t−m&lt;/sup&gt;''.

Given a non-negative integer ''t'', a (''t'',''s'')-sequence in base ''b'' is an infinite sequence of points ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that for all integers &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0, m \geq t&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{x_{kb^m}, ..., x_{(k+1)b^m-1}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a (''t'',''m'',''s'')-net in base ''b''.

In his article, Sobol described ''Π&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;-meshes'' and ''LP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; sequences'', which are (''t'',''m'',''s'')-nets and (''t'',''s'')-sequences in base 2 respectively. The terms (''t'',''m'',''s'')-nets and (''t'',''s'')-sequences in base ''b'' (also called Niederreiter sequences) were coined in 1988 by [[Harald Niederreiter]].&lt;ref name=Nied88&gt;[[Harald Niederreiter|Niederreiter, H.]] (1988). "Low-Discrepancy and Low-Dispersion Sequences", ''Journal of Number Theory'' '''30''': 51–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Sobol sequences'' was introduced in late English-speaking papers in comparison with [[Halton sequence|Halton]], Faure and other low-discrepancy sequences.

== A fast algorithm for the construction of Sobol sequences ==

A more efficient [[Gray code]] implementation was proposed by Antonov and Saleev.&lt;ref name=AS79&gt;Antonov, I.A. and Saleev, V.M. (1979) "An economic method of computing LP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;-sequences". ''Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz.'' '''19''': 243–245 (in Russian); ''U.S.S.R. Comput. Maths. Math. Phys.'' '''19''': 252–256 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the generation of Sobol numbers, they are clearly aided by the use of Gray code &lt;math&gt;G(n)=n \oplus \lfloor n/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''n'' for constructing the ''n''-th point draw.

Suppose we have already generated all the Sobol sequence draws up to ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and kept in memory the values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1,''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for all the required dimensions. Since the Gray code ''G''(''n'') differs from that of the preceding one ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) by just a single, say the ''k''-th, bit (which is a rightmost bit of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1), all that needs to be done is a single [[XOR]] operation for each dimension in order to propagate all of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
x_{n,i} = x_{n-1,i} \oplus v_{k,i}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Additional uniformity properties ==

Sobol introduced additional uniformity conditions known as property A and A’.&lt;ref name=Sobol76&gt;Sobol, I. M. (1976) "Uniformly distributed sequences with an additional uniform property". ''Zh. Vych. Mat. Mat. Fiz.'' '''16''': 1332–1337 (in Russian); ''U.S.S.R. Comput. Maths. Math. Phys.'' '''16''': 236–242 (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Definition: A low-discrepancy sequence is said to satisfy '''Property A''' if for any binary segment (not an arbitrary subset) of the ''d''-dimensional sequence of length 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; there is exactly one draw in each 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; hypercubes that result from subdividing the unit hypercube along each of its length extensions into half.

;Definition: A low-discrepancy sequence is said to satisfy '''Property A’''' if for any binary segment (not an arbitrary subset) of the ''d''-dimensional sequence of length 4&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; there is exactly one draw in each 4&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; hypercubes that result from subdividing the unit hypercube along each of its length extensions into four equal parts.

There are mathematical conditions that guarantee properties A and A'.

;Theorem: The ''d''-dimensional Sobol sequence possesses Property A iff
::&lt;math&gt;
\det(\mathbf{V}_d) \equiv 1 (\mod 2),
&lt;/math&gt;
:where '''V'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''d''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''d'' binary matrix defined by
::&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{V}_d := \begin{pmatrix}
{v_{1,1,1}}&amp;{v_{2,1,1}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,1,1}}\\ 
{v_{1,2,1}}&amp;{v_{2,2,1}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,2,1}}\\ 
{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\ddots}&amp;{\vdots}\\ 
{v_{1,d,1}}&amp;{v_{2,d,1}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,d,1}}
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
:with ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; denoting the ''m''-th digit after the binary point of the direction number ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0.''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',1&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',2&lt;/sub&gt;...)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

;Theorem: The ''d''-dimensional Sobol sequence possesses Property A' iff
::&lt;math&gt;
\det(\mathbf{U}_d) \equiv 1 \mod 2,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where '''U'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; is the 2''d''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2''d'' binary matrix defined by
::&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{U}_d := \begin{pmatrix}
{v_{1,1,1}}&amp;{v_{1,1,2}}&amp;{v_{2,1,1}}&amp;{v_{2,1,2}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,1,1}}&amp;{v_{d,1,2}}\\ 
{v_{1,2,1}}&amp;{v_{1,2,2}}&amp;{v_{2,2,1}}&amp;{v_{2,2,2}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,2,1}}&amp;{v_{d,2,2}}\\ 
{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\ddots}&amp;{\vdots}&amp;{\vdots}\\ 
{v_{1,2d,1}}&amp;{v_{1,2d,2}}&amp;{v_{2,2d,1}}&amp;{v_{2,2d,2}}&amp;{\dots}&amp;{v_{d,2d,1}}&amp;{v_{d,2d,2}}
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
:with ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; denoting the ''m''-th digit after the binary point of the direction number ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0.''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',1&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j'',2&lt;/sub&gt;...)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Tests for properties A and A’ are independent. Thus it is possible to construct the Sobol sequence that satisfies both properties A and A’ or only one of them.

== The initialization of Sobol numbers ==

To construct a Sobol sequence, a set of direction numbers ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; needs to be selected. There is some freedom in the selection of initial direction numbers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These numbers are usually called ''initialisation numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is possible to receive different realisations of the Sobol sequence for selected dimensions. A bad selection of initial numbers can considerably reduce the efficiency of Sobol sequences when used for computation.

Arguably the easiest choice for the initialisation numbers is just to have the ''l''-th leftmost bit set, and all other bits to be zero, i.e. ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for all ''k'' and ''j''. This initialisation is usually called ''unit initialisation''. However, such a sequence fails the test for Property A and A’ even for low dimensions and hence this initialisation is bad.

== Implementation and availability of Sobol sequences ==

Good initialisation numbers for different numbers of dimensions are provided by several authors.  For example, Sobol provides initialisation numbers for dimensions up to 51.&lt;ref name=SobLev76&gt;Sobol, I.M. and Levitan, Y.L. (1976). "The production of points uniformly distributed in a multidimensional cube" ''Tech. Rep. 40, Institute of Applied Mathematics, USSR Academy of Sciences'' (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; The same set of initialisation numbers is used by Bratley and Fox.&lt;ref name=BF88&gt;Bratley, P. and Fox, B. L. (1988), "Algorithm 659: Implementing Sobol’s quasirandom sequence generator". ''ACM Trans. Math. Software'' '''14''': 88–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initialisation numbers for high dimensions are available on Joe and Kuo.&lt;ref name=JK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/sobol/ |title=Sobol sequence generator |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Jaeckel|Peter Jäckel]] provides initialisation numbers up to dimension 32 in his book "[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]]".&lt;ref name=Jackel&gt;Jäckel, P. (2002) "Monte Carlo methods in finance". New York: [[John Wiley and Sons]]. ({{ISBN|0-471-49741-X}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other implementations are available as C, Fortran 77, or Fortran 90 routines in the [[Numerical Recipes]] collection of software.&lt;ref name=NumRec&gt;Press, W.H., Teukolsky, S. A., Vetterling, W. T., and Flannery, B. P. (1992) "Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77: The Art of Scientific Computing, 2nd ed." ''Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K.''&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Free and open-source software|free/open-source]] implementation in up to 1111 dimensions, based on the Joe and Kuo initialisation numbers, is available in C&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt/blob/master/src/util/sobolseq.c C implementation of the Sobol sequence] in the [http://ab-initio.mit.edu/nlopt NLopt library] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/stevengj/Sobol.jl Sobol.jl] package: Julia implementation of the Sobol sequence.&lt;/ref&gt;  A different free/open-source implementation is available for [[C++]], [[Fortran 90]], [[Matlab]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/sobol/sobol.html The Sobol Quasirandom Sequence], code for C++/Fortran 90/Matlab/Python by J.

In [[mathematics]], a '''subsequential limit''' of a [[sequence]] is the limit of some [[subsequence]]. Every subsequential limit is a [[cluster point]], but not conversely. In [[first-countable]] spaces, the two concepts coincide.

The [[supremum]] of the set of all subsequential limits of some sequence is called the limit superior, or limsup. Similarly, the infimum of such a set is called the limit inferior, or liminf. See [[limit superior and limit inferior]].

If (X,d) is a metric space and there is a [[Cauchy sequence]] such that there is a subsequence converging to some x, then the sequence also converges to x.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">'''Terminological inexactitude''' is a phrase introduced in 1906 by British politician [[Winston Churchill]]. Today, it is used as a [[euphemism]] or [[circumlocution]] meaning a [[lie]] or untruth.

Churchill first used the phrase following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 election]]. Speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 22 February 1906 as [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies|Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office]], he had occasion to repeat what he had said during the campaign. When asked that day whether the Government was condoning slavery of Chinese labourers in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], Churchill replied:&lt;ref name="safire"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[William Safire|Safire, William]]|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=9780195340617|page=474|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The conditions of the Transvaal ordinance ... cannot in the opinion of His Majesty's Government be classified as slavery; at least, that word in its full sense could not be applied without a risk of terminological inexactitude.&lt;ref name="safire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M3oyAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;ots=tsnYBL8FUO&amp;dq=terminological%20inexactitude%20transvaal&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q=terminological%20inexactitude%20transvaal&amp;f=false ''The Outlook'', Volume 17] retrieved 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been used as a euphemism for a lie in the House of Commons, as to accuse another member of lying is considered [[unparliamentary language|unparliamentary]].

In more recent times, the term was used by [[Conservative MPs|Conservative MP]] [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] to the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Oppositon]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]] over an accusation that Rees-Mogg's company had moved a [[hedge fund]] into the [[Eurozone]] despite him being in favour of [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/jacob-rees-mogg-accuses-jeremy-corbyn-of-terminological-inexactitude-for-brexit-jibe-11418702|title=Jacob Rees-Mogg accuses Jeremy Corbyn of 'terminological inexactitude' for Brexit jibe|work=Sky News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-40527522/jacob-rees-mogg-terminological-inexactitude-over-brexit|title=Rees-Mogg on 'terminological inexactitude'|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jacob-rees-mogg-accused-jeremy-12803192|title=Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Jeremy Corbyn of 'peddling false news' - here's why|last=Smith|first=Mikey|date=2018-06-27|work=mirror|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Story of My Experiments with Truth''''' is the autobiography of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]], covering his life from early childhood through to 1921. It was written in weekly instalments and published in his journal ''Navjivan'' from 1925 to 1929. Its English translation also appeared in installments in his other journal ''[[Young India]]''.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt; It was initiated at the insistence of [[Swami Anand]] and other close co-workers of Gandhi, who encouraged him to explain the background of his public campaigns. In 1999, the book was designated as one of the "100 Best Spiritual Books of the 20th Century" by a committee of global spiritual and religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/enter/books/book372.htm |title=Spiritual books of the century | work=USA Today | date=2 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

=== Translator's preface ===
This section is written by [[Mahadev Desai]] who translated the book from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] to English in 1940. In this preface Desai notes that the book was originally published in two volumes, the first in 1927 and second in 1929. He also mentions that the original was priced at {{INRConvert|1}} and had a run of five editions by the time of the writing of his preface. 50,000 copies had been sold in Gujarati but since the English edition was expensive it prevented Indians from purchasing it. Desai notes the need to bring out a cheaper English version. He also mentions that the translation has been revised by an English scholar who did not want his name to be published. Chapters XXIX-XLIII of Part V were translated by Desai's friend and colleague Pyarelal.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=M. K. Gandhi.

=== Introduction ===
The introduction is written by Gandhi himself mentioning how he has resumed writing his autobiography at the insistence of Jeramdas, a fellow prisoner in [[Yerwada Central Jail]] with him. He mulls over the question a friend asked him about writing an autobiography, deeming it a Western practice, something "nobody does in the east".&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=edited by Richard L.|title=Gandhi's experiments with truth : essential writings by and about Mahatma Gandhi|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1143-7|pages=388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRQcKsx-YgQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi himself agrees that his thoughts might change later in life  but the purpose of his story is just to narrate his experiments with truth in life.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; He also says that through this book he wishes to narrate his spiritual and moral experiments rather than political.

=== Part I ===
The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Men of Turmoil – Biographies by Leading Authorities of the Dominating Personalities of Our Day|year=2007|publisher=Hesperides Press|isbn=1-4067-3625-2|pages=384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MT8pbR2r4rAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play ''[[Harishchandra]]'' and says,"I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Pitirim A.

Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth. His disdain for physical training at school, particularly gymnastics has also been written about in this part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudolph|first=Susanne Hoeber|title=Gandhi : the traditional roots of charisma|year=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-73136-0|pages=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3Ac_HEZkcMC&amp;dq=|edition=[Pbk. ed.].|author2=R, Lloyd I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II ===
After a long history of antagonism, the British and the Dutch shared power in South Africa, with Britain ruling the regions of Natal and Cape Colony, while the Dutch settlers known as the Boers taking charge in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, two independent republics. The white settler and the independent Boer states continued to engage in volatile interactions with the British, so a threat of violent eruptions always loomed large. In order to placate both the Boer and other white settlers, the British adopted a number of racist policies, and while the Indians, most of them working on sugar and coffee plantations, did not suffer as much as the black population, they clearly experienced a treatment as second-class citizens. The initial story of Gandhi’s travails in South Africa and of his systematic struggle against oppression is well known. Gandhi repeatedly experienced the sting of humiliation during his long African sojourn. The incident at Maritzburg, where Gandhi was thrown off the train has become justly famous. When Gandhi, as a matter of principle, refused to leave the first class compartment, he was thrown off the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_2/04_arvind_narrain.pdf"|title = ""MY EXPERIMENTS WITH LAW": GANDHI’S EXPLORATION OF LAW’S POTENTIAL|last = Narrain|first = Arvind|date = April 1, 2013|journal = NUJS Law Review|access-date = January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gandhi also had difficulty being admitted to hotels, and saw that his fellow-Indians, who were mostly manual laborers, experienced even more unjust treatment.

Very soon after his arrival, Gandhi's initial bafflement and indignation at racist policies turned into a growing sense of outrage and propelled him into assuming a position as a public figure at the assembly of Transvaal Indians, where he delivered his first speech urging Indians not to accept inequality but instead to unite, work hard, learn English and observe clean living habits. Although Gandhi's legal work soon start to keep him busy, he found time to read some of Tolstoy's work, which greatly influenced his understanding of peace and justice and eventually inspired him to write to Tolstoy, setting the beginning of a prolific correspondence. Both Tolstoy and Gandhi shared a philosophy of non-violence and Tolstoy's harsh critique of human society resonated with Gandhi's outrage at racism in South Africa.

Both Tolstoy and Gandhi considered themselves followers of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] from the New Testament, in which Jesus Christ expressed the idea of complete self-denial for the sake of his fellow men. Gandhi also continued to seek moral guidance in the Bhagavad-Gita, which inspired him to view his work not as self-denial at all, but as a higher form of self-fulfillment. Adopting a philosophy of selflessness even as a public man, Gandhi refused to accept any payment for his work on behalf of the Indian population, preferring to support himself with his law practice alone.

But Gandhi's personal quest to define his own philosophy with respect to religion did not rely solely on sacred texts. At the time, he also engaged in active correspondence with a highly educated and spiritual Jain from Bombay, his friend Raychandra, who was deeply religious, yet well versed in a number of topics, from Hinduism to Christianity. The more Gandhi communicated with Raychandra, the more deeply he began to appreciate Hinduism as a non violent faith and its related scriptures. Yet, such deep appreciation also gave birth to a desire to seek inner purity and illumination, without solely relying on external sources, or on the dogma within every faith. Thus, although Gandhi sought God within his own tradition, he espoused the idea that other faiths remained worthy of study and contained their own truths.

Not surprisingly, even after his work assignment concluded, Gandhi soon found a reason to remain in South Africa. This pivotal reason involved the "Indian Franchise Bill", with which the Natal legislature intended to deprive Indians of the right to vote. No opposition existed against this bill, except among some of Gandhi's friends who asked him to stay in South Africa and work with them against this new injustice against Indians, who white South Africans disparagingly called "coolies." He found that racist attitudes had become deeply entrenched, especially in the Dutch-ruled regions, where they lived in the worst urban slums and could not own property or manage agricultural land. Even in Natal, where Indians had more influence, they were not allowed to go out after 9 p.m. without a pass, while in Cape Colony, another British territory, they were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk. The new bill which prohibited Indians from voting in Natal only codified existing injustice in writing.

Although a last-minute petition drive failed to the Indian Franchise Bill from passing, Gandhi remained active and organized a much larger petition, which he sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, and distributed to the press in South Africa, Britain and India. The petition raised awareness of the plight of Indians and generating discussions in all three continents to the point where both the Times of London and the Times of India published editorials in support of the Indian right to the vote. Gandhi also formed a new political organization called the Natal Indian Congress (a clear reference to the Indian National Congress), which held regular meetings and soon, after some struggles with financing, started its own library and debating society. They also issued two major pamphlets, An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africa, and The Indian Franchise–An Appeal, which offered a logical argument against racial discrimination. He was also thrown of the Train when he didn't agree to move from his first class seat which he paid for.

Though, at first, Gandhi intended to remain in South Africa for a month, or a year at most, he ended up working in South Africa for about twenty years. After his initial assignment was over, he succeeded in growing his own practice to about twenty Indian merchants who contracted manage their affairs. This work allowed him to both earn a living while also finding time to devote to his mission as a public figure. During his struggle against inequality and racial discrimination in South Africa, Gandhi became known among Indians all around the world as "Mahatma," or "Great Soul."

=== Part III ===

In South Africa with the Family, the Boer War, Bombay and South Africa Again.

In 1896, Gandhi made a brief return to India and returned with his wife and children. In India, he published another pamphlet, known as the Green Pamphlet, on the plight of Indians in South Africa. For the first time, Gandhi realized that Indians had come to admire his work greatly and experienced a taste of his own popularity among the people, when he visited Madras, an Indian province, where most manual laborers had originated. Although his fellow-Indians greeted him in large crowds with applause and adulation, he sailed back to South Africa with his family in December 1896.

Gandhi had become very well known in South Africa as well, to the point where a crowd of rioters awaited him at Port Natal, determined that he should not be allowed to enter. Many of them also mistakenly believed that all the dark-skinned passenger on the ship that took Gandhi to Natal were poor Indian immigrants he had decided to bring along with him, when, in reality, these passengers were mostly returning Indian residents of Natal. Fortunately, Gandhi was able to establish a friendly relationship with the British in South Africa so the Natal port's police superintendent and his wife escorted him to safety. After this incident, local white residents began to actually regard him with greater respect.

As Gandhi resumed his work at the Natal Indian Congress, his loyalty to the British guided him to assist them in the Boer War, which started three years later. Because Gandhi remained a passionate pacifist, he wanted to participate in the Boer War without actually engaging in violence so he organized and led an Indian Medical Corps which served the British in a number of battles, including the important battle of '''Spion Kop in January 1900.'''

At the time, Gandhi believed that the British Empire shared the values of liberty and equality that he himself embraced and that, by virtue of defending those principles, the British constitution deserved the loyalty of all British subjects, including Indians. He viewed racist policy in South Africa as a temporary characteristic aberration, rather than a permanent tendency. With respect to the British in India, at this point in his life, Gandhi considered their rule beneficial and benevolent.

The armed conflict between the British and Dutch raged on for over three years of often brutal fighting with the British conquering the Transvaal and Orange Free state territories. Gandhi expected that the British victory would establish justice in South Africa and present him with an opportunity to return to India. He wanted to attend the 1901 meeting of the Indian National Congress, whose mission was to provide a social and political forum for the Indian upper class. Founded in 1885 by the British, the Congress had no real political power and expressed pro-British positions. Gandhi wanted to attend its meeting nevertheless, as he was hoping to pass a resolution in support of the Indian population in South Africa. Before he left for Bombay, Gandhi promised the Natal Indian Congress that he would return to support their efforts, should they need his help.

As Gandhi attended the 1901 Indian National Congress, his hopes came true. G.K. Gokhale, one of the most prominent Indian politicians of the time, supported the resolution for the rights of Indians in South Africa and the resolution passed. Through Gokhale, in whose house Gandhi stayed for a month, Gandhi met many political connections that would serve him later in life.

However, his promise to always aid his friends in Natal soon prompted him to return to South Africa, when he received an urgent telegram informing him that the British and Boers had now formed a peaceful relationship and often acted together to the detriment of the Indian population, as Britain was planning to live local white individuals in power in South Africa, much like it had done in Canada and Australia.

Gandhi travelled back to South Africa immediately and met with Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and presented him with a paper on the injustice against the Indian population but Chamberlain indicated that the Indians would have to obey the new rulers of South Africa, now called the "Afrikaners," which included both Dutch and British local settlers.

Gandhi began to organize a fast response to this new South African political configuration. Instead of working in Natal, he now established a camp in the newly conquered Transvaal region and began helping Indians who had escaped from the war in that region, and now had to purchase overly expensive re-entry passes. He also represented poor Indians whose dwellings in a shantytown the authorities had dispossessed. Gandhi also started a new magazine, Indian Opinion, that advocated for political liberty and equal rights in South Africa. The magazine, which initially included several young women from Europe, expanded its staff around the country, increasing both Gandhi's popularity and the public support for his ideas.

At round same time, Gandhi read John Ruskin's book ''[[Unto This Last]]'', which maintained that the life of manual labor was superior to all other ways of living. As he adopted this belief, Gandhi chose to abandon Western dress and habits, and he moved his family and staff to a Transvaal farm called the Phoenix, where he even gave renounced the use of an oil-powered engine and printed ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' by hand-wheel, and performed agriculture labor using old, manual farming equipment. He began to conceive of his public work as a mission to restore old Indian virtue and civilization, rather than fall prey to modern Western influence, which included electricity and technology.

Between 1901 and 1906, he also changed another aspect of his personal life by achieving Brahmacharya, or the voluntary abstention from sexual relations. He made this choice as part of his philosophy of selflessness and self-restraint. Finally, he also formulated his own philosophy of political protest, called Satyagraha, which literally meant "truth-force" in Sanskrit. In practice, this practice meant protesting injustice steadfastly, but in a non-violent manner.

He put this theory into practice on September 8, 1906, when, at a large gathering of the Indian community in Transvaal, he asked the whole community to take a vow of disobedience to the law, as the Transvaal government had started an effort to register every Indian child over the age of eight, which would make them an official part of the South African population.

Setting a personal example, Gandhi became the first Indian to appear before a magistrate for his refusal to register, and he was sentenced to two months in prison. He actually asked for a heavier sentence, a request, consistent with his philosophy of self-denial. After his release, Gandhi continued his campaign and thousands of Indians burned their registration cards, crossing the Transvaal-Natal border without passes. Many went to jail, including Gandhi, who went to jail again in 1908.

Gandhi did not waiver when a South African General by the name of Jan Christiaan Smuts promised to eliminate the registration law, but broke his word. Gandhi went all the way to London in 1909 and gathered enough support among the British to convince Smuts to eliminate the law in 1913. Yet, the Transvaal Prime Minister continued to regard Indians as second-class citizens while the Cape Colony government passed another discriminatory law making all non-Christian marriages illegal, which meant that all Indian children would be considered born out of wedlock. In addition, the government in Natal continued to impose crippling poll tax for entering Natal only upon Indians.

In response to these strikingly unjust rules, Gandhi organized a large-scale satyagraha, which involved women crossing the Natal-Transvaal border illegally. When they were arrested, five thousand Indian coal miners also went on strike and Gandhi himself led them across the Natalese border, where they expected arrest.

Although Smuts and Gandhi did not agree on many points, they had respect for each other. In 1913, Smuts relented due to the sheer number of Indians involved in protest and negotiated a settlement which provided for the legality of Indian marriages and abolished the poll tax. Further, the import of indentured laborers from India was to be phased out by 1920. In July 1914, Gandhi sailed for Britain, now admired as "Mahatma," and known throughout the world for the success of satyagraha.

=== Part IV ===
Part IV. Mahatma in the Midst of World Turmoil

Gandhi was in England when World War I started and he immediately began organizing a medical corps similar to the force he had led in the Boer War, but he also faced health problems that caused him to return to India, where he met the applauding crowds with enthusiasm once again. Indians continued to refer to him as "Mahatma" or "Great Soul," an appellation reserved only for the holiest men of Hinduism. While Gandhi accepted the love and admiration of the crowds, he also insisted that all souls were equal and did not accept the implication of religious sacredness that his new name carried.

In order to retreat into a life of humility and restraint, as his personal principles mandated, he decided to withdraw from public life for a while spending his first year in India focusing on his personal quest for purity and healing. He also lived in a communal space with untouchables, a choice which many of his financial supporters resented, because they believed that the very presence of untouchables defiled higher-caste Indians. Gandhi even considered moving to a district in Ahmedabad inhabited entirely by the untouchables when a generous Muslim merchant donated enough money to keep up his current living space for another year. By that time, Gandhi's communal life with the untouchables had become more acceptable.

Although Gandhi had withdrawn from public life, he briefly met with the British Governor of Bombay (and future Viceroy of India), Lord Willington, whom Gandhi promised to consult before he launched any political campaigns. Gandhi also felt the impact of another event, the passing of G.K. Gokhale, who had become his supporter and political mentor. He stayed away from the political trend of Indian nationalism, which many of the members of the Indian National Congress embraced. Instead, he stayed busy resettling his family and the inhabitants of the [[Phoenix Settlement]] in South Africa, as well as the Tolstoy Settlement he had founded near Johannesburg. For this purpose, on May 25, 1915, he created a new settlement, which came to be known as the Satyagraha ashram ( derive from Sanskrit word "Satya" means "truth" ) near the town of Ahmedabad and close to his place of birth in the western Indian province of Gujarati. All the inhabitants of the ashram, which included one family of untouchables, swore to poverty and chastity.

After a while, Gandhi became influenced by the idea of Indian independence from the British, but he dreaded the possibility that a westernized Indian elite would replace the British government. He developed a strong conviction that Indian independence should take place as a large-scale sociopolitical reform, which would remove the old plagues of extreme poverty and caste restrictions. In fact, he believed that Indians could not become worthy of self-government unless they all shared a concern for the poor.

As Gandhi resumed his public life in India in 1916, he delivered a speech at the opening of the new Hindu University in the city of Benares, where he discussed his understanding of independence and reform. He also provided specific examples of the abhorrent living conditions of the lower classes that he had observed during his travels around India and focused specifically on sanitation.

Although the Indians of the higher-castes did not readily embrace the ideas in the speech, Gandhi had now returned to public life and he felt ready to convert these ideas to actions. Facing the possibility of arrest, just like he always did in South Africa, Gandhi first spoke for the rights of impoverished indigo-cultivators in the Champaran district. His efforts eventually led to the appointment of a government commission to investigate abuses by the indigo planters.

He also interefered whenever he saw violence. When a group of Ahmedabad mill workers went on strike and became violent, he resolved to fast until they returned to peace. Though some political commentators condemned Gandhi's behavior as a form of blackmail, the fast only lasted three days before the workers and their employers negotiated an agreement. Through this situation, Gandhi discovered the fast as one of his most effective weapons in late years and set a precedent for later action as part of satyagraha.

As the First World War continued, Gandhi also became involved in recruiting men for the British Army, an involvement which his followers had a difficult time accepting, after listening to his passionate speeches about resisting injustice in a non-violent manner. Not surprisingly, at this point, although Gandhi still remained loyal to Britain and enamored with the ideals of the British constitution, his desire to support and independent home rule became stronger. As time passed, Gandhi became exhausted from his long journey around the country and fell ill with dysentery. He refused conventional treatment and chose to practice his own healing methods, relying on diet and spending a long time bedridden, while in recovery in his ashram.

In the meantime, India’s unrest was overwhelming at the prospect of the British destroying the world's only Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire. While the British alleged that they fought to protect the rights of small states and independent peoples from tyranny, in India, an increasing number of people found this alleged commitment less than genuine.

After the end of the war, the British government decided to follow the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee, which advocated the retention of various wartime restrictions in India, including curfews and measures to suppress free speech. Gandhi was still sick when these events took place and, although he could not protest actively, he felt his loyalty to the British Empire weaken significantly.

Later, when the Rowlatt Act actually became law, Gandhi proposed that the entire country observe a day of prayer, fasting, and abstention from physical labor as a peaceful protest against the injustice of the oppressive law. Gandhi's plea generated an overwhelming response as millions of Indians did not go to work on April 6, 1919.

As the entire country stood still, the British arrested Gandhi, which provoked angry crowds to fill the streets of India's cities and, much to Gandhi's dislike, violence erupted everywhere. Gandhi could not tolerate violence so he called off his campaign and asked that everyone return to their homes. He acted in accordance with his firm belief that if satyagraha could not be carried out without violence, it should not take place at all.

Unfortunately, not all protesters shared Gandhi's conviction as ardently. In Amritsar, capital of the region known as the Punjab, where the alarmed British authorities had deported the local Hindu and Muslim members of the Congress, the street mobs became very violent and the British summoned Brigadier-General Reginald E.H. Dyer to restore order. Dyer prohibited all public meetings and instituted public whippings for Indians who approached British policemen. Despite these new regulations, a crowd of over ten thousand protesters gathered in the center of Armitsar, and Dyer responded with bringing his troops there and opening fire without warning. Tightly packed together, the protesters had nowhere to run from the fire, even when they threw themselves down on the ground the fire was then directed on the ground, ceasing only when the British troops no longer had ammunition. Hundreds died and many more were wounded.

This unfortunate occurrence became known as the Amritsar Massacre, it outraged the British public almost as much as Indian society. The authorities in London eventually condemned Dyer's conduct, forcing him to resign in disgrace. The effect the massacre had on Indian society became even more profound as more moderate politicians, like Gandhi, now began to wholeheartedly support the idea of Indian independence, creating an intense climate of mutual hostility. After the massacre, Gandhi eventually obtained permission to travel to Amritsar and conduct his own investigation. He produced a report months later and his work on the report motivated him to contact a number of Indian politicians, who advocated for the idea of independence from British rule.

After Amritsar, Gandhi attended the Muslim Conference being held in Delhi, where Indian Muslims discussed their fears that the British would suppress Caliphs of Turkey. Muslims considered the Caliphs as heirs of Mohammed and spiritual heads of Islam. While the British considered such suppression a necessary effort to restore order after World War I, the Muslim populations viewed it as slap in the face. Gandhi urged them not to accept the actions of the British. He proposed a boycott of British goods, and stated that if the British continued to insist on the elimination of the Caliphate, Indian Muslims should take even more drastic measures of non-cooperation, involving areas such as government employment and taxes.

During the months that followed, Gandhi continued to advocate for peace and caution, however, since Britain and Turkey were still negotiating their peace terms. Unlike more nationalistic politicians, he also supported the [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms|Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] for India, as they laid the foundation for constitutional self-government. Eventually, other politicians who thought the reforms did not go far enough had to agree with Gandhi simply because his popularity and influence had become so great that the Congress could accomplish little without him.

As the British remained determined to put an end to the Muslim Caliphate, they enforced the [[Rowlatt Act]] resolutely. Even Gandhi became less tolerant towards British practices and in April 1920, he urged all Indians, Muslim and Hindu, to begin a "non-cooperation" protest against the British rule by giving up their Western clothing and British jobs. As a personal example, on August 1, he returned the kasar-i-hind medal that he had received for providing medical service to the Boer War's wounded British army  in South Africa. He also became the first president of the Home Rule League, a largely symbolic position which confirmed his position as an advocate for Indian Independence.

In September 1920, Gandhi also passed an official constitution for the Congress, which created a system of two national committees and numerous local units, all working to mobilize a spirit of non-cooperation across India. Gandhi and other volunteers traveled around India further establishing this new grass roots organization, which achieved great success. The new British Viceory in India, Lord Reading, did not dare to interfere because of Gandhi's immense popularity.

By 1922, Gandhi decided that the initiative of non-cooperation had to transform into open civil disobedience, but in March 1922, Lord Reading finally ordered Gandhi's arrest after a crowd in the city of Chauri Chaura attacked and killed the local representatives of British authority. Gandhi, who had never encouraged or sanctioned this type of conduct, condemned the actions of the violent crowds and retreated into a period of fasting and prayer as a response to this violent outburst. However, the British saw the event as a trigger point and a reason for his arrest.

=== Part V ===
The British authorities placed Gandhi on trial for sedition and sentenced him to six years in prison, marking the first time that he faced prosecution in India. Because of Gandhi's fame, the judge, C.N. Broomfield, hesitated to impose a harsher punishment. He considered Gandhi clearly guilty as charged, despite the fact that Gandhi admitted his guilt and even went as far as requesting the heaviest possible sentence. Such willingness to accept imprisonment conformed to his philosophy of satyagraha, so Gandhi felt that his time in prison only furthered his commitment and goals. The authorities allowed him to use a spinning wheel and receive reading materials while in prison, so he felt content. He also wrote most of his autobiography while serving his sentence.

However, in Gandhi's absence, Indians returned to their British jobs and their every day routines. Even worse, the unity between Muslims and Hindu, which Gandhi advocated so passionately, had already begun to fall apart to the point where the threat of violence loomed large over many communities with mixed population. The fight for Indian independence could not continue while Indians themselves suffered disunity and conflict, all the more difficult to overcome in a huge country like India, which had always suffered religious divisions, as well as divisions by language, and even caste.

Gandhi realized that Independence and that the British had lost the will and power to sustain their empire, but he always acknowledged that Indians could not rely simply on the weakening of Britain in order to achieve independence. He believed that Indians had to become morally ready for Independence. He planned to contribute to such readiness through his speeches and writing, advocating humility, restraint, good sanitation, as well as an end to child marriages. He acknowledged that he had changed his position on many issues, like child marriages, and that he had not always managed to discern the most moral course of action in his life.

After his imprisonment ended, he resumed his personal quest for purification and truth. He ends his autobiography by admitting that he continues to experience and fight with "the dormant passion" that lie within his own soul. He felt ready to continue the long and difficult path of taming those passions and putting himself last among his fellow human beings, the only way to achieve salvation, according to him.

"That is why the worlds' praise fails to move me; indeed it very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions is far harder than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms,"

Gandhi writes in his "Farewell" to the readers, a suitable conclusion for an autobiography that he never intended to be an autobiography, but a tale of experiments with life, and with truth.

[[File:A throffer -- kill this person and get 7 dollars or I'll kill you.jpg|thumb|A photographic representation of the classic throffer: "Kill this man and receive £100—fail to kill him and I'll kill you.]]

In [[political philosophy]], a '''throffer''' is a proposal (also called an intervention{{refn|Offers, threats and throffers are "interventions, by others, in individuals' practical deliberations".{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|p=36}}|group=note}}) that mixes an offer with a threat which will be carried out if the offer is not accepted. The term was first used in print by political philosopher [[Hillel Steiner]]; while other writers followed, it has not been universally adopted and it is sometimes considered synonymous with ''[[carrot and stick]]''. Though the threatening aspect of a throffer need not be obvious, or even articulated at all, an overt example is

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kill this man and receive £100; fail to kill him and I'll kill you.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|p=39}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Steiner differentiated offers, threats and throffers based on the preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject when compared to the normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable than it would have been were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of [[coercion]], and form part of the question of the possibility of [[coercive offer]]s. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.

The theoretical concerns surrounding throffers have been practically applied concerning [[workfare]] programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving [[social welfare]] have their aid decreased if they refuse the offer of work or education. [[Robert Goodin]] criticised workfare programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly sex offenders, can result in more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in [[community psychiatry]], and management expert John J. Clancey, who talks about throffers in employment.

==Origin and usage==
The term ''throffer'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''threat'' and ''offer''.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}} It was first used by Canadian philosopher [[Hillel Steiner]] in a 1974–75 ''[[Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society]]'' article.{{sfn|Carter|2011|p=667}} Steiner had considered a quote from the 1972 film ''[[The Godfather]]'': "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". While the line seemed to be amusingly ironic (because a threat is being made, not an offer), Steiner was unsatisfied that the difference between an offer and a threat was merely that one promises to confer a benefit and the other a penalty.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|pp=37–8}} He thus coined ''throffer'' to describe the "offer" in ''The Godfather''.{{sfn|Bardhan|2005|p=39}} One prominent thinker who adopted the term was political scientist [[Michael Taylor (political scientist)|Michael Taylor]],{{sfn|Taylor|1982|p=13}} and his work on throffers has been frequently cited.{{sfn|Bardhan|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Zimmerling|2005|p=63}}{{sfn|Goti|1999|p=206}}

''Throffer'' has not, however, been universally adopted; Michael R. Rhodes notes that there has been some controversy in the literature on whether to use ''throffer'',{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}} citing a number of writers, including Lawrence A. Alexander,{{sfn|Alexander|1983}} David Zimmerman{{sfn|Zimmerman|1981}} and Daniel Lyons,{{sfn|Lyons|1975}} who do not use the term.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p= 150}} Some, including political scientists Deiniol Jones{{sfn|Jones|1999|p=11}} and Andrew Rigby,{{sfn|Rigby|1991|p=72}} consider ''throffer'' to be synonymous with ''[[carrot and stick]]'', an idiom which refers to the way a donkey is offered a carrot to encourage compliance, while noncompliance is punished with a stick.{{sfn|Ayto|2010|p=56}} Other writers, while electing to use the word, consider it a poor one. For instance, literary scholar Daniel Shore calls it "a somewhat unfortunate term", while using it in his analysis of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Regained]]''.{{sfn|Shore|2012|p=161}}

==Definitions==
In addition to Steiner's original account of throffers, other authors have suggested definitions and ideas on how to differentiate throffers from threats and offers.

===Steiner's account===
In the article that introduces the term ''throffer'', Steiner considers the difference between interventions in the form of a threat and those in the form of an offer. He concludes that the distinction is based on how the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ for the subject of the intervention when compared with "the norm". Steiner observes that a concept of "normalcy" is presupposed in literature on coercion, as changes in well-being for the subject of an intervention are not merely relative, but absolute; any possibility of an absolute change requires a standard, and this standard is "the description of the normal and preducable course of events, that is, the course of events which would confront the recipient of the intervention were the intervention not to occur".{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|pp=38–9}}

For an offer, such as "you may use my car whenever you like", the consequence of compliance "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer of the use of the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with "[[Highwayman|your money or your life]]", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|p=39}}

For Steiner, all of offers, threats and throffers affect the [[Practical reason|practical deliberations]] of their recipient in the same way. What is significant for the subject of the intervention is not the extent to which the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.{{sfn|Steiner|1974–75|pp=40–1}}

===Stevens's account===
Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens provides examples of what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives an example of an intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand "either you accept my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}}

In its place, Stevens suggests that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends not on the desirability of compliance and noncompliance when compared to the norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability would have been were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how it would have been without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as it would have been. A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what it would have been without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as it would have been.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=85}}

===Kristjánsson's account===
Political philosopher [[Kristján Kristjánsson]] differentiates threats and offers by explaining that the former is a proposal that creates an obstacle, while the latter is one kind of proposal (another example being a request) that does not.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=67}} He also draws a distinction between ''tentative proposals'' and ''final proposals'', which he feels earlier authors ignored.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=68}} A tentative proposal does not logically create any kind of obstacle for its subject, and, as such, is an offer. For instance, "if you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy" is a tentative proposal, as it does not logically entail that a failure to fetch the paper will result in no candy; it is possible that candy can be acquired by another route. In other words, [[Material conditional|if]] the subject fetches the paper, then they get candy.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=66}} By contrast, if the proposal was a final proposal, it would take the form of "[[if and only if]] you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy". This entails that candy can only be acquired if the subject fetches the paper, and no other way. For Kristjánsson, this kind of final proposal constitutes a throffer. There is an offer to fetch the paper ("if"), and a threat that candy can only be acquired through this route ("only if"). As such, an obstacle has been placed on the route of acquiring candy.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=67}}

Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites [[Joel Feinberg]], [[Alan Wertheimer]] and [[Robert Nozick]]) provided moral and statistical analyses of various [[thought experiments]] to determine whether the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|pp=68–9}} He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of [[moral responsibility]] would be required.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=69}}

===Rhodes's account===
Political philosopher and legal theorist Michael R. Rhodes offers an account of threats, offers and throffers based upon the perception of the subject of the proposal (and, in the case of proposals from agents as opposed to nature,{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}} the perception of the agent making the proposal.){{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=37, 66}} Rhodes presents seven different [[motivation]]al-want-structures, that is, seven reasons why ''P'' may want to do what leads to ''B'':

#''W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (intrinsic-attainment-want): "''B'' is wanted in and of itself; ''B'' is perceived by ''P'' with immediate approbation; ''B'' is valued in and of itself by ''P''."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' (extrinsic-attainment-want): "''B'' is perceived by ''P'' as a means to ''E'' where ''E'' is an intrinsic-attainment-want."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' (compound-attainment-want): "''B'' is both an intrinsic-attainment-want and an extrinsic-attainment-want; B is both ''W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' (extrinsic-avoidance-want): "''B'' is perceived by ''P'' as a means of avoiding ''F'' where ''F'' is perceived by ''P'' with immediate disapprobation (''F'' is feared by, or ''F'' is threatening to, ''P'')."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' (complex-want-type-A): "''B'' is both W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' (complex-want-type-B): "''B'' is both W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;."
#''W&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'' (complex-want-type-C): "''B'' is both W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;."{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=31}}

Proposals that motivate ''P'' to act because of ''W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''W&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent offers. Those that do so because of ''W&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent threats.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}} Rhodes notes that offers and threats are asymmetrical: while an offer requires only a slight approbation, a high degree of disapprobation is required before a proposal can be called a threat. The disapprobation must be high enough to provoke the "perception of a threat and correlative sense of fear".{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=37}} Rhodes labels as ''throffers'' those proposals that motivate ''P'' to act because of ''W&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''W&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'',{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=49–55}} but notes that the name is not universally used.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=39}}

For Rhodes, throffers can not merely be biconditional proposals. If ''Q'' proposes that ''P'' pay $10,000 so that ''Q'' withholds information that would lead to ''P''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s arrest, then despite the fact that the proposal is biconditional (that is, ''P'' may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for ''P'' independent of ''Q''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s proposal.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=42–3}} ''P''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s paying of ''Q'' does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=44}} The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal).{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=44, 57}} Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain ''neutral proposals'', and so not be throffers.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=44}} The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=56}} Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|pp=63–4}}

==Throffers and coercion==
Consideration of throffers forms part of the wider question of [[coercion]] and, specifically, the possibility of a [[coercive offer]].{{sfn|Anderson|2011}} Determining whether throffers are coercive, and, if so, to what extent, is difficult.{{sfn|Shapiro|2007|p=217}} The traditional assumption is that offers cannot be coercive, only threats can, but throffers can challenge this.{{sfn|Anderson|2011}}{{sfn|Kleinig|2009|p=15}} The threatening aspect of a throffer need not be explicit, as it was in Steiner's examples. Instead, a throffer may take the form of an offer, but carry an implied threat.{{sfn|Burnell|2008|p=423}} Philosopher [[John Kleinig]] sees a throffer as an example of an occasion when an offer alone may be considered coercive. Another example of a coercive offer may be when the situation in which the offer is made is already unacceptable; for instance, if a factory owner takes advantage of a poor economic environment to offer workers an unfair wage.{{sfn|Kleinig|2009|pp=15–6}} For Jonathan Riley, a liberal society has a duty to protect its citizens from coercion, whether that coercion comes from a threat, offer, throffer or some other source. "If other persons ... attempt to frustrate the right-holder's wants, then a liberal society must take steps to prevent this, by law if necessary. All exercises of power by others to frustrate the relevant individual or group preferences constitute unwarranted 'interference' with liberty in purely private matters."{{sfn|Riley|1989|p=133}}

Ian Hunt concurs that offers may be considered coercive, and claims that, whatever form the interventions take, they may be considered coercive "when they are socially corrigible influences over action that diminish an agent's freedom overall". He accepts that a possible objection to his claim is that at least some coercive offers do seemingly increase the freedom of their recipients. For instance, in the thought experiment of the [[lecherous millionaire]], a millionaire offers a mother money for treatment for her son's life-threatening illness in exchange for her becoming the millionaire's mistress. [[Joel Feinberg]] considers the offer coercive, but in offering a possibility of treatment, the millionaire has increased the options available to the mother, and thus her freedom.{{sfn|Hunt|2001|pp=141–2}} For Hunt, Feinberg "overlooks the fact that the millionaire's offer opens the option of [the mother] saving her child on condition that the option of not being [the millionaire's] mistress is closed". Hunt does not see the mother as more free; "while it is clear that she has a greater capacity to pursue her interests as a parent once the offer has been made, and to that extent can be regarded as freer, it is clear also that her capacity to pursue her sexual interests may have been diminished."{{sfn|Hunt|2001|pp=142}} Every coercive proposal, whether threat, offer or throffer, according to Hunt, contains a simultaneous loss and gain of freedom.{{sfn|Hunt|2001|pp=142}} Kristjánsson, by contrast, argues that Feinberg's account of "coercive offers" is flawed because these are not offers at all, but throffers.{{sfn|Kristjánsson|1992|p=67}}

[[Peter Westen]] and [[H. L. A. Hart]] argue that throffers are not always coercive, and, when they are, it is specifically the threat that makes them so. For a throffer to be coercive, they claim, the threat must meet three further conditions; firstly, the person making the throffer "must be intentionally bringing the threat to bear on X in order that X do something, Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", secondly, the person making the throffer must know that "X would not otherwise do or wish to be constrained to do" Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and, thirdly, the threat part of the throffer must render "X's option of doing Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; more eligible in X's eyes than it would otherwise be".{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=100}} As such, for the authors, there is the possibility of non-coercive throffers. The pair present three possible examples. Firstly, when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke; secondly, when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision-making; or, thirdly, when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer.{{sfn|Hart|Westen|1985|p=582}} Rhodes similarly concludes that if a throffer is coercive, it is because of the threatening aspect.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=69}} For him, the question is "whether one regards the threat component of a throffer as both a necessary and sufficient condition of the performance of a behaviour".{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=99}} He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act, then the proposal is not coercive. However, if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors, then it is tricky to determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced. He suggests that differentiating between "pure coercion" and "partial coercion" may help solve this problem,{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=69}} and that the question of coercion in these cases is one of degree.{{sfn|Rhodes|2000|p=100}}

==Practical examples==
The conceptual issues around throffers are practically applied in studies in a number of areas, but the term is also used outside of academia. For instance, it has seen use in British policing and in British courts.{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|p=63}}

===Workfare===
Conceptual thinking about throffers is practically applied in considerations of conditional aid, such as is used in [[workfare]] systems. For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky, the denial of [[welfare]] when subjects refuse work is the epitome of a throffer.{{sfn|Ezorsky|2011|pp=36–7}} Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher [[Robert Goodin]].{{sfn|Goodin|1998|p=180}} In the words of Daniel Shapiro, also a political philosopher, the offer aspect of workfare is seen in the "benefits one receives if one learns new skills, gets a job, alters destructive behaviors and the like", while the threat aspect is executed with "the elimination or reduction of aid, if the person does not, after a certain period of time, accept the offer".{{sfn|Shapiro|2007|p=217}} For Goodin, the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect. In this way, workfare can represent a "genuine" throffer, but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive, and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer. When, however, an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments, there is no genuine choice; the individual is, for Goodin, unable to refuse the throffer. This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer. This is presented as an argument against workfare, and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond [[paternalism|paternalistically]] by claiming that, regardless of issues of freedom, the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered.{{sfn|Goodin|1998|pp=181–3}}

Shapiro responds to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see [[welfare state]]) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by a refusal to accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn to family and friends for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable to determine whether or not people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.{{sfn|Shapiro|2007|pp=217–8}}

For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, editors of ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective'', workfare programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare involves the use of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of "new paternalism".{{sfn|Lødemel|Trickey|2001|pp=7–8}} The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, it can be argued that benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine [[Social safety net|safety net]]. Thirdly, compulsion undermines consumer feedback, and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.{{sfn|Lødemel|Trickey|2001|pp=7–8}}

===Prisoners and mental health===
Forensic psychologist Eric Cullen and prison governor Tim Newell claim that prisoners face a throffer once they are told that they must acknowledge their guilt before they are offered [[parole]]{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|p=55}} or moved to an [[open prison]]. Cullen and Newell cite the example of a prisoner who falsely admitted guilt to move to an open prison; once there, however, he felt he could no longer lie about his guilt, and confessed to the prison's governor. He was subsequently transferred back to a maximum security prison.{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|p=63}} In the case of [[sex offenders]], a throffer is presented when they are offered release if they take up treatment, but are threatened with extended sentences if they do not. Cullen and Newell are concerned about the predicament that these throffers present to prisoners, including those found innocent on appeal.{{sfn|Cullen|Newell|1999|pp=65–6}} Concerns surrounding throffers proposed to convicted sex offenders have also been discussed in print by Alex Alexandrowicz, himself wrongly imprisoned, and criminologist [[David Wilson (criminologist)|David Wilson]].{{sfn|Alexandrowicz|Wilson|1999|pp=144–5}} The latter observed the difficulties for those innocent people wrongly imprisoned who are faced with the throffer of having their sentence shortened if they "acknowledge their guilt", but noted that, as perspectives of prisoners were rarely considered, the problem is usually not visible.{{sfn|Wilson|2001}}

Likewise, therapeutic treatment of non-criminals with [[mental health]] problems can be considered in terms of throffers. In [[community psychiatry]], patients with mental health problems will sometimes be presented with the provision of social services, such as financial or housing aid, in exchange for changing their lifestyle and reporting for the administration of medicines. Psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez considers these throffers a form of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], and worries that they

&lt;blockquote&gt;
have multiple implications in regard to coercive mechanisms from implicit curtailments of freedom to ascription of vulnerability. The former would include threats to personal autonomy, instilling fear in regard to a potential loss of freedom, an increase of dependency with mistrust of one's own capabilities to manage the business of living and, hence, an increase of feelings and attitudes of helplessness.

===Business===
According to [[management]] researcher John J. Clancey, [[scientific management]] can involve the use of throffers. While [[piecework]] had been utilised since the [[Middle Ages]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] blended [[Rationalization (economics)|rationalised]] management with piecework, to create a new system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they were able to exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.{{sfn|Clancey|1998|p=145}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">'''Traditional engineering''', also known as '''sequential engineering''', is the process of [[marketing]], engineering [[design]], [[manufacturing]], testing and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] where each stage of the development process is carried out separately, and the next stage cannot start until the previous stage is finished.  Therefore, the information flow is only in one direction, and it is not until the end of the chain that errors, changes and corrections can be relayed to the start of the sequence, causing estimated costs to be under predicted.

This can cause many problems; such as time consumption due to many modifications being made as each stage does not take into account the next.  This method is hardly used today{{citation needed|reason=Experience in a number of engineering sectors suggests that many firms have not yet transitioned to concurrent engineering.|date=July 2016}}, as the concept of [[concurrent engineering]] is more efficient.

Traditional engineering is also known as '''over the wall engineering''' as each stage blindly throws the development to the next stage '''over the wall'''.

==Lean manufacturing==
Traditional manufacturing has been driven by sales forecasts that companies need to produce and stockpile inventory to support. Lean manufacturing is based on the concept that production should be driven by the actual customer demands and requirements. Instead of pushing product to the marketplace, it is pulled through by the customers' actual needs.

==Sequential engineering stages==
# Research
# Design
# Manufacture
# Quality Control
# Distribution
# Sales

==Disadvantages of sequential engineering==
# This orderly step-by-step process will bring control to complex projects but is very slow.
# In today’s highly competitive market place this can lead to product failures and lost sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manufacturing-works.com/lean/lean_vs_traditional.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094157/http://manufacturing-works.com/lean/lean_vs_traditional.php |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''transcendentals''' ({{lang-la|transcendentalia}}) are the properties of [[being]] that correspond to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|three]] aspects of the human field of interest and are their ideals; [[science]] (''truth''), the [[arts]] (''beauty'') and [[religion]] (''goodness'').{{cn|date=February 2018}} Philosophical disciplines that study them are [[logic]], [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]].

==History==
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Asha|Satya}}

[[Parmenides]] first inquired of the properties co-extensive with being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] fragment B 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]], spoken through [[Plato]], then followed (see ''[[Form of the Good]]'').

[[Aristotle]]'s [[substance theory]] (being a substance belongs to being ''qua'' being) has been interpreted as a theory of transcendentals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1028b4; Allan Bäck, ''Aristotle's Theory of Abstraction'', Springer, 2014, p. 210: "Since all that is, in any [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] is in virtue of having some relation to substance..., being a substance belongs to being ''qua'' being. Because of the centrality of substance for something to be, Aristotle says, "what is being is just the question what is substance." [''Metaph''. 1028b4] Given Aristotle’s account of focal meaning, it has turned out that x is a being only if x is a substance. Items in non-substantial categories are beings, secondarily, only given their being in substance. ... [Ι]n ''Metaphysics'' IV, Aristotle offers both transcendental and categorical items as proper subjects for first philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle discusses only unity ("One") explicitly because it is the only transcendental intrinsically related to being, whereas truth and goodness relate to rational creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' X.1–2; Benedict Ashley, ''The Way toward Wisdom: An Interdisciplinary and Intercultural Introduction to Metaphysics'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 2006), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic philosopher]]s elaborated the thought that there exist transcendentals (''transcendentalia'') and that they transcended each of the ten Aristotelian [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacDonald (ed.), ''Being and Goodness: The Concept of the Good in Metaphysics and Philosophical Theology'', Cornell University Press, 1991, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A doctrine of the transcendentality of the good was formulated by [[Albert the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentals-medieval/ Medieval Theories of Transcendentals (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil, [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], posited five transcendentals: ''res, unum, aliquid, bonum, verum''; or "thing", "one", "something", "good", and "true".&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', Q. 1 A. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saint Thomas derives the five explicitly as transcendentals,&lt;ref&gt;''De Veritate'', Q. 1 A.1''&lt;/ref&gt; though in some cases he follows the typical list of the transcendentals consisting of the One, the Good, and the True. The transcendentals are [[ontology|ontologically]] one and thus they are convertible: e.g., where there is truth, there is beauty and goodness also.

In [[Christian theology]] the transcendentals are treated in relation to [[theology proper]], the doctrine of [[God]]. The transcendentals, according to Christian doctrine, can be described as the ultimate desires of man. Man ultimately strives for perfection, which takes form through the desire for perfect attainment of the transcendentals. The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that God is Himself truth, goodness, and beauty, as indicated in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PC.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] references these three at Section 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Each transcends the limitations of place and time, and is rooted in being. The transcendentals are not contingent upon cultural diversity, religious doctrine, or personal ideologies, but are the objective properties of all that exists.

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Ujukatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "rectitude", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma]] teachings:
* ''Kāya-ujukatā'' - rectitude of mental body 
* ''Citta-ujukatā'' - rectitude of consciousness

These two mental factors have the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2377-2380}}
:Rectitude is straightness. The twofold rectitude has the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush tortuousness of the mental body and consciousness, and its manifestation is non-crookedness. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to hypocrisy and fraudulence, etc., which create crookedness in the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=229}}
:According to the ''[[Dhammasangani]]'' (par 50, 51) this pair of cetasikas consists in straightness and rectitude, being without deflection, twist or crookedness.
:The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that uprightness of cetasikas and of citta crush crookedness and that they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as deception and craftiness, which cause crookedness in mental factors and consciousness.
:Uprightness is the opponent of deception and craftiness.
