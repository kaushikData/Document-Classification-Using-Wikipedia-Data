Sport became increasingly popular in [[England]] and [[Ireland]] through the 17th century and there are several references to [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]], while [[bare-knuckle boxing]] was revived. The interest of gamblers in these sports gave rise to [[Professional sports|professionalism]]. The first known attempts to organise [[football]] took place in Ireland.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1681 — The ancient sport of [[Boxing|pugilism]] resurfaced in England during the late 17th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]], also known as [[prizefighting]]; the first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight was published in the ''London Protestant Mercury''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==[[Chess]]==
* Having been firmly established in Spain and Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries, chess became increasingly fashionable in France which, by the end of the 17th century, was the main centre of European chess.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Cotswold Games]]==
* [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]]'s [[Cotswold Games|Olimpick Games]] held in the [[Cotswolds]] from c.1604 to 1612.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606045814/http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |archive-date=2010-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{citation |last=Williams |first=Jean |title=The Curious Mystery of the Cotswold 'Olimpick' Games: Did Shakespeare Know Dover ... and Does it Matter? |journal=Sport in History |doi=10.1080/17460260902872602 |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=150–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* c.1611 — the world's earliest known organised cricket match was played at [[Chevening, Kent]] between teams styled [[Weald and Upland cricket team|Weald and Upland]] and [[Chalkhill cricket team|Chalkhill]].&lt;ref name=DU4&gt;Underdown, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1611 to 1660 — numerous court cases concerning cricket.&lt;ref name=LTL17C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |title=From Lads to Lord's – 17th century |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=17 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153250/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Village cricket]] thrived in the middle period of the 17th century, but there is no evidence of teams of county strength being formed at this time.&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt;
* c.1660 — in the wake of the [[English Restoration]], the popularity of cricket as a gambling sport encouraged investment and patronage; the introduction of professional players and the formation of teams representative of multiple parishes, possibly whole counties, mark the beginning of an evolution from the level of village cricket towards a major standard.&lt;ref name=HSA23&gt;Altham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W10&gt;Webber, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt; 
* 1695 — Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] on the Act's expiry in 1696; it is from this time that matters concerning cricket and other sports could be reported in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp428-435 |title=Charles II, 1662: An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Bookes and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses |publisher=British History Online |work=Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5 |date=1628–80 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 July 1697 — the ''Foreign Post'' reported a "A Great Match in Sussex" played for fifty guineas, the earliest known record of a top-class match.&lt;ref name=FL18C1&gt;Buckley, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TJM3&gt;McCann, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game had the earliest described rules requiring equal numbers, no playing of the ball on the ground, and banning the forward pass, with similarities to the modern game of [[Rugby football]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
'''Ireland'''
* 17th century — football games grew in popularity and were widely played under the patronage of the gentry; games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants and attracting wagers with purses of up to 100 guineas.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1670 — the earliest record of a recognised precursor to modern football dates from a match in [[County Meath]] in which catching and kicking the ball were permitted.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1695 — "foot-ball" is banned by the severe ''Sunday Observance Act'', imposing a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports on the Sabbath but it proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Golf]]==
'''Events'''
* 1603 — [[James VI of Scotland]] appointed Edinburgh bowmaker William Mayne as royal club-maker for his lifetime.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1605 — [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] became known as the home of horse racing in England after its discovery by [[James I of England|James I]] while out [[falconry|hawking]] or riding; the region has a long association with horses going back to the time of [[Boadicea]] and the [[Iceni]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1634 — by this time, spring and autumn race meetings had been introduced at Newmarket and the first Gold Cup event was held in 1634.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1654 — all horse racing banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and many horses requisitioned by the state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1664 — following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], racing flourished and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] instituted the [[Newmarket Town Plate]], writing the rules himself:{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
::"Articles ordered by His Majestie to be observed by all persons that put in horses to ride for the Plate, the new round heat at Newmarket set out on the first day of October, 1664, in the 16th year of our Sovereign Lord King Charles II, which Plate is to be rid for yearly, the second Thursday in October for ever".

==[[Lacrosse]]==
'''Events'''
* 15th–19th century — [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] played lacrosse to resolve conflicts, heal the sick, give thanks to the Creator and train for war in modern-day Canada and the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1636 — [[Jean de Brébeuf]], a French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary]], watched a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] game of lacrosse in what is now [[Ontario]], and he noticed that the sticks resemble a [[bishop]]'s [[crosier]] or "la crosse" in [[French language|French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2310">The national [[association football|football]] competitions in [[Belgium]] were stopped during the '''1944–1945 season''' due to [[World War II]]. [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|RSC Anderlechtois]] was the leader of the [[Belgian First Division|Premier Division]] when it was stopped however not all teams had played the same number of matches&lt;ref&gt;http://users.skynet.be/fb304341/kampioenen1/1945.htm Belgium Soccer History&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 4 clubs did not participate to that season: the title holders [[R. Antwerp F.C.|R Antwerp FC]], [[K. Beerschot V.A.C.|R Beerschot AC]], [[K. Lierse S.K.|K Liersche SK]] and [[K. Berchem Sport|R Berchem Sport]]. The [[Belgium national football team]] played their first official match since 1940 on the 1944 Christmas Eve.

==Overview==
At the end of the season, [[K.F.C. Rhodienne-Verrewinkel|RRC de Bruxelles]], [[K. Boom F.C.|K Boom FC]] and [[R. Tilleur F.C.|R Tilleur FC]] were promoted to the Premier Division, while the 4 clubs which did not take part in the 1943-44 Championship came back. No teams were relegated to Division I so the Premier Division was played with 19 clubs in [[1945–46 in Belgian football|1945–46]]. Also in the lower divisions, the number of teams was increased from 16 to 17 in Division I A, from 15 to 18 in Division I B, from 14 to 18 in Promotion A, 16 to 19 in Promotion B, 14 to 18 in Promotion C and 16 to 18 in Promotion D.

[[Image:Threeturn.GIF|thumb|250px|Three turn diagram]]
A '''3 turn''' is a [[figure skating]] element which involves both a change in direction and a change in edge.  For example, when a skater executes a forward outside 3 turn, the skater begins on a forward outside edge and finishes on a backwards inside edge.  There are eight 3 turns in all: one for each possible combination of direction (forward or backward), skating foot (left or right), and edge (inside or outside).

The turn is named for the tracing that it makes on the ice.  Each edge makes a curve, and the change of edge in between them is marked by a point.  It looks roughly like the number three.

Three turns are considered basic turns in figure skating.  Along with [[mohawk turn]]s, they are the first one foot turns (where only one foot is on the ice during the entry, exit and turn) learned by beginning skaters, and the most common way for skaters to change direction.  Three turns can also be used as the common entrance to a [[toe loop jump]] and the [[flip jump]].

'''Anaheim Ice''', formerly known as '''Disney Ice''', is an [[Ice rink|indoor ice rink complex]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. It is known for being one of the major works of [[architect]] [[Frank Gehry]]. It is the practice and training rink of the [[Anaheim Ducks]] of the [[National Hockey League]], and also hosts youth hockey, [[figure skating]] events, and public skating. Additionally, it serves as the home rink for the [[University of Southern California]] club hockey team,&lt;ref name="uschockey"&gt;[http://www.uscicehockey.com USC Ice Hockey website]&lt;/ref&gt; and was the site of the 2010 PAC-8 Hockey Conference Tournament, hosted by USC.&lt;ref name="pac8"&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/pages/PAC-8-Hockey-Conference-Tournament/271408391159 PAC-8 Conference  Tournament Facebook page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Disney Ice was commissioned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] then-CEO [[Michael Eisner]], who said, "I was looking for the next generation of American architects -- and he was on the list of architects who were pushing the envelope. We bought a hockey team. We needed a practice rink."&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/gehry_pop/disneyice.html American Masters: Frank Gehry], PBS&lt;/ref&gt; The facility resembles a pair of huge [[quonset hut]]s, and has a wooden interior with laminated beams and braces, producing "a nautical effect that recalls the inverted ship shape of Gehry's Disney Concert Hall".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 1995. 

When the Anaheim Ducks (then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim) were sold to [[Henry Samueli]] and his wife Susan in 2005, Disney Ice was also sold to the Samuelis, who renamed it Anaheim Ice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23650">The '''''Apito Dourado''''' (Golden Whistle) affair is a sports [[match fixing|corruption]] scandal in [[Football in Portugal|Portuguese football]] that first arose in 2004. Portuguese Judiciary Police (''[[Polícia Judiciária]]'') investigators named several football personalities as suspects (''[[arguido]]s'') of corrupting or attempting to corrupt referees, including [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa]], chairman of [[FC Porto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vernet-Riera|first=Josep|date=21 January 2010|title=FC Porto: Leaked Phone Taps Proof in Major Corruption Scandal|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/330214-fc-porto-leaked-phone-taps-proof-major-corruption-scandal|website=Bleacher Report|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=3 December 2004|title=Police raid HQ of European champions Porto|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200412/s1257302.htm|dead-url=yes|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|website=ABC Sport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204055737/http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200412/s1257302.htm|archive-date=4 December 2014|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the former [[Boavista F.C.]] chairman and [[Portuguese League for Professional Football]] President [[Valentim Loureiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 April 2004|title=Portugal football bosses arrested|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3643515.stm|website=BBC News|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although less notorious, a major part of the affair involved lower division referees and clubs, namely [[UD Sousense]] and [[Gondomar S.C.]], and club officials.

In December 2006, Pinto da Costa's former partner [[Carolina Salgado]] published the book ''[[Eu, Carolina]]'' ("Me, Carolina"), in which she made serious accusations against him. Pinto da Costa called these accusations "absurd" and said he would address them in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 December 2006|title=Pinto da Costa não comenta acusações|trans-title=Pinto da Costa does not comment accusations|url=http://www.tsf.pt/online/desporto/interior.asp?id_artigo=TSF176083|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|website=TSF|archive-url=http://archive.fo/hERM|archive-date=13 September 2012|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salgado's book caused the two cases in which Pinto da Costa was involved that had already been dismissed to be re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gomes|first1=Joaquim|last2=Rita|first2=Pedro|date=9 December 2006|title=Carolina Salgado testemunha da Judiciária|trans-title=Carolina Salgado - Judiciária's witness|url=http://www.correiodamanha.pt/noticia.asp?id=223726&amp;idselect=133&amp;idCanal=133&amp;p=22|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|website=Correio da Manhã|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014229/http://www.correiodamanha.pt/noticia.asp?id=223726&amp;idselect=133&amp;idCanal=133&amp;p=22|archive-date=28 September 2007|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, [[Porto]]'s Tribunal de Instrução Criminal decided that one of these cases, concerning a match between FC Porto and [[S.C. Beira-Mar|Beira-Mar]] where Pinto da Costa allegedly delivered an envelope containing €2,500 to a referee, would proceed to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pontes|first1=Carlos|last2=Ferris|first2=Ken|date=25 March 2008|title=Soccer-Porto president to stand trial for alleged bribery|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-europe-porto/soccer-porto-president-to-stand-trial-for-alleged-bribery-idUKL2587848820080325|website=[[Reuters]]|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major case involving FC Porto and Pinto da Costa, regarding a match between FC Porto and [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora|Estrela da Amadora]], where FC Porto allegedly offered prostitutes to the match referees, was dismissed for the second time in June 2008 and the main accusation witness, Salgado, accused of perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cabrita|first=Felícia|date=30 June 2008|title=Pinto da Costa não vai a julgamento e Carolina Salgado acusada de falsas declarações|trans-title=Pinto da Costa will not go to trial and Carolina Salgado accused of false statements|url=https://sol.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=99944|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|newspaper=[[Sol (newspaper)|Sol]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922092822/http://sol.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=99944|archive-date=22 September 2008|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Valentim Loureiro was found guilty of abuse of power but not guilty of corruption. He was sentenced to three years and two months of suspended jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 July 2008|title=Valentim condenado a três anos e dois meses de prisão com pena suspensa por abuso de poder|trans-title=Valentim sentenced to two years and two months of suspended jail time for abuse of power|url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/Portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=969333|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|website=[[TSF (radio)|TSF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203074740/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/Portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=969333|archive-date=3 December 2008|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the disciplinary committee of the [[Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional|Portuguese Professional Football League]], who had opened a parallel non-criminal proceeding called '''''Apito Final''''' (Final Whistle), sentenced Pinto da Costa to a two-year suspension and FC Porto was docked six points in the [[Primeira Liga]] and fined €150,000 for attempted bribery;&lt;ref name="uefa ban"&gt;{{cite news|date=4 June 2008|title=Porto not admitted to Champions League|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=705421.html|website=UEFA|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boavista FC was sentenced to relegation for bribery and referee coercion, and fined €180,000; [[U.D.

In January and October 2010, many of the Apito Dourado [[telephone tapping|wiretaps]] were uploaded to [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=3 October 2010|title=YouTube volta a revelar 'segredos' do futebol|trans-title=YouTube reveals football 'secrets' once again|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/sport/desporto/youtube-volta-a-revelar-segredos-do-futebol|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|website=Correio da Manhã|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005030731/http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/sport/desporto/youtube-volta-a-revelar-segredos-do-futebol|archive-date=5 October 2015|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
On 20 April 2004, the Apito Dourado operation was triggered, leading to the arrest of 16 people, including club officials and referees. Among them were the then [[Portuguese League for Professional Football]] President and Mayor of [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]], [[Valentim Loureiro]], the then Chairman of the Refereeing Board, [[José António Pinto de Sousa]], and the then chairman of [[Gondomar S.C.]], [[José Luís Oliveira]].

On 2 December, the [[Polícia Judiciária|Judiciary Police]] was supposed to conduct a search at [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa|Pinto da Costa]]'s home, but the Chairman of [[FC Porto]] had allegedly been previously informed by a source in the Judiciary Police, clearing the site beforehand. On the next day, Pinto da Costa presented himself willingly in the Court of Gondomar for questioning, and was released on a 200,000 euro bail.

On 20 April 2005, the "fruit affair", named as such because of the "fruit" (a codeword for prostitutes) which was used in tapped phone calls, involving FC Porto's chairman Pinto da Costa offering prostitutes to referee [[Jacinto Paixão]] before the match between FC Porto and [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora|Estrela da Amadora]], was dropped.

In January 2006, the Apito Dourado affair proceeded in Gondomar, and the public prosecution filed charges against 27 people, including Valentim Loureiro, José Oliveira and Pinto de Sousa.

By December, [[Carolina Salgado]], former partner of Pinto da Costa, published the book ''[[Eu, Carolina]]'' ("Me, Carolina"), in which she revealed new data about the case, mainly sports corruption situations, tax fraud, breach of judicial secrecy, assaults, perjury and obstruction to justice. This caused the court to reopen several court cases.

The court cases related to the FC Porto - Estrela da Amadora and [[S.C. Beira-Mar|Beira-Mar]] - FC Porto were reopened in early 2007. The first match involved FC Porto allegedly offering prostitutes to Jacinto Paixão (the referee); the second match involved Pinto da Costa allegedly delivering [[Augusto Duarte]] (the referee) an envelope containing 2,500 euro in order for him to benefit FC Porto. The affair became known as the "envelope affair".

In March 2007, the judiciary team responsible for the Apito Dourado affair announced that 56 inquiries were underway. In July, judge [[Maria José Morgado]] revealed that 20 charges were produced.

In March 2008, FC Porto was indicted for the corruption cases in the matches against Beira-Mar and Estrela da Amadora. For the same reason, [[C.D. Nacional|Nacional]] and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] were also indicted for bribering the referees of the matches against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]], and the match against Estrela da Amadora, respectively.

In October 2008, the court filed the case against Pinto da Costa, Augusto Duarte, [[Rui Alves]] and [[António Araújo (referee)|António Araújo]] regarding the Nacional - Benfica match.

In March, the public prosecution asked for the conviction of Pinto da Costa, António Araújo and Augusto Duarte regarding the FC Porto - Beira-Mar match.

==Criminal court decisions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
In June 2007, 13 of the 24 suspects in the Gondomar part of the affair, mainly related to lower division football, were convicted of charges comprising corruption, influence peddling and abuse of power. Valentim Loureiro was sentenced to three years and two months of suspended penalty for abuse of power, and lost his position of mayor of Gondomar. José Luís Oliveira, chairman of Gondomar SC and vice-chairman of the city of Gondomar was found guilty of 25 crimes of abuse of power and 10 crimes of corruption, and was sentenced to three years of suspended penalty. Pinto de Sousa was found guilty of 25 crimes of abuse of power and convicted to three years of suspended penalty.

João Macedo, António Eustáquio, Jorge Saramago (all three of them referees) were sentenced to pay a fine. The court considered proven that all three of them had received gold objects but that did not mean that the referees had breached the rules of the game of football association. It also stated that it was impossible to prove in which situation of a match the referee was acting intentionally in case of error.

Barbosa da Cunha, João Soares Mesquita, Ricardo Pinto, Carlos Carvalho, Valente Mendes, José Manuel Rodrigues, Sérgio Sedas, José Agostinho Silva and Leonel Viana were all acquitted by the Gondomar court.

On 3 April 2009, Pinto da Costa was acquitted on all criminal charges related to the Beira-Mar-FC Porto match of the 2003–04 season.

==Apito Final==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In 2007, the Portuguese League of Football started a non-criminal process calling it ''Apito Final'' (Final Whistle). On 9 May 2008, Boavista were relegated to the second-tier [[Segunda Liga|Liga de Honra]] for bribery and referee coercion and FC Porto were docked six points for attempted bribery. This caused [[UEFA]]'s Control and Disciplinary Body to ban FC Porto from the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League]].&lt;ref name="uefa ban"/&gt; This decision was later annulled by UEFA's Appeals Body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=17 June 2008|title=Porto admission confirmed|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=719886.html|website=UEFA|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning FC Porto was admitted to the competition. The Portuguese League has also sentenced Pinto da Costa to a two-year suspension; [[João Loureiro]], Boavista's chairman and Valentim Loureiro's son, to a four-year suspension; and [[João Bartolomeu]], [[União de Leiria]] chairman, to a one-year suspension. Five referees have also been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 May 2008|title=Apito Final: Boavista punido com descida de divisão, FC Porto com perda de seis pontos|trans-title=Final Whistle: Boavista punished with league relegation, FC Porto punished with loss of six points|url=http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1328267&amp;idCanal=56|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|newspaper=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621113108/http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1328267&amp;idCanal=56|archive-date=21 June 2008|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the clubs, chairmen, and referees punished filed appeals, except for FC Porto, whose punishment did not prevent them from winning the Portuguese League title.

On May 2011, the Central Administrative Court of the South of Portugal ruled that the decision of taking six points from FC Porto's global classification in the 2007–08 season, as well as the suspension of FC Porto's President, Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa for two years, both confirmed in 2008 on a controversial meeting made by the Justice Council of the Portuguese Football Federation, were to be ruled as "inexistent", due to the fact that those decisions were taken by a small number of the remaining counselors, after the meeting had been declared finished by the Council's President, and acting behind the President's and the Vice-President's back, as they were absent by then. The Portuguese Football Federation has announced it would appeal from this decision to the Administrative Supreme Court.

Pinto da Costa was acquitted of corruption in relation to the match between FC Porto and Estrela da Amadora 2003–04 on 23 September 2014. The Justice Council (FPF) president acquitted the FC Porto president of "the practice of infringement disciplinary very serious corruption (...) in the form of trial."

Also Jacinto Paixão, at the date first category referee, was acquitted of the practice of "very serious disciplinary infraction of corruption of the refereeing team", along with the remaining technical team: José Carlos Gladim Chilrito and Manuel António Candeias Square.

The civil court considered the wiretaps as illegal in this process. Therefore, the Disciplinary Commission of the League, now the professional section of the Disciplinary Council of the Portuguese Football Federation, had to remove the wiretaps as evidence, stating "unproven" charges.

==Wiretaps==
Several conversations between suspects were recorded during the Apito Dourado investigation, and many of them show talks about referee nominations and performances and alleged briberies. After the acquittal decisions, several wiretaps were released on YouTube and immediately went viral. Some of the most notorious ones include:

* A conversation (hours before the FC Porto-Estrela da Amadora match on 24 January 2004) between FC Porto's chairman, Pinto da Costa, and football agent António Araújo, in which Araújo asks for Pinto da Costa's authorization to send "fruit to sleep with" (an alleged codeword for prostitutes) to JP (alleged codename for Jacinto Paixão, the match referee). Pinto da Costa states in that conversation that "fruit" has already been sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx6Xz5rRuGY|title=Apito Dourado: 'Fruta para dormir'|date=22 January 2010|website=YouTube|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Apito Dourado: "Fruit for sleeping"|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, a video recording emerged that showed a confession by Jacinto Paixão, in which he confesses to the usual practice of accepting prostitutes and paid trips to either benefit FC Porto (against [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica]]) or harm Benfica (against [[Moreirense F.C.|Moreirense]]). Jacinto Paixão states in the video that he recorded such confession in case something should happen to him or his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxkbrt1oR_o|title=Apito Dourado: Confissão de Jacinto Paixão|date=|website=YouTube|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Golden Whistle: Jacinto Paixão's confession|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 May 2011|title='FC Porto ofereceu-nos raparigas'|trans-title='FC Porto offered us girls'|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/primeira_liga/artigo/2011/05/12/fc-porto-ofereceu-nos-raparigas|dead-url=yes|language=Portuguese|website=SAPO Desporto|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402024735/http://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/primeira_liga/artigo/2011/05/12/fc-porto-ofereceu-nos-raparigas|archive-date=2 April 2016|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conversations between Pinto da Costa, António Araújo and Augusto Duarte (a referee), where the three arrange a meeting at Pinto da Costa's house. This took place two days before Augusto Duarte was refereeing the match between FC Porto and Beira-Mar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtqzgmhAOIk|title=Apito Dourado: António Araújo e Augusto Duarte|date=21 January 2010|website=YouTube|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Golden Whistle: Augusto Duarte and António Araújo|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinto da Costa stated that this visit was due to the fact that the referee Augusto Duarte was seeking family advice from him. That the meeting had taken place was proven in court; however, the motive for it was not clear, so the charge was dismissed.
* A conversation between [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] president, [[Sequeira Nunes]], and Pinto de Sousa, chairman of the Refereeing Board, which took place on 24 March 2004, where the former denounces to the latter that Nacional's president, Rui Alves, is offering prostitutes to Nacional's matches' referees in order to benefit Nacional. A month prior to that conversation, Rui Alves complains to António Araújo that Nacional has not won a match refereed by Augusto Duarte for a long time. Araújo then asks for Rui Alve's permission to "work" the referee in order to benefit Nacional against Benfica. Three days later, Araújo phones Alves to inform him that everything was in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y7swlgm9lA|title=Pinto da Costa Novas Escutas 1|date=2 October 2010|website=YouTube|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Pinto da Costa New Wiretaps 1|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nacional won the match against Benfica (3–2).

==Aftermath==
The Apito Dourado process was a major event in Portuguese football and made international headlines at the time. Pinto da Costa, the most notorious suspect, was not convicted by the criminal court system, although being convicted by the Portuguese League's disciplinary committee to a two-year ban. FC Porto was convicted by the league's disciplinary committee to a six-point loss and ordered to pay a €150,000 fine.&lt;ref name="uefa ban"/&gt;

Despite no heavy convictions of penalties, the scandal seriously damaged Portuguese football's and FC Porto's reputation. Santiago Segurola, [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'s assistant director stated in 2008, "It is terrible what is happening to football (...) In the last few years proven corruption cases have emerged from Italy and Portugal (...) There are people who want to win so much that they are willing to break the rules in the most obscene ways. One of the things that surprises the most is that they (the teams involved) are always the same: [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], Porto..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/charlas/santiagosegurola/12052008.html|title=Charlas|last=Segurola|first=Santiago|date=12 May 2008|website=Marca|language=Spanish|trans-title=Chats|access-date=15 September 2017|quote=Son casi siempre los mismos: Juventus, Oporto...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apito Dourado scandal not only hit Portuguese football but also the whole Portuguese criminal procedure system. One of the big controversies was the fact that the prosecutors had "no doubts" about the Judiciary Police tipping off Pinto da Costa to clear his office hours before the conduction of a search. However, since the source of the leak was unable to be identified, the accusation was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=15 June 2007|title=Pinto da Costa avisado|trans-title=Pinto da Costa tipped off|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/exclusivo-cm/pinto-da-costa-avisado|language=Portuguese|website=Correio da Manhã|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decision which convicted lower division referees to fines has been subject of controversies. One of them is the justification it gave for not considering golden object offers to referees as relevant evidence. A wide debate has also been sparked between the right to privacy (invoked in this case as part of a claim that the unauthorized wiretaps were unusable evidence) and the demand for a more severe justice, regardless of the privacy rights of crime suspects.

The codewords used in the wiretaps have since become common Portuguese football jargon, expressions such as "''fruta para dormir''" ("fruit to sleep with", an alleged codeword for prostitutes), "dark coffee" and "latte" (referring to the skin tone of the prostitutes), "''rebuçado''" (literally translated as "candy") being used by both supporters and club officials to mock and attack clubs related to the Apito Dourado wiretaps, such as FC Porto, Boavista FC, CD Nacional and Gondomar SC.

[[CMTV]] started a series about Apito Dourado in 2013, regarding the 10th year anniversary of the scandal, by airing the already known wiretaps as well as releasing previously unknown ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMkhEanpnps&amp;list=PLfFPZiCPBl6e6JL6xhR7_PhXdxRk3-QHF|title=10 anos de Apito Dourado - Ep. 1 - Escutas Inéditas + Reportagem|date=2 April 2013|website=YouTube|language=Portuguese|trans-title=10 years of Golden Whistle - Ep. 1 - New Wiretaps|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Santiago''' ({{lang-it|Battaglia di Santiago}}, {{lang-es|Batalla de Santiago}}) was a [[football (soccer)|football]] match during the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]], played between host [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 2 June 1962 in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | title=Battle of Santiago |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=6 November 2003 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,,1079146,00.html |accessdate=26 June 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained its nickname from the level of violence seen in the game, in which two players were sent off, numerous punches were thrown and police intervention was required four times. The referee was [[Ken Aston]], who later went on to invent [[Penalty card|yellow and red cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=80623.html |title=Ken Aston – the inventor of yellow and red cards |date=15 January 2002 |website=FIFA.com |accessdate=21 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606022246/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=80623.html |archivedate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In this Group 2 clash, already heightened tensions between the two football teams were exacerbated by the description of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] in crude terms by two Italian journalists, Antonio Ghirelli and Corrado Pizzinelli; they had written that Santiago was a backwater dump where "the phones don't work, taxis are as rare as faithful husbands, a cable to Europe costs an arm and a leg and a letter takes five days to turn up", and its population as prone to "malnutrition, illiteracy, alcoholism and poverty. Chile is a small, proud and poor country: it has agreed to organise this World Cup in the same way as Mussolini agreed to send our air force to bomb London (they didn't arrive). The capital city has 700 hotel beds. Entire neighbourhoods are given over to open prostitution. This country and its people are proudly miserable and backwards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV4i32LWwXwC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=chile+vs+italy+1962+the+phones+don't+work&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MWOr6wyJs_&amp;sig=cL7nHArEs1EzgvJyNnx9wouobL0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G8WaVdm0MYSz-AHdsYHQBQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=chile+vs+italy+1962+the+phones+don't+work&amp;f=false |title=How to Win the World Cup |first=Graham |last=McColl |date=10 June 2010 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4070-5732-3 |page=115 |accessdate=21 October 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean newspapers fired back, describing Italians in general as fascists, mafiosos, oversexed, and, because some of Inter Milan's players had recently been involved in a doping scandal, drug addicts.&lt;ref name="US Soccer Players"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/the-battle-of-santiago |title=The Battle of Santiago |first=Ken |last=Pendleton |date=16 March 2007 |website=US Soccer Players |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalists involved were forced to flee the country, while an Argentinian scribe mistaken for an Italian in a Santiago bar was beaten up and hospitalised.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; 

Chile's organisation of and preparation for the tournament had been severely disrupted by the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]], the strongest earthquake ever recorded in human history. Articles in the Italian papers ''La Nazione'' and ''Corriere della Sera'' were saying that allowing Chile to host the World Cup was "pure madness"; this was used and magnified by local newspapers to inflame the Chilean population. The British newspaper the Daily Express wrote "The tournament shows every sign of developing into a violent bloodbath. Reports read like battlefront despatches. Italy vs Germany was described as 'wrestling and warfare'".

==Match==

===Summary===
The first foul occurred within 12 seconds of kick-off.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Italy's [[Giorgio Ferrini]] was sent off in the twelfth minute after a foul on [[Honorino Landa]], but refused to leave the pitch and had to be dragged off by policemen.

English referee [[Ken Aston]] did not see a punch by Chilean [[Leonel Sánchez]] to Italian [[Mario David]], which had come in retaliation for being fouled seconds earlier. When David attempted to kick Sánchez in the head a few minutes later (he missed), he was sent off.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US Soccer Players" /&gt;

In the violence that continued, Sánchez broke [[Humberto Maschio]]'s nose with a left hook, but Aston did not send him off.&lt;ref name="US Soccer Players" /&gt; The two teams engaged in scuffles and spitting, and police had to intervene three more times. Chile won the match 2–0.

When highlights from the match were shown on British television a couple of days later (not the same night, because film of matches had to be flown back to the UK), the match was introduced by BBC sports commentator [[David Coleman]] as "the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of the game."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">'''Robert Churchill McConnell''' (January 18, 1925 – March 18, 2012) was a founding member of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR), serving as its secretary and treasurer. In 1985, he won the first [[Bob Davids Award]], SABR's highest honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sabr.org/about/bob-davids-award Bob Davids Award winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McConnell was born on January 18, 1925 in [[Seattle, Washington]], though he moved around continuously throughout his youth. His family settled in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in 1935.

He joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in 1942, serving on the U.S.S. Whitman and U.S.S. Mifflin during his first three years in the service. He was sent for officer training at [[Vanderbilt University]] in July 1945, whence he earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in mechanical engineering in 1949.&lt;ref name=SABRbio&gt;[http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/5e8e335e SABR Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball research endeavors==
McConnell is credited with finding, filling in and fixing considerable amounts of missing, incomplete or incorrect historical baseball information, especially that concerning home runs.&lt;ref name=SABRbio /&gt; His work largely included seeking out old box scores, gleaning statistics and details from those, his new findings and sharing them with other baseball research enthusiasts - many of whom would be among the founding SABR members. Considered an expert on home runs, he co-wrote the book ''The Home Run Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/SABR_presents_the_home_run_encyclopedia.html?id=TNjtAAAAMAAJ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; His expertise was cited by the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', ''[[Associated Press]]'' and ''[[The Press of Atlantic City]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F89220D1145B1D2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM AP citing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AC&amp;p_theme=ac&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EBE57ED2C9E548D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Press of Atlantic City]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB087229BEED282&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Stl.

'''Bodybuilding''' is the use of [[Weight training|progressive resistance exercise]] to control and develop one's [[Muscle|musculature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emery, Michael|url=http://www.bodybuildingreviews.net/Bodybuilding.html|title=Men's Bodybuilding: A Short History|publisher=Bodybuildingreviews.net|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a '''bodybuilder'''. In [[professional bodybuilding]], bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through a combination of intentional [[dehydration]], elimination of [[Adipose tissue|nonessential body fat]], and [[carbohydrate loading]] to achieve maximum [[vascularity]], as well as [[Sun tanning|tanning]] to accentuate muscular definition. Bodybuilders may use [[anabolic steroids]] to build muscles.
&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Please do not add yourself or other bodybuilders you perceive to be notable. This is an encyclopedia introduction paragraph and is not intended to include a massive dump of everyone who has ever competed or won. Please discuss your additions on the talk page.

The winner of the annual [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia]] contest is generally recognized as the world's top male professional bodybuilder. The title was held by [[Phil Heath]], who won every year from 2011 to 2017, but in 2018 the winner was [[Shawn Rhoden]]. The winner of the Women's Physique portion of the competition is widely regarded as the world's top female professional bodybuilder. The title is currently held by [[Juliana Malacarne]], who has won every year since 2014. Since 1950, the [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [[Universe Championships]] have been considered the top amateur-bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as [[Reg Park]], [[Lee Priest]], [[Steve Reeves]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

== Early history ==
[[File:Sandow_ca1894.ogv|right|thumb|250x250px|Eugen Sandow in 1894]]

Stone-lifting traditions were practiced in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Tamilakam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/locked-horns-and-a-flurry-of-feathers/article4294435.ece|title=Locked horns and a flurry of feathers|first=D.|last=Karthikeyan|date=January 12, 2013|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western weightlifting developed in Europe from 1880 to 1953, with [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]] displaying feats of [[Physical strength|strength]] for the public and challenging each other. The focus was not on their physique, and they often had large bellies and fatty limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwarzenegger, A.|title=The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding|year=1999|location=Fireside, NY|isbn=978-0684857213|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eugen Sandow ===
Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by German [[Eugen Sandow]], now called the "Father of Bodybuilding". He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in "muscle display performances". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1936 [[musical film]] ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' depicts this beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.

Sandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in "[[cabinet card]]s" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect "Gracilian", a standard of [[Golden ratio|ideal body proportion]]s close to those of ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues. Men were judged by how closely they matched these proportions.

===First large-scale bodybuilding competition===
Sandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the "Great Competition". It was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]. Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|title=Bodybuilders Through the Ages|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Bodybuilders-Through-the-Ages.html|date=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of [[Nottingham]]. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy, now the most famous of all, was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe. In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to [[Steve Reeves]] for winning the inaugural [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]]. It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia]] contest, [[Frank Zane]], was presented with the bronze trophy, or at least a replica of it. Since then, [[Mr. Olympia]] winners have been awarded a replica of the bronze trophy.

On January 16, 1904, the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in America took place at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. The competition was promoted by [[Bernarr Macfadden]], the father of physical culture and publisher of the original bodybuilding magazines such as ''Health &amp; Strength''. The winner was Al Treloar, who was declared "The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Treloar/treloar.htm|title=Al Treloar at SandowPlus.com|publisher=Sandowplus.co.uk|date=December 28, 1903|accessdate=October 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629104307/http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Treloar/treloar.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treloar won a [[US dollar|$]]1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, [[Thomas Edison]] made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and [[Charles Atlas]] continued to promote bodybuilding across the world. [[Alois P. Swoboda]] was an early pioneer in America.

=== Notable early bodybuilders ===
[[File:Ed_Fury_and_Jackie_Coey,_1953.jpg|left|thumb|266x266px|Model Jackie Coey with Mr. Los Angeles contestant [[Ed Fury]] in 1953]]

Many other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include [[Earle Liederman]] (writer of some of bodybuilding's earliest books), [[Zishe Breitbart]], [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], Emy Nkemena, George F. Jowett, Finn Hateral (a pioneer in the art of posing), [[Frank Saldo]], [[Monte Saldo]], [[William Bankier]], Launceston Elliot, [[Sig Klein]], Sgt. Alfred Moss, Joe Nordquist, Lionel Strongfort ("Strongfortism"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Strongfort/course/lesson1.htm ''STRONGFORTISM''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802165327/http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Strongfort/course/lesson1.htm|date=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Frištenský]], [[Ralph Parcaut]] (a champion wrestler who also authored an early book on "physical culture"), and Alan P. Mead (who became an impressive muscle champion despite the fact that he lost a leg in [[World War I]]). Actor [[Francis X. Bushman]], who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor's model before beginning his famous silent movie career.

== 1950s{{ndash}}1960s ==
Bodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and gymnastics champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for bulking up and cutting down, the use of protein and other food supplements, and the opportunity to enter physique contests. The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, most notably the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB), founded by Canadian brothers [[Joe Weider|Joe]] and [[Ben Weider]]. Other bodybuilding organizations included the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the male-dominated contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many "Mr. (insert town, city, state, or region)" championships, the most prestigious titles{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia (which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world).

During the 1950s, the most famous competing bodybuilders{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Bill Pearl]], [[Reg Park]], [[Leroy Colbert]], and [[Clarence Ross]]. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as movies. The most notable{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Jack LaLanne]], [[Steve Reeves]], Reg Park, and [[Mickey Hargitay]]. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in [[North Hollywood, California]] and [[Vic Tanny]]'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no "hardcore" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of [[Gold's Gym]] in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed [[Muscle Beach]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The 1960s grew more in TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in popular shows and movies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==1970s{{ndash}}1990s==
=== New organizations ===
In the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Franco Columbu]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and others in the 1977 docudrama ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat. The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/|title=IFBB Professional League - Jim Manion, Chairman IFBB Professional League|publisher=Ifbbpro.com|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921210350/http://abhivacrossfitarena.com/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.

=== Anabolic/androgenic steroid use ===
[[File:Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_7.png|right|thumb|240x240px|[[Ronnie Coleman]], eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]], pictured in October 2009]]

This period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of "mass monsters", beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing to the present day with [[Lee Haney]], [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]], and [[Markus Rühl]]. Bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]] and [[Paul Demayo]] attained mass and size that were not seen previously but were not particularly successful at the pro level. At the time of shooting ''Pumping Iron'', Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that "you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He would later say that he does not regret using anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-676684.html|newspaper=CBS|date=February 11, 2009|title=Arnold: No Regrets About Steroids|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Canada]], steroids are listed under Schedule IV of the ''Controlled Drugs and Substances Act'', enacted by the [[Parliament of Canada|federal Parliament]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/ ''Controlled Drugs and Substances Act'', SC 1996, c. 19, Schedule IV, no. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bodybuilding Federation ===
{{Main|World Bodybuilding Federation}}

In 1990, [[professional wrestling]] promoter [[Vince McMahon]] announced that he was forming a new bodybuilding organization named the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]] (WBF). McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]]. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (later ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.

==2000s==
In 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest. Other professional contests emerged in this period, such as the [[Arnold Classic]], [[Night of Champions (bodybuilding)|Night of Champions]], and the European Grand Prix of Bodybuilding.

In the early 21st century, patterns of consumption and recreation similar to those of the United States became more widespread in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders emerged from former [[Eastern Bloc]] states.

=== Olympic sport discussion ===
In the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Frank_Zane.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Zane]], three-time Mr. Olympia]]
In the modern bodybuilding industry, the term "[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a "pro card" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifbb.com/ifbb-faq/ Ifbb Faq – Ifbb]. Ifbb.com (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2016-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.

===Natural bodybuilding {{anchor|MuscleMania|UFE|INBF|WNBF|INBA|PNBA|NPC|NANBF}}===
{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}
Due to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves "natural" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the "freakish" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.

In natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from [[Polygraph test|lie detectors]] to [[urinalysis]]. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations. Some of the larger ones include MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.

Other notable natural bodybuilding organizations include the [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) and the North American Natural Bodybuilding Federation (NANBF). NPC competitions screen competitors using ineffective lie detector tests to ensure fair practices. Such tests are very error-prone, and some competitors are not even tested.

This is how the NPC differs from the NANBF. The NANBF takes a more direct approach by taking urine samples from all competitors that are tested for steroids and any other substances on the banned list. The NANBF also differs from the NPC when it comes to judging. The criteria for certain poses differs from organization to organization. The NANBF even has an elevated calf pose which is unique for their competitions.

=== Female bodybuilding ===
{{main|Female bodybuilding}}
[[File:Nikki_Fuller.jpg|thumb|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performing a side chest pose]]
The first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in [[Canton, Ohio]] in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest—that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Jan, "Bodybuilding", St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the "Miss" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a gymnastic element to them. A study by the ''[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]'' found that female bodybuilders who are taking [[anabolic steroids]] are more likely to have qualified for [[Substance dependence|substance dependence disorder]] and have been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness and have a history of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Mitchell|title=Women and Anabolic Steroids: An Analysis of a Dozen Users|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|date=Nov 2010|volume=20|issue=6|pages=475–81|pmid=21079445|doi=10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181fb5370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E Wilma Conner competed in the 2011 NPC Armbrust Pro Gym Warrior Classic Championships in [[Loveland, Colorado]], at the age of 75 years and 349 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each competitor also performs a routine to display their physique. A [[posedown]] is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders spend a lot of time practising their posing in mirrors.

In contrast to [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions, where [[physical strength]] is important, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.

=== Preparations ===
==== Cutting and bulking ====
The general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the "off-season") and, approximately 12–14 weeks from competition, attempt to lose [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as "cutting"). The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance ([[calorie]] surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of growth.

The cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to oxidize fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Charles|author2=Frank L|author3=Evens W|title=Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding.|journal=Sports Med|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=317–27|pmid=15107010|doi=10.2165/00007256-200434050-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulking and cutting strategy is effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance.&lt;ref&gt;the science and development of muscle hypertrophy, Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, page 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions.  Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much fat-free mass as possible.

==== Clean bulking ====
Many non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt the conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the "bulking" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief "competition season".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high would be to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a decently low amount of fats,  "Gaining lean muscle means going for leaner cuts of meat, like flank steaks and fillets, chicken, and, of course, fish," says White. "Enjoy your meat with some starch: rice, beans, quinoa, whole-grain couscous, or sweet potato, for example".&lt;ref&gt;Giblin, Chris. "Clean Bulking: for Frustrated Hard-Gainers, Clean Bulking Is Attainable If You Focus Your Diet Accordingly with the Right Foods and Strategy." Joe Weider's Muscle &amp; Fitness, vol. 75, no. 8, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain a clean bulk it is important to reach calorie goals every day. Macronutrient goals will be different for each person, but, it is ideal to get as close as possible.

====Dirty bulking====
"Dirty bulking" is the process of eating at a caloric surplus, without finding the exact number of macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly often choose to use the "dirty bulk" method.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Rian. (April 6, 2015) [http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dirty-bulking-why-you-need-to-know-the-dirty-truth.htm Dirty Bulking: Why You Need To Know The Dirty Truth!]. Bodybuilding.com. Retrieved on 2016-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-competition ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

In the week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders may decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or "[[vascularity]]". The appearance of veins is further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[Sunless tanning|tanning products]] and applying [[Vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step is the use of weights to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size.

== Muscle growth ==
Bodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize muscle hypertrophy:
* [[Strength training]] through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.
* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]] and supplements when necessary.
* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.

Bodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto "eat clean, train hard, sleep well".

=== Weight training ===
{{Main|Weight training|Strength training}}

[[Weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is to repair this micro-trauma that result in [[muscle growth]]. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.&lt;ref name="pmid7371625"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|year=1980|vauthors=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25–34|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles?|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/strength/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, there is an increase in size and strength of the muscles (compared to if that same individual does not lift weights at all). However, the emphasis is different.

Many trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals. i.e. a bodybuilder will use sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to myofibrillar hypertrophy temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from "muscular confusion".

=== Nutrition ===
The high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[Food energy|calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. A sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]] in preparation for a contest. The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=Rob|title=Coach &amp; Athletic Director|date=March 2002|volume=71|issue=8|page=3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 5, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriadis|first=George|last2=Mitrou|first2=Panayota|last3=Lambadiari|first3=Vaia|last4=Maratou|first4=Eirini|last5=Raptis|first5=Sotirios A.|date=August 2011|title=Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue|journal=Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice|volume=93 Suppl 1|pages=S52–59|doi=10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6|issn=1872-8227|pmid=21864752}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein—which also induces the release of insulin—it is impossible to add muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00424-007-0368-2|pmid=17957382|title=Effects of contraction and insulin on protein synthesis, AMP-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation state of translation factors in rat skeletal muscle|journal=Pflügers Archiv|volume=455|issue=6|pages=1129–40|year=2007|last1=Miranda|first1=Lisa|last2=Horman|first2=Sandrine|last3=De Potter|first3=Isabelle|last4=Hue|first4=Louis|last5=Jensen|first5=Jørgen|last6=Rider|first6=Mark H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodybuilders seek out [[Glycemic index|low-glycemic]] [[polysaccharide]]s and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-[[Glycemic index|glycemic]] sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[Glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Protein ====
[[File:Protein_shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]
The motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s. Current advice says that bodybuilders should consume 25–30% of protein per total [[calorie]] intake to further their goal of maintaining and improving their body composition.&lt;ref name="LambertCP"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15107010|volume=34|issue=5|title=Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding|year=2004|journal=Sports Med|pages=317–27|vauthors=Lambert CP, Frank LL, Evans WJ|doi=10.2165/00007256-200434050-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a widely debated topic, with many arguing that 1&amp;nbsp;gram of protein per pound of body weight per day is ideal, some suggesting that less is sufficient, while others recommending 1.5, 2, or more.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Samantha (April 2004) [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-114819458.html Protein: a guide to maximum muscle: confused?

''FLEX Magazine'', January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some debate concerning the best type of protein to take. Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[Whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value|Biological Value (BV)]] and quick absorption rates. However, [[Whey protein|whey]] has a bigger effect than Casein on insulin levels. [[Whey protein|Whey]] triggers about double the amount of insulin release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114511006271|pmid=22289570|title=Greater stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with ingestion of whey protein isolate v.

Bodybuilders are usually thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of [[soy]], which is additionally avoided due to its claimed [[estrogenic]] properties. Still, some nutrition experts believe that soy, [[flax seeds]] and many other plants that contain the weak estrogen-like compounds or [[Phytoestrogens|phytoestrogen]]s can be used beneficially, as phytoestrogens compete with estrogens for receptor sites in the male body and can block its actions. This can also include some inhibition of [[pituitary]] functions while stimulating the P450 system (the system that eliminates hormones, drugs and metabolic waste product from the body) in the liver to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen.&lt;ref name="MikeFalcon"&gt;Falcon, Mike.

Contrary to certain rumors that animal-based protein is more suitable to trigger muscle growth than plant-based protein, a study by Mangano et al. (2017) could not provide any evidence for this. In contrast, if combined properly plant-based protein even has a higher biological quality. A combination of one part wheat protein (e.g. [[seitan]]) and two parts soy protein (e.g. [[tofu]]) has thus been favored by many bodybuilders. Some bodybuilders, such as  [[Patrik Baboumian]] and [[Robert Cheeke]], follow a strict [[Veganism|vegan]] diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2017/02/07/ajcn.116.136762|title=Dietary protein is associated with musculoskeletal health independently of dietary pattern: the Framingham Third Generation Study|first1=Kelsey M.|last1=Mangano|first2=Shivani|last2=Sahni|first3=Douglas P.|last3=Kiel|first4=Katherine L.|last4=Tucker|first5=Alyssa B.|last5=Dufour|first6=Marian T.|last6=Hannan|date=February 8, 2017|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|pages=714–722|via=ajcn.nutrition.org|doi=10.3945/ajcn.116.136762|pmid=28179224|volume=105|issue=3|pmc=5320406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meals ====
Bodybuilders often split their food intake for the day into 5 to 7 meals of roughly equal nutritional content and attempt to eat at regular intervals (e.g. every 2 to 3 hours). This method can serve two purposes: to limit overindulging in the cutting phase, and to physically allow for the consumption of large volumes of food during the bulking phase. Contrary to popular belief, eating more frequently does not increase [[Metabolic rate|basal metabolic rate]] when compared to the traditional 3 meals a day. While food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called the [[thermic effect of food]], it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across the meals of the day. Well-controlled studies using whole-body calorimetry and [[doubly labeled water]] have demonstrated that there is no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently.&lt;ref name="BellisleF"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellisle F, McDevitt R, Prentice AM|title=Meal frequency and energy balance|journal=Br.

==== Dietary supplements ====
{{Main|Bodybuilding supplement}}
The important role of nutrition in building muscle and losing fat means bodybuilders may consume a wide variety of [[dietary supplements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philen RM, Ortiz DI, Auerbach SB, Falk H|title=Survey of advertising for nutritional supplements in health and bodybuilding magazines|journal=JAMA|year=1992|pages=1008–11|volume=268|issue=8|pmid=1501305|doi=10.1001/jama.268.8.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various products are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase the rate of fat loss, improve joint health, increase natural testosterone production, enhance training performance and prevent potential nutrient deficiencies.  There are three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order for muscle building. The major nutrients – protein, carbohydrate, and fat – provide the body with energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Nutrients in Food|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/major-nutrients-in-food-topic-overview|publisher=webMd|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-enhancing substances ===
Some bodybuilders use drugs such as [[anabolic steroids]] and precursor substances such as [[prohormone]]s to increase [[muscle hypertrophy]]. Anabolic steroids cause muscle [[hypertrophy]] of both types (I and II) of muscle fibers caused likely by an increased synthesis of muscle proteins and are accompanied with undesired side effects including [[hepatotoxicity]], [[gynecomastia]], [[acne]], the early onset of [[male pattern baldness]] and a decline in the body's own testosterone production, which can cause [[testicular atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Muscle growth is more difficult to achieve in older adults than younger adults because of [[biological aging]], which leads to many metabolic changes detrimental to muscle growth; for instance, by diminishing growth hormone and [[testosterone]]. Some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose HGH treatment for adults with HGH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing [[muscle]] mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing [[bone]] density and muscle strength, improves [[cardiovascular]] parameters, and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexopoulou O, Abs R, Maiter D|title=Treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: who, why and how?

=== Rest ===
Although muscle ''stimulation'' occurs in the [[gym]] (or home gym) when lifting weights, muscle ''growth'' occurs afterward during rest. Without adequate rest and sleep (6 to 8 hours), muscles do not have an opportunity to recover and build. About eight hours of sleep a night is desirable for the bodybuilder to be refreshed, although this varies from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Some individual bodybuilders add a [[massage]], sometimes by professional masseuse, massager or masseur at the end of each workout to their routine as a method of recovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Thinking Through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics|date=2012|page=43|publisher=Cambridge University|isbn=978-1107019065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overtraining ===
{{Main|Overtraining}}
Overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where his workload exceeds his recovery capacity. There are many reasons that overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and can result in a hyperadrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.&lt;ref name="LonnieLowery_Overtraining"&gt;Lowery, Lonnie. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191307/http://www.t-nation.com/readTopic.do?id=459318 Testosterone Nation – The Warrior Nerd: Overtraining or Under-eating?] Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid overtraining, intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery. Timely provision of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and various micronutrients such as [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical. A mental disorder known as bigorexia may be held accountable of some people overtraining. Sufferers feel as if they are never big enough or muscular enough. Therefore, this forces them to overtrain in order to try and reach this goal physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|pmid=18759381|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that overtraining can be beneficial. One article published by ''[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]'' magazine stated that you can "Overtrain for Big Gains". It suggested that if one is planning a restful holiday and they do not wish to inhibit their bodybuilding lifestyle too much, they should overtrain before taking the holiday, so the body can rest easily and recuperate and grow. Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase. These are known as "shock micro-cycles" and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes.&lt;ref name="pmid14719980"&gt;{{cite journal

== Injecting oil into muscles {{anchor|synthol}} ==
'''Site enhancement oil''', often called "'''santol'''" or "'''synthol'''" (no relation to the [[Synthol (mouthwash)|Synthol]] mouthwash brand), refers to oils injected into muscles to increase the size or change the shape. Some bodybuilders, particularly at the professional level, inject their muscles with such mixtures to mimic the appearance of developed muscle where it may otherwise be disproportionate or lagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jason|first1=P|title=Synthol Abuse in Bodybuilding|url=http://proteinfart.com/64-of-the-grossest-synthol-freaks-you-never-wanted-to-see/|website=ProteinFart.com|date=March 31, 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120003847/http://proteinfart.com/64-of-the-grossest-synthol-freaks-you-never-wanted-to-see/|archivedate=January 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as "fluffing".&lt;ref name="synthol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Fitness/story?id=3179969&amp;page=1|title=Like Implants for the Arms: Synthol Lures Bodybuilders: Risky Injections Mean Massive Muscles for Users|last=Childs|first=Dan|date=May 16, 2007|work=ABC News|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthol is 85% oil, 7.5% [[lidocaine]], and 7.5% alcohol.&lt;ref name="synthol" /&gt; It is not restricted, and many brands are available on the Internet.&lt;ref name="popeye"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1782095.ece|title=Bodybuilders puff up with 'Popeye the Sailorman' oil jab|last=Foggo|first=Daniel|date=May 13, 2007|work=Sunday Times|accessdate=March 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524043824/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1782095.ece|archive-date=May 24, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of injected oil to enhance muscle appearance is common among bodybuilders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Paraffin oil injection in bodybuilders calls for preventive action |last=Henriksen|first=TF|author2=Løvenwald JB|author3=Matzen SH|year=2010|journal=Ugeskrift for Lægerer|volume=172|issue=3|pmid=20089216|language=Danish|pages=219–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adv" /&gt; despite the fact that synthol can cause [[pulmonary embolism]]s, nerve damage, infections, [[sclerosing lipogranuloma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaefer|first1=N|title=Muscle enhancement using intramuscular injections of oil in bodybuilding: review on epidemiology, complications, clinical evaluation and treatment|doi=10.1007/s10353-011-0033-z|volume=44|issue=2|journal=European Surgery|pages=109–115|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stroke,&lt;ref name="synthol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pupka|first=A|author2=Sikora J|author3=Mauricz J|author4=Cios D|author5=Płonek T.|year=2009|title=The usage of synthol in the body building|journal=Polim Med.|volume=39|issue=1|pages=63–5|pmid=19580174|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of oil-filled [[granuloma]]s, [[cyst]]s or ulcers in the muscle.&lt;ref name="adv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iversen|first=Line|author2=Asja Lemcke|author3=Mikael Bitsch|author4=Tonny Karlsmark|year=2008|title=Compression Bandage as Treatment for Ulcers Induced by Intramuscular Self-injection of Paraffin Oil|journal=Acta Derm Venereol|volume=89|issue=2|pages=196–7|doi=10.2340/00015555-0583|pmid=19326015|doi-broken-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darsow|first=Ulf|author2=Harald Bruckbauer|author3=Wolf-Ingo Worret|author4=Heidelore Hofmann|author5=Johannes Ring|year=2000|title=Subcutaneous oleomas induced by self-injection of sesame seed oil for muscle augmentation|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=42|issue=2|pages=292–294|doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(00)90144-0|pmid=10642691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schäfer|first=C.N.|author2=H.

As the injected muscle is not actually well-developed, it might droop under gravity.&lt;ref name="popeye" /&gt;

'''Candlestick Park''' was an outdoor sports and entertainment [[stadium]] in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the [[United States]], located in [[San Francisco]], in the [[Bayview-Hunters Point|Bayview Heights]] area. The stadium was originally the home of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[San Francisco Giants]], who played there from [[1960 San Francisco Giants season|1960]] until moving into Pacific Bell Park (since renamed [[AT&amp;T Park]]) in [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000]]. It was also the home field of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] of the [[National Football League]] from [[1971 San Francisco 49ers season|1971]] through [[2013 San Francisco 49ers season|2013]]. The 49ers moved to [[Levi's Stadium]] in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] for the [[2014 San Francisco 49ers season|2014]] season. The last event held at Candlestick was a concert by [[Paul McCartney]] in August 2014, and the demolition of the stadium was completed in September 2015.

The stadium was situated at [[Candlestick Point]] on the western shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. (Candlestick Point was named for the "Candlestick birds" that populated the area for many years.) Due to Candlestick Park's location next to the bay, strong winds often swirled down into the stadium, creating unusual playing conditions. At the time of its construction in the late 1950s, the stadium site was one of the few pieces of land available in the city that was suitable for a sports stadium and had space for the 10,000 parking spaces promised to the Giants.

The surface of the field was natural [[Poa|bluegrass]], but for nine seasons, from 1970 to 1978, the stadium had [[artificial turf]]. A "sliding pit" configuration, with dirt cut-outs only around the bases, was installed in 1971, primarily to keep the dust down in the breezy conditions. Following the 1978 football season, natural grass returned to the stadium.

==Park history==
When the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] arrived in San Francisco in 1958, they played their home games at the old [[Seals Stadium]] at 16th and Bryant Streets. As part of the agreement regarding the Giants' relocation to the West Coast, the city of San Francisco promised to build a new stadium for the team. Most of the land at Candlestick Point was purchased from Charles Harney, a local contractor. Harney purchased the land in 1952 for a quarry and industrial development. He made a profit of over $2 million when he sold the land for the stadium. Harney received a no-bid contract to build the stadium. The entire deal was the subject of a grand jury investigation in 1958.

Ground was broken in {{baseball year|1958}} for the stadium and the Giants selected the name of '''Candlestick Park''', after a name-the-park contest on March 3, 1959 (for the derivation of which, see below). Prior to the choice of the name, its construction site had been shown on maps as the generic '''''Bay View Stadium'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pot Luck|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=March 4, 1959|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KdMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9nYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5404,2134654&amp;dq=phillies&amp;hl=en|page=3-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first modern baseball stadium, as it was the first to be built entirely of [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref name="Storied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]] on the opening day of Candlestick Park on April 12, 1960, and the [[Oakland Raiders]] played the final three games of the 1960 season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raiders Face L.A. In 'Must' Game At Candlestick Park |newspaper=Oakland Tribune |date=December 4, 1960 |page=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their entire [[List of American Football League seasons#1961 .5B2.5D|1961]] [[American Football League]] season at Candlestick. With only 77 home runs hit in 1960 (46 by Giants, 31 by visitors), the fences were moved in, from left-center to right-center, for the [[1961 San Francisco Giants season|1961]] season.&lt;ref name=cpdimcut/&gt;

Following the [[1970 San Francisco Giants season|1970]] season, the first with [[AstroTurf]], Candlestick was enclosed, with grandstands around the outfield. This was in preparation for the 49ers in [[1971 San Francisco 49ers season|1971]], who were moving from their long-time home of [[Kezar Stadium]]. The result was that the wind speed dropped marginally, but often swirled irregularly throughout the stadium, and the view of [[San Francisco Bay]] was lost.

[[File:Candlestick Postcard - 01.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Candlestick as seen shortly after it was built in its original open grandstand configuration before being enclosed.]]

Candlestick played host to two [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s in its life as home for the Giants. The stadium hosted the [[1961 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|first of two games in 1961]] and later hosted the [[1984 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1984 All-Star Game]]. The Giants played a total of six postseason series at Candlestick; they played host to the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] in [[1971 National League Championship Series|1971]], [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]], and [[1989 National League Championship Series|1989]], the [[World Series]] in [[1962 World Series|1962]] and [[1989 World Series|1989]], and one [[1997 National League Division Series|NLDS]] in 1997.

The 49ers hosted eight [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship games]] during their time at Candlestick. The first was in January 1982 when [[Dwight Clark]] caught a game-winning touchdown pass from [[Joe Montana]] to lead the [[1981 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] to their first Super Bowl by defeating the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. Clark's play went down as one of the more famous in football history, and was dubbed "[[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]]". The last of these came in January 2012, when [[Lawrence Tynes]] kicked a field goal in overtime to defeat the 49ers and send the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] to their fifth Super Bowl. The most recent postseason game hosted by the 49ers at Candlestick was the [[2012–13 NFL playoffs#Divisional Playoffs|Divisional Playoff]] matchup between the 49ers and the [[Green Bay Packers]], won by the 49ers by a score of 45-31. The 49ers' record in NFC Championship games at Candlestick was 4-4; they defeated the Cowboys twice, in 1981 and [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|1994]], the [[Chicago Bears]] in [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984]], and the [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] in [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|1989]]. Their losses came against the Cowboys in [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|1992]], the Giants in [[1990 New York Giants season|1990]] and 2011, and the Packers in [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|1997]].

In addition to Clark's famous touchdown catch, two more plays referred to as "The Catch" took place during games at Candlestick. The play dubbed "The Catch II" came in the [[1998–99 NFL playoffs#Wild Card playoffs|1998 Wild Card round]], as [[Steve Young]] found [[Terrell Owens]] for a touchdown with eight seconds left to defeat the two-time defending NFC Champion Packers. The play called "The Catch III" came in the [[2011–12 NFL playoffs#Divisional playoffs|2011 Divisional Playoffs]], when [[Alex Smith]] threw a touchdown pass to [[Vernon Davis]] with nine seconds remaining to provide the winning margin against the [[New Orleans Saints]].

On October 17, 1989, the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] (measuring 7.1 on the [[Richter Scale]]) struck San Francisco, minutes before Game 3 of the [[1989 World Series|World Series]] was to begin at Candlestick. No one within the stadium was injured, although minor structural damage was incurred to the stadium. [[Al Michaels]] and [[Tim McCarver]], who called the game for [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]], later credited the stadium's design for saving thousands of lives.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt; An ESPN documentary about the earthquake revealed that the local stadium authority demanded that Candlestick Park undertake a major engineering project to shore up perceived safety red flags in the stadium. The authority pushed reluctant officials to get this done between the 1988 and 1989 baseball seasons, which prevented a "collapse wave" that would have killed thousands of fans and led to there being very few casualties of any kind in Candlestick after such a massive natural disaster. The World Series between the Giants and their Bay rivals the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] was subsequently delayed for 10 days, in part to give engineers time to check the stadium's overall structural soundness (and that of the A's nearby home, the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]]). During this time, the [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] moved their game against the [[1989 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] on October 22 to [[Stanford Stadium]], where they had defeated the [[1984 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] 38–16 to win [[Super Bowl XIX]] on January 20, 1985.

The NFL awarded [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] to Candlestick Park on November 2, 1994.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OowyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B-cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2467,966185&amp;dq=super-bowl+site&amp;hl=en] Candlestick Park had planned to make major renovations in preparation for the game; when that did not happen, the NFL owners awarded Super Bowl XXXIII to the Miami area during their October 31, 1996 meeting in [[New Orleans]].

[[File:Candlestick Park - 7-24-1971.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Candlestick Park upper deck expansion in progress during 1971 baseball season. Note the [[artificial turf]] then in use. ]]
In {{baseball year|2000}}, the Giants moved to the new Pacific Bell Park (now called [[AT&amp;T Park]]) in the China Basin neighborhood, leaving the 49ers as the sole professional sports team to use Candlestick. The final baseball game was played on September 30, 1999, against their long time rivals the [[1999 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], who won 9–4. In that game, all nine Dodgers starters had at least one base hit, while the stadium's final home run came from Dodgers' right fielder [[Raúl Mondesí]] in the 6th inning. The National League rivalry between the Giants and Dodgers, one of the oldest and most hotly contested in the Major Leagues, dated back to when both teams were based in New York City. When first the Dodgers, then the Giants, moved to California in 1958, the rivalry continued unabated.

Candlestick Park was, for its last several years as home to just the 49ers, in other words football-only, the only remaining NFL stadium to have begun as a baseball-only facility which later underwent an extensive redesign to accommodate football. This was evidenced by the stadium's curiously oblong and irregular shape, whereby views from a sizable section of lower-deck seating in the baseball configuration's right-field corner were so badly obstructed by the eastern grandstand of the football seating configuration that they were unusable for football games and would consequently sit empty. Since a football gridiron, including its end zones and benches along the sidelines, is much smaller than a baseball playing field and foul territory, this large grandstand, which provided thousands of prime seats along one whole sideline of the football field, was designed to be retractable. It would slide backwards for baseball games, under the upper deck, and provide a smaller section of baseball seating beyond the outfield wall in right. After the Giants played their 1999 season and moved away from Candlestick, this grandstand was left permanently in its football position, and the unusable seats were eventually removed.

On September 3, 2011, Candlestick Park hosted the first and only college football game in its history with a neutral site game between the [[California Golden Bears]] and [[Fresno State Bulldogs]] (Cal was designated the "home" team).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/42148/jeff-tedford-talks-fresno-state-ties |title=Jeff Tedford talks Fresno State ties

At approximately 5:19&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time on December 19, 2011, Candlestick Park experienced an unexpected power outage just before a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the 49ers and the [[2011 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]. An aerial shot shown live on [[ESPN]] showed a transformer sparking and then the stadium going completely dark. About 17 minutes later, however, the park's lights came back on in time for the game's kickoff. With 12:13 remaining in the second quarter, another power outage created yet another 30-minute delay before play resumed again. The [[2011 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers 2011 season]] ended at Candlestick Park with a loss to the [[New York Giants]] in the NFC Championship Game.

The 49ers played their final game at Candlestick Park on Monday, December 23, 2013 against the [[2013 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], winning 34–24 after a [[NaVorro Bowman]] interception that would be called '''The Pick at the Stick''' by some sports columnists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csnbayarea.com/49ers/instant-replay-49ers-survive-punch-playoff-ticket-stick-finale |title=Instant Replay: 49ers survive, punch playoff ticket in 'Stick finale |first=Matt |last=Maiocco |website=CSN Bay Area |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212400/http://www.csnbayarea.com/49ers/instant-replay-49ers-survive-punch-playoff-ticket-stick-finale |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This game was the facility's 36th and final game on ''Monday Night Football'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201312230sfo.htm |title=Atlanta Falcons at San Francisco 49ers - December 23rd, 2013 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most at any stadium used by the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2013/12/24/5240834/niners-vs-falcons-candlestick-park-mnf-history |title=49ers vs. Falcons provides final classic Monday Night Football moment at Candlestick Park |first=Matthew |last=Fairburn |website=SBNation.com |date=December 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[baseball park|baseball field]], the stadium was infamous for the windy conditions, damp air and dew from fog, and chilly temperatures. The wind often made it difficult for outfielders trying to catch fly balls, as well as for fans, while the damp grass further complicated play for outfielders who had to play in cold, wet shoes. Architect John Bolles designed the park with a boomerang-shaped concrete baffle in the upper tier to protect the park from wind. Unfortunately, it never worked. For Candlestick's first 10 seasons, the wind blew in from left-center and out toward right-center. When the park was expanded to accommodate the 49ers in 1971, it was thought that fully enclosing the park would cut down on the wind. Instead, the wind swirled from all directions, and was as strong and cold as before. Giants [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] [[center fielder]] [[Willie Mays]] claimed the wind cost him over 100 home runs. Nonetheless, he had less difficulty fielding balls in the windy conditions. Mays was used to playing in difficult conditions.  He'd begun his career at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York, which featured an enormous outfield.

During the first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star Game]] of {{baseball year|1961}} (one of two played in the park—the other was in {{baseball year|1984}}), Giants pitcher [[Stu Miller]] was blown off balance by a gust of wind and was charged with a [[balk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/sports/baseball/stu-miller-dies-at-87-blown-off-mound-in-all-star-game.html |title=Stu Miller, All-Star Who Committed a Windblown Balk, Dies at 87 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=Associated Press |date=6 January 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, wind picked up the entire batting cage and dropped it 60 feet (18 m) away on the pitcher's mound while the [[New York Mets]] were taking batting practice.

[[File:Candlestick Park 1965.jpg|thumb|250px|A Giants game at Candlestick in 1965.]]
The stadium also had the reputation as the coldest park in Major League Baseball. It was initially built with a [[radiant heating]] system of hot water pipes under the lower box seats in a space between the concrete and the ground. The pipes were not embedded in the concrete, however, and did not produce enough heat to offset the cold air. Both the city and the Giants balked at the cost of upgrading the system so it would work properly (e.g. removing the seats and concrete, embedding larger pipes, and replacing the concrete and seats). As a result, the Giants played more day games than any Major League Baseball team except the [[Chicago Cubs]], whose ballpark, [[Wrigley Field]], did not have lights installed until 1988. Many locals, including Giants' broadcaster [[Lon Simmons]], were surprised at the decision to build the park right on the bay, in one of the coldest areas of the city.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt; Attorney [[Melvin Belli]] filed a claim against the Giants in 1960 because his six-seat box, which cost him almost $1,600, was unbearably cold. Belli won in court, claiming that the "radiant heating system" advertised was a failure.&lt;ref&gt;''How Do Astronauts Scratch an Itch?'' by [[David Feldman (author)|David Feldman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giants eventually played on the reputation to bolster fan support with promotions such as awarding the Croix de Candlestick pin to fans who stayed for the duration of extra-inning night games. The pins featured the Giants' "SF" monogram capped with snow, along with the [[Latin]] slogan "''Veni, vidi, vixi''" ("I came, I saw, I survived"). Among many less-than-flattering fan nicknames for the park were "North Pole", "Cave of the Winds", "Windlestick", and "The Quagmire." Older fans called it "The Dump" in honor of the former use of the land. Ironically, the Giants played their last game at Candlestick under blue skies with no fog and a game time temperature of 82°, which was common for September games.

Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] visited the site as early as 1957 and was involved in the stadium's design from the outset. While he was aware of the weather conditions, he usually visited the park during the day—not knowing about the particularly cold, windy and foggy conditions that overtook it at night. Originally, Bolles' concrete baffle would have extended all the way to left field, which would have further reduced the prevailing winds. Nevertheless, the size of the structure was reduced for cost savings. In 1962, Stoneham commissioned a study of the wind conditions. The study revealed that had the windy conditions been known prior to construction, conditions would have been significantly improved by building the park 100 yards farther to the north and east.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~nathaz/doc/tribute-JEC-wind-engineer.pdf |title=A Tribute to Jack E. Cermak |first=Ahsan |last=Kareem |website=JEC Wind Engineer |year=2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914205144/http://www.nd.edu/~nathaz/doc/tribute-JEC-wind-engineer.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have meant building it on [[fill dirt|fill]], however, which is less stable during earthquakes. The stadium's location on the bedrock of [[Bayview Park, San Francisco|Bayview Hill]] provided more stability.

The winds were intense in the immediate area of the park. Studies showed they were no more frequent than other parts of San Francisco but are subject to higher gusts. This is because of a hill immediately adjacent to the park. This hill, in turn, is the first topographical obstacle met by the prevailing winds arriving from the Pacific Ocean {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} to the west. Arriving at Candlestick from the Pacific, these winds travel through what is known as the Alemany Gap before reaching the hill. The combination of ocean winds free-flowing to Candlestick, then swirling over the adjacent hill, created the cold and windy conditions that were the bane of the Giants' 40-year stay on Candlestick Point. It was indeed the wind and not the ambient air temperature that provided Candlestick's famed chill. The Giants' subsequent home, [[AT&amp;T Park]], is just one degree warmer, but is far less windy, creating a "warmer" (relatively speaking) effect. While the wind is a summer condition (hot inland, cool oceanside), winter weather is right in line with the rest of sea level Northern California (mild with occasional rain).

===Other design flaws and irregularities===
Candlestick was an object of scorn from baseball purists for reasons other than weather. Although originally built for baseball, foul territory was quite roomy. According to Simmons, nearly every seat was too far from the field even before the 1971 expansion.&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt; As with the radiant heating system in the grandstands, the heating systems in the dugouts were wholly inadequate. Players on other [[National League]] teams – especially if they'd played for the Giants beforehand – complained that the visitors dugout was colder than the Giants' dugout. This was due to two reasons: First, because the Giants' dugout included a tunnel to the clubhouse, heat from the clubhouse flowed into the dugout. The second reason was due to the placement of the dugouts. The Giants' dugout was located on the first base side, which was on the south side of the stadium. The visitors' dugout was located on the third base (west) side of the field.

On December 19, 2011, a transformer blew outside of the stadium before the [[2011 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]]' ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the [[2011 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], leading to two power outages. The first power outage, which occurred when the transformer blew at 5:19 pm local time, delayed the game start for 32 minutes. The second power outage occurred at 6:42 pm local time, with 12:13 left to play in the second quarter. This delayed the game for 19 minutes. The cause of the transformer's failure was due to a broken splice, according to [[Pacific Gas and Electric|PG&amp;E]] investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/us/city-patches-candlestick-park-power-system-and-waits.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first=John|last=Upton|title=City Patches Candlestick Park Power System, and Waits|date=January 13, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Beatles' final concert===
[[The Beatles]] gave their final full concert at Candlestick Park on August 29, 1966. Songs performed at the show were "[[Rock and Roll Music]]", "[[She's a Woman]]", "[[If I Needed Someone]]", "[[Day Tripper]]", "[[Baby's in Black]]", "[[I Feel Fine]]", "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", "[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]", "[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]", "[[Paperback Writer]]", and "[[Long Tall Sally]]". A rough recording of most of the concert was left unreleased, although the audio has leaked on to the internet. The recording cuts off during the last minute of the concert, interrupting "Long Tall Sally". The Beatles had not announced that this was to be their last concert, and if the foursome themselves knew, it was a closely guarded secret. In fact, much of the existing film footage of the concert was captured in color by a 15-year-old Beatles fan, Barry Hood.  A relatively small amount of black-and-white footage was shot by local TV news in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento. Hood released some of his film in a limited edition documentary titled ''The Beatles Live In San Francisco''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televideos.com/index.html |title=Beatles Last Concert Candlestick Park San Francisco DVD |website=televideos.com |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But more of Hood's rare footage remains in a vault, unseen by the public as of 2017.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; On August 14, 2014, former [[Beatle]] [[Paul McCartney]] returned one last time to become the closing act of Candlestick Park's long history.  McCartney's performance was within days of being 48 years after the Beatles played their famous last concert at Candlestick. To showcase the event, McCartney contacted Barry Hood and used a portion of his original 1966 Beatles film on a big screen at this last concert.

===Papal Mass===
[[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated a [[Papal Mass]] on September 18, 1987 at Candlestick Park during his tour of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Pope-in-S-F-When-John-Paul-II-blessed-AIDS-6520215.php |title=Pope in S.F.: When John Paul II blessed AIDS sufferers |author=Nolte, Carl |date=18 September 1987 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=HTES19870923.2.7 |title=Local faithful among throng at Candlestick for Pope's visit |author=Dugan, Barry W. |date=23 September 1987 |newspaper=Healdsburg Tribune, Enterprise and Scimitar |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated crowd of 70,000 attended the mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/thebigevent/2013/06/06/a-pray-on-the-green-the-pope-at-candlestick-in-1987/ |title=A Pray on the Green: The Pope at Candlestick in 1987 |website=The Big Event [blog] |author=Hartlaub, Peter |date=6 June 2013 |publisher=San Francisco Chroncile |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
Candlestick Park was also home to dozens of commercial shoots as well as the location for the climactic scene in both the 1962 thriller ''[[Experiment in Terror]]'' and the 1974 [[Richard Rush]] comedy ''[[Freebie and the Bean]]''. In February 2011, scenes for the film ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', starring [[Matt Damon]], [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Jude Law]], were filmed at the stadium. ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'' was also filmed there in 1996.

==Name changes==
[[File:1985 Mother's Cookies - Candlestick Park.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Candlestick Park was located about {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} south of downtown, pictured here in 1985]]
Some think that Candlestick Point was named for the indigenous "candlestick bird" ([[long-billed curlew]]), once common to the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/01/29/MN95857.DTL |title=Supervisor wants Candlestick to stick |first=Larry D. |last=Hatfield |date=January 29, 2002 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book "California Geographic Names" lists Candlestick Point as being named for a pinnacle of rock first noted in 1781 by the De Anza Expedition. This pinnacle was also noted by the U.S. Geodetic Survey in 1869. The pinnacle disappeared around 1920.

The [[naming rights|rights to the stadium name]] were licensed to [[3Com Corporation]] from September 1995 until 2002, for $900,000 a year. During that time, the park became known as "3Com Park at Candlestick Point", or, simply, "3Com Park". In 2002, the naming rights deal expired, and the park then became officially known as "San Francisco Stadium at Candlestick Point". On September 28, 2004, a new naming rights deal was signed with [[Monster Cable]], a maker of cables for electronic equipment, and the stadium was renamed "Monster Park". Just over a month later, however, a measure passed in the November 2 election stipulated that the stadium name revert to "Candlestick" permanently after the contract with Monster expired in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition H: Naming the Stadium at Candlestick Point|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2004/11/02/ca/sf/meas/H/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City and County of San Francisco had trouble finding a new naming sponsor due in part to the downturn in the economy, but also because the stadium's tenure as 3Com Park was tenuous at best. Many local fans were annoyed with the change and continued referring to the park by its original name, regardless of the official name. The Giants reportedly continued to call the stadium "Candlestick Park" in media guides, because the naming rights were initiated by the 49ers. Some even mocked the 3Com sponsorship. [[Chris Berman]], for instance, usually called it "Commercial-Stick Park." Local fans sometimes called it "Dot-com Park" (see [[Dot-com bubble]]). Freeway signs in the vicinity were changed to read "Monster Park" as part of an overall signage upgrade to national standards on California highways, but in 2008 those signs were changed back to "Candlestick Park".

The name change also ended up being confusing for the intended branding purposes, as without the "Cable" qualifier in the official name, many erroneously thought the stadium was named for the [[Monster.com]] [[employment website]] or [[Monster Energy|Monster Energy Drink]], not the cable vendor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2005/11/28/tidbits1.html|first=Jim |last=Gardner |title=Fans unclear on main Monster in 49ers lineup |website=[[San Francisco Business Times]] |date=November 28, 2005|accessdate=November 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2007, San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] announced that the playing field would be renamed "[[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] Field" in honor of the former [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and 49ers coach, who died on July 30 that year, pending the approval of the city government. The stadium itself retained its name as was contractually obligated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/10/BAGBFRGLUT8.DTL&amp;feed=rss.sports|title=8,000 turn out at Monster Park to say goodbye to Bill Walsh |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators still use this name occasionally, most recently when [[Jerry Rice]]'s jersey was retired.

On September 18, 2009, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''{{'}}s [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] used the mock-combination name "Candle3Monsterstick" in reference to the many name changes the stadium has gone through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/peter_king/09/18/week2/index.html |work=CNN |title=Fascinating matchup in San Diego, more to watch this weekend|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite numerous official and unofficial name changes over the history of the stadium and surrounding park/facilities, the stadium is lovingly referred to as "the Stick" by many locals and die-hard fans since its original titling of "Candlestick Park" in 1960.

==Replacement and demolition==
Plans were underway to construct a new 68,000-seat stadium at Candlestick Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/A-very-different-stadium-plan-2492680.php |title=A very different stadium plan |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=July 18, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2006, however, the 49ers announced that they would abandon their search for a location in San Francisco and begin to pursue the idea of building a stadium in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. As a result, San Francisco withdrew its bid for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympics]] on November 13, 2006, as its centerpiece stadium was lost. Groundbreaking for the Santa Clara stadium occurred on April 19, 2012. On May 8, 2013, the media announced that the name of the new stadium would be [[Levi's Stadium]]. The stadium opened on July 17, 2014, in time for the 2014 NFL season. The 49ers christened their new home a month after it opened.

A grassroots movement for the Giants to play another baseball game at Candlestick had existed since 2009. Many fans had hoped to see another game in 2010, the 50th anniversary of the Giants' first season at Candlestick Park, but this idea was dropped due to the cost. Although many fans wished for another Giants game at the ''Stick'', the Giants never returned to their former stadium for a final game.

With the departure of the 49ers, Candlestick Park was left without any permanent tenants. Demolition of the stadium was expected to occur soon after the 49ers played their final game of the 2013 season, but over time the date of demolition was moved back to late 2014, with several special events planned for the intervening period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shafer|first=Margie|date=December 18, 2013|title=Special Events Planned At Candlestick Park Before Demolition|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/12/18/special-events-planned-at-candlestick-park-before-demolition/|website=San Francisco CBS local |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, [[Paul McCartney]] announced that he would perform a concert as the last scheduled event in the 54-year-old stadium on August 14, 2014.&lt;ref name = "Macca"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Paul-McCartney-to-play-at-Candlestick-5426723.php |title=Paul McCartney to play Candlestick's final show |last1=Matier |first1=Phillip |last2=Ross |first2=Andrew |date=April 24, 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Beatles]] had performed their last scheduled concert at Candlestick Park 48 years earlier.

Demolition began in November 2014 as workers tore out seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Candlestick-teardown-begins-seats-being-5899250.php |title=Candlestick teardown begins — seats being ripped out |last1=Matier |first1=Phillip |last2=Ross |first2=Andrew |date=November 18, 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the developer withdrew a request to implode the stadium, possibly to be broadcast as part of the Super Bowl halftime entertainment. Instead, mechanized structural demolition commenced, which was favored over implosion due to local dust pollution concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Candlestick-Park-will-go-out-with-a-wrecking-6019420.php |title=Candlestick Park will go out with a wrecking ball, not a bang |last1=Matier |first1=Phillip |last2=Ross |first2=Andrew |date=January 16, 2015 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=March 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition was expected to be complete by March 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Demolition of Candlestick Park Underway; New Development to Replace Old Stadium |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Demolition-of-Candlestick-Park-Underway-New-Development-Replacing-Stadium-290783791.html |last=Fernandez |first=Lisa |date=February 4, 2015 |website=NBC Bay Area |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Candlestick-Park-disappearing-piece-by-piece-6062980.php |title=Last team at Candlestick Park is bent on demolition |last=Rubenstein |first=Steve |date=February 5, 2015 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=March 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not completed until September 24, 2015.

In 2014, 1,000 historic Candlestick Park Stadium seats were installed at [[Kezar Stadium]] for the public to enjoy. The renovation was funded by the City's Capital Planning General Fund. Mayor Edwin M. Lee helped re-open the stadium with a warm-up run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZoBxOZQGoE|title=Mayor Lee at Kezar Track Opening After $3.2 Million Renovation|first=|last=Mayor Ed Lee|date=17 March 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, 4,000 additional historic Candlestick seats were acquired and installed at Kezar. The seats were paid for by the [[San Francisco Deltas]] as a part of a $1-million improvement the team agreed upon to make use of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2016/12/02/candlestick-seats-will-soon-fill-sfs-kezar-stadium-thanks-to-san-francisco-deltas-soccer-team-49ers-nasl/|title=Candlestick seats will soon fill SF's Kezar Stadium, thanks to Deltas soccer team|date=2 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, [[Lennar Corporation]] and [[Macerich]] announced plans to build a dense "urban outlet" center incorporating retail and housing with underground parking on the Candlestick Park site. The proponents suggested that the new development would be completed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Major-urban-outlet-retail-center-planned-for-5897403.php |title=Major 'urban outlet' retail center planned for Candlestick Point |last=Dineen |first=J. K. |date=November 17, 2014 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=March 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has not proceeded, and the plan was suspended by its proponents in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/04/06/exclusive-fivepoint-suspends-work-on-635-000.html |title=Exclusive: FivePoint suspends work on 635,000-square-foot shopping mall at the former Candlestick Park  |first1=Roland |last1=Li |first2=Katie |last2=Burke |work=[[San Francisco Business Times]] |date=April 6, 2018 |accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Croix de Candlestick==
[[Image:Croix de Candlestick.JPG|100px|thumb|right|VENI•VIDI•VIXI "I came, I saw, I survived."]]

The Croix de Candlestick is an [[award pin]] that was given out to [[baseball]] [[Fan (person)|fans]] as they exited Candlestick Park at the conclusion of a night game that went extra [[inning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://goingdowntown.mlblogs.com/tag/croix-de-candlestick/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/10-best-things-being-giants-fan-190249508.html&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the ballpark's legendarily cold winds, the pin carried the motto, "[[Veni, vidi, vici|Veni, Vidi, Vixi]]" ("I came, I saw, I survived").&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Ballard]], [https://www.si.com/vault/2013/12/30/106414228/candlestick-19602013 "Candlestick Park, 1960−2013"], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', December 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to receive a pin, the fans would have to turn in their [[ticket stub]] at the entry/exit.  The pin, developed by team marketing director [[Patrick J. Gallagher]], was first issued in 1983.  In 1983 the [[San Francisco Giants]] played in five extra inning night games,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SFG/1983-schedule-scores.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; with a total attendance of 70,933 and in 1984 they played in five extra inning night games&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SFG/1984-schedule-scores.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; with a total attendance of 44,031. The pin was given out for several years. On September 28–30, 1999, tens of thousands of fans received the pin for attending the Giants' final three-game home stand at Candlestick, against the team's archrival, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].&lt;ref&gt;David Steele, [https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/The-Last-Night-Resembled-Very-Few-Others-3273078.php "The Last Night Resembled Very Few Others"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', September 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/28/sports/sp-15065 "Candle In The Wind"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist later called it "the smartest marketing promotional in Bay Area history".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hartlaub, [https://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2010/08/18/the-badges-of-honor-of-a-bay-area-resident/ "The badges of honor of a Bay Area resident"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Mayor Ed Lee...: I’m a real San Franciscan, because I’ve EARNED a Croix de Candlestick and whenever I hear the phrase “the catch” I have to take a moment...)"&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.sfgate.com/culture/2012/02/01/when-can-you-call-yourself-a-native/ SF Gate, "When can you call yourself a native"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"They don’t give out a Croix de Candlestick to fans who stay ’til the bitter end at Levi’s, or even a Croix de Fiddlesticks, but this time the late birds got their reward."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/ostler/article/49ers-Jimmy-Garoppolo-provides-reason-for-12385238.php%20SF%20Chronicle 49ers’ Jimmy Garoppolo provides reason for excitement]

It was set up in 1993 to provide ocean sailing for [[Disability|disabled people]] in its purpose designed and built cruising yachts and inland [[dinghy]] sailing in Martin 16 keel boats and WETA [[trimaran]]s. DSA has developed into an umbrella or [[Holding company|holding charity]] for a number of projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://patient.info/support/the-disabled-sailors-association&lt;/ref&gt;

==RoRo Sailing Project==
&lt;ref name="sailability.co.uk"&gt;http://www.sailability.co.uk/directory.php?sector=8&amp;id=0086&amp;offset=10&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1995 RoRo has provided ocean [[sailing]] facilities for disabled people. The funds were raised through Grant Making Trusts, enabling the design and built of two 11 meter [[wheelchair accessible]] ocean cruising [[yacht]]s ''Spirit of Scott Bader'' and ''Verity K''. Both yachts are based in [[Portsmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tourismforall.org.uk/Water-Based-Activities.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian designed and built dinghies are quite common in [[North America]] but were unknown in [[Europe]] until DSA started importing them. The Martin16 provides access to the inland waters for disabled and disadvantaged. They have been used for the British [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] team members to practice, and as a training boat for disabled engaged on ambitious long range sailing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.sailforce.ie/pages/martin-16.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721130355/http://cms.sailforce.ie/pages/martin-16.php |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girls on the Run''' is a North American non-profit program that works to encourage pre-teen girls to develop [[Self-esteem|self-respect]] and [[health]]y lifestyles through dynamic, interactive lessons and [[running]] games, culminating in a celebratory 5k run. The organization's curricula seek to address all aspects of the girls' development to enhance their physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual [[well-being]] while establishing a lifetime appreciation of health and fitness.

Local chapters (called "councils") operate under an [[umbrella organization]], Girls on the Run International, which develops curricula and provides support to the local councils while encouraging the formation of additional councils in areas not yet served by the program.

==Mission==
The organization describes its mission as follows: "We inspire girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a fun, experience-based curriculum which creatively integrates running."&lt;ref name = AnnRpt2013 /&gt; It further describes a vision: "We envision a world where every girl knows and activates her limitless potential and is free to boldly pursue her dreams."&lt;ref name = "Our Mission &amp; Core Values"&gt;Girls on the Run International, "[http://www.girlsontherun.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Mission]".  Accessed 2013.06.25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It accomplishes these goals by combining training for a running race with lessons to enhance the participants' social, physical, and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Startup Princess, "[http://startupprincess.com/living-the-american-dream-molly-barker-founder-of-girls-on-the-run/ Living The American Dream: Molly Barker, Founder of Girls on The Run]". July 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Girls on the Run was established in 1996 in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Program founder Mary W. ("Molly") Barker (featured in the movie "Apple Pie"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applepiemovie.com/index.htm Apple Pie: Raising Champions]. Accessed 2010.04.16.&lt;/ref&gt;) struggled in her own life, including a bout with alcoholism, and came to the realization that a [[running]] program gave her "respect for my body and all the things it can do."&lt;ref name = "Express"&gt;Vicky Hallett, "[http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2010/04/girls-on-the-run-molly-barker.php Getting on Track in Life]", (Washington, D.C.) ''Express'', April 13, 2010, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; She founded Girls on the Run with an initial group of 13 girls. The next season, there were 26, and the season after that, 75. In 2000, Girls on the Run International was recognized as a [[501(c)(3)|non-profit charitable]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;Girls on the Run International, "[http://www.girlsontherun.org/ourfounder.html Our Founder]". Accessed 2010.04.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Girls on the Run International, "[http://www.girlsontherun.org/Who-We-Are/Our-History Our History]".&lt;/ref&gt; The program has grown to the point that in fiscal 2013, 212 local councils served 138,776 girls.&lt;ref name = "AnnRpt2013"&gt;Girls On the Run International, ''2013 Annual Report''.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of spring of 2015, the program reported that it had served its one millionth girl overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlsontherun.org/ Home Page], Girls on the Run International; accessed 2015.06.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
Girls on the Run operates two programs for its participants, to keep the lessons age-appropriate.  "Girls on the Run" is for 3rd–6th graders (approximately 8 through 12 years old).  "Heart &amp; Sole" is directed to 7th–8th graders (12 through 14 years old).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.girlsontherun.org/What-We-Do/6th-8th-Grade-Program]".  Accessed 2013.06.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting twice a week in small teams of 8-20 girls, the program teaches life skills through fun, engaging lessons that celebrate the joy of movement. The 24-lesson curriculum is taught by certified coaches and includes three parts: understanding ourselves, valuing relationships and teamwork, and understanding how we connect with and shape the world at large. Over the course of the program, participants develop and improve competence, feel confidence in who they are, develop strength of character, respond to others and themselves with care and compassion, create positive connections with peers and adults, and make a meaningful contribution to community and society.&lt;ref&gt;Girls on the Run International, "[http://www.girlsontherun.org/What-We-Do What We Do]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girls on the Run===
Over a period of 10–12 weeks, girls in the 3rd through 5th grade participate in an after-school program designed to allow every girl to recognize her inner strength.  The Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence and celebrate all that makes them unique.&lt;ref Name = "GotRP"&gt;[http://www.girlsontherun.org/What-We-Do/3rd-5th-Grade-Program 3rd-5th Grade Program], Girls on the Run; accessed 2014.03.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental and physical development. The Girls on the Run program uses the tenants of [[sports-based youth development]] to determine program activities, curricula, staff training, and guiding principles. Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age.  They also develop strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. The program starts with helping the girls get a better understanding of who they are and what is important to them.  Then, participants look at the importance of teamwork and healthy relationships.  Finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world.&lt;ref name = "GotRP" /&gt;

Physical activity is woven into the program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health.  At the end of each three-month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run [[5k run|5k]] event, which involves other Girls on the Run teams from the community and possibly other councils.  This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum.  Coaches, parents, and community members participate, cheer, and celebrate.&lt;ref name = GotRP /&gt;

===Heart &amp; Sole===
Middle-school girls face many challenges that can affect their emotional and physical well-being, and which are different from those faced by younger girls. The Heart &amp; Sole curriculum is designed to address these challenges by empowering participants to make thoughtful and healthy decisions. Like Girls on the Run, the Heart &amp; Sole curriculum is delivered over the course of 10 to 12 weeks and addresses the societal, mental, and emotional challenges peculiar to that age.&lt;ref name = GoTP&gt;[http://www.girlsontherun.org/What-We-Do/6th-8th-Grade-Program 6th-8th Grade Program], Girls on the Run; accessed 2014.03.18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the curriculum for younger girls, Heart &amp; Sole begins by encouraging the participants to examine and better understand who they are and what is important to them. Once they have a deeper awareness of their individual values, they look at the role of teams and healthy relationships. Lastly, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world.&lt;ref name = GoTP /&gt;

The curriculum allows for more mature handling of such topics as eating disorders, internet safety, relationships, cyber-bullying and tobacco and alcohol use. Participants discuss these subjects on an in-depth level and use their personal experiences to shape thought-provoking interaction. The Heart &amp; Sole curriculum is designed to provide each girl with "the skills to shut out the noise of the external world that is attempting to limit who she is and to instead listen to her individual truth – the one that will lead her toward an enriching and contented life."&lt;ref name = GoTP /&gt;

As might be expected, running is a significant part of the curriculum.  Heart &amp; Sole uses physical activity to inspire and motivate girls throughout the program, to encourage lifelong health and fitness, and most importantly, to build confidence through accomplishment. At the end of each season (fall and spring), the girls and their running buddies complete in the semiannual 5k running event, which gives the girls a tangible sense of achievement as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals.&lt;ref name = GoTP /&gt;

The final of the men's [[artistic gymnastics]] team all-around competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] was held at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|North Greenwich Arena]] on 30 July. Eight teams of five gymnasts competed from a total of twelve teams which had qualified for the Games.

Teams qualified for the final through the general artistic qualification performances on 28 July 2012. The eight teams with the best combined scores in the qualification moved on to the team final. In the final, each team selected three gymnasts to compete on each apparatus. All three scores counted for the team score; the three scores on each apparatus were summed to give a final team score.

[[China at the 2012 Summer Olympics|China]] won the gold medal with a total score of 275.997 points. In second place with 271.952 points was [[Japan at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Japan]] and [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] took bronze with 271.711.

==Controversy==
Entering the final rotation of the all-around, China held the lead, followed by Japan, Ukraine, and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Guardian_liveblog&gt;{{cite news|last=Glendenning|first=Barry|title=Olympic gymnastics 2012: men's final – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/30/olympic-gymnastics-2012-mens-final-live|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain earned high scores on the floor exercise, allowing them to pass Ukraine in the standings despite a solid rings programme from the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, however, Japan were encountering significant troubles on their final apparatus, the pommel horse. First [[Kazuhito Tanaka]] fell during his routine, for a low score of 13.433. Following a solid routine, a bad dismount from the pommel horse by [[Kōhei Uchimura]] initially led to a modest score of 13.466,&lt;ref name=Sun_20120801&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Dan|title=Bronze for our boys - after Japan win dramatic appeal|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/olympics/4463178/Team-gymnastics-Great-Britain-win-dramatic-bronze.html|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=The Sun|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; knocking his team down to fourth place and moving Great Britain to second for a silver medal and Ukraine back to third for a bronze. However, the Japanese team filed an appeal, believing that Uchimura had been given the incorrect difficulty score (D-score) for his dismount, which even though botched in execution, it was landed without an actual fall. After an in-depth video review by the Men's Technical Committee, headed by Adrian Stoica, Uchimura's dismount was credited with the correct D-score for the dismount (0.7 points for the G-level skill), increasing his total score to 14.166, bringing Japan back to second place for a silver medal, and knocking Great Britain down to third place for a bronze and Ukraine to fourth place, out of the medal standings.&lt;ref name=Sun_20120801/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= Bleacher Report |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1278131-2012-olympic-mens-gymnastics-judges-us-fold-under-pressure-of-biggest-stage |title= 2012 Olympic Men's Gymnastics: Judges, US Fold Under Pressure of Biggest Stage |author= Liviu Bird |date= 30 July 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120801014755/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1278131-2012-olympic-mens-gymnastics-judges-us-fold-under-pressure-of-biggest-stage |archivedate= 1 August 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= Bleacher Report |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1278162-mens-gymnastics-olympic-controversy-japan-takes-silver-great-britain-snubbed |title= Men's Gymnastics Olympic Controversy: Japan Takes Silver, Great Britain Snubbed |author= Patrick Clarke |date= 30 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= Daily Mail |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181141/Olympic-Gymnastics-2012-Team-GB-men-bronze-Japanese-appeal-robs-silver-medal.html |title= Robbed!

#{{note|1}} Uchimura was initially given a score of 13.466 on the pommel horse. However, the Japanese team filed an appeal, believing that he had been given the incorrect D-score for his dismount. After review by the Men's Technical Committee, the dismount's difficulty was authorized and his score was raised to 14.166.

The '''Gymnopaedia''', in ancient [[Sparta]], was a yearly celebration during which [[nudity|naked]] youths displayed their athletic and martial skills through the medium of [[war dance|war dancing]]. The custom was introduced in 668 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cartledge, ''Spartan Reflections'' p.102&lt;/ref&gt; concurrently with the introduction of naked athletics.&lt;ref name="Smith1890"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/adictionarygree00marigoog#page/n945|p=931|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=William|title=A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities|date=1890|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]|location=London|volume=Vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Corybantian dance from Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities (SALTATIO article).png|thumb|350px|[[Corybantian dance]], the type of dance most likely danced on Gymnopedia festivals (image from [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|Dictionary of Antiquities]]'').]]

==Etymology==
The word ''Gymnopaedia'' derives from the [[History of the Greek language|ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Γυμνοπαιδίαι}}, composed of the words {{lang|grc|γυμνός}} (''gymnos'', "naked" or "unarmed") and {{lang|grc|παιδιά}} "game" from {{lang|grc|παῖς}} (''pais'', "child" or "youth").{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In Greek the plural form, {{lang|grc|Γυμνοπαιδίαι}}, appears most often.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Singular: see Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 208d.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Complete citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In addition to ''gymnopaedia'', modern transliterations and adaptations include ''gymnopaidiai'' (mostly older translations of Greek texts, maintaining a plural form for the word),{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} ''gymnopaidiae'' (Latinized plural form),{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} ''gymnopedia'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} ''gymnopaedie'' (in [[German language|German]]),{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} and ''gymnopédie'' (in [[French language|French]], including [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnopédies]]'').

==Ancient Greece==

The word ''Gymnopaedia'' appears in texts of [[Herodotus]], and several authors in the [[History of the Greek language#Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Koine Greek]] periods. 

The festival, dedicated to [[Apollo]], was celebrated every year in the summertime with gymnastic contests.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Desrciption of Ancient Greece'', 3.11.7&lt;/ref&gt; The festival lasted for several, perhaps for ten, days. The statues of Apollo, [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]] stood in a part of the [[Agora]], and it was around these statues that the Spartan youths performed their choruses and dances in honour of Apollo. On the last day grown men also performed choruses and dances in the theatre, and during these gymnastic exhibitions they sang the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Desrciption of Ancient Greece'', 3.11.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] praises gymnopaedia-like exercises and performances in ''[[Plato's Laws|The Laws]]'' as a medium of education: by dancing in the summer heat, Spartan youth were trained in both musical grace and warrior grit simultaneously.
The boys in their dances performed rhythmic movements that resembled the exercises of the palaestra and the pancration, and also imitated the dance of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Hippagoras ap. Ath. xiv. p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gymnopaedia was also held in memory of Sparta's defeat by [[Argos]] at Hysiai in 669 or 668 BC. By recognizing their defeat, the Spartans hoped to appease the gods and prevent future defeats. During the festive days, those Spartans who had fallen on that occasion were always praised in songs at this festival.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Agesilaus'' 29&lt;/ref&gt;The military style of dancing reinforces the emphasis on military success in Spartan society.

In ancient Greece, sports were generally reserved for men, and were performed ''gymnos'' (naked).  [[Aristophanes]]' plays and other sources{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} suggest that women in Sparta also exercised publicly in the nude. Some modern opinion, therefore, suggests that this festival included the dancing of young women to show their strength and worthiness to give birth to strong men,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} and also to promote [[Eugenics|eugenic]] marriage and population growth,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} with which Sparta would later struggle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The whole season of the gymnopaediae, during which Sparta was visited by great numbers of strangers, was one of great merriment and rejoicings.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'c 1.2.61; Plutarch, ''Life of Agesilaus''&lt;/ref&gt;

While for the earliest of these authors the meaning of ''Gymnopaedia'' appears predominantly as a festival (including dances, sports, and other activities),{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} in later antiquity ''gymnopaedia'' refers to a specific dance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Roman era==
Eight centuries after the first gymnopaedia, it the festival survived in [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonia]] into the [[Ancient Rome|Roman era]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} According to [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]'s [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] ''Of Pantomime'', it retained some connection to [[martial arts]], as the youths would engage in gymnopaedia immediately after their daily military training.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}} On the other hand, he describes the gymnopaedia as "yet another dance", neither involving nudity nor exclusivity for men.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Hurling''' ({{lang-gle|Iománaíocht/Iomáint}}), the [[Gaelic games|Gaelic sport]], is a prominent feature '''in popular culture'''.

==In film==
Hurling and [[Hollywood]] have long been linked.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"&gt;Commins, Michael. [http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4835:hurling-and-the-hollywood-link-goes-way-back-in-time&amp;Itemid=51 "Hurling and the Hollywood link"], ''Mayo News'', 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Several awards have resulted from the depiction of hurling in film, including the [[Palme d'Or]] and several [[Academy Award]] nominations:

* The 1930s [[Warner Brothers]] short film ''Sports Thrills'', narrated by CBS broadcaster [[Ted Husing]], demonstrated hurling.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt;
* A 1936 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]-commissioned short series, directed by David Miller, portrayed hurling as "bordering on savage" with "all the Hollywood stereo-type images of the Irish back then, short of drinking, on the field". The GAA complained and attempted to have some of the more unpleasant scenes removed.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt;
* The 1952 film ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' features the famous line: "Sure don't you know the [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] hurlers haven't been beaten west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]] in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt;
* A 1955 [[Paramount Studios]]-commissioned short film, Three Kisses,&lt;ref name="NUIG"&gt;National University of Ireland, Galway [http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive/2010/august2010/recently-discovered-hurling-films-screened-for-first-time-in-eighty-years-1.html "Recently Discovered Hurling Films Screened for First Time in Eighty Years"], ''NUI Galway'', 5 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Justin Herman, was nominated for an Academy Award.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt;
* The 1956 film ''[[The Rising of the Moon]]'' featured a badly bruised and bandaged but victorious local hurling team, leading to "deep concern" about Hollywood's tendency to overdo the bad side of hurling.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt; Novelist [[Flann O'Brien]] (''[[The Third Policeman]]'', ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'') gave the disagreement a satirical edge in his newspaper column.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt;
* During filming of the 1958 Rank Studios film ''Rooney'' titular actor John Gregson ran out onto the [[Croke Park]] turf with the teams ahead of the 1957 All-Ireland Senior Championship Final between [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] and [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]]. He wore a Kilkenny jersey to film the part.&lt;ref name="hurlinghollywoodlink"/&gt;
* The 2006 [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', set in 1920, opens with a Sunday hurling match in [[County Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;McBride, Dara. [http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Top-10-Irish-films-of-the-decade--79490672.html "Top 10 Irish films of the decade"]. IrishCentral.com. Thursday, 17 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].
*In the opening scenes of the 2011 film ''[[Blitz (film)|Blitz]]'', [[Jason Statham]] uses a hurley to beat up three youths who are trying to steal a car. Statham's character is heard to say, "This, lads, is a hurley, used in the Irish game of hurling, a cross between hockey and murder".
*In the Disney production "Secret of Boyne Castle" 1972 - episode 1, Kurt Russell was playing Hurling at the boarding school where the mini series starts.

==In literature==

* ''[[The Hurley Maker's Son]]'' - a memoir by Patrick Deeley, which takes an in-depth look at the craft of hurley making during the author's childhood in a small townland in Galway - was shortlisted for the Irish Book Awards in 2016.
* Hurling is referenced in the works of [[James Joyce]]; he mentions it in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916)&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_ILE9B-c6uUC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=hurling+james+joyce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KJ-7Mugswj&amp;sig=xTycCtddEKTBp_cbS9_VnCxcocQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6l0qTdGnIMq5hAeAkZyhDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewildgeese.com/pages/cusack2.html "Michael Cusack and James Joyce: Pair May Well Have Reshaped Modern Ireland"].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Samuel Beckett]]'s novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'' references hurling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2yWK_FHbkrIC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=hurling+samuel+beckett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VCBeFXiPZ0&amp;sig=sGJomZT4Vm1gnykktHL1CK9wCP8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lmEqTdjpKMaJhQfFne3-AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives"].

* In [[John Banville]]'s novel ''[[The Newton Letter]]'', the character Edward "appeared, brandishing a hurley stick", which he later "leaned on, [...] admiring his drink" before taking it up again after urinating against a chestnut tree. "Still held dangled down" by the narrator's side, Edward then proceeds to "gently bat" him with the hurley stick.&lt;ref&gt;Banville, John.

* The [[Colm Tóibín]] novel ''[[Brooklyn (novel)|Brooklyn]]'' (2009) features an exchange between two characters involving the confusion that may occur when discussing the similarities between hurling and the American sport of [[baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;Tóibín, Colm. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4mOrEoLlJQMC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=hurling+Colm+T%C3%B3ib%C3%ADn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MBdMTcURjB&amp;sig=LpIuHTQqFeN7WtvCu6t3mpNRRZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l2sqTdmkDZKKhQeKicHmAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Brooklyn''].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stephen Maturin]] in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey-Maturin series]] was a hurler, and demonstrates his skills to the dismay of his cricket teammates in one of the books.

The '''William H. Kibbie-ASUI Activity Center''' (commonly known as the '''Kibbie Dome''') is a multi-purpose indoor athletic [[stadium]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] United States, on the campus of the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho]]. It is the home of the [[Idaho Vandals]] and is used for intercollegiate competition in four sports: [[Idaho Vandals football|football]], [[Idaho Vandals men's basketball|basketball]], [[tennis]], and indoor [[athletics (track and field)|track &amp; field]].

The Kibbie Dome opened {{Time ago|1971}} as an outdoor [[concrete]] football stadium in October [[1971 Idaho Vandals football team|1971]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aIBfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6240%2C2361152 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Under construction: architect's drawing |agency=photo |date=June 11, 1971 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; built on the same site of the demolished wooden [[Neale Stadium]] ([[1937 Idaho Vandals football team|1937]]–68), seen in this early 1950s [http://www.tomandrodna.com/Stadium.jpg photo]. Following the [[1974 Idaho Vandals football team|1974]] football season, a barrel-arched roof and vertical end walls were added in ten months and the stadium re-opened as an enclosed facility in September [[1975 Idaho Vandals football team|1975]].

With just 16,000 permanent seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kibbie-ASUI Activity Center|publisher=University of Idaho Athletics|accessdate=October 11, 2017|ref=http://www.govandals.com/facilities/?id=1|quote=The facility has a capacity of more than 16,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the second smallest home stadium for [[college football]] in [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] (formerly Division I-A), but Idaho football has rejoined the FCS and is a member of the Big Sky Conference. Since February 2001, the Kibbie Dome has been reconfigured for basketball games and is referred to as the '''Cowan Spectrum''', seating 7,000. The [[elevation]] of the playing surface is {{convert|2610|ft|}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/image.aspx?T=2&amp;S=12&amp;Z=11&amp;X=623&amp;Y=6468&amp;W=2&amp;qs=%7cMoscow%7cIdaho%7c Terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com] – topo map – UI campus – accessed 2009-09-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Construction===
The stadium was built in stages and took several years to complete. Originally, the new football stadium was to be outdoors and seat over 23,000 spectators, with an adjacent 10,000-seat indoor arena for basketball. The [[Big West|PCAA]] conference had been launched in 1969 and Idaho was attempting to join, but political wrangling in the state legislature and subsequent budget cuts caused a change in the scope of the stadium project. This ensured that Idaho could not make the move to the PCAA; the Vandals remained in the [[Big Sky Conference]] with the other state schools, [[Idaho State University|Idaho State]] and new member [[Boise State University|Boise State]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiargonaut.com/content/view/3661/48/ UI Argonaut]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Idaho finally did join the PCAA in 1996, the conference had changed its name to the Big West.

The revised plan was for a smaller capacity football stadium, to be enclosed to allow use as a basketball arena (and indoor track and tennis as well). This multi-purpose concept had been recently used at [[Idaho State University|Idaho State]] in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], where the [[Minidome]] (now [[Holt Arena]]) had opened in 1970.
 
Construction on the concrete grandstands started in February 1971,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#K lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#K]&lt;/ref&gt;
after a fire destroyed the previously condemned wooden [[Neale Stadium]] in November [[1969 Idaho Vandals football team|1969]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#N lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/uibldngs.html#N]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium, which opened in [[1937 Idaho Vandals football team|1937]], had been condemned in August 1969 due to soil erosion beneath the grandstands. The Vandal football team played its limited home schedule for the next two seasons at [[Washington State University|WSU's]] [[Rogers Field (Washington State)|Rogers Field]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]].

After a fire significantly damaged Rogers Field's south grandstand in April 1970, WSU moved all of its [[1970 Washington State Cougars football team|1970]] and [[1971 Washington State Cougars football team|1971]] home games to [[Joe Albi Stadium]] in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], but the Vandals remained at Rogers in Pullman for four "home" games in [[1970 Idaho Vandals football team|1970]]. The Vandals' game with WSU on September 19 in Spokane was dubbed the {{nowrap|"Displaced Bowl."&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonstate.scout.com/2/243292.html washingtonstate.scout.com/2/243292.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002011344/http://washingtonstate.scout.com/2/243292.html |date=2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A lopsided {{nowrap|44–16 win}} for the Cougars, it was WSU's only victory in a stretch of 22 games.

While [[steel]] and [[aluminum]] were the products of the day for domes and large unsupported buildings, Trus-Joist saw the UI stadium as a chance to demonstrate the strength, durability, and economy of their engineered wood products.

The Kibbie Dome's roof spans {{convert|400|ft|round=5}} from sideline-to-sideline, and its maximum height is {{convert|150|ft|round=5}} above the hashmarks. ([[Holt Arena]], completed in 1970 on the campus of [[Idaho State University]] in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], has an opposite geometry: its arched roof spans the ''length'' of the football field, rather than its width, resulting in a very low roof at the end lines and goal posts.)

Soon after completion in 1975, problems arose with the roof's exterior. The {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} outer surface of [[Hypalon]] and underlying polyurethane foam were improperly applied&lt;!-- and was found to be unsuitable for the extended annual temperature range of [[Idaho Panhandle|northern Idaho]]. The significant expansion and contraction caused fractures--&gt; and a second attempt to seal the roof with Diathon in the late 1970s did not succeed. Leaks were occurring and [[Wood-decay fungus|wood rot]] was a potential problem by 1980. An [[infrared]] scan of the roof in the spring of 1981 showed that half of it was moist and the insulating foam was in poor condition.&lt;ref name=kdlbsu/&gt;&lt;ref name=lsfdl/&gt; Various stopgap measures were taken to stop the leaks in 1981.&lt;ref name=ssttr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zPZLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Zu4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5314,5569889 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=photo |title=The sun shines through the roof... |date=July 14, 1981 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iafyds&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nYRfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_TAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4930,1099448 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Dome roof: If at first you don't succeed...|date=November 3, 1981 |page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kdrfre&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n4RfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_TAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=roof%20kibbie&amp;pg=6137%2C2039427 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |agency=photo |title=Kibbie Dome roof repairs |date=November 5, 1981 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kddic&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jZxfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rDEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2828,5569889 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Kibbie Dome's drip is conquered |last=Moulton |first=Kristen |date=December 12, 1981 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cskdrb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ALleAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vjAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5546,3100257 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Contractors seek Kibbie Dome repair bid |date=June 23, 1982 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lpoirf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zbheAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oDAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5850,1046805 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Lawyers ponder options in Kibbie Dome claims |agency=Associated Press |date=September 3, 1982 |page=6C}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an extended period of finger-pointing and threatened legal action, an out-of-court settlement was reached.

==Football==
The Kibbie Dome officially seats just 16,000 for football, making it the second smallest venue in [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] (formerly Division I-A). A record crowd of 19,878 was recorded for the eightth consecutive [[Boise State–Idaho rivalry|rivalry game]] victory over [[1989 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] in November [[1989 Idaho Vandals football team|1989]], during the schools' I-AA [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] era. The football field runs an unorthodox east-west, but even with the new translucent upper end walls ([[2009 Idaho Vandals football team|2009]] and [[2011 Idaho Vandals football team|2011]]), sun location is not a major visibility issue.

For two and a half seasons, 1999 to 2001, the Vandals used [[Washington State University|WSU]]'s [[Martin Stadium]] in nearby [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] as its home field, as Idaho transitioned back to [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-A]] from [[Football Championship Subdivision|Division I-AA]]. When [[Dennis Erickson]] returned as head coach in [[2006 Idaho Vandals football team|2006]], there was talk of adding a second deck to the Kibbie Dome to increase the football seating to 25,000, and building a new basketball arena. In February 2007, the state board of education appropriated funds to study expansion possibilities. On December 6, the board approved funding to begin design work for $52 million in improvements, including an expansion to 20,000 seats, lowering the elevation of the playing field, and other various safety and spectator improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idahostatesman.com/vandalsports/story/231555.html idahostatesman.com/vandalsports/story/231555.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

When not used for football, the former [[AstroTurf]] football field was rolled up in about an hour to reveal {{convert|93000|sqft|acre ha|abbr=off}} of polyurethane tartan surface, used for indoor tennis and track &amp; field. The five-lane track is {{convert|290|m|yd|abbr=off}} in length, and 9 tennis courts are lined on its infield. Basketball and volleyball courts are also lined on the tartan infield. The AstroTurf was spooled onto a large field-width reel at the base of the west wall.

In 1990, the original synthetic turf (3M Tartan Turf)&lt;ref name=bigwigs/&gt; of [[1972 Idaho Vandals football team|1972]] was replaced after 18 seasons, which included three years outdoors.&lt;ref name=idsyn89&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1NctAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v9AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5621%2C2707369 |newspaper=Idahonian |location=Moscow |last=Smith |first=Christopher |title=Roll out the carpet |date=June 10, 1989 |page=1A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2007, the Kibbie Dome's AstroTurf was replaced with RealGrass Pro, a next-generation infilled synthethic turf similar to [[Field Turf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&amp;ATCLID=1136611 govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&amp;ATCLID=1136611]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the carpet-like AstroTurf, the infilled synthetic turf is not easily rolled up in a continuous reel, and must be removed in sections. The turf sections are {{convert|5|yd|spell=in}} in width, running from sideline to sideline, attached to each other with [[velcro]]. Other stadiums with RealGrass Pro include [[Texas Stadium]] (the former home of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]), and the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].

Life and safety upgrades to the Kibbie Dome began {{Time ago|2009|spellout=yes}} in the spring of [[2009 Idaho Vandals football team|2009]]. The west wall was replaced with a non-combustible construction assembly; [[translucent]] plastic panels on the upper half and [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] metal siding on the lower. Concurrent with the end-wall replacement, a range of interior life safety work took place: field level exiting in the new west wall, addition of handrails in the seating aisles, provision of the required smoke exhaust systems; and other life safety and code mitigation improvements. The second phase of the project was completed in [[2011 Idaho Vandals football team|2011]] with the replacement of the east wall. A premium seating area (Litehouse Center) was established in 2011 in the former press box area above the south grandstand; a new press box was constructed above the north grandstand.

==Basketball==
The stadium has also served as the home of the Vandal basketball teams, providing increased [[seating capacity]] over the venerable [[Memorial Gymnasium (University of Idaho)|Memorial Gym]] (built in 1928), a block to the east. The basketball court is positioned at midfield on the south sideline, in front of the press box and the south grandstand, with temporary seating on the north, east, and west. The first basketball game was played against [[Washington State Cougars men's basketball|WSU]] on {{Start date and age|1976|01|21}}, commemorated with a visit by Vandal great [[Gus Johnson (basketball)|Gus Johnson]].&lt;ref name=domeopr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_bBfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4jIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5873%2C5364449 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Dome opener |last=Emerson |first=Paul |date=January 21, 1976 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_LBfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4jIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4290%2C5163165 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Idaho cage great Gus Johnson returns to Palouse |last=Barrows |first=Bob |date=January 20, 1976 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_rBfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4jIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4183%2C5586383 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=WSU also captures alumni game 74-63 |last=Spotleson |first=Bruce |date=January 22, 1976 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main court was originally smooth tartan rubber, poured directly onto the pavement floor, resulting in a very hard and unforgiving surface, but resulted in a tremendous home court advantage under head coach [[Don Monson]] in the early 1980s. After nine seasons, it was replaced with a conventional hardwood floor in the fall of 1984, acquired from the [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].&lt;ref name=newhdwd84&gt;{{cite news |url=https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/ref/collection/argonaut/id/9790?_ga=2.132077324.2092029922.1539109752-2101260250.1525192126 |work=Argonaut |location=(Moscow, Idaho) |agency=(University of Idaho) |title=Dome to be home for hoop court |date=August 28, 1984 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During basketball games, the converted Kibbie Dome is now referred to as the '''Cowan Spectrum''', named for '''Bob''' and '''Jan Cowan''', who financed the current configuration. Since February 2001, the new basketball layout has been separated from the rest of the stadium by massive black curtains to give the court a more intimate "stadium-within-a-stadium" feel, with a reduced [[seating capacity]] of 7,000. Temporary OES scoreboards are placed over the north and south stands during games. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrWjNbtbGc (video)]

During the early 1980s, with [[Don Monson]] as head coach, the Kibbie Dome was considered one of the 20 toughest home courts in [[college basketball]] by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].'' Additional temporary seating was gradually increased on the north basketball sideline and attendance exceeded 11,000 for several games during the [[Don Monson#1982–83 season|1982–83]]  season.&lt;ref name=cougsnip&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-rxeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CDEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4182%2C1633153 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |last=Killen |first=John |title=Vandals nip Cougars in OT, 62-58 |date=December 5, 1982 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snap&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R5xfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ojEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4823%2C3714993 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Snap!

The venue hosted three [[Big Sky Conference]] men's basketball tournaments (by winning the regular season title), in 1981, 1982, and 1993. (The Vandals departed the [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] for the [[Big West Conference|Big West]] in 1996, then to the [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] in 2005 before returning its non-football sports to the Big Sky in 2014.)

Since its enclosure in 1975, the Kibbie Dome has undergone several significant additions. The East End Addition was completed in the fall of [[1982 Idaho Vandals football team|1982]], providing the entire athletic department with locker rooms, offices, a weight room, athletic training facility, and equipment room. The formal dedication and open house for the $3.9 million addition was held in late October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=db9eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=STEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6090%2C1699361 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=Idaho |title=Open house planned at dome addition |date=October 20, 1982 |page=7C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the addition, the football and basketball teams, both Vandals and visitors, dressed in the Memorial Gym and made the lengthy walk (or run) west to the Kibbie Dome, often in rain or snow. This had been the practice for UI football for over 40 years, since the opening of [[Neale Stadium]] in 1937. Bill Kibbie also made a significant donation for this project in 1979.&lt;ref name=kgadm&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jtIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LPkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4206%2C164634 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=Kibbie gift aids dome |date=December 1, 1979 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, the facilities were again enhanced with the addition of the {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Vandal Athletic Center, designed by [http://www.opsisarch.com Opsis Architecture], home to the Norm and Becky Iverson Speed and Strength Center; the renovation of the men's and women's basketball, football, and volleyball locker rooms, and the addition of a state-of-the-art hydrotherapy pool (ARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=1257088 govandals.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17100&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=1257088]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjacent practice fields==
[[File:UI-kibbee-moscow-id-us.png|300px|thumb|Kibbie Dome from the far west in [[2007 Idaho Vandals football team|2007]]]]
August 2005 saw the installation of infilled SprinTurf on the former natural grass practice field east of the Kibbie Dome. The days of "off-limits" were eliminated, as UI students acquired state-of-the-art playing fields available for year-round use. A field that previously had just 300 usable hours annually as an "intercollegiate athletics only" field (primarily for natural turf varsity football practice), is now available for up to 2,000 hours per year. The project was funded through the Kibbie Dome turf replacement fund; the $1.2 million SprinTurf project included lighting and fencing.

The two {{convert|75|yd|adj=on}} fields are adequate for team practice for football (and soccer, lacrosse, rugby, and other sports) as well as for intramural competition, but short enough to have two fields in the space available. Each field is a full half-field (with end zone &amp; goal post) plus an additional {{convert|15|yd}} beyond the 50-yard line. An unmarked {{convert|10|yd|0|adj=on}} median separates the two fields; the total length, with end zones, is {{convert|160|yd|0}} and runs north-south. The former natural turf fields were lined as a regulation football field running north-south, with a half field at the north end running east-west. An added benefit of the synthetic surface is an estimated $50,000 annual savings in field maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;

About a half mile north (800 m) of the Dome are expansive natural grass intramural fields, west of the Wallace dormitories.

[[Image:RPWlogo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Real Pro Wrestling''''s Logo.]]
'''Real Pro Wrestling''' (also known as '''RPW''' or '''RealPro Wrestling''') was a [[professional]] [[sports league]] of [[wrestling]], similar to the [[amateur wrestling]] found in the [[Olympic Games]] and at the [[collegiate wrestling|college]] and [[scholastic wrestling|high school]] level. The term "real" was meant to emphasize that it was [[professional]] (meaning the wrestlers are paid money) and it was wrestling, but that it was not [[professional wrestling]] in the traditional sense; modern professional wrestling features [[work (professional wrestling)|predetermined outcomes]] and operates under a very different [[Professional wrestling#Rules|set of rules]] from amateur wrestling.

Real Pro Wrestling, Inc was founded in 2002 by former [[Northwestern University]] wrestling teammates Toby Willis and Matt Case. The company was based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] with branch offices in New York and Virginia. RPW was a television production company and a producer of live events.

The league began operations in March 2005 and consisted of eight teams (see below).  Although the teams had various city and state names, all matches were taped on a soundstage in Nashville and Los Angeles (Los Angeles Center Studios).

According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20050126155145/http://realprowrestling.com/ the official website], "In RPW, classic meets the future as the matches are conducted in a specially designed coliseum which showcases a raised circular mat to facilitate better camera angles and to afford the live audience a better viewing experience. The circular mat allows for 360 degree camera angles and aids in covering the close quarters that wrestlers frequently find themselves in as they maneuver for position." 

Numerous similar projects were announced before RPW, but none had gotten off the ground.  Lanny Bryant, the [[Montana]]-based editor of ''Wrestling USA'' magazine, proposed a similar league in the early 1990s, as one example.

RPW folded in 2007, after two seasons (2004 and 2006-7).  

In the spring of 2013, the Association of Career Wrestlers formed a new series offering competitions with financial incentives for post-collegiate wrestlers called [http://touracw.com Tour ACW].  This new series has a new set of rules building on the RPW rules with an emphasis on scoring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intermatwrestle.com/articles/11869&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Wrestling style==
The style of wrestling that is used in ''RPW'' is a combination of [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]], [[folkstyle|American Folkstyle]], [[Sumo|sumo wrestling]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]].  Because of this, wrestlers of many styles competed in the league.  Greco-Roman and Freestyle were the most common wrestling backgrounds in the leagues, due largely to the Olympic experience of the wrestlers in the league.  In fact, the team rosters consists of numerous Olympians and [[NCAA]] champions.

==Rules==
The rules were similar to [[Freestyle wrestling#Scoring|freestyle wrestling]] but were modified to encourage risk and intensity. The goal is to dominate the opponent and pin his shoulders to the mat. This is called a fall. Points are also awarded during the six-minute match for controlling the opponent, placing him in danger, or escaping the opponent's control. If there is no fall, then the wrestler with the most points wins the match. Some of the most noticeable changes were as follows:
# Two 3-minute periods instead of 3 periods totaling 7 minutes
# If a wrestler pushed his opponent out of the ring he would get a point.
# '''The Bonus''' - if a wrestler manages to stay in the center of the mat and stay aggressive, their ''bonus meter'' would go up.  If they got the bonus, they would get to go into a special position in which they couldn't lose any points and could gain points by throwing their opponents.
# '''TV Challenge''' - the coach of each wrestler is allowed once per individual match to challenge a call made by the ''Ref'' using video from multiple video angles.

==League structure==
Despite the existence of eight "franchises" in RPW, all tournaments were conducted in a classic elimination bracket format. No actual [[dual meet]]s were held.

==Television coverage==
In the league's first season, 2005–06, matches were televised on PAX TV (now [[ION Television]]) on Sunday evenings and on [[Fox Sports Net]] affiliates at various times.  [[Rulon Gardner]], one of the most famous figures in amateur wrestling in the [[United States]], was the [[color analyst]].  Veteran Radio and Television Sports Announcer Chip Hoback from Nashville, TN did the Voice Over and Highlights.  

Due to executive reorganizations at both networks, both PAX and FSN pulled the show.  RPW then decided to syndicate coverage of the second season on various [[terrestrial television|broadcast stations]].

In an [http://thewrestlingmall.com/stories/rpw_willis_interview.php interview] with [http://www.thewrestlingmall.com/ The Wrestling Mall] co-founder Toby Willis also revealed that although sponsors and investors were already lined up for Season 2 a few employees had attempted a "take over" of the company which also added to the downfall of the league.  In the same series of articles Mr. Willis stated his wish that wrestling would adopt more of a martial arts mentality to draw in more kids.  Mr. Willis said, "Wrestling desperately needs to rebrand itself as a martial art not just another arbitrary sport. We need to use military terminology and martial art vocabulary. We need to teach it as self defense. So instead of the high school coach walking up to a kid in the hallways of school and asking them to try wrestling, they should ask the kid if he wants to learn self defense. What kid says they want to be defenseless? Then when the kid shows up for practice, the coach has to teach wrestling from a martial arts perspective."

'''Rimmington (Kent cricketer)''' refers to three brothers who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]], [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] teams between the [[1777 English cricket season|1777 and 1791 seasons]].

Personal details of them are unknown apart from their initials which were B, T and M.  Their known appearances were 6, 5 and 1 respectively.  But, as often happened at the time with other brothers and namesakes, when just one of them played only the surname was recorded and there are another 15 matches in which an unidentified Rimmington took part.

In 1780, B Rimmington was one of the most successful batsmen of the season, scoring 130 runs in only 3 matches.

It is believed the Rimmingtons were from Kent and they were originally involved with Kent cricket, but references to them from 1785 indicate that they joined the prominent Hornchurch Club and played for Essex.

The rule is often mistakenly believed to prohibit ''[[Glossary of Gaelic games terms#F|foreign sports]]'' at GAA owned [[List of GAA stadiums|stadiums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/why-gaa-needs-this-dose-of-reality-1218743.html|title=
Why GAA needs this dose of reality|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=Irish Independent|first=Eugene|last=McGee|date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, non-Gaelic games such as [[boxing]] and [[American football]] did [[List of non-Gaelic games played in Croke Park|take place]] in [[Croke Park]] before Rule 42 was modified.

==The drive to have Rule 42 changed==
In the early 2000s the GAA came under pressure to allow non-Gaelic games be played in Croke Park so that the [[Football Association of Ireland]] could be joint hosts of [[Euro 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/2259736.stm|title=Croke Park ruled out for Euro 2008|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=15 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the association was asked to modify the rule so that the [[Ireland national rugby union team]]  and [[Republic of Ireland national football team]] would not have to play their home games outside Ireland while the [[Lansdowne Road]] stadium was being redeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/3417359.stm|title=Green light for Lansdowne|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=27 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of motions to change Rule 42 failed or were blocked from being put on the agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/roscommonherald/2004/11/04/story180.asp |title=Rule 42 debate will go ahead |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629113628/http://archives.tcm.ie/roscommonherald/2004/11/04/story180.asp |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority of the opposition coming from the [[Ulster GAA|Ulster]] [[GAA county|counties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4451933.stm |title=Gaelic angst over stadium decision |accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=16 April 2005 | first=James | last=Helm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rule was finally modified in 2005 to allow the playing of soccer and [[rugby union]] in [[Croke Park]] only while [[Lansdowne Road]] was being redeveloped. The motion gave  the GAA's [[Structure of the Gaelic Athletic Association|central council]] the power to decide which games would be allowed in Croke Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0416/gaa.html|title=GAA Congress Rule 42 decision welcomed|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=RTÉ News|date=16 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion to the GAA's [[Gaelic Athletic Association Congress|annual congress]] passed 227–97, thus obtaining the two-thirds majority required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/plugins/newsfeed.cgi?rm=content&amp;plugin_data_id=6101 |title=Rule 42 motion is carried |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306031401/http://www.gaa.ie/plugins/newsfeed.cgi?rm=content&amp;plugin_data_id=6101 |archivedate= 6 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==When the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road is complete==
It was agreed that once the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road (now called the [[Aviva Stadium]]) is complete Rule 42 will revert to its 2005 wording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrugby.com/Story/0,18259,3551_1902765,00.html |title=Ireland must wait to enjoy Croke craic |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203757/http://www.planetrugby.com/Story/0%2C18259%2C3551_1902765%2C00.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 official guide"/&gt; However, high profile GAA members including [[Seán Kelly (Irish politician)|Seán Kelly]], former [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA president]], have expressed the view that the rule should not be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2009/1015/walshn.html|title=Walsh wants Croker to stay open|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=RTÉ News|date=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1130/1224259709936.html|title=No sense in Croke Park reverting to ban, says Kelly|accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=The Irish Times|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April 2010 the GAA voted to keep Croke Park open after the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/gaa/2010/0417/1224268580815.html|title=Croke Park doors to remain open|accessdate=2010-04-18 | work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Croke Park==
In addition to the opening of Croke Park to competing sports, local GAA units have sought to rent their facilities out to other sports organisations for financial reasons in violation of Rule 42.&lt;ref name="stateOfTheGame"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continued existence of Rule 42 has proven to be controversial since the management of Croke Park has been allowed to earn revenue by renting the facility out to competing sports organisations, but local GAA units which own smaller facilities cannot.&lt;ref name="stateOfTheGame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colmORourkeRule42"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/colm-orourke/colm-orourke-there-is-no-more-room-for-vanity-projects-in-the-gaa-2577493.html | title=There is no more room for vanity projects in the GAA | accessdate=14 March 2011 | author=O'Rourke, Colm | date=13 March 2011 | publisher=Sunday Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that it is questionable as to whether or not such rental deals would actually be damaging to the GAA's interests.&lt;ref name="stateOfTheGame"/&gt;

==Wording of the rule==
The original wording of Rule 42 is:
{{Quote|Grounds controlled by Association units shall not be used or permitted to be used, for horse racing, greyhound racing, or for field games other than those sanctioned by Central Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaelicfootball.eusu.ed.ac.uk/documents/GAA%20Official%20Guide%202003.pdf |title=2003 GAA Guide showing pre-2005 wording of Rule 42 |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816230315/http://gaelicfootball.eusu.ed.ac.uk/documents/GAA%20Official%20Guide%202003.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The 2005 amendment added the sentence: 
{{quote|Central Council shall have the power to authorise the use of Croke Park for games, other than those controlled by the Association, during a temporary period when Lansdowne Road Football Ground is closed for the proposed development.&lt;ref name="2009 official guide"/&gt;}}

==The first games in Croke Park==
The first game to take place under the relaxed Rule 42 took place on 11 February 2007.  It was a [[Six Nations Championship]] rugby union match between [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[France national rugby union team|France]] which Ireland lost 17–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/6352033.stm|title=Ireland 17–20 France|accessdate=2010-01-12 | work=BBC News | date=11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following match against [[England national rugby union team|England]] generated some controversy, since it involved the playing of "[[God Save the Queen]]" at a ground where British soldiers had killed fourteen spectators on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday, 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-02-09-foreign-rugby-invading-irelands-hallowed-ground|title='Foreign' rugby invading Ireland's hallowed ground|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/god-save-the-queen-at-joness-road-a-remarkable-moment-122168.html|title='God Save the Queen' at Jones's Road a remarkable moment'|accessdate=2010-01-12 | work=Irish Independent|first=John A|last=Murphy|date=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was a small protest by [[Republican Sinn Féin]] outside the ground.  Ireland won the match by 43 points to 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/ireland-43-england-13-ireland-have-the-last-laugh-as-ashton-rues-massive-blip-437967.html|title=

==A world record attendance==
In early February 2009, with possibility of an all Irish semi-final in the [[2008-09 Heineken Cup]], the GAA confirmed that club rugby would also be allowed under the relaxing of Rule 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/5019_12325.php |title=Croke Park lined up as potential semi-final venue |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090218160942/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/5019_12325.php |archivedate=18 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[2008-09 Heineken_Cup#Semi-finals|game]] was played in Croke Park on 2 May 2009, when [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] defeated [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] 25–6. The attendance of 82,208 set a new world record attendance for a club rugby union game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8030912.stm |title=Leinster 25–6 Munster||accessdate=2010-01-07 | work=BBC News | date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the realignment of [[FIFA]]'s youth competitions in 1977, the [[Soviet Union national under-20 football team]] was formed and competed until 1993 (in 1992 it qualified as CIS youth under-18 football team) qualifying 7 times. Following [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet qualification was passed to Russia which competed in the [[1993 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. Two years later Russia managed to qualify for the tournament on its own effort, but since then it yet to qualify for it.

'''Shoreham''' is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Sevenoaks District]] of [[Kent]], England. The parish includes the settlements of [[Badgers Mount]] and [[Well Hill]], and is located 5 miles north of [[Sevenoaks]].

The probable derivation of the name is ''estate at the foot of a steep slope''. Steep slope was from the Saxon word ''scor''. pronounced ''shor'', but written ''sore'' by Norman scribes.

The village of Shoreham contains four traditional independent pubs: Ye Olde George Inne, The King's Arms, The Two Brewers and the Crown; with another in nearby Twitton.

==History==
The Darent valley was one of the major areas of [[Stone Age]] settlement; Shoreham is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].

In 1668, [[cricket]] was mentioned in a court case as being played at Shoreham, one of the sport's earliest references.&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300 – 1787 |publisher=Stumpsite |first=John |last=Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134518/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also known as a [[smuggling]] area. Moreover, Shoreham was the most bombed village in the United Kingdom during the Second World War because the Army took over several manor houses for operational use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  

Papermaking was once a local industry; the mill closed finally in 1925.

==War memorial==
There is a white memorial cross in the hillside opposite the village church. It was dug in 1920 as a memorial to local men killed in action.

Shoreham was the birthplace and home of Private [[Thomas Highgate]], who was the first British soldier to be shot for [[desertion]] during the [[First World War]] on 8 September 1914, following the [[Battle of Mons|Battle of]] and [[Great Retreat|Retreat from Mons]]. In 2000, Shoreham Parish Council voted not to include his name on its war memorial. However, after a posthumous pardon in 2006, it was considered that his name might be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4798025.stm |title=England &amp;#124; Shot at dawn, pardoned 90 years on |publisher=BBC News |date=16 August 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial is incomplete. It has been established that at least one of its fallen, George Arthur Rouse (brother of Percy Aslin, marked on the memorial, both sons of Harriet Rouse, as recorded in the 1901 Census), is missing. One hundred years after he died, an effort to have George added was underway.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Shoreham Aircraft Museum==
The official opening of the [[Shoreham Aircraft Museum]] in 1978 was attended by fifteen former [[Battle of Britain]] pilots. It pays lasting tribute to all those airmen who fought in the skies over southern England during [[World War II]] and houses a substantial collection of aviation relics excavated by the group over many years from sites of crashed British and German aircraft, as well as items which have been donated.

Run by local enthusiasts, the Museum is largely funded by proceeds made by visitors whose donations contribute to the recovery and preservation of the artefacts.
The Battle of Britain brought the village of Shoreham directly into the war when on 15 September 1940, a [[Dornier Do 17]]Z, part of a force of about 100 German bombers approaching London, was shot down shortly before noon. The invading formation had been challenged by nine [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons and the battle developed into a series of individual 'dogfights'. The unfortunate pilot of the Dornier was forced to land in a field at Castle Farm, with a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] circling overhead, its cockpit canopy open, and its pilot waving a handkerchief, to signal a warning to the growing crowd of hop-pickers nearby to stay away until the Shoreham [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] arrived to recover the German crew. Feldwebel Heitsch, the pilot, and Feldwebel Pfeiffer, the observer, were driven to The Fox &amp; Hounds pub in Knatts Valley, where they were bought a brandy before being driven to Sevenoaks Police Station. The museum holds a collection of photographs of the Dornier, along with items taken from the wreckage at the time.

==Shoreham duck race==

[[Image:ShorehamDuckRace.jpg|thumb|Shoreham duck race]]
The Duck Race is a long-running event in the village. It is held each year, on the May Day bank holiday. Entrants pay a small fee (usually £1) to enter their 'duck' into the race. The duck has to travel along the river Darent from the war memorial in the village, to the bridge before the old Mill. A 'duck' can be anything from a shop-bought rubber duck to a model made by the entrant(s). Actual ducks are forbidden. It is a large event in the village and several hundred people turn out each year to line the riverbanks and watch. Anyone can enter and there is a prize for the 'Best Duck in Show' (awarded before the race begins) and the 'First placed Duck.' The money raised goes towards charitable organisations in the village.

==Television==
The [[kitchen|''Showdown'' kitchen]] featured in ''[[The Big Family Cooking Showdown]]'' is a [[converted barn]] in Shoreham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/zoe-ball-on-cooking-showdown-im-not-the-greatest-cook-486377/|title=''The Big Family Cooking Showdown'' kitchen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
On 29 September 1934, [[Airspeed Courier]] G-ACSY of [[London, Scottish &amp; Provincial Airways Ltd]] crashed [[1934 London, Scottish &amp; Provincial Airways Airspeed Courier crash|just north of Shoreham]], at the bottom of Cockerhurst Road.&lt;ref name=EDP20090604&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/air_crash_mystery_1_598760 | title=Air crash mystery | date=4 June 2009 | newspaper=Eastern Daily Press | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422184140/https://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/air_crash_mystery_1_598760 | archivedate=22 April 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was on a scheduled international passenger flight from [[Heston Aerodrome|Heston]] to [[Le Bourget Airport|Paris]] and all four people on board were killed.

==Notable people==
(in alphabetical order)
* [[Robert Ashington Bullen]] (1850-1912), geologist and authority on [[mollusca]], was the vicar from 1888 to 1896.
* [[Verney Lovett Cameron]] (1844–1894), first European to cross Equatorial Africa from coast to coast, buried in the village graveyard.
* Robert Colgate, was a Shoreham farmer and a sympathiser with the [[French Revolution]] who, having been forced to leave Britain in 1793, travelled to the US where his son [[William Colgate]] founded the famous [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]] company in 1806.
* [[Shena Mackay]] (author) though born in Edinburgh, grew up in Shoreham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview8 |title=Bohemian rhapsodist &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]] (1878–1957), the writer, lived here, at Dunstall Priory, serving in the Home Guard during World War II, and is buried here, with his wife
* London-born artist [[Samuel Palmer]], (1805–1881) lived in the village from 1826 to 1835 where he was part of a group of artists who followed [[William Blake]] (there is a theory that Blake took his inspiration for 'Jerusalem' from the village's surroundings) and called themselves ''The Ancients''. Palmer's work vividly depicts the local rural landscapes of the 1820s. Contrary to local myth, he did not live at the 'Water House' on the River Darent, but in a run-down farm cottage that has since been demolished. The mistake arises because his father, Samuel Palmer senior, rented the 'Water House' for some years.

'''Ski wax''' is a material applied to the bottom of snow runners, including [[ski]]s, [[snowboard]]s, and [[toboggan]]s, to improve their [[coefficient of friction]] performance under varying [[snow]] conditions. The two main types of wax used on skis are glide waxes and grip waxes. They address [[kinetic friction]]—to be minimized with a glide wax—and [[static friction]]—to be achieved with a grip wax. Both types of wax are designed to be matched with the varying properties of snow, including crystal type and size, and moisture content of the snow surface, which vary with temperature and the temperature history of the snow. Glide wax is selected to minimize sliding friction for both [[Alpine skiing|alpine]] and [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] skiing. Grip wax (also called "kick wax") provides on-snow traction for cross-country skiers, as they stride forward using [[Cross-country skiing#Classic|classic technique]].

Modern plastic materials (e.g. high-modulus polyethylene and Teflon), used on ski bases, have excellent gliding properties on snow, which in many circumstances diminish the added value of a glide wax. Likewise, uni-directional textures (e.g. fish scale or micro-scale hairs) underfoot on cross-country skis can offer a practical substitute for grip wax for those skiers, using the [[Cross-country skiing#Classic|classic]] technique.

== History ==
[[File:Martin Matsbo.jpg|thumb|right|Swedish ski racer, Martin Matsbo, pioneered development of modern cross-country ski waxes.]]
Johannes Scheffer in ''Argentoratensis Lapponiæ'' (History of Lapland) in 1673 gave what is probably the first recorded instruction for ski wax application&lt;ref name="Kuz01" /&gt; He advised skiers to use pine tar pitch and rosin. Ski waxing was also documented in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberleutnant Hals|title=Om Skismøring|publisher=Skienes Verden|location=Vaage|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 1854, California gold rush miners held organized downhill ski races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Longboards at Mammoth|url=http://www.thestormking.com/tahoe_nuggets/Nugget_170/nugget_170.html|publisher=Mic Mac Publishing|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discovered that bases smeared with dopes brewed from vegetable and/or animal compound helped increase skiing speeds. This led to some of the first commercial ski wax (even though they contained no wax at all), such as ''Black Dope'' and ''Sierra Lighting''; both were mainly composed of [[whale oil|sperm oil]], vegetable oil and pine pitch. However, some instead used paraffin candle wax that melted onto ski bases, and these worked better under colder conditions.&lt;ref name=gripandglide/&gt;

Pine tar on wooden ski bases proved effective for using skis as transport over the centuries, because it fills the pores of the wood and creates an [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surface that minimizes suction from water in the snow, yet has sufficient roughness to allow traction for forward motion. In the 1920s and 30s, new varnishes were developed by European companies as season-long ski bases. A significant advance for cross country racing was the introduction of klister, for good traction in granular snow, especially in spring conditions; klister was invented and patented in 1913 by [[:no:Peter Østbye (skiprodusent)|Peter Østbye]]. In the early 1940s, a Swedish chemical company, advised by Olympic crosscountry skier [[Martin Matsbo]], started the development of petroleum-based waxes, using [[paraffin wax]] and other admixtures. By 1952, such noted brands as Toko, Swix and Rex were providing an array of color-coded, temperature-tailored waxes.&lt;ref name=gripandglide&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masia|first1=Seth|title=Grip and Glide: A Short History of Ski Wax |url=https://www.skiinghistory.org/history/grip-and-glide-short-history-ski-wax|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last quarter of the 20th century, researchers addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the novel use of a [[surfactant]] that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by [[Hertel Wax]].

==Science of sliding on snow==
[[File:Snow friction vs water film thickness--Colbeck.png|thumb|Conceptual representation of sliding friction over snow, as a function of water film thickness, created by passage of a ski or other slider over a snow surface.]]
The ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski.

===Friction===
Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction, &lt;math&gt;F_{max} = \mu_\mathrm{s} F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt;, for the ski/snow contact, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of static friction and &lt;math&gt; F_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force of the ski on snow. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.&lt;ref name="Bhavikatti"&gt;{{cite book

===Snow properties===
{{See also|Snow}}
Snowflakes have a wide range of shapes, even as they fall; among these are: six-sided star-like [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendrites]], hexagonal needles, platelets and icy pellets. Once snow accumulates on the ground, the flakes immediately begin to undergo transformation (called ''metamorphosis''), owing to temperature changes, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and mechanical action. Temperature changes may be from the ambient temperature, solar radiation, rainwater, wind, or the temperature of the material beneath the snow layer. Mechanical action includes wind and compaction. Over time, bulk snow tends to consolidate&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt; Colbeck reports that fresh, cold, and man-made snow all interact more directly with the base of a ski and increase friction, indicating the use of harder waxes. Conversely, older, warmer, and denser snows present lower friction, in part due to increased grain size, which better promotes a water film and a smoother surface of the snow crystals for which softer waxes are indicated.&lt;ref name = Colbeck/&gt;

===Ski friction properties===
Colbeck offers an overview of the five friction processes of skis on snow. They are the: 1) resistance due to plowing of snow out of the way, 2) deformation of the snow over which the ski is traveling, 3) lubrication of the ski with a thin layer of melt water, 4) capillary attraction of water in the snow to the ski bottom, and 5) contamination of the snow with dust and other non-slippery elements. Plowing and deformation pertain to the interaction of the ski, as a whole, with the snow and are negligible on a firm surface. Lubrication, capillary attraction and contamination are issues for the ski bottom and the wax that is applied to reduce sliding friction or achieve adequate grip.&lt;ref name = Colbeck/&gt;

Typically, a sliding ski melts a thin and transitory film of lubricating layer of water, caused by the heat of friction between the ski and the snow in its passing. Colbeck suggests that the optimum water film thickness is in the range between 4  and 12 [[Micrometre|''μ''m]]. However, the heat generated by friction can be lost by conduction to a cold ski, thereby diminishing the production of the melt layer. At the other extreme, when the snow is wet and warm, heat generation creates a thicker film that can create increased capillary drag on the ski bottom.&lt;ref name = Colbeck&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzmin and Fuss suggest that the most favorable combination of ski base material properties to minimize ski sliding friction on snow include: increased hardness and lowered thermal conductivity of the base material to promote meltwater generation for lubrication, wear resistance in cold snow, and [[hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]] to minimize capillary suction. These attributes are readily achievable with a [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] base, which diminishes the value added by glide waxes.&lt;ref name = Routledge&gt;

== Glide wax ==
Glide wax can be applied to alpine skis, snowboards, skate skis, classic skis, back-country skis, and touring skis.  Traditional waxes comprise solid hydrocarbons. High-performance "fluorocarbon" waxes also contain fluorine which substitute some fraction of the hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbons with fluorine atoms to achieve lower coefficients of friction and high water-repellency than the pure hydrocarbon wax can achieve.&lt;ref name = Talbot&gt;

*'''Age''': Reflects the metamorphosis of snow crystals that are sharp and well-defined, when new, but with aging become broken or truncated with wind action or rounded into ice granules with freeze-thaw, all of which affects a ski's coefficient of friction.
*'''Moisture content''': The percentage of mass that is liquid water and may create suction friction with the base of the ski as it slides.
*'''Temperature''': Affects the ease with which sliding friction can melt snow crystals at the interface between ski and snow.

===Properties===
A variety of glide waxes are tailored for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting of the snow to lubricate its passage over the surface and its ability to avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26&amp;nbsp;°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, [[microcrystalline wax]]es with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and [[paraffin wax]]es with 20 to 35 carbon atoms.&lt;ref name = Talbot/&gt; Additives to such waxes include [[graphite]], [[teflon]], [[silicon]], [[fluorocarbons]], and [[molybdenum]] to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glide Wax|url=https://www.skiwax.ca/tp/glide.php|publisher=skiwax.ca|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base material===
The role of glide wax is to adapt and improve the friction properties of a ski base to the expected snow properties to be encountered on a spectrum from cold crystalline snow to saturated granular snow.  Modern ski bases often are made from [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)]]. Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, so there is no possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content.&lt;ref name="Kuz01"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Licentiate |title=Investigation of the most essential factors influencing ski glide |url=http://epubl.ltu.se/1402-1757/2006/03/LTU-LIC-0603-SE.pdf |last=Kuzmin |first=Leonid |year=2006 |publisher=Luleå University of Technology |accessdate=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same author asserts that texture is more important than surface chemistry for creating the optimum balance between a running surface that's too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow.&lt;ref name="Kuz03"/&gt; Giesbrecht agrees that low wetting angle of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the [[micrometre]] scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a textured surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Doctoral |title=Polymers on snow: Towards skiing faster |url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:1160/eth-1160-02.pdf |last=Giesbrecht |first=Jan Lukas |year=2010 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology |accessdate=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grip waxes are designed for specific temperature ranges and types of snow; a correctly selected grip wax does not appreciably decrease the glide of skis that have proper camber for the skier's weight and for the snow conditions.&lt;ref name=gripandglide/&gt; There are two substances used for grip wax: hard wax and klister.

The '''Stadio Dino Manuzzi''', also known as '''Orogel Stadium''' for sponsorship reason, is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Cesena]], Italy.  It is currently the home of [[A.S.D. Romagna Centro Cesena]]. The stadium holds 23,860.

The stadium was initially constructed in 1957 but at the time had no seats, just two terraces. In 1973, when AC Cesena reached Serie A status, the stadium was greatly expanded and could hold 30,000 spectators. In this version of the stadium, the highest ever attendance was recorded when on 10 February 1974, 35,991 people watched Cesena defeat giants AC Milan. The stadium was called '''La Fiorita''' from its construction until 1982, when it became named after former Cesena president Dino Manuzzi.

In 1988 the stadium underwent a complete restructuring were all of the existing stands were demolished and then rebuilt. The new capacity was reduced to 23,860.

As a part of Italy's Euro 2016 bid, the Dino Manuzzi was included and there were plans to invest close to €30m on the stadium. The planned changes included an increase in capacity to over 31,000 new press boxes, VIP lounges and media boxes. This fell through after Euro 2016 was awarded to France.

At the beginning of the 2011/12 season, the pitch was converted to an artificial playing surface, with Cesena becoming the first club to do so. On 13 August 2011, at the end of the Italy - Japan rugby match, fans were allowed to enter the pitch and take a cut out of grass with them. That same summer some further work was carried out on the stadium, including a capacity expansion by 1,000 seats. New chairs were installed. The chairs were a white and black colour and on one terrace they spell out AC Cesena. Two Plexiglas boxes were also installed on the side of the pitch, each holding eight supporters, where the fans can track the progress of the match from just a few meters away.

In 2014, {{ill|Orogel|it}} signed a sponsorship agreement with [[A.C. Cesena]], the tenant of the stadium. The stadium would be called '''Orogel Stadium – Dino Manuzzi'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/cesena/sport/calcio/accesena-stadio-orogel-stadium-1.246459|title=Cesena, il Manuzzi diventa Orogel Stadium|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=13 October 2018|newspaper=[[Il Resto del Carlino]]|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[U.S. Census Bureau]]''. Retrieved on May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[City and County of Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], on the campus of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. Initially named the '''Special Events Arena''' when it opened in 1994, the arena was renamed in 1998 after [[Stan Sheriff]] (1932–1993), a former UH athletic director who lobbied for its construction.

==Events==

'''Taylor "Tates" Locke''' (born February 25, 1937) is an American former [[basketball]] coach.

Locke coached the [[Buffalo Braves]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) for half a season, in 1976–77, before being replaced by [[Bob MacKinnon]].  Prior to his Buffalo experience, Locke coached for [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], where he hired a young assistant coach named [[Bobby Knight]].  Knight would later replace Locke when Locke left West Point. After West Point, Locke moved on to [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]], winning a MAC title in 1968-69.  Locke would subsequently coach at [[Clemson University]], but would be forced to resign as the result of an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] investigation into recruiting violations. The violation resulted in the Tigers being put on NCAA probation. He later coached at [[Jacksonville University]] and took them to an NCAA berth and [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] berth.

Locke would became the head coach at [[Indiana State University]] and served as a scout and assistant general manager for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].

The movie ''[[Blue Chips]]'', starring [[Nick Nolte]], is said to be based on Locke's career.  However, several midwestern college coaches claim to be the inspiration for the character.

'''Titan Gym''' is a 4,000 seat, indoor [[multi-purpose stadium]] on the campus of [[California State University, Fullerton]] in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], [[California]].

==History and renovations==
[[Image:TitanGym1.jpg|250px|left|Exterior of Titan Gym]]

Titan Gym was built in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daniels Comes Back to Basics |date=14 November 2000 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/14/sports/sp-51488?pg=3 |accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty years later, the gym hosted [[Handball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|handball]] competitions for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Milestones of Cal State Fullerton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Milestones of Cal State Fullerton |date= |work=[http://www.titanmag.com/ Titan Magazine] |url=http://www.titanmag.com/2007/milestones/index.html |accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 135-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]] spoke on behalf of the [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]]/[[Dan Quayle|Quayle]] campaign in 1988, his last [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] appearance as [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Milestones of Cal State Fullerton"/&gt;

In order to combat wear and tear on Titan Gym, there have been a number of improvements made.  Bleachers, which were used to seat the attendees, have been replaced with chair-back seats.  The floor was completely redesigned and resurfaced.  A new scoreboard was unveiled before the 2003 season and additional balcony seating was added before the start of the 2004 season.

For the [[Cal State Fullerton Titans|CSUF]] athletes, Titan Gym is also the home practice facility for the basketball and volleyball programs. 

The [[2018 U.S. Open (badminton)|2018 U.S. Open]], a stop on the [[2018 BWF World Tour|2018 Badminton World Federation Tour]], was held at the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yonex US Badminton Open (Prospectus)|url=http://bwfextranet.com/docs/events/3216/docs/US%20Open%202018%20_%20Prospectus%20Final%20_%20v1.10.pdf|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|accessdate=7 July 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future renovation plans include an expansion of the Titan Gym entrance to include a Titans Hall of Fame as well as a reception area for social functions.

==Tenants==
Currently the men's basketball, women's basketball and women's volleyball call Titan Gym home. The men's basketball team has played every season at Titan Gym since its opening in 1964.

The '''Turner Stadium''' ({{lang-he-n|אצטדיון טרנר}}), officially the '''Yaakov Turner Toto Stadium Be'er Sheva''' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|אצטדיון טוטו באר שבע ע"ש יעקב טרנר}}) is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Be'er Sheva]] and the home ground of [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Be'er Sheva]]. It was named for former Be'er Sheva mayor [[Yaakov Turner]].&lt;ref name=JP/&gt;

The stadium has an all-seated capacity of 16,126 seats, with the southern stand named after Arthur Vasermil, for whom the club's previous [[Vasermil Stadium]] was named.&lt;ref name=JP/&gt; and is a part of a [[sports complex]] which also includes the multi-purpose 3,000-seat [[Conch Arena]], a [[training field]] and a [[swimming pool]].

==History and features==
Completed in 1964, its stadium-style seats, combined with bleachers in the upper levels, accommodate 5,139 fans surrounding the maple wood floor. 

The playing surface in Western Hall has undergone several changes in its history. Originally a wooden floor, the regulation-size court was replaced with a tartan floor in 1973 and, prior to the 1993-94 basketball season, upgraded with a parquet floor similar to that in the old [[Boston Garden]]. In 2014, the parquet floor was replaced with a maple wood floor. The court is surrounded by a Chem-turf jogging track.

The building underwent massive construction in 1997 with the addition of the $8 million Student Recreation Center to its south. The SRC serves as host to all intramural and club sports, and houses a swimming pool, racquetball courts, suspended jogging track and state-of-the-art exercise equipment.

In the summer of 1999, the court received a face lift with a new floor design featuring Rocky, the WIU mascot, and it was refinished during the summer of 2000.
The latest addition to Western Hall, a new training facility for all WIU athletic programs and locker room for the Leatherneck football program which was added onto the East Arena, was completed in July, 2000.

==Events==
Besides serving as the home for varsity basketball and volleyball, Western Hall houses numerous athletic and physical education activities and many major Bureau of Cultural Affairs events, including concerts, musicals and multi-cultural entertainment events for all ages. One of the highlights of the 1999-2000 BCA season was an appearance by [[Bill Cosby]].

The Wimbledon Cup is a marksmanship trophy that was established in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nra.org/Article.aspx?id=788 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831054534/http://www.nra.org/Article.aspx?id=788 |archive-date=August 31, 2004 |accessdate=January 16, 2018 |title=Tubb is NRA 2004 Long Range Champion |publisher=NRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wimbledon Cup.jpg|thumb|The Wimbledon Cup for rifle shooting marksmanship]]

It is awarded annually during the [[National Rifle &amp; Pistol Matches]] which are held at [[Camp Perry]], Ohio.

Each year the high-power phase of these matches traditionally takes place during the first two weeks of August. The Wimbledon Cup is awarded for the winner of a 1000-yard shooting match &amp;mdash; in which the rules permit use of "any sight", including telescopes.

Concurrent with the Wimbledon, [[High power rifle|service rifle]] shooters compete for the Farr Trophy, and [[International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations|Palma]] rifle shooters vie for the "Doc" Aiken Trophy.

==History==
The Wimbledon Cup is a silver tankard wrought by
British silversmiths of the Victorian period.

The [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom]] inaugurated the prize in 1866. The [[Illustrated London News]] reported on July 26, 1866, that the Wimbledon Cup was a new prize for the Wimbledon Rifle Meeting of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iln.org.uk/iln_years/year/1866.htm|title=New Prizes at The Wimbledon Volunteer Rifle Meeting
|date=July 26, 1866|work=Illustrated London News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, the trophy was presented to the American rifle team attending the British matches at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] by Princess Louise, on behalf of the riflemen of Great Britain. Members of the American team competed among themselves for the trophy at Wimbledon; this match was won by Major Henry Fulton. The Wimbledon Cup was taken to the United States and placed in annual competition at [[Creedmoor Rifle Range]] as the trophy for a long range match open to any rifle. Michelle Gallagher has won the most cups with five. Her family have won it seven times. Her mother Nancy H. Tompkins-Gallagher won once and her step-father Middleton W. Tompkins won once.

The 1965 Trophy was awarded to [[Carlos Hathcock|LCPL Carlos N. Hathcock, USMC]].
