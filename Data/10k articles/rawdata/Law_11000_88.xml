      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40709">In the United States, a '''401(k)''' plan is the tax-qualified, [[defined contribution|defined-contribution]] [[pension]] account defined in subsection 401(k) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; Under the plan, retirement savings contributions are provided (and sometimes proportionately matched) by an employer, deducted from the employee's paycheck before taxation (therefore [[Tax deferral|tax-deferred]] until withdrawn after retirement or as otherwise permitted by applicable law), and limited to a maximum pre-tax annual contribution of $18,500 (as of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits|title=Retirement Topics 401k and Profit Sharing Plan Contribution Limits {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/retirement-planning/401k1.htm How 401 k Plans Work] by Lee Ann Obringer&lt;/ref&gt;

Other employer-provided defined-contribution plans include [[403(b)]] plans for nonprofit institutions, [[457 plan#457(b) (eligible) plans|457(b)]] plans for governmental employers, and [[401(a)]] plans. These plans may provide total annual addition of $55,000 (as of 2018) per plan participant, including both employee and employer contributions.

==History==
In the early 1970s a group of high-earning individuals from [[Kodak]] approached Congress to allow a part of their salary to be invested in the stock market and thus be exempt from income taxes.&lt;ref name="olen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olen|first1=Helaine|title=Pound foolish : Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry|date=31 December 2013|publisher=Portfolio|isbn=159184679X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in section 401(k) being inserted in the then taxation regulations that allowed this to be done. The section of the Internal Revenue Code that made such 401(k) plans possible was enacted into law in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See section 135(a) of the [[Revenue Act of 1978]], Pub. L. No. 95-600, 92 Stat. 2763, 2785 (Nov. 6, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to allow taxpayers a break on taxes on deferred income. In 1980, a benefits consultant and attorney named Ted Benna took note of the previously obscure provision and figured out that it could be used to create a simple, tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. The client for whom he was working at the time chose not to create a 401(k) plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1851124,00.html|title=A Brief History Of: The 401(k)|first=Alyssa|last=Fetini|date=16 October 2008|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later went on to install the first 401(k) plan at his own employer, the Johnson Companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/your-401k-when-it-was-invented-and-why/|title=Your 401(k): When It Was Invented—and Why}}&lt;/ref&gt; (today doing business as Johnson Kendall &amp; Johnson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jkj.com/about/history/|title=History - Johnson, Kendall &amp; Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, employees could contribute 25% of their salary, up to $30,000 per year, to their employer's 401(k) plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Deferred income guarantees before-tax dollars are saved |work= Providence Journal |location= Providence, Rhode Island |date= February 14, 1984 |first= Steve |last= Winter |page= B5 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1525C18197AC5168&amp;p_docnum=4&amp;p_queryname=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
Income taxes on pre-tax contributions and investment earnings in the form of interest and dividends are tax deferred. The ability to defer income taxes to a period where one's tax rates may be lower is a potential benefit of the 401(k) plan. The ability to defer income taxes has no benefit when the participant is subject to the same tax rates in retirement as when the original contributions were made or interest and dividends earned. Earnings from investments in a 401(k) account in the form of capital gains are not subject to capital gains taxes. This ability to avoid this second level of tax is a primary benefit of the 401(k) plan. Relative to investing outside of 401(k) plans, more income tax is paid but less taxes are paid overall with the 401(k) due to the ability to avoid taxes on capital gains.

For pre-tax contributions, the employee does not pay federal income [[tax]] on the amount of current income he or she defers to a 401(k) account, but does still pay the total 7.65% payroll taxes (social security and medicare). For example, a worker who otherwise earns $50,000 in a particular year and defers $3,000 into a 401(k) account that year only reports $47,000 in income on that year's tax return. Currently this would represent a near-term $750 saving in taxes for a single worker, assuming the worker remained in the 25% marginal [[tax bracket]] and there were no other adjustments (like deductions). The employee ultimately pays taxes on the money as he or she withdraws the funds, generally during retirement. The [[character (income tax)|character]] of any gains (including tax-favored capital gains) is transformed into "ordinary income" at the time the money is withdrawn.

Beginning in the 2006 tax year, employees have been allowed to designate contributions as a [[Roth 401(k)]] deferral. Similar to the provisions of a [[Roth IRA]], these contributions are made on an after-tax basis.

If the employee made after-tax contributions to the non-Roth 401(k) account, these amounts are commingled with the pre-tax funds and simply add to the non-Roth 401(k) basis.  When distributions are made the taxable portion of the distribution will be calculated as the ratio of the non-Roth contributions to the total 401(k) basis.  The remainder of the distribution is tax-free and not included in gross income for the year.

For accumulated after-tax contributions and earnings in a designated Roth account (Roth 401(k)), "qualified distributions" can be made tax-free. To qualify, distributions must be made more than 5 years after the first designated Roth contributions ''and'' not before the year in which the account owner turns age 59½, unless an exception applies as detailed in IRS code section 72(t). In the case of designated Roth contributions, the contributions being made on an after-tax basis means that the taxable income in the year of contribution is not decreased as it is with pre-tax contributions. Roth contributions are irrevocable and cannot be converted to pre-tax contributions at a later date. (In contrast to Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs), where Roth contributions may be re characterized as pre-tax contributions.) Administratively, Roth contributions must be made to a separate account, and records must be kept that distinguish the amount of contribution and the corresponding earnings that are to receive Roth treatment.

Unlike the Roth IRA, there is no upper income limit capping eligibility for Roth 401(k) contributions.  Individuals who find themselves disqualified from a Roth IRA may contribute to their Roth 401(k).  Individuals who qualify for both can contribute the maximum [[statutory]] amounts into either or a combination of the two plans (including both catch-up contributions if applicable). Aggregate statutory annual limits set by the IRS will apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics--401k-and-Profit-Sharing-Plan-Contribution-Limits|title=Retirement Topics - 401(k) and Profit-Sharing Plan Contribution Limits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawal of funds==
Generally, a 401k participant may begin to withdraw money from his or her plan after reaching the age of 59½ without penalty.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes severe restrictions on withdrawals of tax-deferred or Roth contributions while a person remains in service with the company and is under the age of 59½. Any withdrawal that is permitted before the age of 59½ is subject to an [[excise tax]] equal to ten percent of the amount distributed (on top of the ordinary income tax that has to be paid), including withdrawals to pay expenses due to a hardship, except to the extent the distribution does not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction under Internal Revenue Code section 213 to the employee for amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care (determined without regard to whether the employee itemizes deductions for such taxable year).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215012/https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/taking-money-early Taking money from an IRA or 401(k) early]". ''Fidelity Viewpoints''. Fidelity Investments. May 20, 2013. Archived from [https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/taking-money-early the original] on February 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts withdrawn are subject to ordinary income taxes to the participant.

The Internal Revenue Code generally defines a hardship as any of the following.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Allen. "[https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/Pages/IRS-hardship-withdrawals.aspx IRS: Self-Certification Permitted for Hardship Withdrawals from Retirement Accounts]". ''Society for Human Resource Professionals''. April 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Unreimbursed medical expenses for the participant, the participant's spouse, or the participant's dependent.
* Purchase of principal residence for the participant.
* Payment of college tuition and related educational costs such as room and board for the next 12 months for the participant, the participant's spouse or dependents, or children who are no longer dependents.
* Payments necessary to prevent foreclosure or eviction from the participant's principal residence.
* Funeral and burial expenses.
* Repairs to damage of participant's principal residence.

Some employers may disallow one, several, or all of the previous hardship causes. To maintain the tax advantage for income deferred into a 401(k), the law stipulates the restriction that unless an exception applies, money must be kept in the plan or an equivalent tax deferred plan until the employee reaches 59½ years of age. Money that is withdrawn prior to the age of 59½ typically incurs a 10% penalty tax unless a further exception applies.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p575.pdf Publication 575: Pension and Annuity Income]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This penalty is on top of the "ordinary income" tax that has to be paid on such a withdrawal. The exceptions to the 10% penalty include: the employee's death, the employee's total and permanent disability, separation from service in or after the year the employee reached age 55, [[substantially equal periodic payments]] under section 72(t), a [[qualified domestic relations order]], and for deductible medical expenses (exceeding the 7.5% floor). This does not apply to the similar [[457 plan]].

Many plans also allow employees to take [[loan]]s from their 401(k) to be repaid with after-tax funds at predefined [[interest rate]]s. The interest proceeds then become part of the 401(k) balance. The loan itself is not taxable income nor subject to the 10% penalty as long as it is paid back in accordance with section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code. This section requires, among other things, that the loan be for a term no longer than 5 years (except for the purchase of a primary residence), that a "reasonable" rate of interest be charged, and that substantially equal payments (with payments made at least every calendar quarter) be made over the life of the loan. Employers, of course, have the option to make their plan's loan provisions more restrictive. When an employee does not make payments in accordance with the plan or IRS regulations, the outstanding loan balance will be declared in "default". A defaulted loan, and possibly accrued interest on the loan balance, becomes a taxable distribution to the employee in the year of default with all the same tax penalties and implications of a withdrawal.

These loans have been described{{By whom|date=March 2012}} as tax-disadvantaged, on the theory that the 401(k) contains before-tax dollars, but the loan is repaid with after-tax dollars. While this is precisely correct, the analysis is fundamentally flawed with regard to the loan principal amounts.  From your perspective as the borrower, this is identical to a standard loan where you are not taxed when you get the loan, but you have to pay it back with taxed dollars.   However, the interest portion of the loan repayments, which are essentially additional contributions to the 401(k), are made with after-tax funds but they do not increase the after-tax basis in the 401(k).  Therefore, upon distribution/conversion of those funds the owner will have to pay taxes on those funds a second time.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra, Tony. "[http://homeguides.sfgate.com/can-use-401k-funds-purchasing-second-home-tax-penalties-48576.html Can You Use Your 401(k) Funds for Purchasing a Second Home Without Tax Penalties?]" ''Demand Media''. Retrieved on January 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Required minimum distributions (RMD)===
Account owners must begin making distributions from their accounts by April 1 of the calendar year after turning age 70½ or April 1 of the calendar year after retiring, whichever is later. The amount of distributions is based on life expectancy according to the relevant factors from the appropriate IRS tables.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2017_publink1000230772 Publication 590: Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), Additional Material]". ''Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exception to minimum distribution for people still working once they reach that age. The exception only applies to the current plan they are participating in and does not apply if the account owner is a 5% owner of the business sponsoring the retirement plan.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-required-minimum-distributions-rmds Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs (Search "actually retire")]". ''Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;/ref&gt; Required minimum distributions apply to both pretax and after-tax Roth contributions. Only a Roth IRA is not subject to minimum distribution rules. Other than the exception for continuing to work after age 70½ differs from the rules for IRA minimum distributions. The same penalty applies to the failure to make the minimum distribution. The penalty is 50% of the amount that should have been distributed, one of the most severe penalties the IRS applies.  In response to the economic crisis, Congress suspended the [[IRA Required Minimum Distributions|RMD]] requirement for 2009.

===Required distributions for some former employees===
A 401(k) plan may have a provision in its plan documents to close the account of a ''former'' employee who have low account balances. Almost 90% of 401(k) plans have such a provision.&lt;ref&gt;Donhardt, Tracy. "[http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/personal-finance-pension-retirement/10576057-1.html Too many cashing out of 401(k)s]." ''Indianapolis Business Journal''. September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005, a 401(k) plan may require the closing of a former employee's account if and only if the former employee's account has less than $1,000 of vested assets.

When a former employee's account is closed, the former employee can either rollover the funds to an [[Individual Retirement Account]], rollover the funds to another 401(k) plan, or receive a cash distribution, less required income taxes and possibly a penalty for a cash withdrawal before the age of 59 1/2.

==Rollovers==

Rollovers between eligible retirement plans are accomplished in one of two ways: by a distribution to the participant and a subsequent rollover to another plan or by a direct rollover from plan to plan. Rollovers after a distribution to the participant must generally be accomplished within 60 days of the distribution. If the 60-day limit is not met, the rollover will be disallowed and the distribution will be taxed as ordinary income and the 10% penalty will apply, if applicable. The same rules and restrictions apply to rollovers from plans to IRAs.

===Direct rollovers===
A direct rollover from an eligible retirement plan to another eligible retirement plan is not taxable, regardless of the age of the participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc413.html |title=Topic 413 - Rollovers from Retirement Plans |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional to Roth conversions===
In 2013 the IRS began allowing conversions of existing Traditional 401(k) contributions to Roth 401(k). In order to do so, an employee's company plan must offer both a Traditional and Roth option and explicitly permit such a conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Caplinger, Dan. (2013-01-08) [http://www.fool.com/retirement/401k/2013/01/08/convert-401k-to-roth-smart-move.aspx Convert 401(k) to Roth: Smart Move?]. Fool.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==

===Contribution deferral limits===
There is a maximum limit on the total yearly ''employee'' pre-tax or Roth salary deferral into the plan. This limit, known as the "402(g) limit", was $15,500 for the year 2008; $16,500 for 2009–2011; $17,000 for 2012; $17,500 for 2013–2014; $18,000 for 2015–2017; $18,500 for 2018; and $19,000 for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=187833,00.html |title=IRS Announces Pension Plan Limitations for 2009 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=2008-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/participant/article/0,,id=151786,00.html |title=401(k) Resource Guide – Plan Participants – Limitation on Elective Deferrals |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=2009-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=229975,00.html|title=IRS Announces Pension Plan Limitations for 2011|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|date=Oct 28, 2010|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/2013-Pension-Plan-Limitations |title=IRS Announces 2013 Pension Plan Limitations; Taxpayers May Contribute Up to $17,500 to Their 401(k) Plans in 2013 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Announces-2015-Pension-Plan-Limitations;-Taxpayers-May-Contribute-up-to-$18,000-to-their-401%28k%29-plans-in-2015|title=IRS Announces 2015 Pension Plan Limitations; Taxpayers May Contribute up to $18,000 to their 401(k) plans in 2015|publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=2014-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 2018limits&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-17-64.pdf Notice 2017-64: 2018 Limitations Adjusted As Provided in Section 415(d), etc.]" ''Internal Revenue Service''.

Employees who are at least 50 years old at any time during the year are now allowed additional pre-tax "catch up" contributions of up to $5,000 for 2008; $5,500 for 2009–2014; and $6,000 for 2015–2019.&lt;ref name= 2018limits/&gt;&lt;ref name= 2019limits/&gt; The limit for future "catch up" contributions may also be adjusted for inflation in increments of $500. In eligible plans, employees can elect to contribute on a pre-tax basis or as a Roth 401(k) contribution, or a combination of the two, but the total of those two contributions amounts must not exceed the contribution limit in a single calendar year.  This limit does not apply to post-tax non-Roth elections.

If the employee contributes more than the maximum pre-tax/Roth limit to 401(k) accounts in a given year, the excess as well as the deemed earnings for those contributions must be withdrawn or corrected by April 15 of the following year. This violation most commonly occurs when a person switches employers mid-year and the latest employer does not know to enforce the contribution limits on behalf of their employee. If this violation is noticed too late, the employee will not only be required to pay tax on the excess contribution amount the year was earned, the tax will effectively be doubled as the late corrective distribution is required to be reported again as income along with the earnings on such excess in the year the late correction is made.

Plans which are set up under section 401(k) can also have employer contributions that cannot exceed other regulatory limits. Employer matching contributions can be made on behalf of designated Roth contributions, but the employer match must be made on a pre-tax basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4530.pdf |title=IRS Publication 4530: Designated Roth Accounts under a 401(k) or 403(b) Plan: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plans also have a profit-sharing provision where employers make additional contributions to the account and may or may not require matching contributions by the employee.  These additional contributions may or may not require a matching employee contribution to earn them.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/404 26 CFR §404(a)(3)(A)(i)]". via ''Legal Information Institute''. Cornell University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p560.pdf Publication 560: Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans]". 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the matching funds, these contributions are also made on a pre-tax basis.

There is also a maximum 401(k) contribution limit that applies to all employee and employer 401(k) contributions in a calendar year.  This limit is the section 415 limit, which is the lesser of 100% of the employee's total pre-tax compensation or $44,000 for 2006; $45,000 for 2007; $46,000 for 2008; $49,000 for 2009–2011; $50,000 for 2012; $51,000 for 2013; $52,000 for 2014; $53,000 for 2015-2016; $54,000 for 2017; $55,000 for 2018; and $56,000 for 2019.&lt;ref name= 2018limits/&gt;&lt;ref name=2019limits/&gt; For employees over 50, the catch-up contribution limit is also added to the section 415 limit.

Governmental employers in the United States (that is, federal, state, county, and city governments) are currently barred from offering 401(k) retirement plans unless the retirement plan was established before May 1986. Governmental organizations may set up a section 457(b) retirement plan instead.

===Contribution deadline===
For a corporation, or LLC taxed as a corporation, contributions must be made by the end of a calendar year. For a sole proprietorship, partnership, or an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship, the deadline for depositing contributions is generally the personal tax filing deadline (April 15, or September 15 if an extension was filed).

===Highly compensated employees (HCE)===
To help ensure that companies extend their 401(k) plans to low-paid employees, an IRS rule limits the maximum deferral by the company's highly compensated employees (HCEs) based on the average deferral by the company's non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). If the less compensated employees save more for retirement, then the HCEs are allowed to save more for retirement. This provision is enforced via "non-discrimination testing". Non-discrimination testing takes the deferral rates of HCEs and compares them to NHCEs. In 2008, an HCE was defined as an employee with compensation greater than $100,000 in 2007, or as an employee that owned more than 5% of the business at any time during the year or the preceding year.&lt;ref name="US CODE Title 26,414q"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/414-#q|title=US CODE Title 26,414(q) |publisher=Cornell University Law School |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the $100,000 limit for determining
HCEs, employers can elect to limit the top-paid group of employees to the top 20% of employees ranked by compensation.&lt;ref name="US CODE Title 26,414q"/&gt; That is, for plans with the first day of the plan-year in the 2007 calendar year, HCEs are employees who earned more than $100,000 in gross compensation (also known as 'Medicare wages') in the prior year. For example, most testing done in 2009 was for the 2008 plan-year, which compared 2007 plan-year gross compensation to the $100,000 threshold in order to determine who was an HCE and who was an NHCE.  The threshold became $110,000 for 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=229975,00.html IRS Announces Pension Plan Limitations for 2011]. Irs.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The threshold was $115,000 for 2012–2014; and $120,000 for 2015–2018.&lt;ref name= 2018limits/&gt; 

The actual deferral percentage (ADP) of all HCEs as a group cannot exceed 2 percentage points greater than all NHCEs as a group. This is known as the ADP test. When a plan fails the ADP test, it essentially has two options to come into compliance. A return of excess can be given to the HCEs to lower the HCE ADP to a passing level, or it can process a "qualified non-elective contribution" (QNEC) to some or all of the NHCEs in order to raise the NHCE ADP to a passing level. A return of excess requires the plan to send a taxable distribution to the HCEs (or reclassify regular contributions as catch-up contributions subject to the annual catch-up limit for those HCEs over 50) by March 15 of the year following the failed test. A QNEC must be vested immediately.

The annual contribution percentage (ACP) test is similarly performed but also includes employer matching and employee after-tax contributions. ACPs do not use the simple 2% threshold, and include other provisions which can allow the plan to "shift" excess passing rates from the ADP over to the ACP. A failed ACP test is likewise addressed through return of excess, or a QNEC or qualified match (QMAC).

There are a number of "[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]" provisions that can allow a company to be exempted from the ADP test.   This includes making a "safe harbor" employer contribution to employees' accounts. Safe harbor contributions can take the form of a match (generally totaling 4% of pay) or a non-elective profit sharing (totaling 3% of pay). Safe harbor 401(k) contributions must be 100% vested at all times with immediate eligibility for employees. There are other administrative requirements within the safe harbor, such as requiring the employer to notify all eligible employees of the opportunity to participate in the plan, and restricting the employer from suspending participants for any reason other than due to a hardship withdrawal.

===Automatic enrollment===
Employers are allowed to automatically enroll their employees in 401(k) plans, requiring employees to actively opt out if they do not want to participate (traditionally, 401(k)s required employees to opt in). Companies offering such automatic 401(k)s must choose a default investment fund and savings rate. Employees who are enrolled automatically will become investors in the default fund at the default rate, although they may select different funds and rates if they choose, or even opt out completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retirementmadesimpler.org/WhoWeAre/MediaFAQs.shtml |title=Retirement Made Simpler: FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic 401(k)s are designed to encourage high participation rates among employees. Therefore, employers can attempt to enroll non-participants as often as once per year, requiring those non-participants to opt out each time if they do not want to participate. Employers can also choose to escalate participants' default contribution rate, encouraging them to save more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/regs/fedreg/final/07-5147.pdf |title=Default Investment Alternatives Under Participant Directed Individual Account Plans; Final Rule |publisher=Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]] made automatic enrollment a safer option for employers. Prior to the Pension Protection Act, employers were held responsible for investment losses as a result of such automatic enrollments.  The Pension Protection Act established a safe harbor for employers in the form of a "Qualified Default Investment Alternative", an investment plan that, if chosen by the employer as the default plan for automatically enrolled participants, relieves the employer of financial liability. Under Department of Labor regulations, three main types of investments qualify as QDIAs: lifecycle funds, balanced funds, and managed accounts.  QDIAs provide sponsors with fiduciary relief similar to the relief that applies when participants affirmatively elect their investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsdefaultoptionproposalrevision.html |title=Default Investment Alternatives Under Participant-Directed Individual Account Plans | publisher=Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fees===
401(k) plans charge fees for administrative services, investment management services, and sometimes outside consulting services. They can be charged to the employer, the plan participants or to the plan itself and the fees can be allocated on a per participant basis, per plan, or as a percentage of the plan's assets. For 2011, the average total administrative and management fees on a 401(k) plan was 0.78 percent or approximately $250 per participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ici.org/pdf/rpt_11_dc_401k_fee_study.pdf |title=Defined Contribution / 401(k) Fee Study | author=[[Deloitte Consulting LLP]] for the [[Investment Company Institute]] |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Supreme Court ruled, in 2015, that plan administrators could be sued for excessive plan fees and expenses, in Tibble v. Edison International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/05/opinion-analysis-justices-confirm-continuing-duty-for-erisa-trustees-to-monitor-investments/|title=Opinion analysis:  Justices confirm continuing duty for ERISA trustees to monitor investments|date=19 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Tibble case, the Supreme Court took strong issue with a large company placing plan investments in "retail" mutual fund shares as opposed to "institutional" class shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://retirement-plan-lawyer.com/401k-plan-trustees-have-continuing-duty-to-monitor/ |title=Supreme Court Permits Cause of Action for Putting 401(k) Investments in Retail as Opposed to Institutional Shares |access-date=2015-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305181031/http://retirement-plan-lawyer.com/401k-plan-trustees-have-continuing-duty-to-monitor/ |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top-heavy provisions===
The IRS monitors defined benefit plans such as 401(k)s to determine if they are top-heavy, or weighted too heavily in providing benefits to [[key employee]]s.  If the plans are too top-heavy, the company must remedy this by allocating funds to the other employees' (known as non-key employees) benefit plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401k-Plan-Fix-It-Guide-The-Plan-was-Top-Heavy-and-Required-Minimum-Contributions-Were-not-Made-to-The-Plan |title=401(k) Plan Fix-It Guide - The plan was top-heavy and required minimum contributions weren't made to the plan. |publisher=irs.gov |date=2015-10-23 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans for certain small businesses or sole proprietorships==
The [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] (EGTRRA) made 401(k) plans more beneficial to the self-employed. The two key changes enacted related to the allowable "Employer" deductible contribution, and the "Individual" IRC-415 contribution limit.

Prior to EGTRRA, the maximum tax-deductible contribution to a 401(k) plan was 15% of eligible pay (reduced by the amount of salary deferrals). Without EGTRRA, an incorporated business person taking $100,000 in salary would have been limited in Y2004 to a maximum contribution of $15,000. EGTRRA raised the deductible limit to 25% of eligible pay without reduction for salary deferrals. Therefore, that same businessperson in Y2008 can make an "elective deferral" of $15,500 plus a profit sharing contribution of $25,000 (i.e. 25%), and—if this person is over age 50—make a catch-up contribution of $5,000 for a total of $45,500. For those eligible to make "catch-up" contribution, and with salary of $122,000 or higher, the maximum possible total contribution in 2008 would be $51,000.  To take advantage of these higher contributions, many vendors now offer [[Solo 401(k)|Solo 401(k) plans or Individual(k) plans]], which can be administered as a Self-Directed 401(k), permitting investment in real estate, mortgage notes, tax liens, private companies, and virtually any other investment.

Note: an unincorporated business person is subject to slightly different calculation. The government mandates calculation of profit sharing contribution as 25% of ''net self-employment (Schedule C) income''. Thus on $100,000 of self-employment income, the contribution would be 20% of the gross self-employment income, 25% of the net after the contribution of $20,000.

===Rollovers as business start-ups (ROBS)===
ROBS is an arrangement in which prospective business owners use their 401(k) retirement funds to pay for new business start-up costs.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=231594,00.html|title=Retirement News for Employers – Fall 2010 Edition – Rollovers as Business Start-Ups Compliance Project|publisher=IRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROBS is an acronym from the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] for the IRS ROBS [[Rollovers as Business Start-Ups]] Compliance Project.

ROBS plans, while not considered an abusive tax avoidance transaction, are questionable because they may solely benefit one individual – the individual who rolls over his or her existing retirement 401(k) withdrawal funds to the ROBS plan in a tax-free transaction. The ROBS plan then uses the rollover assets to purchase the stock of the new business. A [[C corporation]] must be set up in order to roll the 401(k) withdrawal.

==Other countries==
Even though the term "401(k)" is a reference to a specific provision of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code section 401, it has become so well known that it has been used elsewhere as a generic term to describe analogous legislation. For example, in October 2001, [[Japan]] adopted legislation allowing the creation of "Japan-version 401(k)" accounts even though no provision of the relevant Japanese codes is in fact called "section 401(k)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actuary-japan.com/llohmann/liafacts/2206.htm|title=LIA$Facts$ June, 2002 - Defined Contribution Plans in Japan ("Japan 401K") - Portability|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htm.co.jp/services_human_resource_japan_2.htm|title=Human Resources Retirement Plans Japan - Outsourcing by HTM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/finance/gt/662/|title=[企業年金・401k] All About｜企業年金や確定拠出年金を解説|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Japanese|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar pension schemes exist in other nations as well. 
The term is not used in the [[UK]], where analogous pension arrangements are known as [[personal pension scheme]]s. In Australia, they are known as [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation]] funds.

Similarly, [[India]] has a scheme called [[Public Provident Fund (India)|PPF]] and EPF, that are loosely similar to 401 (k) schemes, wherein the employee contributes 7.5% of his / her salary to the provident fund and this is matched by an equal contribution by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Provident Fund|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/PPF|accessdate=15 November 2016|publisher=Economic Times|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Employees' Provident Fund Organisation]] (EPFO) is a statutory body of the [[Government of India]] under the [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Ministry of Labour and Employment]]. It administers a compulsory contributory Provident Fund Scheme, Pension Scheme and an Insurance Scheme. The schemes covers both Indian and international workers (for countries with which bilateral agreements have been signed; 14 such social security agreements are active). It is one of the largest social security organisations in India in terms of the number of covered beneficiaries and the volume of financial transactions undertaken. The EPFO's apex decision making body is the Central Board of Trustees.

[[Nepal]] and [[Employees' Provident Fund, Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] have similar [[Employees Provident Fund Nepal|employees provident fund]] schemes. In [[Malaysia]], The [[Employees Provident Fund (Malaysia)|Employees Provident Fund (EPF)]] was established in 1951 upon the Employees Provident Fund Ordinance 1951. The EPF is intended to help employees from the private sector save a fraction of their salary in a lifetime banking scheme, to be used primarily as a retirement fund but also in the event that the employee is temporarily or no longer fit to work. As of March 31, 2014, the size of the EPF asset size stood at RM597 billion (US$184 billion), making it the fourth largest [[pension fund]] in [[Asia]] and seventh largest in the world.

==Risk==
Unlike defined benefit [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act|ERISA]] plans or banking institution savings accounts, there is no government insurance for assets held in 401(k) accounts. Plans of sponsors experiencing financial difficulties sometimes have funding problems. However, the bankruptcy laws give a high priority to sponsor funding liability. In moving between jobs, this should be a consideration by a plan participant in whether to leave assets in the old plan or roll over the assets to a new employer plan or to an individual retirement arrangement (an IRA). Fees charged by IRA providers can be substantially less than fees charged by employer plans and typically offer a far wider selection of investment vehicles than employer plans.

'''Abraham Lincoln's patent''' relates to an [[invention]] to lift boats over [[shoal]]s and obstructions in a river.&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Harry |last1=Goldsmith |title=Abraham Lincoln, Inventions and Patents |work=Journal of the Patent Office Society |volume=20 |date=January 1938 |pages=5–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only [[United States patent]] ever registered to a [[United States President|President of the United States]].&lt;ref name="pony"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.myoutbox.net/popch25.htm |title=The Patent Office Pony: A History of the Early Patent Office |first1=Kenneth W. |last1=Dobyns |date=November 1994 |page=150 |publisher=Sergeant Kirkland's Museum and Historical Society |place=Fredericksburg, VA |edition=1st |chapter=Chapter 25. Antebellum |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |isbn= 978-0-9632137-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{McCormick1931|at= back cover, p. 114|mode=cs1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] conceived the idea of inventing a mechanism that would lift a boat over shoals and obstructions when on two different occasions the boat on which he traveled got hung up on obstructions. The original documentation of this patent was rediscovered in 1997.

This device was composed of large [[bellows]] attached to the sides of a boat that were expandable due to air chambers.  His successful patent application led to his drafting and delivering two lectures on the subject of patents while he was President. Lincoln was at times a [[patent attorney]] and was familiar with the patent application process as well as patent lawsuit proceedings.  Among his notable patent law experiences was litigation over the mechanical [[reaper]]; both he and his future Secretary of War, [[Edwin Stanton]], provided [[counsel]] for [[John Henry Manny]].&lt;ref name="McCormick_1931_pp61-62"&gt;{{Harvp|McCormick|1931|pp=61–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The invention stemmed from Lincoln's experiences ferrying travelers and carrying freight on the [[Great Lakes]] and some [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] rivers.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/object-oct06.html |title=Inventive Abe: In 1849, a future president patented an ingenious addition to transportation technology |first1=Owen |last1=Edwards |journal=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |date=October 2006 |accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, Lincoln wrote his autobiography and recounted that while in his late teens he took a [[flatboat]] down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River]]s from his home in [[Indiana]] to [[New Orleans]] while employed as a hired hand. The son of the boat owner kept him company and the two went out on this new undertaking without any other helpers.&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/education/patent.htm |title=Lincoln's Patent |publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online |accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[Macon County, Illinois]], Lincoln made an additional trip a few years later on another flatboat that went from [[Beardstown, Illinois]], to New Orleans. He, John D. Johnston (his stepmother's son) and [[John Hanks]] were hired as laborers by [[Denton Offutt]] to take a flatboat to New Orleans. They were to join Offutt at [[Springfield, Illinois]]. In early March 1831, the boys purchased a [[Voyageurs#Canoes|large canoe]] and traveled south on the [[Sangamon River]].

When they finally found him, they discovered Offutt had failed to secure a contract for a freight trip in Beardstown. Thus, purchasing the large canoe was an unnecessary expense. They then tried to cut their losses and worked for Offutt for twelve dollars per month [[Logging|cutting timber]] and building a boat at [[Lincoln's New Salem|the Old Sangamon town]] (fifteen miles northwest of Springfield) on the Sangamon River. The new boat carried them to New Orleans based upon the original contract with Offutt.&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"/&gt;

As [[William Horman]] first wrote, "necessity is the mother of invention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |first=Gary|last=Martin  |year=1996 |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk./meanings/necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention.html |title=Necessity Is the Mother of Invention |work=The Phrase Finder |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Offutt's flatboat could reach the [[Illinois River]], it got hung up on a [[milldam]] at the Old Sangamon town. As the boat was sinking, Lincoln took action, unloading some cargo to right the boat, then drilling a hole in the bow with a large [[auger (drill)|auger]] borrowed from the local cooperage. After the water drained, he replugged the hole. With local help, he then [[portage]]d the empty boat over the dam, and was able to complete the trip to New Orleans.&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"/&gt;

At the age of 23, Lincoln started his political career in New Salem. Near the top of his agenda was improvement of [[ship transport|navigation]] on the Sangamon River. Lincoln's law partner and biographer, [[William H. Herndon]], also reports an additional incident at the time: a boat Lincoln was on got stranded on a shoal; the boat gradually swung clear and was dislodged after much manual exertion.&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"/&gt; This event, along with the Offutt's boat/milldam incident, prompted Lincoln to start thinking about how to lift vessels over river obstructions and [[shoal]]s. He eventually came up with an idea for inflatable flotation.

Called "Buoying Vessels Over Shoals," Lincoln envisioned a system of waterproof fabric bladders that could be inflated when necessary to help ease a stuck ship over such obstacles. When crew members knew their ship was stuck, or at risk of hitting a shallow, Lincoln's invention could be activated, which would inflate the air chambers along the bottom of the watercraft to lift it above the water's surface, providing enough clearance to avoid a disaster. As part of the research process, Lincoln designed a scale model of a ship outfitted with the device. This model (built and assembled with the assistance of a Springfield, Ill., mechanic named Walter Davis) is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].{{#tag:ref|There are contrary opinions as to the genesis of the model. One notes that the medal plaque affixed to it is misspelled as "Abram", a mistake not likely to be made by Lincoln himself. It concludes that it was likely made by a Washington model maker. Despite that, the Marine Collection curator thinks it is "one of the half dozen or so most valuable things in our collection."&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

After reporting to Washington for his two-year term in Congress (beginning March 1847), Lincoln retained Zenas C. Robbins, patent attorney.&lt;ref name="pony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="documents"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pddoc.com/skedaddle/articles/abraham_lincolns_patent.htm |title=Lincoln's Patent |work=American Civil War Anecdotes, Incidents, Articles, and Books |format= PDF |publisher=Skedaddle|accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins most probably had drawings done by Robert Washington Fenwick, his apprentice artist. Robbins processed the application,&lt;ref name="pony"/&gt; which became patent No. 6,469 on May 22, 1849. However, it was never produced for practical use.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"/&gt; There are doubts as to whether it would have actually worked: It "likely would not have been practical," stated Paul Johnston, curator of maritime history at the [[National Museum of American History]], "because you need a lot of force to get the buoyant chambers even two feet down into the water. My gut feeling is that it might have been made to work, but Lincoln's considerable talents lay elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

About that time, Lincoln took his son [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert Todd]] to the [[Old Patent Office Building]]{{#tag:ref|A modern temple to rational invention patterned after the [[Parthenon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H-08AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=Patent+Office+Parthenon#v=onepage&amp;q=Patent%20Office%20Parthenon&amp;f=false |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=April 16, 1859 |pages=263–264 |title=Patent Office |volume=XIV |number=32 |place=New York |accessdate=December 30, 2011 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican04161859-263}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}} model room to view the displays, sowing one of the youngster's fondest memories.&lt;ref name="pony"/&gt;  Lincoln himself continued to have a special affinity for the site.{{#tag:ref|In 1865, it was the venue for Lincoln's [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Second Inaugural Ball]], the first ball held in a government building; twelve years later the upper floor was destroyed in the [[1877 U.S. Patent Office fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/patent.html?c=y&amp;page=4 |title=Back to the Future: One of Washington's Most Exuberant Monuments—the Old Patent Office Building—Gets the Renovation it Deserves |first1=Adam |last1=Goodheart |journal=Smithsonian |date=July 2006 |page=4 |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302012310/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/patent.html?c=y&amp;page=4 |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=upper-alpha}}

Be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, of Springfield, in the county of Sangamon, in the state of Illinois, have invented a new and improved manner of combining adjustable buoyant air chambers with a steam boat or other vessel for the purpose of enabling their draught of water to be readily lessened to enable them to pass over bars, or through shallow water, without discharging their cargoes;&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6469?printsec=abstract&amp;dq=Abraham+Lincoln+patent&amp;ei=yz_zTumwLqjv0gGTmsiaAg&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham%20Lincoln%20patent&amp;f=false |title=Letters Patent No. 6,469 |publisher=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lincoln's reflections on patents==
Lincoln's exposure to the patent system, as an inventor and as a lawyer, engendered deep beliefs in its efficacy. In the United States, patent law has a constitutional foundation, was supported by the country's founders, and was viewed as an indispensable engine for economic development.&lt;ref name="ladas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |title=A Brief History of the Patent Law of the United States |accessdate=December 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115040700/http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It led him to deliver two lectures on the subject, and was reflected in his approach as president.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;{{cite book |ref= harv |first1=Jason |last1=Emerson |year= 2009 |title=Lincoln the Inventor |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7_77bXv_nAwC |place= Carbondale, IL |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8093-2898-7 |via= Google Books |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siupress.com/pages/catalogs/SIU_Press_Catalog_Spring-Summer_09.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=South Indiana University Press |title=Lincoln the Inventor |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602091018/http://www.siupress.com/pages/catalogs/SIU_Press_Catalog_Spring-Summer_09.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln had an attraction to machinelike accessories all his life, which some say was hereditary and handed down to him from his father's interest in labor-saving equipment. He made speeches on inventions before he became president. He said in 1858, ''Man is not the only animal who labors; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship.''&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"/&gt;

Lincoln admired the patent law system because of the reciprocal benefits it furnished both the inventor and society. In 1859 he noted that the patent system ". . . has secured to the inventor, for a limited time, the exclusive use of his invention; and thereby added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production of new and useful things."&lt;ref name="LincolnPatent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Illinois"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/library/what_we_have/patents_and_trademarks/lincolnpatents.html |title=Abraham Lincoln, Second Lecture on Discoveries and Inventions |location=Jacksonville, IL |date=February 11, 1859 |publisher=[[Illinois Library Association|Illinois State Library]] |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126040033/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/library/what_we_have/patents_and_trademarks/lincolnpatents.html |archivedate=January 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He described the discovery of America as the most important development "in the world's history," followed second by the technology of printing and third by patent laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/lstartinventors/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm |first1=Mary |last1=Bellis |title=A Patent for a President |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was himself a patent lawyer.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

Early in his legal career, he won an unreported [[patent infringement]] case for the defendant, styled ''Parker v. Hoyt''.  A jury found that his client's [[waterwheel]] did not infringe the patent. His second largest professional fee came from successful participation in the "[[Reaper]] Case", ''[[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick]] v. [[John Henry Manny|Manny]]''.  He was co-counsel for the defendant with two aggressive and preeminent Pennsylvania patent attorneys, George Harding, and [[Edwin M. Stanton]].

Although Lincoln was prepared and well-paid, his co-counsel thought him too "ungainly and unpresentable to be allowed to participate" and present the argument. Although he was sent home unheard, Manny won the case in an opinion authored by Supreme Court Judge [[John McLean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Reports of Cases Argued and Decided in the Circuit Court, Volume 6 |chapter= Cyrus H.

'''Agenda 21 for culture''' (now also known as '''Culture 21''') is a program for [[cultural governance]] developed in 2002–2004 and organized by [[United Cities and Local Governments]].
 
Part of the program's premise is to add culture as a fourth conceptual pillar of [[sustainable development]] in [[governance]], the historical three pillars of which are environment, social inclusion, and economics.

== History ==

"[[Agenda 21]]" is an agenda for [[sustainable development]] in the [[21st century]], approved by [[United Nations]] members at the Rio [[Earth Summit]] in 1992. The original Agenda 21 did not discuss culture in great depth. It did include a section (Chapter 28) known as "Local Agenda 21" which called for local governments to adopt action plans and to collaborate with international organizations; a deliberative process which itself would "increase household awareness of sustainable development issues".&lt;ref&gt;[[Agenda 21]], "[http://www.un-documents.net/a21-28.htm Chapter 28: Local Authorities' Initiatives in Support of Agenda 21]".&lt;/ref&gt; While the ecological dimension of Local Agenda 21 was paramount at first, cities in the following years have incorporated cultural development into their outlook on sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Oldřich Hájek, Jiří Novosák, &amp; Pavel Bednář, "[https://uottawa.scholarsportal.info/ojs/index.php/clg-cgl/article/view/187 Local Agenda 21 and Culture: Lessons from the Czech Republic]", ''Culture and Local Governance'' 3(2), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the [[World Bank]] and [[UNESCO]] jointly endorsed the inclusion of culture in the sustainable development strategy.&lt;ref name=DuxburyCullenPascual&gt;Nancy Duxbury, Catherine Cullen, &amp; Jordi Pascual, "Cities, Culture, and Sustainable Development"; in H.K. Anheier, Y.R. Isar &amp; M. Hoelscher, eds., ''Cultural  Policy and Governance in a New  Metropolitan Age''; London: Sage, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Serageldin &amp; Joan Martin-Brown, eds., ''[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/100961468770395932/pdf/multi-page.pdf Culture in Sustainable Development: Investing in cultural and natural endowments: proceedings of the conference sponsored by the World Bank and UNESCO, held at the World Bank, Washington, DC, September 28 and 29, 1998].'' Washington, DC: The World Bank, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, the first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in [[Porto Alegre]], resolved to create guidelines for local cultural policies. A final document was approved on 8 May 2004 in Barcelona, and on 15 September it was submitted to [[UN-HABITAT]] and [[UNESCO]]. In the same year, the world organization [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) was formed to coordinate this Agenda 21 for culture.

By 2010, over 400 governments and organizations had jointed Agenda 21 for culture in some way.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013&gt;Nancy Duxbury &amp; Sharon Jeannotte, "[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_Global_Cultural_Governance_Policy_Duxbury-Jeannotte_2013.pdf Global Cultural Governance Policy]"; Chapter 21 in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Planning and Culture''; London: Ashgate, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 membership exceeded 500.&lt;ref name=Vlassis2015 /&gt;

== Contents ==

The Agenda 21 for culture has 67 articles, divided into three sections: principles, undertakings, and recommendations. The "Principles" include core values such as [[cultural diversity]] and [[human rights]], as well as perspectives on which actors will implement the agenda. [[Cities]] are envisioned as primary sites for cultural production and governance, as well as places where cultural policy is necessary for harmonious coexistence. [[Culture]] itself is described as an essential part of constructing [[citizenship]] for people of all ages. Participation in culture takes place through channels including [[internet]], [[public space]]s, and work.&lt;ref name=A21C&gt;''Agenda 21 for culture'', adopted 8 May 2004. [http://www.agenda21culture.net/sites/default/files/files/documents/multi/ag21_en.pdf Culture 21], edited 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Undertakings" section encourages policies which support cultural development and expand access to culture without prejudice. It specifically mentions books, internet, museums, and tourism as vectors for culture. It calls for decentralized but funded cultural policies; multilateral cooperation between cultural institutions, NGOs, and governments; and popularization of scientific technical culture. It advocates the right of [[freedom of speech]], the [[moral rights]] of authors and artists, and the development of legal systems for historic preservation. The recommendations section addresses local and national governments, regional blocs, and international organizations, offering advice for how each of them can implement this agenda.&lt;ref name=A21C /&gt;

== Organization and initiatives ==

In the UCLG, the Agenda 21 for culture is managed by the Committee on Culture, which is co-chaired by Buenos Aires and the City of Mexico and vice-chaired by Angers, Barcelona, Belo Horizonte, Bilbao, Bogotá, Jeju, Paris and Porto Alegre since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.agenda21culture.net/sites/default/files/files/plan/report_2016_-_eng_def.pdf Report 2016] (Barcelona, 30 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2012 and 2015, the UCLG Committee on Culture was chaired by the [http://www.lillemetropole.fr Lille-Métropole] and co-chaired by Buenos Aires, México DF and Montreal, and the cities of Angers, Barcelona and Milan were Vice-Presidents and three other cities (one from Africa, one from Middle East/Asia and one from Asia/Pacific) to join the Board as Vice-Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;See the report of the 8th meeting of the Committee (Barcelona, September 2012) in [http://www.agenda21culture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=65&amp;lang=en Circular 62]&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2012, the Committee on culture was chaired by [http://www.bcn.cat/en/ihome.htm Barcelona city council], and [http://international.stockholm.se Stockholm], [https://web.archive.org/web/20091012193738/http://www.mairie-lille.fr/en Lille], [http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar Buenos Aires] and [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,40491560&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Montreal] councils are its vice presidents.

Other organizations promoting Agenda 21 for culture include UNESCO and the [[Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation]] (AECID).

In 2009–2010, UCLG, with AECID and the Barcelona City Council, created the Fund for Local Cultural Governance, to advance the implementation of the Agenda 21 for culture in African, Mediterranean and Latin American cities.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/2279 The UCLG Fund for Local Cultural Governance to Finance Projects in 11 Cities]", [[Cities Alliance]], 13 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009–2013 UNESCO and the AECID developed "Culture for Development Indicators" (CDIS), an "advocacy and policy" toll for assessing cultural development in 22 areas within 7 categories.&lt;ref name=Vlassis2015&gt;Antonios Vlassis, "Culture in the post-2015 development agenda: the anatomy of an international mobilization"; ''Third World Quarterly'' 36(9), 2015; [[DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1052064]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the UCLG Committee on Culture has worked to ensure that culture is explicitly integrated into the development programmes of the United Nations which aim to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. After some awareness-raising actions during the Millennium Development Goals Summit, the UN General Assembly approved the final document of the Summit that mentions culture as an important dimension of development.

UNESCO and UCLG have advocated for inclusion of culture in the 2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and have continued to promote this outlook.&lt;ref name=Vlassis2015 /&gt;

== Reports ==

Since 2006, in the framework of its research tasks, the Agenda 21 for culture has published several reports:&lt;ref&gt;See reports: [http://www.agenda21culture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en here]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and development ==
[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|thumb|The [[Circles of Sustainability]] visualization incorporates culture as a fourth pillar of [[sustainable development]].]]

The Agenda 21 for culture is a tool to enhance the role of culture in urban policies and also a tool to make cultural issues the fourth pillar of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;This issue has been championed by Australian researcher and activist Jon Hawkes ([http://www.fourthpillar.biz www.fourthpillar.biz]) in his book ''The Fourth Pillar of Sustainability. Culture’s Essential Role in Public Planning''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sustainability" in culture refers not only to the preservation of cultural heritage but also to incorporating the sustainable development mentality into everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/30969983/Kangas_A._Duxbury_N._and_De_Beukelaer_C._2017_Introduction_cultural_policies_for_sustainable_development_International_Journal_of_Cultural_Policy_23_2_ Anita Kangas, Nancy Duxbury, &amp; Christiaan De Beukelaer], "Introduction: cultural policies for sustainable development"; ''International Journal of Cultural Policy'' 23(2). "Cultural sustainability tends to be defined in two ways. On one hand, it refers to the sustainability of cultural and artistic practices and patterns, including, for example, identity formation and expression, cultural heritage conservation, and a sense of cultural continuity. On the other hand, cultural sustainability also refers to the role of cultural traits and actions to inform and compose part of the pathways towards more sustainable societies. Culture lies at the core of practices and beliefs that can support or inspire the necessary societal transition to more sustainable living. These narratives, values, and actions contribute to the emergence of a more culturally sensitive understanding of sustainable development and to clarifying the roles of art, culture, and cultural policy in this endeavor."&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive work and activism undertaken by the Agenda 100 for culture led the UCLG Executive Bureau to head the preparation of the policy statement document "Culture: the Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", approved on 17 November 2010 in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders – 3rd UCLG World Congress, held in Mexico City. This document opens a new perspective and points to the relationship between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies.

== Participation ==
[[Quebec]] has endorsed the Agenda 21 for culture model and released a development plan along these lines.&lt;ref name=DuxburyCullenPascual /&gt; [[Montreal]] has ratified the agenda and undertaken various actions including library restoration and the creation of new cultural institutions, including "Design Montréal". An NGO called "Culture Montréal" has formed to promote development of and access to culture. Montreal has been designated a "UNESCO City of design".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Rober Choquet &amp; Marie-Eve Bonneau, "Montreal's local cultural policies: Montréal, cultural metropolis: from a municipal policy to a collective action plan. An article underlining the 5th anniversary of the Agenda 21 for culture"; in Pascual (2009), pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moroccan city [[Essaouira]], according to mayor [[Asma Chaabi]], has been incorporating culture into its implementation of Local Agenda 21 since the 1990s. She writes in the five-year review of Agenda 21 for culture that Essaouira has succeeded in its historic preservation goals through cooperation with the national ministry of culture and with UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Chaabi]], "The Agenda 21 for culture and Essaouira"; in Pascual (2009), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Dorfman''' (January 6, 1923 – January 20, 1983) was an insurance agency owner, and a consultant to the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT) Central States Pension Fund. He was a close associate of longtime IBT President [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and associated with organized crime via the [[Chicago Outfit]]. Dorfman was convicted on several felony counts, and was murdered in 1983.

==Early years==
Allen Dorfman was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] in 1923 to a [[working class]] family and attended [[Marshall Metropolitan High School|Marshall High School]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He enlisted in the [[US Marines]] and won a [[Silver Star]] at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. Crime writer [[Nicholas Pileggi]] and journalist [[Dan Moldea]] describe Allen as having an athletic build and premature grey hair and a stylish appearance. He attended the [[University of Illinois]] and taught physical education there. He and his wife, Lynn, were the parents of four children: James, Michael, David and Kim.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Allen Dorfman was the stepson of Paul "Red" Dorfman, the head of the Chicago Waste Handler's Union and a kingpin in the [[Chicago Outfit]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Allen Dorfman Built Wealth Through Teamster Contacts |author=Joseph B. Treaster |date=January 21, 1983 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/21/us/allen-dorfman-built-wealth-through-teamster-contacts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen's stepfather Paul had troubles with the [[AFL-CIO]] when he was caught taking funds out of the labor union's health and welfare reservoir, and, among other things, started paying personal bills with the membership money. Dorfman was only one of two trustees on the fund. In addition, his father had deposited $150,000 of health and welfare money into a bank owned by a friend, George Sax, who did not pay a cent of interest. Sax was the owner of the Saxony Motel in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], which was a meeting place for Hoffa, Dorfman, Robert Shulman and others when they were visiting southern Florida.

Through mobster Santo Perrone, Jimmy Hoffa had met Paul Dorfman. Dorfman and Perrone had done business together through the Chicago Scrap Handlers' Union. Through Paul Dorfman, Allen drew alliance with [[Joseph Glimco|Joey Glimco]], Paul DeLucia and [[Sam Giancana]]. In early 1949, Hoffa set up the Michigan Conference of the Teamsters' Welfare Fund. In 1951, he persuaded two trustees of the fund, [[Frank Fitzsimmons]] and employer delegate to move the fund to the newly formed Chicago branch of Union Casualty Agency. The branch was owned by Paul Dorfman's wife, Allen's mother Rosemary "Rose", and by Allen. This was despite the fact that Allen had no experience in the insurance.

Solicited by Paul Dorfman, the New York parent company gave Allen his start in the lucrative labor industry and helped set up the Chicago branch. Through his stepfather, Allen met Hoffa and Local 337's president, Owen Bert Brennan. When Union Casualty received fiduciary responsibility for the Michigan Conference Fund, Hoffa had already created a larger welfare fund, the Central States Health and Welfare Fund, which had also given its business to Union Casualty. The two fund accounts made up 90 percent of the branch company's contracts. During the first eight years of fiduciary management by Union Casualty the Dorfmans made more than $3 million in commissions and service fees. In one instance, Allen took $51,462 in premiums and simply deposited it in a special account that he maintained with his mother, with no complaints from the Teamsters.

Allen Dorfman was apparently well respected by the mob. A Chicago Outfit mob boss was once heard discussing Dorfman with a subordinate saying, "Allen [Dorfman] is not that type of guy, but the people that got a piece of him are that type of guy. Allen is meek and Allen is harmless. But the people behind him are not meek and they are not harmless."

==Teamsters' leader==
In 1949, Allen Dorfman formed the Union Insurance Agency and obtained a contract to provide health and welfare insurance for the [[Teamsters]] Central States union. The contract soon extended to sickness and accident insurance. In 1959, Dorfman became the subject of an investigation by the [[McClellan Committee]], a US Senate group investigating potential crimes and improprieties in the US labor movement. Dorfman came under scrutiny regarding the excessive fees paid by the Teamsters to Dorfman's company. The Committee suspected that large cash withdrawals from the business were actually [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] to [[Jimmy Hoffa]]. During the late 1950s, Dorfman got involved in approving loans for the Teamster's Central States Pension Fund. Many of these loans were real estate loans to associates of high-ranking Teamster members or to [[organized crime]] connected casinos in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. In 1963, Dorfman was [[indicted]] in the same [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], jury-fixing case that sent Hoffa to prison. However, Dorfman was acquitted in the case. After Hoffa went to prison in 1967, Dorfman took control of the Central States Pension fund. Among the loans he later made was a $160 million loan to [[Argent Corporation]], which owned a group of casinos, including the [[Stardust Resort &amp; Casino]]. The casinos at that time were infiltrated by organized crime and profits were being heavily [[Skimming (casinos)|skimmed]] and paid to organized crime. A number of organized crime members were later convicted in the case. By 1977, Dorfman had lost control of the pension fund due to the implementation of [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] and subsequent increases in outside control of the fund.&lt;ref&gt;''The Teamsters''; by Steven Brill; 1978 [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], New York, New York {{ISBN|0-671-22771-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorfman rose to prominence during labor unrest following [[World War II]], and by the late 1950s was a close cohort of IBT President [[Jimmy Hoffa]]. Dorfman's rise coincided with enormous expansion in Teamsters' ranks, along with spectacular growth in the union's pension funds, which eventually came largely under Dorfman's administration. The "Test Fleet" prosecution brought against Hoffa by the Justice Department, then headed by [[Attorney General of the United States|US Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resulted in a [[hung jury]] in December 1962. Dorfman, along with other Hoffa allies, was investigated and charged with [[jury tampering]]. Dorfman was acquitted in the case, but Jimmy Hoffa, was found guilty of this crime in 1964. After a lengthy appeals process Hoffa went to prison in 1967.

==Embezzlement conviction==
Alleged ties to [[organized crime]] dogged Dorfman during his time as a Teamsters' leader, as he was the stepson of the Chicago-based gangster Paul "Red" Dorfman. Dorfman, based mostly in Chicago, was eventually indicted, along with several other Teamsters' leaders, for [[embezzlement]] from the union [[pension fund]], in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"Hoffa Union Associate Indicted Over Kickback", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Jul 15, 1971.

In February 1974, Dorfman was indicted for fraud involving $1.4 million in loans made by the [[Teamster]]'s pension fund to Gaylur Products/American Pail Company, a plastics manufacturing company in [[Deming, New Mexico|Deming]], [[New Mexico]]. Indicted along with Dorfman were [[Joseph Lombardo]] (aka "Joey the Clown"), [[Anthony Spilotro]] (aka "The Ant"), Irwin Weiner, and several others. Between 1959 and 1969 the Central States Pension Fund Plan the loans had gone unpaid. But in 1971, Irwin Weiner a prominent bailbondsman, organized crime associate and friend of [[Jack Ruby]] had purchased stock in the company and received another $1.4 million loan from the fund with a mere $7,000 deposit. The government's case collapsed after their main witness, Daniel Seifert, was murdered in September 1974 and the defendants were either acquitted or dropped from the indictment. (Lombardo was convicted of Seifert's murder in 2007 as a result of [[Operation Family Secrets]].)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol9/pdf/HSCA_Vol9_5Fxv_Weiner.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DeAngeles among three acquitted by U.

==Violent death==
In 1979, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] launched "Operation Pendorf" (for penetration of Allen Dorfman). The FBI installed hidden microphones in the office of Dorfman's insurance agency. As a result of information obtained from the [[wiretaps]], a federal grand jury in Chicago indicted Dorfman and four others in May 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Bringing down the mob: the war against the American Mafia'', Thomas A. Reppetto; Henry Holt and Co. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7802-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}} Dorfman was subsequently convicted in December 1982, along with Teamsters' president [[Roy Lee Williams]] and [[Chicago Outfit]] enforcer [[Joseph Lombardo]], of conspiring to bribe [[Howard Cannon]], the Democratic [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Nevada]].

Three days before his sentencing, scheduled for January 23, 1983, Allen Dorfman was murdered outside the [[Purple Hotel|Lincolnwood Hyatt]] parking lot in [[Lincolnwood, Illinois]]. Described as a gangland-style execution, the murder was presumably intended to keep him from cooperating with authorities to avoid a possible 55-year prison sentence. He was with longtime friend Irwin Weiner, a known associate of many Chicago mob figures. Weiner was not injured in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dorfman slain in parking lot |newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=January 21, 1983 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-GYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PCoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4601,155497&amp;dq=allen-dorfman&amp;hl=en |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clues tie Mob to Dorfman killing |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |agency=UPI |date=January 25, 1983 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NbMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AmAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7079,4518232&amp;dq=allen-dorfman&amp;hl=en |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Alan King]] portrayed a character named Andy Stone in the Martin Scorsese film ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]''.  That character was based on elements from Allen Dorfman's life.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">'''Authenticated Received Chain''' ('''ARC''') is an [[email]] authentication system designed to allow an intermediate mail server like a mailing list or forwarding service to sign an email's original authentication results. This allows a receiving service to validate an email when the email's [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] and [[DKIM]] records are rendered invalid by an intermediate server's processing.&lt;ref name="ARC-Overview-2016Q3-v01.pdf"/&gt;

ARC is currently a draft standard with the [[IETF]].&lt;ref name="IETF ARC Draft 03"/&gt;{{FV|date=September 2018}}

==Overview==
[[DMARC]] allows a sender's domain to indicate that their emails are protected by [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] and/or [[DKIM]], and tells a receiving service what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes - such as to reject the message. However, a strict [[DMARC]] policy may block legitimate emails sent through a mailing list or forwarder, as the SPF check will fail due to the unapproved sender and the [[DKIM]] signature will be invalidated if the message is modified, such as by adding a subject tag or footer.

ARC helps to solve the problem of the SPF and DKIM signatures being invalidated by giving the intermediate server a way to sign the original message's validation results. Even if the SPF and DKIM validation fail, the receiving service can choose to validate the ARC. If the ARC indicates that the original message passed the SPF and DKIM checks and the only modifications were made by intermediaries trusted by that receiving service, the receiving service may choose to ignore the failed SPF, DKIM, or DMARC validation and accept the email anyway. It's up to each receiving service to decide which intermediaries to trust.

==Implementation==

ARC defines three new mail headers:

* '''ARC-Authentication-Results''' (abbreviated '''AAR''') - A combination of an instance number (i) and the results of the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation
* '''ARC-Seal''' (abbreviated '''AS''') - A combination of an instance number (i), a DKIM-like signature of the previous ARC-Seal headers, and the validity of the prior ARC entries.
* '''ARC-Message-Signature''' (abbreviated '''AMS''') - A combination of an instance number (i) and a DKIM-like signature of the entire message ''except'' for the ARC-Seal headers

To sign a modification, an intermediate server performs the following steps:
* Copies the "Authentication-Results" field into a new AAR field (starting with i=1) and prepends it to the message.
* Calculates the AMS for the message (with the AAR) and prepends it to the message.
* Calculates the AS for the previous Arc-Seal headers and prepends it to the message.

To validate an ARC, the recipient performs the following steps:
* Validates the chain of ARC-Seal headers (no missing entries, all ARC-Seal messages state that the prior ARC entries are valid, etc.)
* Validates the newest ARC-Message-Signature (based on the instance number)

The '''Bankruptcy Act of 1938''', also known as the '''Chandler Act''', expanded voluntary access to the [[bankruptcy]] system in the [[United States]] and made voluntary petitions more attractive to debtors. It also gave authority to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in the administration of bankruptcy filings.  One effect was to remove [[investment bank]]s from control of the corporate reorganization process by eliminating the equity receivership technique. Instead, a trustee was appointed by the bankruptcy court to oversee the reorganization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David A. |last=Skeel |title=Icarus in the boardroom: the fundamental flaws in corporate America and where they came from |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_weAxteZn1wC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22investment+banks%22+%22equity+receivership%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zQ6rTbCUBYXjiAKdlKTvDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22investment%20banks%22%20%22equity%20receivership%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bankruptcy Act, though now superseded by the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy Code]], remains an important interpretive tool for current bankruptcy law.

Several United States Supreme Court decisions have interpreted the Bankruptcy Code by looking back to the history of the Chandler Act. Some of the most notable decisions include:

- ''United States'' v. ''Whiting Pools, Inc.'', which justified the practice of requiring the IRS to return a bankrupt company's property under the Bankruptcy Code by reference to previous practice under the Bankruptcy Act. The Court wrote that Congress must have been aware of this previous practice and decided not to change it when it passed the Bankruptcy Code. &lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/462/198/case.html United States v. Whiting Pools]&lt;/ref&gt;

- ''Johnson'' v. ''Home State Bank'', in which the Court looked to the legislative history and precedent of the Bankruptcy Act to interpret the term "claim" in the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/78/ Johnson v. Home State Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

- ''Fidelity Financial Services, Inc.'' v. ''Fink'', in which the Court considered Bankruptcy Act's rules about and precedent interpreting avoidable preferences to resolve a similar question under the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/522/211/ Fidelity Financial Services v. Fink]&lt;/ref&gt;

- ''Cohen'' v. ''de la Cruz'', in which the court relied on practice under the Bankruptcy Act's to interpret the non-dischargeability provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/213/ Cohen v. de la Cruz]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of using the Bankruptcy Act to interpret the Bankruptcy Code has been criticized by some bankruptcy scholars. They claim that this interpretive tool leads to unpredictable results, may ignore the intent of Congress, and confuses lower courts interpreting Supreme Court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1447&amp;context=pubs Gebbia, Karen.

'''Carbonated soda treatment of phytobezoars''' is the use of [[carbonated soda]] to try to dissolve a [[phytobezoar]]. Bezoars consist of a solid and formed mass trapped in the [[gastrointestinal system]], usually in the [[stomach]].&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwamuro M. |author2=Okada H. |author3=Matsueda K. |author4=Inaba T. |author5=Kusumoto C. |author6=Imagawa A. |author7=Yamamoto K. | year = 2015 | title = Review of the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal bezoars | journal = World Journal of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 336–345 | doi = 10.4253/wjge.v7.i4.336 | pmid = 25901212 | pmc=4400622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000012475|bezoar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMarino 2002 551"&gt;{{cite book | last = DiMarino | first = Anthony | title = Gastrointestinal disease : an endoscopic approach | publisher = Slack | location = Thorofare, NJ | year = 2002|page=551 | isbn = 978-1556425110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can also form in other locations.&lt;ref name="pmid19070299"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bala M, Appelbaum L, Almogy G |title=Unexpected cause of large bowel obstruction: colonic bezoar |journal=Isr.

Carbonated soda has been proposed for the treatment of gastric phytobezoars. In about 50% of cases studied, carbonated soda alone was found to be effective in gastric phytobezoar [[solubility|dissolution]]. Unfortunately, this treatment can result in the potential of developing [[small bowel obstruction]] in a minority of cases, necessitating surgical intervention.&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015/&gt; It is one of many other stomach disorders that can have similar symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stomach, Definition and Patient Education |publisher=Healthline| url = http://www.healthline.com/health/stomach#Overview1 | accessdate = 2015-07-10  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gastric phytobezoars are a form of [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestinal]] blockage and are seen in those with poor gastric motility. The preferred treatment of bezoars includes different therapies and/or fragmentation to avoid surgery. Phytobezoars are most common and consist of various undigested substances including [[lignin]], [[cellulose]],  [[tannin]]s, [[celery]], [[pumpkin]] skin, [[grape]] skins, [[prune]]s, [[raisin]]s, vegetables and fruits.&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015/&gt; Phytobezoars can form after eating [[persimmon]]s and [[pineapple]]s. These are more difficult to treat and are referred to as [[diospyrobezoars]].&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt;

== Treatment ==
[[File:Pembertoncokeanzeige.jpg|thumb|Other medicinal claims for Coca-Cola]]
Carbonated soda may help to dissolve phytobezoars.&lt;ref name=Feld2016&gt;{{cite book | last = Feldman | first = Mark | title = Sleisenger and Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease : pathophysiology/diagnosis/management | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | page=435|year = 2016 | isbn = 978-1455746927 |quote=Carbonated soda (e.g., Coca Cola) may be effective in the dissolution of over 50% of cases of phytobezoars and over 90% when combined with endoscopic methods.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be given by a [[naso-gastric tube]] in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wyllie | first = R | title = Pediatric gastrointestinal and liver disease | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = Philadelphia | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1437735666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbonated soda can also be given by mouth and during [[endoscopy]].&lt;ref name="Elzouki 2012 1796"&gt;{{cite book | last = Elzouki | first = Abdelaziz | title = Textbook of clinical pediatrics | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2012 |page=1796| isbn = 978-3642022029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is effective in about half of the cases.&lt;ref name=Feld2016/&gt;

It promotes dissolution by endoscopic techniques in the majority of the patients left, leading to a final success rate up to 91.3%.&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladas|first1=S. D.|last2=Kamberoglou|first2=D.|last3=Karamanolis|first3=G.|last4=Vlachogiannakos|first4=J.|last5=Zouboulis-Vafiadis|first5=I.|title=Systematic review: Coca-Cola can effectively dissolve gastric phytobezoars as a first-line treatment|journal=Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|volume=37|issue=2|year=2013|pages=169–173|issn=0269-2813|doi=10.1111/apt.12141|pmid=23252775}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, regular use of Coca-Cola resulted in no recurrence 3–15 months after the first episode.&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt; Treatment has varied widely. Coca-Cola has been administrated either as drinking beverage or as lavage. Some are treated with various combinations of drink, injection and irrigation. The volume of Coca-Cola in treatment varies along with daily dose and time of treatment. Dosages varied from 500&amp;nbsp;mL up to 3000&amp;nbsp;mL and treatment period 24&amp;nbsp;hours to 6&amp;nbsp;weeks. When lavage is used, a double-lumen nasogastric tube or two separate tubes using 3000&amp;nbsp;mL of Coca-Cola is administered during a 12-hour period.&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt;  Alternative treatments are the use of cellulase, acetylcysteine, papain, pancreatic enzymes, saline solution, 0.1&amp;nbsp;N HCl and sodium bicarbonate. with papain such as gastric ulcer, hyponatremia and oesophageal perforation. The protocol for the treatment of phytobezoars with Coca-Cola, i.e., dosage and timing, has not been standardized; further investigation has been encouraged.&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015/&gt;

== Contraindications ==
[[Trichobezoar]]s do not respond to treatment with Coca-Cola but instead this type may have to be surgically removed.&lt;ref name="Elzouki 2012 1796"/&gt; Persimmon diospyrobezoars sometimes are resistant to Coca-Cola and require a different treatment. This can include endoscopic fragmentation and/or surgical approaches especially in urgent cases where the patient exhibits gastrointestinal bleeding.&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt;

== Adverse effects and interactions ==
Adverse effects have been observed with the use of papain such as gastric ulcer, hyponatremia and oesophageal perforation.&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt; These effects have not been observed with the use of Coca-Cola. Glucose levels during the administration of Coca-Cola have not been addressed.

== Pharmacology and interactions ==
In addition to Coca-Cola, [[meat tenderizer]] has been used to dissolve bezoars of the stomach.&lt;ref name="Stockman 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stockman | first = James | title = Year book of pediatrics | publisher = Elsevier Mosby | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0323087469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Norton | first = Jeffrey | title = Surgery basic science and clinical evidence | publisher = Springer | location = New York, NY |page=868| year = 2008 | isbn = 9780387308005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When treatment with Coca-Cola is combined with endoscopic methods, the success of treatment approaches 90%.&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt;  The mechanism by which Coca-Cola dissolves the bezoar is based upon its low pH, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubbles, and sodium bicarbonate content.&lt;ref name="Elzouki 2012 1796"/&gt; 

:::"...patients given a continuous infusion of Coca-Cola by nasogastric tube over 12 hours showed complete resolution of bezoars.  If you cannot find a can of Coke, perhaps Pepsi will do the trick, assuming it does not cause dysPEPSIa."&lt;ref name="Stockman 2011"/&gt;

Some clinicians have described the mode of interaction is based upon the acidification of the gastric contents and the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that causes disintegration. Three and a half liters given nasogastrically over 12 hours has been found to dissolve these bezoars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = LastName | first = FirstName | title = Clinical cases and pearls in medicine | publisher = Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd | location = New Delhi | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-9351526469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola has a pH of 2.6. This is due to carbonic and phosphoric acid which resemble gastric acid. Gastric acid is believed to facilitate the digestion of fibers. In Coca-Cola, NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a mucolytic effect and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubbles enhance dissolving the bezoar. Coca-Cola reduces the size and softens the make-up of the bezoar, and combined with other treatments, enhances the dissolution.&lt;ref name="LadasKamberoglou2013"/&gt;

== History ==
A phytobezoar was first  successfully treated with Coca-Cola&amp;nbsp;lavage in 2002.&lt;ref name=Iwamuro2015/&gt;

'''Chancellor''' is an ecclesiastical title used by several quite distinct officials of some [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church body|churches]].
*In some churches, the '''Chancellor''' of a [[diocese]] is a [[lawyer]] who represents the church in legal matters.
*In the [[Church of England]], '''the Chancellor''' is the '''judge''' of the [[consistory court]] of the diocese.  The office of diocesan chancellor technically combines that of Official Principal (who presides over, and represents the bishop in, the [[consistory court]]) with that of [[Vicar General]] (who acts as the bishop’s deputy in non-judicial legal and administrative affairs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin R. |last=Chapman |title=Ecclesiastical Courts, their Officials and their Records |place=Dursley |publisher=Lochin |isbn=187368603X |year=1992 |pages=29–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The office was also known historically in some dioceses as Commissary or Commissary General, and Commissary General remains the usual title in the [[Diocese of Canterbury]].
*In [[Church of England]] [[cathedral]]s, the '''Canon Chancellor''' (more usually known simply as the Chancellor) is one of the [[canon (priest)|canon]]s of the cathedral who has a particular responsibility for matters of education and scholarship, often acting as the cathedral [[librarian]] and [[archivist]]. The Chancellor is generally one of four chief dignitaries in the [[cathedral chapter]], the others being the [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]], the [[Precentor]] and the [[Treasurer]].
*In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] a chancellor is the chief record-keeper of a [[diocese]] or [[eparchy]] or their equivalent. Normally a priest, sometimes a deacon or layperson, the chancellor keeps the official archives of the diocese, as a notary certifies documents, and generally manages the administrative offices (and sometimes finances and personnel) of a diocese. He may be assisted by vice-chancellors. Though he manages the paperwork and office (called the "[[Diocesan chancery|chancery]]"), has no actual jurisdictional authority: the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of the diocese exercises decision-making authority through his [[judicial vicar]], in judicial matters, and the [[vicar general]] for administrative matters.
*In the [[United Methodist Church]], each [[Annual Conference]] has a Conference Chancellor, who is either an active or retired lawyer or judge who serves as the Annual Conference's legal adviser and representative. While the Annual Conference will usually hire outside professional counsel in legal matters requiring legal representation, that hiring and representation is done under the supervision, and with the consent, of the Conference Chancellor.

'''ContactPoint''' was a [[government database]] that held information on all children under 18 in England. It was created in response to the [[child abuse|abuse]] and death of eight-year-old [[murder of Victoria Climbié|Victoria Climbié]] in 2000 in England. Various agencies involved in her care had failed to prevent her death. ContactPoint aimed to improve [[child welfare|child protection]] by improving the way information about children was shared between services. It was designed by [[Capgemini]] and previously had the working titles of '''Information Sharing Index''' (or '''IS Index''' or '''ISI''') and the '''Children's Index'''.

The database, created under the [[Children Act 2004]], cost [[pound sterling|£]]224m to set up and £41m a year to run. It operated in 150 [[local government in England|local authorities]], and was accessible to at least 330,000 users. The database was heavily criticised by a wide range of groups, mainly for [[data privacy|privacy]], [[information security|security]] and child protection reasons. On 12 May 2010 the new UK Coalition Government announced plans to scrap ContactPoint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8677933.stm|title=BBC News - Full Text: Conservative-Lib Dem deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 August 2010 the database was shut down. From that date the ''Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007'', as amended in 2010, no longer applies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.uk/news/news/~/media/Files/lacuna/news/lettertoDCSandCEDecommissioningContactPoint22July2010.ashx Decommissioning ContactPoint], Department for Education, (22 July 2010).

In April 1999, Victoria Climbié (born 2 November 1991 in [[Abobo]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], died 25 February 2000 at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St. Mary's Hospital]], [[London]]) and her great aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao arrived in London, sent by her parents for a chance of an education. A few months later, Kouao met Carl Manning on a bus which he was driving, and she and Victoria moved into his flat. It was here that she was abused, including being beaten with hammers, bike chains, and wires; being forced to sleep in a bin liner in the bath; and being tied up for periods of over 24 hours. In the period leading up to her death, the [[law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police]], the [[social welfare|social services]] of many local authorities, the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]], the [[NSPCC]], and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what the judge in the trial following Victoria's death described as "blinding incompetence",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1113740.stm Inquiry into Climbie officials]", BBC, 12 January 2001. Retrieved 27 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; all failed to properly investigate the abuse and little action was taken. On 24 February 2000, Victoria was admitted into an accident-and-emergency department, semi-unconscious and suffering from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition. She died the next day, aged eight. On 20 November 2000, her guardians, Marie Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning, were charged with child cruelty and [[child murder|murder]]; on 12 January 2001, both were found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2062590.stm Timeline: Victoria Climbie]", BBC, 28 January 2003.

With the publication of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, it became clear that the vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who wanted to see who was working with a particular child or young person.

[[File:The Pirate Bay logo.svg|thumb|Various countries have blocked access to [[The Pirate Bay]] website]]
This is a list of countries where at least one [[Internet service provider|ISP]] formerly or currently censors the popular file sharing website [[The Pirate Bay]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE FOLLOW ALPHABETICAL ORDER. --&gt;

== Argentina ==
On 30 June 2014 the Argentine CNC (National Communications Commission) ordered the blocking of all The Pirate Bay domains. The order originated as a product of a trial between the CAPIF (Argentinian Chamber of Phonograms Productors). With this order the CNC made the ISP block the IP blocks from 194.71.107.0 to 194.71.107.255 [''sic''], in which The Pirate Bay operates, and 12 different The Pirate Bay domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Justicia ordena el bloqueo de The Pirate Bay en la Argentina (Spanish)|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1705910-la-comision-nacional-de-comunicaciones-ordena-el-bloqueo-de-the-pirate-bay-en-la-argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, there is no confirmed blockade of the site in the country. Possibly due to the hack of the government site in protest and a general lack of interest.

In September 2014, the Australian government indicated that it was undergoing discussions regarding whether internet service providers should be forced to block popular torrent sites, including the Pirate Bay.

On 15 December 2016, the [[Federal Court of Australia]] came to the decision to proceed with the block, forcing ISPs to block access to The Pirate Bay, [[isoHunt]], and SolarMovie, as well as the already defunct [[Torrentz]] and TorrentHound, by 5 January. [[John Nicholas (Judge)|Justice Nicholas]] said "I am satisfied that the facilitation of the infringement of copyright is flagrant, and that the operator of the TPB sites has shown a blatant and wilful disregard for the rights of copyright owners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2016/2016fca1503 |title=Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2016&amp;#93; FCA 1503 |publisher=Judgments.fedcourt.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some success with ISPs blocking access, sites such as The Pirate Bay are still easily accessed by VPNs or changing DNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-15/federal-court-orders-pirate-bay-blocked-in-australia/8116912 |title=Internet companies forced to block The Pirate Bay, bittorrent websites in Australia, Federal Court rules - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Whigham |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/piracy/federal-court-expected-to-hand-down-decision-on-blocking-illegal-torrent-and-streaming-sites-today/news-story/c1b0349a2cc6e3fb96007ddf04742efc |title=Siteblocking verdict: court to rule on blocking Pirate Bay, other torrent sites |publisher=News.com.au |date=2016-12-16 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 30 May 2016, Austrian ISPs are now once again free to unblock all previously blocked sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-blockade-lifted-by-austrian-court-160623/|title=Pirate Bay Blockade Lifted In Austria|work=torrentfreak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the Major ISPs have to block the sites again.

After the founders of The Pirate Bay lost their 2009 trial, the Belgian Anti-Piracy Foundation (BAF) began arguing for two [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]{{spaced ndash}}Belgacom and Telenet{{spaced ndash}}to block subscriber access to the site.&lt;ref name="BelgianCourtRuling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nurpa.be/files/20111004_BAF-Belgacom-Telenet-DNS-blocking.pdf|format=PDF|title=Antwerp Appeals Court Ruling: BAF vs Belgacom and Telenet – DNS Blocking (in Dutch, citing the original ruling it overturns)| publisher= nurpa.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; After year-long negotiations broke down, the result was legal action. In July 2010, the Antwerpse Handelsrechtbank (Antwerp Commercial Court) ruled that neither ISP would have to block The Pirate Bay and went on to describe the notion of wholesale site blocking as "disproportionate".

A number of ISPs including the state-owned BSNL, Airtel and Vodafone India continue to block the website though they have ceased to display any custom message when a user heads to the Pirate Bay website. However, the website continues to be accessible on most other ISPs.

The Pirate Bay has been blocked by numerous internet ISPs in [[Indonesia]]. Internet Service Providers blocking it including the semi-private telecommunication Company of Indonesia ([[Telkom Indonesia]]) via its wholly owned ISP ''[[TelkomSpeedy]]'' and possibly some other ISPs.

In June 2011, the [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] ordered the blocking of The Pirate Bay along with several other file-hosting websites via a letter, dated 30 May, to all Malaysian ISPs for violating Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987, which deals with [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|illegally copied content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/11/nation/8879884&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612001810/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F6%2F11%2Fnation%2F8879884&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 June 2011 |title=No more free downloads as MCMC blocks 10 file sharing sites |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was, however, removed in July 2014. Malaysia once again has blocked The Pirate Bay as of 4 June 2015. As of 2018, it doesn't seem to be blocked anymore due to a possible lack of interest and/or the change of government policies.

== Netherlands ==
On 21 July 2005, the Amsterdam district court held a [[preliminary injunction]] hearing against the persons thought responsible for The Pirate Bay. The hearing followed a subpoena from the Dutch record industry trade association [[BREIN]], who had an urgent complaint of intermediary copyright infringement. The defendants did not attend the hearing and hadn't arranged representation, so on 30 July 2009 the court entered an [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] [[default judgment]] against them, accepting the complainants demands. It ruled that Neij, Kolmisoppi and Warg are "to stop and keep stopped the infringements on copyright and related rights of Stichting Brein (foundation Brain) in the Netherlands" within 9 August 2009, or face daily penalties of EUR 30,000, up to a maximum total of EUR 3,000,000.

On 28 January 2014, The Court of Appeal in [[The Hague]] judged that the ongoing blockade was ineffective and, in addition, easy to circumvent, and decided that [[Ziggo]] and [[XS4ALL]] were no longer required to block access to The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://tweakers.net/nieuws/93949/ziggo-en-xs4all-hoeven-the-pirate-bay-niet-langer-te-blokkeren.html Ziggo en Xs4all hoeven The Pirate Bay niet langer te blokkeren]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419011759/http://tweakers.net/nieuws/93949/ziggo-en-xs4all-hoeven-the-pirate-bay-niet-langer-te-blokkeren.html |date=19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]] held that the Court of Appeal's findings on the effectiveness of the blockade were contrary to the case law of the [[European Court of Justice]] and referred preliminary questions to the ECJ, asking whether the activities of The Pirate Bay constitute a "communication to the public" and, if not, whether a blocking injunction can nevertheless be granted against ISPs who facilitate infringing activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Hoge-Raad-der-Nederlanden/Nieuws/Paginas/Vragen-aan-Europees-Hof-over-Pirate-Bay.aspx |title=Vragen aan Europees Hof over Pirate Bay |publisher=Rechtspraak.nl |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kluwercopyrightblog.com/2015/12/20/to-block-or-not-to-block-the-dutch-blocking-injunction-saga-continues/ |title=To block or not to block?

European judges ruled in 2017 that the previous 2012 ruling was not in violation of European law, thus allowing for national courts in the European Union to instigate web-blocks on copyright grounds. The case was then relayed back to the Dutch Supreme Court, which as of January 2018 was still deciding on the matter. However, as the European Court order had now invalidated the 2014 decision, ISPs were yet again forced to block the Pirate Bay pending the Supreme Court decision. On January 12, this block was extended to the ISPs [[KPN]], [[Tele2]], [[T-Mobile]], Zeelandnet and CAIW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/pirate-bay-web-block-extended-to-other-isps-in-netherlands/ Pirate Bay web-block extended to other ISPs in Netherlands], ''Complete Music Update''&lt;/ref&gt; Vodafone was indirectly affected since its merge with Ziggo.

Smaller ISPs weren't charged, and some, such as Lynet, have [http://itavisen.no/2015/09/08/norske-nettleverandorer-vil-ikke-blokkere-pirate-bay/ rejected blocking access to their customers] since they approve of a free internet and were not involved in the case. The blocking is done using [[DNS blocking]].

On 11 September 2015, Norway's two biggest internet providers [[Telenor]] and [[Altibox]] blocked their users access to The Pirate Bay. Film producers like Warner Bros., SF Norway and Disney, got favor in court on all counts in a lawsuit against several of the largest Internet providers in Norway.

[[Asker and Bærum District Court]] rejected demands from the recording artists' copyright organisation [[TONO]] against Norway's largest internet provider, [[Telenor]], to have The Pirate Bay blocked. In a court ruling on 6 November 2009 the court stated that in today's society it would be unnatural to demand of a private company that it should make judgments on whether a website complied with the law, since making such judgments is considered the responsibility of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Holwerda, Thom |title= Judge: Norwegian ISP Does Not Have to Block The Pirate Bay |url= http://www.osnews.com/story/22456/Judge_Norwegian_ISP_Does_Not_Have_to_Block_The_Pirate_Bay |work= [[OSNews]] |date= 7 November 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130522144255/http://www.osnews.com/story/22456/Judge_Norwegian_ISP_Does_Not_Have_to_Block_The_Pirate_Bay/ | archivedate = 2013-05-22| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Jørgenrud, Marius |title= Telenor slipper å sperre Pirate Bay |url= http://www.digi.no/827920/telenor-slipper-aa-sperre-pirate-bay |work= [[Digi.no]] |location= Oslo, Norway |date= 6 November 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 November 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003550/http://www.digi.no/827920/telenor-slipper-aa-sperre-pirate-bay | archivedate = 2013-06-19| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

File sharing and video streaming sites like The Pirate Bay, have been blocked in [[Qatar]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Romania ==
RCS &amp; RDS, UPC Romania, Telekom Romania, Nextgen Communication, Digital Cable Systems and AKTA Telekom will block customers access to three piracy sites for movies and serials (''www.filmehd.net'', ''www.filmeonline2013.biz'' and the torrents ''www.thepiratebay.org'') being no longer allowed for Internet users in Romania, and operators must prohibit access to the related web addresses from the system. The decision was made in court by several film production companies (Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions LLP, Universal Cable Productions LLC, Warner Bros Entertainment INC, Paramount Pictures Corporation, Disney Enterprises, Columbia Pictures Industries and Sony Pictures Television). According to the court's decision, "It is being permanently blocked by the method of DNS blocking access of the clients for the fixed access internet services to the websites currently accessible at the online locations indicated above. The decision is made by putting the solution at the disposal of the parties through the court registry, 05.11.2018 ". The decision is not final and may be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://adevarul.ro/tech/internet/accesul-cele-mai-importante-site-uri-piraterie-filme-seriale-fost-interzis-utilizatorii-internet-romania-1_5be1a7d9df52022f75383d3e/index.html|title=Accesul la cele mai importante site-uri de piraterie de filme şi seriale a fost interzis pentru utilizatorii de internet din România|date=1541515582|work=adevarul.ro|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current status of TPB in Romania ===
Even if site access is illegal, the TPB proxy addresses are still '''&lt;big&gt;valid&lt;/big&gt;''' at the current date. The main ''www.thepiratebay.org site'' is currently '''&lt;big&gt;down&lt;/big&gt;''' in Romania, users experiencing a prolonged page load time and error code 522, unrelated to the official ban.

== Russia ==
The Pirate Bay was blocked in June 2015 by several big ISPs throughout the country as the state blocks sites that contain files or references to files that infringe copyright laws.

== Saudi Arabia ==
The [[Ministry of Culture and Information (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi Arabian Ministry of Culture and Information]] blocked The Pirate Bay, along with multiple other torrenting sites, in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Sar, Ernesto  (2 April 2014) [http://torrentfreak.com/saudi-arabia-government-blocks-pirate-bay-140402 Saudi Arabia Government blocks The Pirate Bay (and more)].

== Singapore ==
The Singapore government had planned to block websites, including TPB, facilitating copyright infringement, so the Copyright Act 2014 was proposed to be amended in August 2014. However, on 29 November 2014, the Copyright Act amendment was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/singapore-passes-pirate-bay-blocking-anti-piracy-law-140708/|title=Singapore Passes Pirate Bay-Blocking Anti-Piracy Law|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, a Singapore court ruled that copyright infringing websites must be blocked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://torrentfreak.com/singapore-court-orders-countrys-first-pirate-site-blockade-160216/ Singapore Court Orders Country’s First Pirate Site Blockade] TorrentFreak Retrieved on February 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sweeping move, the Singapore Government ordered all Singapore ISPs to block 53 sites including TPB following an application by the MPAA. The ISPs are Singtel, M1, Starhub, MyRepublic and Viewqwest &lt;ref&gt;https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/53-piracy-websites-blocked-in-battle-to-curb-copyright-breach&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2015, Vodafone Spain blocks thepiratebay.org as requested by the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of Interior]]. Since 29 March 2015 thepiratebay has been blocked on multiple URLs from all ISPs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vodafone bloquea a The Pirate Bay en España por orden de Mº de Cultura |date=27 January 2015 |url=http://es.gizmodo.com/vodafone-confirma-el-bloqueo-a-the-pirate-bay-por-orden-1681982564 |publisher=[[Gizmodo]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden ==
In May 2010, The Pirate Bay's Swedish Internet service provider [[#Black Internet|lost an appeal]] against an order to stop providing service to the site. Although the service provider had already complied with an earlier order in August 2009 and The Pirate Bay was thereafter hosted elsewhere, in June 2010 the ISP chose also to block their customers from accessing The Pirate Bay in its new location. One of the judges in the case later commented that the court's order didn't require the ISP to control their customers' access to the site, but the ISP wanted to avoid any risk.&lt;ref name="localban"&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish ISP bars users from The Pirate Bay |date=10 June 2010 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/27488/20100628/ |publisher=[[The Local]]  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121008070121/http://www.thelocal.se/27488/20100628/ | archivedate = 2012-10-08| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On February 13, 2017 Sweden's Patent and Market Court of Appeal decided that a broadband provider must block its customers from accessing file sharing site The Pirate Bay, overruling a district court ruling to the contrary from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/zBReO/unik-dom-bredbandsbolaget-maste-blockera-piratsajter Unik dom: Bredbandsbolaget måste blockera piratsajter {{sv icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">The '''Courtyard Crisis''' ({{Lang-sv|Borggårdskrisen}}) was a constitutional conflict between the Swedish king and prime minister&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/borgg%C3%A5rdskrisen|title=Borggårdskrisen|publisher=Nationalencycklopedin|language=Swedish|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significant event in [[Sweden|Swedish]] 20th-century history, marking the last time the [[Monarch of Sweden]] directly intervened in a controversial partisan political issue, as was done by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King]] [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf V]] through the [[Courtyard Speech]] at the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace]] in [[Stockholm]] ({{Lang-sv|Borggårdstalet}}) on 6 February 1914, in front of 32 000 assembled farmers from all over the country, in which he argued for higher military spending.

==Background and aftermath==
In early 1914, tensions ran high in Sweden over the issue of defence spending, with [[World War I]] looming over [[Europe]]. On 6 February 1914, [[Conservatism|Conservative]] opponents of the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] government of [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Karl Staaff]] summoned a 32 000-person demonstration of farmers demanding higher defence spending. [[Gustaf V]], who was in continual conflict with his government, declared to the crowd gathered in the courtyard of [[Stockholm Palace]] that he shared their concerns.

When Prime Minister Staaff reminded the King that [[Constitutional monarchy|a parliamentary system meant the latter's exclusion from partisan politics]], the King refused and said he would "''not give up the right to communicate freely with the [[Swedish people]]''". The government promptly resigned, and 136 Liberal members from both chambers of the [[Riksdag]] issued a statement saying the form of government was in jeopardy, and urging the Swedish people to defend its right to rule itself. Their opponents, [[Allmänna valmansförbundet|the Conservatives]] and the [[Bondeförbundet|Farmers' League]], in turn accused them of putting [[parliamentarism]] over national security, and called on the people to put every effort into solving the defence issue.

The King appointed a conservative government of high-ranking civil servants and businessmen led by [[Hjalmar Hammarskjöld]], but tensions continued in the debate on spending. The second chamber of the Riksdag was dissolved and new elections called for.

The conflict abruptly ended that June with the imminent [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|breakout of war in Europe]], which in effect decided the argument in favour of the Conservatives; however, some reforms and budget amendments were implemented to appease the Liberals. In the end, only the [[Social Democratic Party of Sweden|Social Democrats]] voted against the defence programme, although 24 Liberal parliamentarians discarded their votes in protest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4068">During [[World War II |the Second World War]] '''Defence Regulations''' were a fundamental aspect of everyday life in the [[United Kingdom]].

They were emergency regulations passed on the outbreak of war and during it to give the government emergency powers to prosecute the war. Two [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] were passed as [[enabling legislation]] to allow the Defence Regulations to be promulgated. The first was the [[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939]], which was passed immediately before war was declared, and the second was the [[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1940]], which was passed in the aftermath of the German attack on [[France]] in 1940. The 1940 Act allowed Defence Regulations to be made on matters such as [[industrial conscription]].

The main Defence Regulations were the [[Defence (General) Regulations 1939]], which were amended at various points throughout the war. Other Defence Regulations covered narrower fields of life. These included [[Defence Regulation 18B]], which provided a framework for [[internment]].

The Defence Regulations were [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] and could amend any primary or secondary legislation within the limits of the enabling Acts to allow the effective prosecution of the war. Since the emergency conditions created by the war persisted after the conflict was over, the last of the Defence Regulations, mainly those on food rationing, were not abolished until the early 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Death penalty==

Originally the regulations did not create any capital offences, since the law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] was thought to be sufficient. Defence Regulation 2A provided that "If, with intent to assist the enemy, any person does any act which is likely to assist the enemy or to prejudice the public safety, the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war, he shall be liable to penal servitude for life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1940/nov/20/offences-penalties#S5CV0365P0-08238 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1940 amendments to the regulations created two capital offences: "forcing safeguards" (breaking through roadblocks etc.) under regulation 1B, and looting under regulation 38A.&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold,'' 31st ed. (1943) pp. 1524-1525&lt;/ref&gt; A third new capital offence, called treachery, was created soon afterwards by the [[Treachery Act 1940]].

==Continuance and repeal==
After the end of the war, the Defence Regulations were continued in force by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;9&amp;10 Geo. 6, c. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;9&amp;10 Geo. 6, c. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The last significant Regulations to be in force before the passage of the Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act, 1959,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1959/19%20/pdfs/ukpga_19590019_en.pdf Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act, 1959], 7&amp;8 Eliz. 2, c. 19, coming into force upon [[royal assent]] on 25 March 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= United Kingdom|title= Emergency Laws (Repeal) Bill|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1958/nov/12/emergency-laws-repeal-bill#column_413|house= House of Commons|date= 12 November 1958|column_start= 413|column_end= 414|speaker= [[Frederick Erroll, 1st Baron Erroll of Hale|F.J.

:* No. 55 (giving general power to control industry for wide purposes);
:* No. 55AA, (empowering the Government to secure the necessary information for these purposes); and
:* No. 55AB (giving power to impose price control of goods and services).

Under the terms of the 1959 Act, the last of the Defence Regulations expired on 31 December 1964.&lt;ref&gt;1959 Act, s. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|article|date=February 2012}}
[[File:En el ejido Cuauhtémoc (28) (5618095756).jpg|300px|thumbnail|Ejido in Cuauhtémoc]]
In the [[politics of mexico|Mexican system of government]], an '''''ejido''''' ({{IPA-es|eˈxiðo}}, from [[Latin]] ''exitum'') is an area of [[communal land]] used for [[agriculture]], on which community members individually farm designated [[land lot|parcels]] and collectively maintain communal holdings. ''Ejidos'' are registered with Mexico's National Agrarian Registry (''Registro Agrario Nacional''). The system of ''ejidos'' was based on an understanding of the [[Aztec]] [[calpulli]] and the medieval Spanish ejido.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Appendini, “Ejido” in ‘’The Encyclopedia of Mexico’’. Vol. 1, p. 450. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallup et al. (2003) ''Is Geography Destiny? Lessons from Latin America'', Stanford University Press {{ISBN|978-0821354513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
During the colonial era and the 19th Century Liberal [[La Reforma]] and expansion of haciendas in the late 19th Century under [[Porfirio Díaz]], landlessness was a serious issue in Mexico. It was one of the core problems that contributed to the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]], notably [[Morelos]] where [[Emiliano Zapata]] led revolutionary peasants seeking return of their lands. ''Tierra y libertad'' (land and liberty) was one of the slogans of the Revolution. Distribution of large amounts of land did not begin until [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] became president in 1934. The ''ejido'' system was introduced as an important component of the [[agrarian land reform in Mexico]].

The typical procedure for the establishment of an ejido involved the following steps: 
# landless farmers who leased lands from wealthy landlords would petition the federal government for the creation of an ejido in their general area;
#the federal government would consult with the landlord;
#the land would be expropriated from the landlords if the government approved the ejido; and
#an ejido would be established and the original petitioners would be designated as ''ejidatarios'' with certain cultivation/use rights.   
Ejidatarios do not actually own the land, but are allowed to use their allotted parcels indefinitely as long as they do not fail to use the land for more than two years.  They can pass their rights on to their children.

==Criticism==
Opponents of the ejido system pointed to widespread corruption within the ''Banco Nacional de Crédito Rural'' (Banrural), the primary institution responsible for providing loans to ejiditarios, illegal sales and transfers of ejido lands, ecological degradation, and low productivity as evidence of the system's failure, but defendants countered these arguments by pointing out that every administration since that of Cárdenas had been either indifferent or openly hostile to ejidos, that the land assigned to ejidos was often of lower quality and therefore inherently less productive than privately held land, that the majority of agricultural research and support was biased towards large-scale commercial enterprises, that the politicians complaining about Banrural were the people responsible for the corruption, and that, regardless of its productivity, subsistence production is an important survival strategy for many peasants.

==Change==
As part of a larger program of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic restructuring that had already been weakening support for ejidal and other forms of [[small-scale agriculture]] and negotiation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), Harvard-educated President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in 1992 pushed legislation through congress that modified article 27 of the national constitution to permit the privatization and the sale of ejidal land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yetman|first=David |date=2000 |title=Ejidos, Land Sales, and Free Trade in Northwest Mexico: Will Globalization Affect the Commons? |url=https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/view/3109 |journal=American Studies |publisher=University of Kansas Libraries |volume=41 |issue=2/3 |pages=211–234 |access-date=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a direct cause of the [[Chiapas conflict]].

The changes to the ejidal system have largely failed to improve ejidal productivity, and have been implicated as significant contributing factors to worsening rural poverty, forced migration, and the conversion of Mexico, where the cultivation of maize originated, into a net-importer of maize and food in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bello |first=Walden |date=2009 |title=The Food Wars |url= |location=New York, USA |publisher=Verso |pages=39–53 |isbn=978-1844673315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''ferme générale''''' ({{IPA-fr|fɛʁm ʒeneʁal}}, "general farm") was, in ''[[Ancien Régime in France|ancien régime]]'' [[Kingdom of France|France]], essentially an [[outsource]]d customs, excise and indirect tax operation. It collected duties on behalf of the [[King of France|King]] (plus hefty bonus fees for themselves), under renewable six-year contracts. The major tax collectors in that highly unpopular [[tax farming]] system were known as the '''''fermiers généraux''''' (singular '''''fermier général'''''), which would be ''tax farmers-general''{{efn|The English word "farmer" in the sense of "agricultural producer" is derived from the French word ''fermier'' which means "leaseholder" (of an agricultural business or any other thing). Initially the word "farmer" designated in England only those agricultural producers who were not the owners of the land they were cultivating. Subsequently "farmer" became the generic term of all agricultural entrepreneurs, whether they owned the cultivated soil or not.}} in English.&lt;ref&gt;This article is largely from [[:fr:Ferme générale]], which cites: Marie-Nicolas Bouillet and Alexis Chassang (eds), ''Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de géographie'', 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries the  ''fermiers généraux'' became immensely rich and figure prominently in the history of cultural patronage, as supporters of French music, major collectors of paintings and sculpture, patrons of the ''[[Marchand-mercier|marchands-merciers]]'' and consumers of the luxury arts in the vanguard of Parisian fashions. In his 1833 novel ''[[Ferragus (novel)|Ferragus]]'', writer [[Honoré de Balzac]] attributes the sad air that hangs about the [[Île Saint-Louis]] in central Paris to the many houses there owned by fermiers généraux. Their sons or grandsons purchased patents of nobility and their daughters often married into the aristocracy. Especially members of impoverished aristocratic families were eager to marry daughters of the ''fermiers généraux'' in order to restore the wealth they had prior to their ruin. This was called in popular French ''redorer son blason'' (literally "to re-gild one's coat of arms").&lt;ref&gt;Le petit Larousse 2013, p932&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, the public revenue was based largely on the following taxes:
*The '''''[[Taille]]'' – Direct land tax''' imposed on French [[peasant]] and non-noble households, based on how much land they held. In some provinces, the principle of ''taille réelle'' was used, which meant that the tax was based on the actual market value of the real estate. In a majority of provinces the ''taille personnelle'' was applied: the tax level was the result of an arbitrary and gross estimation of the real estate value. Noblemen, public office holders and the inhabitants of the large cities were exempt from the ''taille''.
*The '''''Taillon''''' – Tax for military expenditure.
*The '''''Vingtième''''' (''one-twentieth'') – Based solely on revenue (5 percent of net earnings from land, property, commerce, industry and from official offices).
*The '''''[[Gabelle]]''''' – A very complicated system of taxes and outsourced regional monopolies on salt, with enormous price disparities between the different provinces (e.g. the salt price in Paris was thirty times higher than in Brittany) that were a strong enticement to smuggling.
*The '''''Aides''''' – National tariffs on various products, including wine and tobacco.
*The '''''Traites''''' – Custom duties for either the import or export of goods to and from France, or for the transport of goods from one French province to the neighbouring one (internal customs).
*The '''''Octroi''''' – A local tariff levied on products entering the cities, especially Paris.
*The '''''Droits féodaux''''' (feudal rights), a long list of petty duties for every possible event or activity in a peasant's life (the right to marry, to inherit, to use the mill, to use the roads of the local aristocrat, to be exempt from doing mandatory chores for the local lord, etc.), to be paid to the local lord, the King or both and generally considered by the peasant to be arbitrary and humiliating.
*The '''''Dîme''''' ("the tenth [part]) – A mandatory [[tithe]] to support the state church and its clergy, collected by the local vicars, monks or bishops (and so, not a tax in the legal sense). The ''Dîme'' had to be paid either in legal tender (money) or in material assets by all residents regardless of their religion.

===Tax farming before Colbert===

The ''Ferme générale'' developed at a time when the monarchy suffered from chronic financial difficulties. The ''Affermage'' (leasing, [[outsourcing]]) of the collection of the ''traite'' (customs duties and taxes) had the advantage of guaranteeing the Treasury foreseeable and regular receipts, while reducing the perception of its role in tax-collection. The rights were initially contracted separately to various tax farmers, who were named ''traitants'' (who had the right to collect the ''traite'') or ''partisans'' (who had a share (''partie'') in the collection of the ''traite''). They were obliged to pay to the Royal Treasury the sum stipulated in their lease, and they received a share of the income and a share of any "unexpected" surplus. Each right was leased separately, which caused great administrative complexity: the taking of goods out of bond could involve several tax farms. Prior to 1598, this system had developed so that the tax farms were allocated among five ''pays'' (parts of France).

In 1598 the [[Superintendent of Finances]], the [[Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully|Duke of Sully]], entrusted tax collection to one farm instead of five separate ones, and subjected the collection of duties raised in the provinces to the rights of the King. The single tax farm was called the ''Cinq Grosses Fermes'' (five large farms). In 1607, he issued new rules (''Règlement Général sur les Traites'') on the collection of duties in an attempt to harmonize procedures. He also attempted to constitute the whole of France into a single customs area, but was without success, as the provinces "considered foreign" (i.e. which became  part of France after the foundation of the Kingdom; especially the south and Brittany) refused to merge with the zone covered by the ''Cinq Grosses Fermes''. By the middle of the 17th century, France was divided for tax purposes into three principal zones: 
*Provinces of the ''Cinq Grosses Fermes'' without any internal customs duties (since 1664 by decision of Colbert)
*Provinces "considered foreign" and therefore had negotiated lower rates on some taxes
*Provinces "effectively following the example of the provinces considered foreign" (i.e. the last to become part of France; especially Lorraine and Alsatia) which formed tax-free zones when doing trade with the neighbouring foreign countries.

Not all ''fermiers-généraux'' constrained their viewpoint to their own enrichment: [[Pierre-Paul Riquet]], appointed collector in [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] in 1630,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McKnight | first = Hugh | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cruising French Waterways, 4th Edition | publisher = Sheridan House| year = 2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =  9781574092103}}&lt;/ref&gt; used his fortune to build the [[Canal du Midi]] that links the Mediterranean coast of France to [[Toulouse]] and then on to the system of canals and rivers that ran across to the [[Bay of Biscay]] on the Atlantic coast, considered to be one of the great engineering feats of the 17th century.

===The farm under Colbert:  ''traitants'' and ''partisans''===
The process was further developed under the aegis of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], Minister of Finance to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. 
To reduce the number of these farmers and to increase the share of the collection transferred to the Royal Treasury, Colbert sought to gather a great number of rights together in ''fermes générales'' (general farms). The first ''fermes générales'' was instituted in 1680 to collect ''gabelles'', ''aides'', ''taille'' and ''douane'' .

Although sometimes of obscure origin, the financiers which took these rights often quickly accumulated immense fortunes which enabled them to play a significant political and social role. Their greed and excesses shocked the public and were often turned into objects of ridicule in literature, for example by playwright [[Alain-René Lesage]] in his 1709 comedy ''[[Turcaret]]'', which was inspired by financier [[Paul Poisson de Bourvallais]].

===The ''Ferme générale'' (1726–90)===

In 1726, all the existing farms were gathered in a single lease. The forty farmers-general, who held guarantees as contractors of the lease, became powerful and fabulously rich. Examples of the first generation of these tax farmers include [[Antoine Crozat]], the first private owner of [[French Louisiana]], the four Pâris brothers, and [[Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière]].

Increased criticism of the ''Ferme générale'' system led the government to introduce new regulations in 1769, which turned the collection of taxes and the administration of the service to which taxation was entrusted to public organisations, with their managers receiving a fixed remuneration. The public career of the reforming economist [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]] began with his appointment in 1761 as ''intendant'' of the ''généralité'' of [[Limoges]].

In 1780, at the initiative of [[Jacques Necker]], finance minister to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], indirect taxes were distributed between three tax farm companies: the ''Ferme générale'' (for customs duties), the ''Ligue générale'' (for taxes on alcohol) and the ''Administration générale des domaines et des droits domaniaux'' (for land taxes and fees for land registration).

By the end of the 18th century, the ''Ferme générale'' system became a symbol of an unequal society. The ''Ferme générale'', and the great wealth of its proprietors, was seen as encapsulating all the perversions of the political and social system. People blamed the injustices and annoyances - which actually arose from the complexity of the tax system - on the company itself, including the brutality of tax collecting troops and the brutal repression of smuggling. The ''[[gabelle]]'' (tax on salt) was the most unpopular of all the taxes.

The ''Ferme générale'' was thus one of the institutions of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' which was most criticised during the 1789 [[French Revolution]]. It was depicted as a group of predatory tyrants; the [[Girondin|Girondist]] politician [[Antoine Français de Nantes]], made an early reputation for himself attacking this prominent target. The ''Ferme générale'' was then suppressed in 1790, with farmers-general paying the price at the scaffold: 28 former members of the consortium were [[guillotine]]d on 8 May 1794. Among them was [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the father of modern [[chemistry]], whose laboratory had been supported by income from his administration of the ''Ferme générale''. His wife, the chemist [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]], who escaped the guillotine, was herself the daughter of another farmer-general, Jacques Paulze.

===Organisation===

The lease of the ''Ferme générale'' was regulated by six-year contracts between the King and an individual who acted as a figurehead for the company. The ''Ferme générale'' held guarantee for the contractor. The number of partners was fixed at 40, after having reached nearly 90 earlier. The contractor committed himself to paying the Royal Treasury the amount of the lease and received in return any surplus. In 1780 an upper limit was set for this remuneration.

The ''Ferme générale'' had its headquarters in Paris. In its central offices it employed nearly 700 people, including two [[chaplain]]s. Its local operations included up to 42 provincial offices and nearly 25,000 agents distributed in two branches of activity; that of the offices which checked, liquidated and charged the fees and that of the guards' brigades which sought and suppressed smuggling with very severe punishments (such as hard labour or hanging).

The employees of the ''Ferme générale'' were not royal civil servants but they acted in the name of the king, and therefore benefited from particular privileges and the protection of the law. In addition, members of the guards' brigades had the right to bear weapons. The managing of the company was handled collectively by the ''Ferme générale''. They met as committees of experts and had control of the company's external services.

The day before the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, almost all the rights of indirect drafts and rights (like the ''gabelle'', the tax on tobacco, and a number of local taxes) were awarded. On the other hand, the Royal Treasury's income from the ''Ferme générale'' represented more than half of the total public revenue. The company had also built the 24-kilometre [[Wall of the Farmers-General]] between 1784 and 1791 in Paris to ensure the payment of taxes on goods entering the city.

==Criticism of tax collection methods==

The ''Ferme générale'' was one of the most hated components of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schama | first = Simon | authorlink = Simon Schama | coauthors = | title = [[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]] | publisher = Alfred A Knopf| year = 1989 | location = | pages =  73| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the ''Ferme générale'' also include:
*Public bodies were deprived of a resource
*Service rendered was not always better in the long term
*The cost could be higher for the taxpayer, who paid his taxes plus the margin taken by the ''Ferme générale''
*The recovery of debts (of tax arrears) by the ''Ferme générale'' could be brutal
*Depriving itself of a resource, the community became involved in debt, and had to find new taxes to obtain additional money

Therefore, at the end of the 18th century, the French state had become involved in considerable debt, which factored among the [[causes of the French Revolution]].

==Cultural role of farmers-general==
The farmers-general of the ''Ancien Régime'' figure prominently in the history of cultural patronage in France. The enlightened farmer-general [[Charles François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem|Le Normant de Tournehem]] was the legal guardian of [[Madame de Pompadour]], responsible for her education - in turn, thanks to her influence, he was made director-general of the ''[[Bâtiments du Roi]]'' in December 1745, and held the post, overseeing royal building works at the King's residences in and around Paris, until his death in 1751. As American architect [[Fiske Kimball]] observed, “Without artistic prejudices, he was a man of ability, honesty and simplicity, who devoted himself to efficient administration".&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, ''Creation of the Rococo'' 1943, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers-general also figured among prominent supporters of French music and collectors of paintings and sculpture, such as [[Pierre Grimod du Fort]], and as patrons of the ''[[marchand-mercier|marchands-mercier]]'', a type of merchants who dealt with decorative art objects.

As consumers of luxurious art the farmers-general were at the vanguard of Parisian fashion, like [[Ange Laurent Lalive de Jully]], a patron of arts who embraced the early form of [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassicist]] style in decorative arts called the ''[[goût grec]]'' (lit. "Greek taste"). Others merely made themselves notorious for their squander, like Ange Laurent's brother Denis Joseph de La Live d'Épinay, the estranged husband of the writer and ''[[Salon (gathering)|saloniste]]'' [[Louise d'Épinay]]. The [[gourmand]] [[Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière]] was the son of the farmer-general [[Laurent Grimod de La Reynière]].  
 
Sons or grandsons of farmer-generals often purchased patents of nobility, with their daughters marrying into aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Joseph de Laborde]] was one who purchased a marquisate for himself.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voltaire and the ''fermiers''==
In his ''Voltaire, A Life''&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ian, 2010, Voltaire, A Life, London: Profile Books&lt;/ref&gt; (pp.&amp;nbsp;427–31), Ian Davidson describes events on [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] estate at [[Ferney-Voltaire|Ferney]], north of Geneva, in the 1770s.

In 1770, hundreds of watchmakers fled the political ructions in Geneva and went to make a new life at Ferney. Voltaire helped them to set up a new watchmaking business. He negotiated a tax exemption for the watchmakers with the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|duc de Choiseul]], Prime Minister of France. But by 1774, the business was prospering and the tax farmers started to take an interest. Three-way negotiations between the tax farmers, Voltaire and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] ensued. In December 1775, Turgot confirmed the watchmakers' exemption from the salt tax (''gabelle'') and from road maintenance duties (''corvée'') and a figure was agreed to compensate the tax farmers for loss of revenue. Voltaire addressed a public meeting on 12 December and the watchmakers accepted the settlement.

Two days later, Voltaire wrote to his friend Mme de Saint-Julien:

''... while we were gently passing our time in thanking M. Turgot, and while the whole province was busy drinking, the gendarmes of the tax farmers, whose time runs out on 1 January, had orders to sabotage us. They marched about in groups of fifty, stopped all the vehicles, searched all the pockets, forced their way into all the houses and made every kind of damage there in the name of the king, and made the peasants buy them off with money. I cannot conceive why the people did not ring the tocsin against them in all the villages, and why they were not exterminated. It is very strange that the ''ferme générale'', with only another fortnight left for them to keep their troops here in winter quarters, should have permitted or even encouraged them in such criminal excesses. The decent people were very wise and held back the ordinary folk, who wanted to throw themselves on these brigands, as if on mad wolves.''

According to Davidson, good sense prevailed despite this violence, Voltaire was appointed a tax commissioner, profits peaked in 1776 and the watchmaking business survived the revolution and continued "well into the nineteenth century".

{{Tort law}}

In law, '''frivolous litigation''' is the practice of starting or carrying on lawsuits that, due to their lack of [[legal merit]], have little to no chance of being won. The term does not include cases that may be lost due to other matters not related to legal merit. While colloquially, a person may term a lawsuit to be frivolous if he or she personally finds a claim to be absurd, in legal usage "frivolous litigation" consists of a claim or defense that is presented where the party (or the party's legal counsel) had reason to know that the claim or defense was manifestly insufficient or futile.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The fact that a claim is lost does not imply that it was frivolous.

Frivolous litigation may be based on absurd legal theories, may involve a superabundance or repetition of [[Motion (legal)|motion]]s or additional suits, may be uncivil or harassing to the court, or may claim extreme [[Legal remedy|remedies]]. A claim or defense may be frivolous because it had no underlying justification in fact, or because it was not presented with an [[argument]] for a reasonable extension or reinterpretation of the [[law]].  A claim may be deemed frivolous because existing laws unequivocally prohibit such a claim, such as a so-called [[Good Samaritan law]].

In the [[United States]], Rule 11 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and similar state rules require that an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] perform a [[due diligence]] investigation concerning the factual basis for any claim or defense. Jurisdictions differ on whether a claim or defense can be frivolous if the attorney acted in [[good faith]]. Because such a defense or claim wastes the court's and the other parties' time, resources and legal fees, [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] may be imposed by a court upon the party or the lawyer who presents the frivolous defense or claim. The law firm may also be sanctioned, or even [[contempt of court|held in contempt]].

==Federal statutes and rules of court penalizing frivolous litigation==
In the [[United States Tax Court]], frivolous arguments may result in a penalty of up to $25,000 under {{uscsub|26|6673|a|1}}. Similarly, section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and the [[U.S. Courts of Appeals]] may impose penalties in which the taxpayer's appeal of a U.S. Tax Court decision was "maintained primarily for delay" or where "the taxpayer's position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless."&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph (4) of subsection (c) of {{usc|26|7482}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A common example, as shown below, is an argument based on [[tax protestor]] claims.

In a noncriminal case in a [[U.S. District Court]], a litigant (or a litigant's attorney) who presents any pleading, written motion or other paper to the court is required, under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to certify that, to the best of the presenter's knowledge and belief, the legal contentions "are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law".&lt;ref&gt;Rule 11(b)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt; Monetary civil penalties for violation of this rule may in some cases be imposed on the litigant or the attorney under Rule 11.&lt;ref&gt;Rule 11(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, the Seventh Circuit Court issued an order giving such an attorney "14 days to show cause why he should not be fined $10,000 for his frivolous arguments".&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Patridge'', 507 F.3d 1092, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,806 (7th Cir. 2007), ''cert. denied'', 552 U.S. 1280, 128 S.Ct. 1721 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A similar rule penalizing frivolous litigation applies in U.S. Bankruptcy Court under Rule 9011.&lt;ref&gt;Rule 9011(b)(2) and Rule 9011(c), Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Congress]] has enacted section 1912 of Title 28 of the U.S.C. providing that in the U.S. Supreme Court and in the U.S. Courts of Appeals where litigation by the losing party has caused damage to the prevailing party, the court may impose a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party for those damages.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|28|1912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Litigants who represent themselves (''[[in forma pauperis]]'' and ''[[pro se]]'') sometimes make frivolous arguments due to their limited knowledge of the law and procedure. The particular tendency of [[prison]]ers to bring baseless lawsuits led to passage of the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] of 1995, which limits the ability of prisoners to bring actions without payment. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Court treatment of frivolous arguments==
An example of a Court's treatment of frivolous arguments is found in the case of ''Crain v. Commissioner'', [http://www.openjurist.org/737/f2d/1417 737 F.2d 1417] (1984), from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]:

{{quote|Glenn Crain appeals from the dismissal of his [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]] petition challenging the constitutional authority of that body and defying the jurisdiction of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to levy taxes on his income. Crain asserts that he "is not subject to the [[jurisdiction]], taxation, nor regulation of the state," that the "Internal Revenue Service, Incorporated" lacks authority to exercise the judicial power of the United States, that the Tax Court is unconstitutionally attempting to exercise [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] powers, and that jurisdiction over his person has never been affirmatively proven.

We perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some [[Color (law)|colorable]] merit. The constitutionality of our income tax system&amp;mdash;including the role played within that system by the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court&amp;mdash;has long been established. We affirm the dismissal of Crain's spurious "petition" and the assessment of a penalty imposed by the Tax Court for instituting a frivolous proceeding. {{UnitedStatesCode|26|6673}}.

The government asks us to assess penalties against Crain for bringing this frivolous appeal, as is authorized by Fed. R. App. P. 38. In Parker v. C. I. R., [http://www.openjurist.org/724/f2d/469/parker-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue 724 F. 2d 469], 472 (5th Cir. 1984), we sounded "a cautionary note to those who would persistently raise arguments against the income tax which have been put to rest for years. The full range of sanctions in Rule 38 hereafter shall be summoned in response to a totally frivolous appeal."

We are sensitive to the need for the courts to remain open to all who seek in good faith to invoke the protection of law. An appeal that lacks merit is not always&amp;mdash;or often&amp;mdash;frivolous. However, we are not obliged to suffer in silence the filing of baseless, insupportable appeals presenting no colorable claims of error and designed only to delay, obstruct, or incapacitate the operations of the courts or any other governmental authority. Crain's present appeal is of this sort. It is a hodgepodge of unsupported assertions, irrelevant platitudes, and legalistic gibberish. The government should not have been put to the trouble of responding to such spurious arguments, nor this court to the trouble of "adjudicating" this meritless appeal.

Accordingly, we grant the government's request. The United States shall recover from appellant Crain twice its cost of this appeal. Additionally, we assess against Crain a damage award of $2000 in favor of the appellee United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Crain v. Commissioner'', 737 F.2d 1417, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9721 (5th Cir. 1984) (''per curiam'').&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Impact upon filing attorney==
Filing a claim that is ultimately deemed frivolous can be highly damaging to the attorney so filing. Attorney Daniel Evans writes:

{{quote|[W]hen a judge calls an argument "ridiculous" or "frivolous," it is absolutely the worst thing the judge could say. It means that the person arguing the position has absolutely no idea of what he is doing, and has completely wasted everyone's time. It doesn't mean that the case wasn't well argued, or that judge simply decided for the other side, it means that there ''was no other side''. The argument was '''''absolutely, positively, incompetent'''''. The judge is not telling you that you were "wrong." The judge is telling you that you are out of your mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#purpose Daniel B. Evans, The Tax Protester FAQ, at]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
===''Washington v. Alaimo''===
In ''Washington v. Alaimo''&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=1617214866373867821&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nrNMUOe4NqaL0QH98oHoBg&amp;ved=0CB4QgAMoADAA 934 F. Supp. 1395 (S.D. Ga. 1996)].&lt;/ref&gt; the court listed more than seventy-five frivolous "motions" (a request for a court to issue an order), all of which required the attention of the Court, including the following:
* "Motion to Behoove an Inquisition"
* "Motion for [[Judex Delegatus]]"
* "Motion for Restoration of Sanity"
* "Motion for [[Deinstitutionalization]]"
* "Motion for [[Publicity]]"
* "Motion to Vacate Jurisdiction"
* "Motion for Cesset processus"
* "Motion for [[Nunc pro tunc]]"
* "Motion for [[Psychoanalysis]]"
* "Motion to Impeach [[Anthony A. Alaimo|Judge Alaimo]]"
* "Motion to Renounce [[Citizenship]]"
* "Motion to [[Exhume]] Body of Alex Hodgson"
* "Motion to Invoke and Execute Rule 15&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_15 Rule 15], Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;/ref&gt;—Retroactive Note: The Court's School Days are Over"
* "Motion for [[Sex reassignment surgery|Skin Change Operation]]"
* "Motion for Catered Food Services"
* "Motion to Kiss My Ass"

Washington, an inmate from Georgia, was eventually prohibited from filing any future lawsuits or motions in any district court unless he first posted a contempt bond of $1,500. To be deemed frivolous, a litigant's arguments must strike beyond the pale.&lt;ref&gt;Weblogger Chris Pearson quotes more extensively from ''Washington v. Alaimo'' in {{cite web |url=http://www.dumb-lawsuits.com/motion-to-kiss-my-ass |title=Motion to Kiss My Ass |date=13 December 2005 |publisher=dumb-lawsuits.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pearson v. Chung''===
In 2005, in ''[[Pearson v. Chung]]'', Roy Pearson, a [[Washington, D.C.]] judge, sued a [[dry cleaning]] business for $67 million for allegedly losing a pair of his pants. This case has been cited as an example of frivolous litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Great American Pants Suit |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010225 |quote=It's nice to see that even the organized plaintiffs bar piously deplores Mr. Pearson's abuse of the law. It would be even nicer if they agreed to stop opposing reforms that would give the Chungs of the world a fighting chance the next time around. |work=Wall Street Journal |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pearson, the dry cleaners lost his pants (which he brought in for a $10.50 alteration) and refused his demands for a large refund. Pearson believed that a sign saying "Satisfaction Guaranteed" in the window of the shop legally entitled him to a refund for the cost of the pants, estimated at $1,000. The $54 million total also included $2.0 million in "mental distress" and $15,000 which he estimated to be the cost of renting a car every weekend to go to another dry cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marc |last=Fisher |title=Wearing Down the Judicial System With a Pair of Pants |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/13/AR2007061302033.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |issn=0190-8286 |page=B01 |date=14 June 2007|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ultimately ruled against Pearson, whose judgeship was subsequently not renewed due to this case and several other actions he filed during his divorce, which were found to demonstrate a lack of "judicial temperament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Set to Lose Job, Sources Say |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/22/AR2007102202170.html?hpid=moreheadlines |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=October 23, 2007 |first=Keith L. |last=Alexander |accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonathan Lee Riches===
In 2010, federal prosecutors asked a judge to help them stop [[Jonathan Lee Riches]] from filing any more lawsuits, arguing that his frequent filings were frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Feds seek to halt inmate's lawsuits |url=http://www.nbc11news.com/news/headlines/102885724.html |publisher=KKCO 11 News |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gloria Dawn Ironbox===
In July 2013, the [[Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario]] dismissed a complaint laid by a man posing as Gloria Dawn Ironbox, a fictional feminist attorney on television series ''[[Family Guy]]''. The claimant alleged that the a marketing scheme by [[A&amp;W (Canada)|A&amp;W Restaurants]] was "[[heteronormative]]", "[[phallocentric]]" and promoted "cross-sectional hegemony." Citing feelings of distress and alienation over the lack of "[[LGBT]]" representation in A&amp;W naming conventions, he demanded $50,000 in damages for injury to dignity and self-respect as well as an order requiring A&amp;W to adopt naming conventions which include non-traditional families. One such product the claimant demanded was the "Pillow Biter", described by the claimant as "a large, dark slab of meat stuffed firmly between two, white, clenched buns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/07/25/heteronormative-burger-family-no-threat-to-lgbt-rights-tribunal-says-after-receiving-outrageous-complaint/ |title='Heteronormative' Burger Family no threat to LGBT, rights tribunal says after receiving 'outrageous' complaint |work=National Post |date=2013-07-25 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sirgiorgio Sanford Clardy===
In January 2014, Sirgiorgio Sanford Clardy, who is serving a 100-year prison sentence for a beating of a prostitute and her customer,&lt;ref name="Portland pimp who beat teen until ears bled, yelled expletives at jurors, gets 100 years"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/07/portland_pimp_who_beat_teen_un.html |title=Portland pimp who beat teen until ears bled, yelled expletives at jurors, gets 100 years |website=The Oregonian |date=July 19, 2013 |accessdate=21 January 2014 |author=Green, Aimee}}&lt;/ref&gt; has filed "a $100 million lawsuit against Nike", for which Clardy claims the shoe manufacturer is partially responsible. Clardy says that "Nike should have placed a label in his Jordan shoes warning consumers that they could be used as a dangerous weapon.

===''Romine v. Stanton''===
In March 2016, James Romine, an independent video game developer who founded [[Digital Homicide Studios]] sued a well known video game critic [[Jim Sterling]] (James Stanton) for criticizing the games published under his studios' name, seeking $10 million in damages for "assault, libel, and slander" to Romine's business. He claimed that Stanton's coverage of his studio's game ''[[The Slaughtering Grounds]]'' as "Worst Game of 2014 Contender" was not protected under [[fair use]] law because he did not believe it was "fair" criticism. An additional lawsuit for $18 million was filed against 100 users on the Steam gaming platform for criticizing their games and business practices, which he had interpreted as "harassment". The judge issued a [[subpoena]] against [[Valve Corporation]] to disclose the identities of those 100 users. This resulted in Valve removing all published games from Digital Homicide Studios.&lt;ref name="azcentral"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2016/09/21/yuma-digital-homicide-video-games-sue-users/90742572/.html |title= Free speech or criminal harassment? |date=September 21, 2016 |author=White, Kaila}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also didn't help that Romine filed the lawsuit as an individual and not as a corporation, and that such criticism is protected under the right to freedom of speech.

'''Hauser's law''' is the proposition that, in the [[United States]], federal tax revenues since World War II have always been approximately equal to 19.5% of [[GDP]], regardless of wide fluctuations in the [[Tax rate#Marginal|marginal tax rate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL971070M/Taxation_and_economic_performance '''Taxation and Economic Performance'''] by W Kurt Hauser&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, since the end of World War II, federal tax receipts as a percentage of [[gross domestic product]] averaged 17.9%, with a range from 14.4% to 20.9% between 1946 - 2007.&lt;ref name="2009 US Budget Documents"&gt;2009 U.S. Government Budget documents [http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf 2009 US Budget Documents].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
{{see also|Taxation in the United States}}

The proposition was first put forward in 1993 by William Kurt Hauser, a [[San Francisco]] investment analyst, who wrote, 

{{quote|No matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America tax revenues have remained at about 19.5% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kurt Hauser, "The Tax and Revenue Equation," ''The Wall Street Journal'', March 25, 1993.  Reprinted in:  W. Kurt Hauser, ''Taxation and Economic Performance'' (Stanford, California: Hoover Institution Press, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7zLmIK1HgEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gwf7fTg5vT&amp;sig=0KkZ3ImfLCEDnGSp70Fh50Xhoak&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AYPzS8bAKoOdlgf1ocT8DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 13-16].&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser cited [[Arthur Laffer]]'s concept of the [[Laffer curve]] in his original article. While the two concepts are similar, Hauser's law was put forward as an [[Empirical evidence|empirical observation]] whereas the Laffer curve is a [[Theory|theoretical argument]].&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;}}

In a May 20, 2008 editorial by David Ranson, the [[Wall St. Journal]] published a graph showing that even though the top marginal tax rate of federal income tax had varied between a low of 28% to a high of 91%, between 1950 and 2007, federal tax revenues had remained close to 19.5% of GDP.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; The editorial went on to say, 

{{quote|The economics of taxation will be moribund until economists accept and explain Hauser's law. For progress to be made, they will have to face up to it, reconcile it with other facts, and incorporate it within the body of accepted knowledge.&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/30653464.html You Can't Soak the Rich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108100055/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/30653464.html |date=2010-01-08 }}, Wall St. Journal, May 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From fiscal year 1946 to fiscal year 2007, federal tax receipts as a percentage of [[gross domestic product]] averaged 17.9%, with a range from 14.4% to 20.9%.&lt;ref name="2009 US Budget Documents"/&gt; 2009 tax collections, at 15% of GDP, were the lowest level of the past 50 years and 4.5 percentage points lower than Hauser's law suggests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10640/10-2009-MBR.pdf CBO-Monthly Budget Review]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Heritage Foundation]] has stated that the [[Late 2000s recession|recent world economic recession]] pushed receipts to a level significantly below the historical average.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;http://www.heritage.org/budgetchartbook/current-tax-receipts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary and criticism==
[[File:U.S.-Tax-Revenues-As-GDP-Percentage-(75-05).JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Total tax revenues as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. (in blue) in comparison to the 34 countries of the [[OECD]] (in green) and the [[EU 15]] (in red).]]

[[Forbes.com]] columnist [[Daniel J. Mitchell]] has argued that Hauser's Law has been observed due to the fact that the U.S. does not have a national [[sales tax]] and instead collects taxes in a [[federalist]] system, in contrast to many other Western nations. He also stated that the U.S. has an inherently more [[Progressive taxation|progressive]] system as well. Thus, he concluded that the Law represents a socio-political policy trend rather than a true economic law and that the trend could change rapidly if value-added taxes are imposed at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.forbes.com/beltway/2010/05/21/will-hausers-law-protect-us-from-revenue-hungry-politicians/ | work=Forbes | first=Daniel J. | last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Mike Kimel, writing for the Angry Bear website, has stated that Hauser's Law is misleading as it sweeps large differences under the table. He wrote that tax revenue is higher in the years following a tax increase and lower in the years following a tax cut. He defined the time periods 1951-1953, 1967-1968, and 1991-2001 as "tax hike eras", and 1953-1967, 1969-1991, 2001-2010 as "tax cut eras", and points out that tax revenues increase in "tax hike eras" and that tax cuts lead to lower revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/hausers-law-is-extremely-misleading.html |title=Hauser's Law is Extremely Misleading |first=Mike |last=Kimmel |work=Angry Bear - Financial and Economic Commentary |date=2010-11-30 |quote= |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zubin Jelveh, writing for [[Portfolio.com]], criticized the ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial for failing to adequately separate social insurance taxes from other types of tax revenues (such as income tax and corporate tax revenue). Because social insurance taxes go directly into the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] trust fund, revenue that is not earmarked for pension checks has actually declined as a percentage of GDP over the last 50 years. Jelveh points out that the main reason for this decline is a dramatic decline in corporate tax revenues, from more than 5% of GDP to less than 2%. Jelveh uses these facts to critique editorialist David Ranson's use of Hauser's Law to argue that raising tax rates on the rich will be ineffective at raising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://seekingalpha.com/article/78256-lying-with-charts-wsj-edition/ |title=Lying With Charts: WSJ Edition - Odd Numbers - Portfolio.com |work=seekingalpha.com |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Jonathan Chait]] has written in ''[[The New Republic]]'' that "swings are fairly dramatic" through U.S. history for tax receipts as a percent of GDP. He stated that the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]] and [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]]s received "massive" extra revenues as the result of tax increases while the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] tax cuts lead to a "massive" drop in revenues. He labeled the idea of static, flat revenues as a "scam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jonathan Chait]]|url=http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/79495/lying-chart-the-day-classic-edition|title=Lying Chart Of The Day, Classic Edition|date=November 29, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010|publisher=''[[The New Republic]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">'''Head of state succession''' is the process by which [[nation]]s transfer leadership of their highest office from one person to another. The succession of a [[head of state]] can be brought about through various means, the most common of which include:

* [[Death]] of the current Head of State
* A military [[Coup d'état]] against the present [[government]]
* A general [[election]]
* A [[Vote of No Confidence]] by the national [[legislature]]
* [[Hereditary]] succession or appointment by a pre-determined council
* [[Resignation]]
* [[Impeachment]]
* [[Abdication]]

== Head of state succession procedures ==
{{Orders of succession by country}}

== Dramatic portrayals ==

The changing of national leadership has been the topic of several films, [[novels]], and [[television]] series, including the following:

* [[Fiction regarding United States presidential succession]] is a major area of dramatic portrayal
* The film ''[[Der Untergang]]'' details the last days of the [[Third Reich]] to include the succession procedure enacted by [[Nazi Germany]] after the [[death of Adolf Hitler]]
* ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' dealt with the succession of the Klingon [[Chancellor]] after an [[assassination]] against the reigning [[Klingon]] Head of State. Several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' dealt more in depth with the exact procedures of transferring the leadership of the [[Klingon High Council]] from one person to another.
* Although ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (2003) is not set on Earth, the political structures of the 12 Colonies of Kobol closely resemble those of the United States. During the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] attack, Secretary of Education [[Laura Roslin]] receives a message from the Case Orange automated beacon, a special mechanism seeking communication with any surviving Colonial government officials. After verifying her identity, she learns that—other than herself—all members of [[Richard Adar|President Richard Adar's]] government have apparently been killed or are missing. The Case Orange response assigns Roslin new instructions, and she (the 43rd in the line of succession) is duly sworn-in as President.&lt;ref name="jeffrey2008"&gt;{{cite news

==Reaction to ''Navigable Waters Protection Act'' changes==
"The most contentious amendments to the bill were those to the ''[[Navigable Waters Protection Act]]'', which remove thousands of lakes and streams from federal protection under that law. The Conservatives said the changes streamline regulation and remove red tape that held up projects along waterways under the guise that they would impede navigation. Opposition parties say it removes environmental oversight over some of Canada's most treasured lakes and rivers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/12/05/fall-budget-bill-passes-with-no-amendments/ |title=Opposition claims moral victory as Conservatives vote down budget bill amendments |date=December 5, 2012 |author=Colin Horgan |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Party argued that Division 18 of Part 4 of Bill C-45 "weakened Canadians’ historic right to navigate the lakes, rivers, and streams of Canada without being impeded by pipelines, bridges, power lines, dams, mining and forestry equipment, and more." They argue that a body of water not mentioned in Schedule 2 on page 424, would no longer be protected from resource development by Canada's first environmental law enacted in 1882, the [[Navigable Waters Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=navigable-green&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill C-45 Greatly Diminishes Right to Unimpeded Navigable Waters |date=October 2012 |author= |publisher=Green Party of Canada |url=https://greenparty.ca/media-release/2012-10-18/bill-c-45-greatly-diminishes-right-unimpeded-navigable-waters|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Amnesty International]] said "changes to the ''[[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]'', the ''[[Fisheries Act]]'', the ''[[Navigable Waters Protection Act]]'', and the proposed ''[[Safe Drinking Water for First Nations Act]]'' have profound implications for the rights of Indigenous peoples as set out in treaties, affirmed in the constitution, and protected by international human rights standards." &lt;ref name=AmnestyInternational&gt;{{cite web |author=Amnesty International |title=Open Letter Urging a Meeting with Chief Theresa Spence |url=http://www.amnesty.ca/news/open-letters/open-letter-urging-a-meeting-with-chief-theresa-spence |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=policy-alternatives&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/commentary/first-nations-long-shadow-assimilation |title=Hennessy's Index: A number is never just a number |author=Trish Hennessy |publisher=Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to ''Indian Act'' changes==

Former Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] argued &lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/01/16/f-idle-no-more-paul-martin.html |author=Jennifer Clibbon |title=Paul Martin says Ottawa has 'no understanding' of native issues: Former prime minister was the architect of the 2005 Kelowna Accord |publisher=CBC |date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the government failed to consult First Nations about this movement towards [privatization] and that the majority of bands were against the change to voting procedures. Martin stated that there was no debate either in parliament or with First Nations on this issue that "the bands themselves must decide." He denounced the way in which it was "simply slipped it into a budget bill."&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; 

{{quote|The old way of deciding whether there could be privatization of these lands was that you had to have a double majority. You had to have majority of those who voted, and of those in the community, which is not unreasonable given low voting levels. What the government did was [to establish] that now 20 or 30 people, if they’re the only ones who voted out of a thousand, can decide the issue.|[[Paul Martin]]&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;}}

[[Idle No More]] is a protest movement formed in reaction to Bill C-45 (Division 8 of Part 4) and other concerns regarding indigenous [[treaty rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Idle No More |date=December 23, 2012 |url=http://idlenomore1.blogspot.ca/p/background-on-idle-no-more.html |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113101803/http://idlenomore1.blogspot.ca/p/background-on-idle-no-more.html |archivedate=January 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Political scientist Tom Flanagan, who worked as advisor to [[Stephen Harper]] until 2004, argued that the modifications to voting and approval procedures in relation to proposed land designations in the ''[[Indian Act]]'' in (Division 8 of Part 4) would speed up approvals which would be advantageous to First Nations that want to lease portions of their reserves for shopping centres, industrial parks, residential developments, casinos, etc.&lt;ref name=Flanagan-land-designation&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Flanagan|authorlink = Tom Flanagan (political scientist) |date=December 29, 2012 |title =Bill C-45 simply makes it easier for first nations to lease land |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, ON |accessdate=September 12, 2013|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/bill-c-45-simply-makes-it-easier-for-first-nations-to-lease-land/article6780103/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ''Indian Act'' changes to land designation for leasing "had to be approved by majority vote in a referendum or band meeting for which the quorum was a majority of members – in other words, approval by a majority of a majority. If, as usually happened, the quorum was not achieved, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs could authorize a second meeting dispensing with the quorum."

'''Justiciability''' concerns the limits upon legal issues over which a court can exercise its judicial authority.&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=Christopher N. |author2=Ides, Allan |title=Constitutional Law: National Power and Federalism |edition=4th |publisher=Aspen Publishers |year=2007 |location=New York, NY |pages= 97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes, but is not limited to, the legal concept of [[Standing (law)|standing]], which is used to determine if the party bringing the suit is a party appropriate to establishing whether an actual [[Adversarial system|adversarial]] issue exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[http://supreme.justia.com/us/392/83/case.html Flast v. Cohen] |vol=392 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=83 |pinpoint=100 |court= |date=1968 |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/392/83/case.html |quote=[W]hen standing is placed in issue in a case, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue, and not whether the issue itself is justiciable. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, justiciability in American law seeks to address whether a court possesses the ability to provide adequate resolution of the dispute; where a court feels it cannot offer such a final determination, the matter is not justiciable.

==In the United States==
{{US fed civ pro}}

Justiciability is one of several criteria that the [[United States Supreme Court]] uses to make a judgment granting ''[[writ of certiorari]]'' ("cert."). 

For an issue to be justiciable by a [[United States federal court]], all of the following conditions must be met: 

# The parties must not be seeking an [[advisory opinion]]. 
# There must be an [[actual controversy]] between the parties,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/219/346/case.html Muskrat v. United States]'', {{ussc|219|346|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the parties cannot agree to a lawsuit where all parties seek the same particular [[Judgement|judgment]] from the court (known as a collusive suit or [[friendly suit]]); rather, the parties must each be seeking a different outcome.
# The question must be neither [[ripeness|unripe]] nor [[mootness|moot]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/367/497/case.html Poe v. Ullman]'', {{ussc|367|497|1961}}; ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/416/312/case.html DeFunis v. Odegaard]'', {{ussc|416|312|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#*An unripe question is one for which there is not yet at least a threatened injury to the [[plaintiff]], or where the available judicial alternatives have not all been [[Exhaustion of remedies|exhausted]].
#*A moot question is one for which the potential for an injury to occur has ceased to exist, or where the injury has been removed. However, if the issue is likely to reoccur, yet will continually become moot before any challenge can reach a court of competent jurisdiction ("capable of repetition, yet evading review"), courts may allow a case that is moot to be litigated.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html Roe v. Wade]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The suit must not be seeking judgment upon a [[political question]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/506/224/case.html Nixon v. United States]'', {{ussc|506|224|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* [[Political question|Political questions]] involve matters where there is:
#** "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department" (meaning that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] requires another [[Separation of powers|branch of government]] to resolve questions regarding the issue);
#** "a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it";
#** an "impossibility of deciding [a matter] without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion";
#** an "impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government";
#** "an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made"; or
#** a "potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/369/186/case.html Baker v. Carr]'', {{ussc|369|186|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* Political questions include such issues as whether the nation is "at war" with another country, or whether the [[U.S. Senate]] has properly "tried" an [[impeachment|impeached]] federal officer.

If the case meets any one of these requirements, the court cannot hear it.

[[U.S. state|State]] courts tend to require a similar set of circumstances, although some states permit their courts to give [[advisory opinions]] on questions of law, even though there may be no actual dispute between parties to resolve.

A '''Kaldor–Hicks improvement''', named for [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and [[John Hicks]], is an economic re-allocation of resources among people that captures some of the intuitive appeal of a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto improvement]], but has less stringent criteria and is hence applicable to more circumstances. A re-allocation is a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could [[compensation principle|hypothetically compensate]] those that are made worse off and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome. The compensation does not actually have to occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor–Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people worse off.

A situation is said to be '''Kaldor–Hicks efficient''', or equivalently is said to satisfy the '''Kaldor–Hicks criterion''', if no potential Kaldor–Hicks improvement from that situation exists.

==Explanation==
A reallocation is said to be a [[Pareto improvement]] if at least one person is made better off and nobody is made worse off. However in practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off. Even voluntary exchanges may not be Pareto improving if they make third parties worse off.

Using the criterion for Kaldor–Hicks improvement, an outcome is an improvement if those that are made better off could in principle compensate those that are made worse off, so that a Pareto improving outcome ''could'' (though does not have to) be achieved. For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a ''Kaldor–Hicks improvement'' if the buyers and sellers are still willing to carry out the transaction even if they have to fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor–Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor–Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least none worse off).

While every Pareto improvement is a Kaldor–Hicks improvement, most Kaldor–Hicks improvements are not Pareto improvements. This is because the set of Pareto improvements is a proper subset of Kaldor–Hicks improvements. This reflects the greater flexibility and applicability of the Kaldor–Hicks criterion relative to the Pareto criterion.

==Use in policy-making==
The Kaldor–Hicks methods are typically used as tests of potential improvements rather than as efficiency goals themselves. They are used to determine whether an activity moves the economy toward Pareto efficiency. Any change usually makes some people better off and others worse off, so these tests consider what would happen if gainers were to compensate losers.

The Kaldor criterion is that an activity moves the economy closer to Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the gainers are [[willingness to pay|prepared to pay]] to the losers to agree to the change is greater than the minimum amount losers are prepared to accept; the Hicks criterion is that an activity moves the economy toward Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the losers would pay the gainers to forgo the change is less than the minimum amount the gainers would accept to so agree. Thus, the Kaldor test supposes that losers could prevent the arrangement and asks whether gainers value their gain so much they would and could pay losers to accept the arrangement, whereas the Hicks test supposes that gainers are able to proceed with the change and asks whether losers consider their loss to be worth less than what it would cost them to pay gainers to agree ''not'' to proceed with the change. After several technical problems with each separate criterion were discovered, they were combined into the [[Scitovsky]] criterion, more commonly known as the "Kaldor–Hicks criterion", which does not share the same flaws.

The Kaldor–Hicks criterion is widely applied in [[welfare economics]] and [[managerial economics]].  For example, it forms an underlying rationale for [[cost–benefit analysis]].  In cost–benefit analysis, a project (for example, a new airport) is evaluated by comparing the total costs, such as building costs and environmental costs, with the total benefits, such as airline profits and convenience for travelers. (However, as cost–benefit analysis may also assign different social welfare weights to different individuals, e.g. more to the poor, the compensation criterion is not always invoked by cost–benefit analysis.)

The project would typically be given the go-ahead if the benefits exceed the costs.  This is effectively an application of the Kaldor–Hicks criterion because it is equivalent to requiring that the benefits be enough that those that benefit could in theory compensate those that have lost out.  The criterion is used because it is argued that it is justifiable for society as a whole to make some worse off if this means a greater gain for others.

==Criticisms==

At a more technical level, various versions of the Kaldor–Hicks criteria lack desirable formal properties. For instance, [[Tibor Scitovsky]] demonstrated that the Kaldor criterion alone is not [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]]: it's possible to have a situation where an outcome A is an improvement (according to the Kaldor criterion) over outcome B, but B is also an improvement over A. The combined Kaldor–Hicks criterion does not have this problem, but it can be [[Intransitivity|non-transitive]] (though A may be an improvement over B, and B over C, A is not thereby an improvement over C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scitovsky |first=T. |authorlink=Tibor Scitovsky|author2= |year=1941 |month= |title=A Note on Welfare Propositions in Economics |journal=Review of Economic Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=77–88 |doi=10.2307/2967640 |jstor= 2967640|publisher=The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 9, No. 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/paretosocial.htm#scitovsky |title=The Paretian System: Scitovsky Reversals and the Double Criteria |accessdate= |last=Fonseca |first=G.

A fringe position also considers the return of the province to [[Germany]] from the [[Russian Federation]], or its independence from both.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-093-65, Flüchtlinge auf Schiff.jpg|thumbnail|[[Refugees from Königsberg]] fleeing to western Germany before the advancing Red Army in 1945]]
Kaliningrad, or [[Königsberg]], had been a part of a German state (the [[Teutonic Order]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Imperial Germany|unified Germany]]) for several centuries before the [[Second World War]], and the city was historically a rich German cultural center, being the home of – among others – the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. 

The annexation of the Königsberg area of [[East Prussia]] to Russia became a stated war aim of the Soviet Union at [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Michael|last2=Coppieters|first2=Bruno|last3=Malashenko|first3=Alekseĭ Vsevolodovich|title=Conflicting Loyalties and the State in Post-Soviet Russia and Eurasia|date=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714648828|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503193910/https://books.google.com/books?id=J_S9xfdODDUC&amp;pg=PA80|archivedate=2018-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], the city was captured by the [[Soviet Union]]. As agreed by the Allies at the [[Potsdam Conference]], northern Prussia, including Königsberg, was annexed by the USSR, which attached it to the [[Russian SFSR]]. In 1946, the city's name was changed to [[Kaliningrad]].

In October 1945, only about 5,000 Soviet civilians lived in the territory.&lt;ref name="malinkin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malinkin|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Building a Soviet City: the Transformation of Königsberg|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|website=Wilson Center|accessdate=2 May 2018|date=8 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707061350/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/building-soviet-city-the-transformation-konigsberg|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 1947 and October 1948, about 100,000 [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944-50)|Germans were forcibly moved]] to Germany.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Stefan|title=How to be Russian with a Difference? Kaliningrad and its German Past|journal=Geopolitics|date=13 May 2010|volume=15|issue=2|pages=345–366|doi=10.1080/14650040903486967}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 400,000 Soviet civilians arrived by 1948.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Some moved voluntarily, but as the number of willing settlers proved insufficient, [[collective farms]] were given quotas of how many people they had to send to Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt; Often they sent the least socially desirable individuals, such as alcoholics and the uneducated.&lt;ref name="malinkin"/&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] suggested that the [[Lithuanian SSR]] should annex Kaliningrad Oblast. The offer was refused by the [[Lithuanian Communist Party]] leader [[Antanas Sniečkus]], who did not wish to alter the ethnic composition of his republic.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=39}} In the late Soviet era, rumors spread that the Oblast might be converted into a homeland for [[Soviet Germans]].&lt;ref name="diener10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Alexander C.|last2=Hagen|first2=Joshua|title=Borderlines and Borderlands: Political Oddities at the Edge of the Nation-State|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742568440|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pci-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaliningrad Oblast remained part of the Soviet Union until [[USSR dissolution|its dissolution]] in 1991, and since then has been an [[exclave]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. After the Soviet collapse, some descendants of the expellees and refugees traveled to the city to examine their roots.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; According to the 2010 Russian Census, 7,349 ethnic Germans live in the Oblast, making up 0.8% of the population.&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the status of Kaliningrad and the rights of expellees was a mainstream political issue until the 1960s, when the shifting political discourse increasingly associated similar views with right-wing revisionism.&lt;ref name="bergerj10"/&gt;

According to a ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article published in 2010, in 1990 the West German government received a message from the Soviet general Geli Batenin, offering to return Kaliningrad.&lt;ref name="ballast"/&gt; The offer was never seriously considered by the Bonn government, who saw [[German reunification|reunification]] with the East as its priority.&lt;ref name="ballast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiegrefe|first1=Klaus|title=ZEITGESCHICHTE: Historischer Ballast|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=Der Spiegel|date=22 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014130823/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-70569479.html|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the EU was alleged to be in talks with Russia to arrange an [[EU association|association]] agreement with the Kaliningrad Oblast, at a time when Russia could not repay £22 billion debt owed to Berlin, which may have given Germany some influence over the territory.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html "Germany in secret talks with Russia to take back Konigsberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206041607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1318819/Germany-in-secret-talks-with-Russia-to-take-back-Konigsberg.html |date=2018-02-06 }}." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. January 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of "buying back" Kaliningrad or other "secret deals" were repudiated by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|last=Wagner|first=Rudolf|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|date=22 January 2001|accessdate=2018-03-21|title=Königsberg für eine Hand voll Euro?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511010948/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kaliningrad-koenigsberg-fuer-eine-hand-voll-euro-a-113527.html|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rumor about a debt-related deal, published by the Russian weekly ''Nash Continent'', alleged that Putin and [[Edmund Stoiber]] had agreed on the gradual return of Kaliningrad in return for waiving the country's $50 billion debt to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karabeshkin|first1=Leonid|last2=Wellmann|first2=Christian|title=The Russian Domestic Debate on Kaliningrad: Integrity, Identity and Economy|date=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=9783825879525|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501085510/https://books.google.com/books?id=15wH3N8gjE8C&amp;pg=PA20|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for irredentism==
[[Inesis Feldmanis]], head of the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the [[University of Latvia]], has been quoted saying that the [[Soviet Union]]'s annexation of Kaliningrad is "an error in history".&lt;ref name="moscow"/&gt;

The [[Freistaat Preußen]] Movement, one of the most active offshoots of the [[Reichsbürger]] movement, considers the Russian (and German) government as illegitimate and see themselves as the rightful rulers of the region.&lt;ref name="rhz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reichsbürger: Wie eine „Ministerpräsidentin“ aus der Eifel die Bundesrepublik bekämpft und einen Weltkrieg riskieren will|url=https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Rhein-Zeitung|date=16 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325191444/https://www.rhein-zeitung.de/region_artikel,-reichsbuerger-wie-eine-ministerpraesidentin-aus-der-eifel-die-bundesrepublik-bekaempft-und-einen-weltkr-_arid,1610906.html|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the movement is split into two competing factions, one based in [[Königsfeld, Rhineland-Palatinate]] and the other in Bonn.&lt;ref name="rhz"/&gt;

===In Lithuania===
{{seealso|Lithuania Minor}}
Some political groups in [[Lithuania]] claim the parts of Kaliningrad Oblast between the [[Pregolya River|Pregel]] and [[Nemunas river|Nemunas]] Rivers, but they have little influence.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}} [[Linas Balsys (politician)|Linas Balsys]], a deputy in the Lithuanian parliament, has argued that the status of the exclave should be discussed at international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts comment on Lithuanian MP’s claims regarding Russia's Kaliningrad|url=http://tass.com/politics/927891|accessdate=30 April 2018|work=TASS|date=30 January 2017|language=ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317113724/http://tass.com/politics/927891|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the former Lithuanian president [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] called for the separation and '[[decolonization]]' of Kaliningrad from Russia.&lt;ref name="kempton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempton|first1=Daniel R.|last2=Clark|first2=Terry D.|title=Unity Or Separation: Center-periphery Relations in the Former Soviet Union|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275973063|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501095203/https://books.google.com/books?id=vro_ongFiCkC&amp;pg=PA145|archivedate=2018-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, the Lithuanian parliament speaker [[Romualdas Ozolas]] expressed his view that Kaliningrad should become an independent republic.&lt;ref name="vitunic"/&gt;

After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the political analyst [[Laurynas Kasčiūnas]] called for a revisiting of the Potsdam Agreement.&lt;ref name="lrt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ar Karaliaučiaus statusas turėtų būti peržiūrimas?|url=http://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/pasaulyje/3/65279/ar-karaliauciaus-statusas-turetu-buti-perziurimas|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Lietuvos Radijas ir Televizija|language=lt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501095205/https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/pasaulyje/3/65279/ar-karaliauciaus-statusas-turetu-buti-perziurimas|archivedate=1 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that residents of Kaliningrad would support a referendum to separate from Russia.&lt;ref name="lrt"/&gt; The notion of a Lithuanian claim has been brushed off by Russian media, with the liberal ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' newspaper dismissing it as a 'geopolitical fantasy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=С легкой претензией на Калининград|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2014/09/26/61321-s-legkoy-pretenziey-na-kaliningrad|accessdate=4 May 2018|work=Новая газета|date=26 September 2014|language=ru-RU|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504195035/https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2014/09/26/61321-s-legkoy-pretenziey-na-kaliningrad|archivedate=4 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, a far-right group calling itself ''Gesellschaft für Siedlungsförderung in Trakehnen'' attempted to establish a settlement in [[Yasnaya Polyana, Kaliningrad Oblast|Yasnaya Polyana]].&lt;ref name="ihlau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ihlau|first1=Olaf|title=RUSSLANDDEUTSCHE: „Mich kriegt hier keiner weg“|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8842841.html|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=Der Spiegel|date=15 December 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104095948/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-8842841.html|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundraising by the organization ''Aktion Deutsches Königsberg'' financed the construction of a German-language school and housing in the neighboring village of Amtshagen.&lt;ref name="schwarz02"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwarz|first1=Moritz|title=Es geht nur mit den Russen|url=https://jungefreiheit.de/service/archiv?artikel=archiv02/212yy56.htm|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=Junge Freiheit|date=17 May 2002|language=de-DE|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503214508/https://jungefreiheit.de/service/archiv?artikel=archiv02%2F212yy56.htm|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the settlers were [[Russian Germans]] from the Caucasus and Kazakhstan, rather than returnees.&lt;ref name="ihlau95"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ihlau|first1=Olaf|title=Rußlanddeutsche: „Da werden Blasen geschlagen“|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9180848.html|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=Der Spiegel|date=24 April 1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411172319/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9180848.html|archivedate=11 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland has made no claim to Kaliningrad, and is seen as being unlikely to do so, as it was a net beneficiary of the [[Potsdam Agreement]], which also decided the status of Kaliningrad.{{sfn|Krickus|2002|p=82}}

A '''kangaroo court''' is a court that ignores recognized standards of law or justice, and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kangaroo%20court| title = kangaroo court |website = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate = 2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority who intentionally disregards the court's legal or ethical obligations. The defendants in such courts are often denied access to legal representation and in some cases, proper defence.

Prejudicial bias of the decision-maker or from political decree are among the most publicized causes of kangaroo courts.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Such proceedings are often held to give the appearance of a fair and just trial, even though the verdict was already decided before the trial actually began.

A kangaroo court could also develop when the structure and operation of the forum result in an inferior brand of adjudication. A common example of this is when institutional disputants ("repeat players") have excessive and unfair structural advantages over individual disputants ("one-shot players").&lt;ref&gt;Stempel, Jeffrey W. 8 Nev. L.J. 251 (2007-2008) Keeping Arbitrations from becoming Kangaroo Courts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''kangaroo court'' is often erroneously believed to have its origin from the courts of Australia's penal colonies.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt; However, the first published instance of the term is from an American source in the year 1853.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite dictionary|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary|title=kangaroo court|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources suggest that it may have been popularized during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849, along with ''mustang court'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=kangaroo+court&amp;searchmode=none |title=Kangaroo Court |website=Etymology Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a description of the hastily carried-out proceedings used to deal with the issue of [[Land claim#Mining claim (United States)|claim jumping]] miners.&lt;ref name=Etymology&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=What's the origin of "kangaroo court"? Is "kangaroo" aborigine for "I don't know"?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/491/whats-the-origin-of-kangaroo-court|publisher=The Straight Dope|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostensibly the term comes from the notion of justice proceeding "by leaps", like a [[kangaroo]]&lt;ref name=brockbond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x1331803980/Minor-League-Baseball-In-this-court-most-anything-goes#axzz2Nq4oSU1r|archive-date=April 11, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411120510/http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x1331803980/Minor-League-Baseball-In-this-court-most-anything-goes%23axzz2Nq4oSU1r#axzz2Nq4oSU1r|dead-url=yes|title=Minor League Baseball In this court most anything goes|website=The Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in other words, "jumping over" (intentionally ignoring) evidence that would be in favour of the defendant. Another possibility is that the phrase could refer to the pouch of a kangaroo, meaning the court is in someone's pocket. The phrase is popular in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand and is still in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Kangaroo+Court |title=Kangaroo Court |website=Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As informal proceedings in sports==
The term is sometimes used without any negative connotation. For example, many [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] teams have a kangaroo court to punish players for [[error (baseball)|errors]] and other mistakes on the field, as well as for being late for a game or practice, not wearing proper attire to road games, or having a messy locker in the clubhouse. Fines are allotted, and at the end of the year, the money collected is given to [[Charitable organization|charity]]. The organization may also use the money for a team party at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bouton | first = Jim | authorlink = Jim Bouton | title = Ball Four | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] | date = 1990 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 0-02-030665-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some examples of adjudication venues described as kangaroo courts are the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] (Volksgerichtshof) of [[Nazi Germany]] that convicted people who were suspected of being involved with the [[20 July plot#Aftermath|failed plot to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944]].

Another example is the trial of [[Pol Pot]] and his brother Ieng San by the [[People's Revolutionary Tribunal (Cambodia)|People's Revolutionary Tribunal]] in [[Cambodia]] in August 1979. After a lengthy trial with a duration of five days, both were sentenced to death ''[[in absentia]]'' on August 19, 1979.&lt;ref name="Schlund-Vials, C. J. 2012"&gt;Schlund-Vials, C. J.

J. 2012"/&gt;

During the [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989, [[President of Romania|President]] and [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Nicolae Ceausescu]] and his wife [[Elena Ceausescu|Elena]] were [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu|sentenced to death]] by a kangaroo court of soldiers from the [[Romanian People's Army]], which recently switched to the side of the revolutionaries.

A '''kazasker''' or '''kadıasker''' ({{lang-ota|قاضی عسكر}}, ''ḳāḍī'asker'', "military judge") was a chief judge in the [[Ottoman Empire]], so named originally because his jurisdiction extended to the cases of soldiers, who were later tried only by their own officers.&lt;ref&gt;Webster (1913), ''sub voce''&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2016}} Two kazaskers were appointed, called ''[[Rumelia|Rumeli]] Kazaskeri'' and ''[[Anatolia|Anadolu]] Kazaskeri'', having their jurisdiction respectively over the European and the Asiatic part of the Empire. They were subordinated to the [[Grand Vizier]], later [[Sheikh ul-Islam|Şeyhülislam]], and had no jurisdiction over the city of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. Moreover, they attended the meetings at the [[Imperial Council (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Mantran (1995), pp. 115-16 &lt;/ref&gt;

A Kazasker handled appeals to the decisions of [[kadı]]'s, had the power to overrule these, and suggested kadı candidates to the Grand Vizier.

The [[Klamath people|Klamath]] tribe along with the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Turtle Mountain Chippewa]], as well as all tribes in the states of [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], and [[Texas]] were targeted for immediate termination by [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108 of 1953]].

== Background ==

In the 1950s, the [[Klamath people|Klamath]] tribe in [[Oregon]] was one of the strongest and wealthiest tribes in the nation. They had created a vigorous economy based on timber resources and imported livestock, which nearly fully supported the entire tribe. The Klamath tribe was not a burden to the Oregon taxpayers, and was the only tribe in the country paying its share of BIA administrative costs.&lt;ref name="The Klamath Tribes -Termination"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klamathtribes.org/background/termination.html |title=The Klamath Tribes -Termination |publisher= |accessdate=27 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321002925/http://www.klamathtribes.org/background/termination.html |archivedate=21 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite appearances, 82% of the tribe members living "on" the reservation had no jobs and most still engaged in hunting and fishing for subsistence. As for acculturation, although Klamath students were enrolled in public high schools, only 10 graduated between 1934 and 1947 and in the mid-1950s more than half of the Klamath students enrolled did not pass to the next grade. Though the Klamath who lived "off" the reservation were more prepared for living in the mainstream society, the occupants of the reservation had no concept of rent, utility payments, taxes, banking or even how they would meet their dietary needs.&lt;ref name="Clements (2009)" /&gt;

== Termination ==

In spite of testimony and evidence given, the [[Klamath people|Klamath]] tribe  was terminated under the ''Klamath Termination Act'', or Public Law 587, enacted on August 13, 1954. Under this act, all federal supervision over Klamath lands, as well as federal aid provided to the Klamath because of their special status as Indians, was ended.&lt;ref name="altlaw.org1"&gt;{{cite web |author= Charles E. Kimball |title=Plaintiffs{{hyphen}}Appellants, v. John D. Callahan, Defendants{{hyphen}}Appellees |publisher= United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit |date= February 26, 1974 |at= 493 F.2d 564 |url=http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/451260}}{{dead-link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The legislation required each tribal member to choose between remaining a member of the tribe, or withdrawing and receiving a monetary payment for the value of the individual share of tribal land.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. ''Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations'. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005 &lt;!--provide page numbers--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Those who stayed became members of a tribal management plan. This plan became a trust relationship between tribal members and the United States National Bank in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, Susan, ''The Termination of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon', ''The American Society for Ethnohistory'', 1972 [https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-1801(197223)19%3A4%3C379%3ATOTKIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F]&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the 2,133 members of the Klamath tribe at the time of termination, 1,660 decided to withdraw from the tribe and accept individual payments for land.&lt;ref name="altlaw.org1"/&gt;

Oregon Senator [[Richard L. Neuberger]], (Democrat) and Oregon Representative [[Albert Ullman]], (Democrat) worked together to delay implementation of the Klamath termination law until hearings with the Indians were held and amendments could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/termination_and_restoration/#.VJuCuv-oDA|title=Termination and Restoration|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of testimony from experts, BIA officials and tribe members,&lt;ref name="Clements (2009)" /&gt; the Klamath were terminated in 1961 as a result of constant pressure by Senator [[Arthur V. Watkins]].&lt;ref name="The Klamath Tribes -Termination"/&gt;

== Modoc Controversy ==
The termination of the Klamath Reservation, in actuality included three distinct but affiliated tribes. The Act defines the members as the "Klamath and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Tribes and the Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians, and of the individual members thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/564a|title=25 U.S. Code § 564a - Definitions|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma|Modoc Tribe]], had been taken as prisoners to Indian Territory in 1873 following the Modoc War in Oregon. Later, they were placed on a reservation in Indian Territory and their lands were allotted as were other tribes to make way for statehood for Oklahoma. In 1909, the US Congress passed an Act allowing those Modocs to return to their traditional home in Oregon and take up residence on the Klamath Reservation. Some returned, and some remained in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, where they had now established homes and ties. In 1965, as a part of the US settlement with the Klamath reservation, a series of hearings were held from April to August. At the hearings, testimony was heard regarding the notice given to the western Modoc at the time of the termination of the Klamath Reservation. William Randall, Representative from Missouri's 5th District, observed on 13 May 1965 that he had reviewed notices that appeared in the ''Federal Register'' between 14 January 1955 and 12 August 1961 regarding the Klamath termination and none mentioned the Modoc. His and other testimony presented at the hearing made it clear that many western Modoc had not registered for the final roll, were unaware that the Klamath termination applied to them, and felt that they should not be excluded from claim reparations due by the United States to the tribe as a whole for historic breaches. The hearings concluded without allowing the Oklahoma Modoc to be included in the rolls of the Klamath Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://soda.sou.edu/Data/Library1/020617a1.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234938/http://soda.sou.edu/Data/Library1/020617a1.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hunting and Fishing Rights ==

Termination led to lawsuits, as individual Klamath Indians struggled to preserve treaty hunting and fishing rights. Five Klamath Indians who had withdrawn from the tribe after Public Law 587 claimed they retained hunting and fishing rights guaranteed to the Klamath tribe in the Treaty of October 16, 1854. After a U.S. district court ruled against them, they filed an appeal under ''[[Kimball v. Callahan]]''.&lt;ref name=altlaw.org2&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles E. KIMBALL et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. John D. CALLAHAN et al., Defendants-Appellees. United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|journal =493 F.2d 564| url=http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/451260|date=February 26, 1974}}{{dead-link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on reasoning similar to that in ''[[Menominee Tribe v. United States]]'', the U.S. District Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit found that, since the Klamath Termination Act did not specifically abrogate Klamath hunting and fishing rights, these rights remained.  The court looked at the stipulation in Public Law 280, providing that no state could deprive an Indian tribe (or individual members) of hunting and fishing rights guaranteed to them by federal treaty.&lt;ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com"&gt;Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, Certiorari to the U.S. Court of Claims, No. 187, 1968. (Transcript at Caselaw.lp){{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=391&amp;invol=404 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401073426/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=391&amp;invol=404 |archivedate=2008-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==

Within the tribe, termination had been supported only by a few who were loyal to Sen. Watkins. After being terminated, the tribe was cut off from services for education, health care, housing and related resources. Termination directly caused decay within the tribe including poverty, alcoholism, high suicide rates, low educational achievement, disintegration of the family, poor housing, high dropout rates from school, disproportionate numbers in penal institutions, increased infant mortality, decreased life expectancy, and loss of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Clements (2009), pp 47-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the western Modoc were restored to tribal status 15 May 1978, in an Act which reinstated the Modoc, Wyandotte, Peoria and Ottawa Tribes of Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=92&amp;page=246&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a decade later, through the leadership and vision of the Klamath people, and the assistance of a few congressional leaders, the Klamath Restoration Act was adopted into law in 1986, reestablishing the Klamath as a sovereign state.&lt;ref name="The Klamath Tribes -Termination"/&gt;

'''Dehorning''' is the process of removing the fully grown [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] of [[livestock]]. [[Cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[goats]] are sometimes dehorned&lt;ref name=RCVS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/vets/mutilations.htm|title=RCVS List of Mutilatory Procedures|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sneddon and Gentle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agriculture.de/acms1/conf6/ws5apain.html|title=Pain in animals|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for economic and safety reasons.  '''Disbudding''' is a different process with similar results; it cauterizes and thus destroys horn buds before they have grown into horns. Disbudding is commonly performed early in an animal's life, as are other procedures such as [[docking (animal)|docking]] and [[castration]].

Many breeds of cattle and sheep are naturally hornless. The [[polled livestock|polled]] gene can occur naturally in particular breeds or easily manipulated during breeding to lack horns, therefore do not need to be dehorned or disbud. Although polling is common among cattle and sheep, a variety of livestock species cannot easily be bred to lack horns naturally.  In one case, the poll gene in goats was linked to [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphrodism]] in a single study several decades ago, although fertile polled goats have been bred.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Horns are removed because they can pose a risk to humans, other animals and to the bearers of the horns themselves (horns are sometimes caught in fences or prevent feeding). Dehorning is normally performed with local [[anesthesia]] and [[sedation]] by a [[veterinarian]] or a trained professional. Removal of larger horns is usually performed during spring and autumn to avoid fly season. In very large horns, "tipping" (removal of the tip of the horn) may be recommended to minimize bleeding. Dehorning is not routinely performed, since it is a difficult and painful process for the animal. Instead, most responsible breeders disbud (see below) their animals while young, when the process is quick and easy.&lt;ref name=Tenn&gt;{{cite web |url=https://utextension.tennessee.edu/publications/documents/pb1684.pdf|title=Dehorning Calves|date=2004 |publisher=University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension |accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dehorning is controversial because of the pain it causes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/dehorning_cattle_bgnd.pdf|title=Dehorning and Disbudding of Cattle|date=2014-07-15 |publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

===Removal===
*Horns may cause injuries to handlers or other animals.
*Horned animals take up more space, causing issues at the feed bunk and during transportation. 
*Horned animals may require specialized equipment, such as feeders and [[angulate crush]]es.
*In some breeds and in some individuals, horns may grow towards the head, eventually causing injury.
*Horns may become broken, causing blood-loss and potential for infection.
*Horned animals may become trapped in fences or vegetation, causing self injury.

===Remaining horned===
*Dehorning (removing fully grown horns) without the use of anesthesia is extremely painful to the animal.&lt;ref name="Hemsworth et al., (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemsworth | first1 = P.H. | last2 = Barnett | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Beveridge | first3 = L. | last4 = Matthews | first4 = L.R. | year = 1995 | title = The welfare of extensively managed dairy cattle - a review | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 161–182 | doi=10.1016/0168-1591(94)00538-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peta_dairy_dehorning&gt;{{cite web|title=Peta video on dairy dehorning|url=http://www.peta.org/tv/videos/vegetarianism-general/1845045113001.aspx|publisher=Peta|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study that surveyed 639 farmers found that 52% of farmers reported that disbudding caused pain lasting more than 6 hours, that only 10 percent of the farmers used local anesthesia before cauterization, 5 percent provided calves with postoperative analgesia, and that farmers "indicated limited willingness to pay the cost of analgesia or to call a veterinarian to perform the procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gottardo|first1=Flaviana|display-authors=etal|title=The dehorning of dairy calves: practices and opinions of 639 farmers.|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|date=November 2011|volume=94|issue=11|pages=5724–5734|doi=10.3168/jds.2011-4443}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Horned livestock are better able to defend themselves and their young from predators such as [[wolf|wolves]] and [[dog]]s.
*Horns provide a secure point for roping or holding the animal's head.
*Horns are traditional in some breeds, and [[breed standard]]s may require their presence (for example, [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]], [[Highland cattle|Highland]] and [[White Park cattle|White Park]] cattle).
*In some areas horns are of cultural significance, often being decorated or even trained into strange shapes.
*Some types of [[Yoke#Head yoke|yoke]]s used by draught [[ox]]en require the presence of horns.
*In very hot climates, horns are useful for thermoregulation and cooling.

Dehorning can be performed on older animals and is normally performed with local [[anesthesia]] ([[cornual nerve]] [[Nerve block|block]]) by a [[veterinarian]] or a trained professional. Removal of larger horns is usually performed during spring and autumn to avoid fly season.&lt;ref name=Tenn/&gt; Sedation may be recommended, especially for larger animals that require increased restraint. Use of longer-term pain medicine, like NSAIDs, is being researched in the US to ensure food safety.

For mature cattle that were not dehorned when they were young, another common practice to just cut off the pointed end of the horn. This practice is called horn tipping; it is less stressful on the animal because there is no blood loss and the horn is cut off where there are no longer any nerve endings.&lt;ref name=Tenn/&gt; This practice does not eliminate the bruising damage done by the horns when cows fight, but it does eliminate the risk of puncture wounds and eye loss from pointed horns.

Disbudding minimizes discomfort and risk, and is performed when horns are small "buds" by one of several methods:
*[[Cauterization]] is the process of killing the growth ring of the horn using heat. This process is done when cattle are very young, no more than three or four weeks old—that way the horns are not very big. The earlier in the calf's life cauterization is done, the less pain and stress is inflicted on the calf.  Cauterization is usually done with a dehorning hot iron after the area is numbed with local anesthesia. 
*A curved knife can be used to cut the horn off when the calf is younger than a couple of months old. It is a simple procedure where the horn and the growth ring is cut off to remove the horn. 
*For under eight months of age, but after the horns are starting to grow attached to the skull, so a cup dehorner or a [[Gigli saw]], a type of surgical cutting wire, is used.&lt;ref name="beattie"&gt;{{cite book |last= Beattie |first= William A.|title= Beef Cattle Breeding &amp; Management |publisher= Popular Books, Frenchs Forest |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-7301-0040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different types of cup dehorners, but they all serve the same function of removing the horn and growth ring. Since the horn is tougher it takes more force to remove it so tools that provide some leverage are need. [[Gigli saw]] wire is used on horns of older calf’s horns that have grown too large for the cup dehorners. 
*The most recent development in dehorning technology is use of a caustic dehorning paste. The paste is used on calves at less than two days old. The hair around the horn is trimmed back and then the paste is spread all over the horn bud and around the base of the horn on the growth cells. The paste kills the growth ring of the horn and then the horn falls off like a scab when it is healed.&lt;ref name="beattie"/&gt;  However, this method bears a risk of the paste causing injury to the animal's eyes or other tissues if used during periods of rain.

===Restraint methods===

The animal to be dehorned is usually restrained, either using a dehorning table or with chemical restraint —[[sedation]]. This ensures that the dehorning procedure can be done safely and properly. Young calves are run through a head gate (similar to a [[cattle crush]]) or haltered. Calves more than a few months old are held in a head gate and their head restrained with a dehorning table or chin bar. Smaller animals like sheep and goats may be restrained by hand or with use of [[halter]]s.

===Pain control===

In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) survey suggested that most cattle in the U.S. were disbudded or dehorned without the use of anesthesia at that time. The survey showed that more than nine out of ten dairy farms practiced dehorning, but fewer than 20 percent of cattle dairy operations used analgesics or anesthesia during the process. While animal rights groups, like the Humane Society of the United States, condemn the practice of dehorning, ending it would mean increased horn-related injuries to cattle and humans. [[Polled livestock|Polled]] genetics, long a staple in [[beef cattle]] breeding are becoming more popular among dairy farmers, with more polled calves being born to [[dairy cattle]] every year. Genetic testing can now determine if cattle carry genes for growing horns.&lt;ref&gt;"USDA NAHMS Dairy 2007". [[USDA NAHMS Online]]. January 2010.

==Public debate==
In 2018 [[Swiss_referendums,_2018#November_referendums|a referendum]] was held in Switzerland on providing additional subsidies to farmers that did not dehorn their livestock (between 75–90% of livestock in Switzerland had their horns removed).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/vote-november-25--2018_are-cows-happier-with-their-horns-/44500542 Are cows happier with their horns?] Swiss Info, 26 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was a result of farmer Armin Capaul collecting over 100,000 signatures for a vote on the issue. However, the proposal was opposed by the government and rejected by voters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46335918 Swiss vote no in sovereignty referendum] BBC News, 25 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Título de la Maestría.JPG|thumb|Example of a diploma from [[Harvard University]] conferring the MPA degree. It belongs to [[Felipe Calderón]], former president of Mexico.]]

The '''Master of Public Administration''' ('''M.P.Adm.''', '''M.P.A.''', or '''MPA''') is a professional graduate degree in [[public administration]], similar to the [[Master of Business Administration]] but with an emphasis on the issues of governance.

==Overview==
The MPA program is a [[professional degree]] and a [[graduate degree]] for the public sector and it prepares individuals to serve as managers, executives and policy analysts in the executive arm of local, state/provincial, and federal/national government, and increasingly in [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) and [[nonprofit]] sectors; it places a focus on the systematic investigation of executive organization and management. Instruction includes the roles, development, and principles of public administration; [[public policy]] management and implementation.

Through its history, the MPA degree has become more interdisciplinary by drawing from fields such as economics, sociology, law, anthropology, political science, and regional planning in order to equip MPA graduates with skills and knowledge covering a broad range of topics and disciplines relevant to the public sector. A core curriculum of a typical MPA program usually includes courses on [[microeconomics]], [[public finance]], research methods, statistics, [[policy analysis]], [[managerial accounting]], ethics, [[public management]], [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), and program evaluation. MPA students may focus their studies on public sector fields such as [[urban planning]], [[emergency management]], [[transportation]], health care (especially [[public health]]), [[economic development]], [[community development]], [[non-profit]] management, [[environmental policy]], [[cultural policy]], and [[criminal justice]].

MPA graduates currently serve in some important positions within the public sector including Prime Minister of Singapore [[Lee Hsien Loong]], former UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]], former [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[David Petraeus]], former president of Liberia [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], former president of Mexico [[Felipe Calderón]], Foreign Minister of Serbia [[Vuk Jeremić]], Chairman of the [[World Toilet Organization]] [[Jack Sim]], former New York City Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]], former [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]], former Treasurer of Australia [[Wayne Swan]]. Other notable MPA graduates include [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and pilot [[Chesley Sullenberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.study.eu/article/15-notable-graduates-from-mpa-and-mpp-programmes|title=15 notable graduates from MPA and MPP programmes|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Master of Public Administration can be acquired at various institutions. See ''[[List of public administration schools|List of schools offering MPA degrees.]]''

The '''Motor Car Act 1903''' (3 Edw.7, c. 36) was an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] that received [[royal assent]] on 14 August 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/27589/page/5211/data.pdf|title=The London Gazetter, Number 27589|date=18 August 1903|access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which introduced [[motor vehicle registration]], [[driver licensing]] and increased the speed limit.&lt;ref name=ni&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsafetyni.gov.uk/index/education/teenzone/tz-mvrus/tz-mvrus-legislation.htm|title=A summary of important legislation|work=Department for Education (Northern Ireland) GCSE Revision|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213141822/http://www.roadsafetyni.gov.uk/index/education/teenzone/tz-mvrus/tz-mvrus-legislation.htm|archivedate=13 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The Act followed the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]] which had increased the speed limit for motorcars to 14&amp;nbsp;mph from the previous 4&amp;nbsp;mph in rural area and 2&amp;nbsp;mph in towns. 

There were some who wished to see the speed limit removed altogether. The influential [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club]] (soon to become the Royal Automobile Club or RAC) was split on the subject; the chair of the working group on the Bill was [[John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|Lord Montagu]] (MP) who took a moderate line supporting speed limits, but was opposed on this by the chairman of the organisation Roger Wallace who were 'strongly against any speed limit' and described Montagu as a 'traitor'.  The secretary of the club publicly proposed a 'compromise' of 25&amp;nbsp;mph without authorisation. Parliamentary debates were described as 'bitter'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndZVcax375EC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=RQCfqFk9Ol&amp;dq|title=The motorway achievement volume 1|page=44|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections of the Act ==
* Section 1 introduced the crime of [[reckless driving]], and imposed penalties.&lt;ref name=ni/&gt;
* Section 2 introduced the mandatory [[vehicle registration]] of all motor cars with the [[county council]] or [[county borough]] council in which the driver was resident. The council was to issue a unique number to each car, and prescribe the manner in which it was to be displayed on the vehicle. The Act also made it an offence to drive a motor car on a public road without [[British car number plates|displaying its registration number]].&lt;ref name=ni/&gt;
* Section 3 made it compulsory for drivers of motor cars  in the United Kingdom to have a [[driving licence]] from "the first day of January, nineteen hundred and four"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/motormiscellany/motoring/law-and-the-motorist/the-motor-car-act-1903|title=The Motor Car Act, 1903 - The Motor Miscellany|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. No test was required, the licence being issued by the council on payment of five shillings. The qualifying age for a car licence was 17 years and for a motor cycle, 14 years.&lt;ref name=ni/&gt;
* The [[speed limit]] on public [[highway]] was raised to 20&amp;nbsp;mph from 14&amp;nbsp;mph which had been set by the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]].&lt;ref name=ni/&gt;
* Section 9 allowed for lower speed limits to be implemented after a local inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1908/nov/09/motor-speed-limits-applications-by-local#S4V0195P0_19081109_HOC_228|title=Motor Speed Limits—Applications by Local Authorities.|date=1908-11-09|accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regulations were introduced regarding the [[Brake|braking]] ability of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221549/227755/rrcgb2008.pdf|title=Reported Road Casualties Great Britain: 2008|page=178|quote=1903-1904: Motor Car Act introduced driving licences. Vehicle braking requirements are introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Act was intended to last for only three years but was extended by the [[Expiring Laws Continuance Act 1900]] until a new bill was seriously discussed in 1929 and enacted. Both the ''Locomotives on Highways Act 1896'' and the ''Motor Car Act 1903'' were repealed by the ''[[Road Traffic Act 1930]]''.&lt;ref name=doeni&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsafetyni.gov.uk/index/road_safety_education/teacherzone-home/teacherzone-mvrus/mvrus-legislation.htm|title=A summary of important legislation|work=DOE NI|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903023641/http://www.roadsafetyni.gov.uk/index/road_safety_education/teacherzone-home/teacherzone-mvrus/mvrus-legislation.htm|archivedate=3 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Royal Commission]] on Motorcars was established in 1905 which reported in 1907 and recommended that motorcars should be taxed, that the speed limit should be abolished (by a majority vote only) and raised concern about the manner in which [[speed traps]] were being used to raise revenue in rural areas rather than being used to protect lives in towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/may/24/royal-commission-on-motor-cars|title=Debate on the Royal Commission on Motor Cars|work=Hansard|date=1906-05-24|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1907/jul/16/motor-car-legislation|title=MOTOR CAR LEGISLATION|work=Hansard|date=1907-07-16|accessdate=2010-04-17|quote=The noble Earl said: My Lords, in 1905, a very important and influential Royal Commission was appointed to consider the subject of motor cars, and what legislation was desirable when the Act at that time existing, and which was limited to three years, expired. That Commission held a great many sittings and examined a great many witnesses; it was extremely painstaking in its work, and presented a very carefully considered and somewhat voluminous Report...  I regard the abolition of the speed limit as the most important recommendation of the Royal Commission... Policemen are not stationed in the villages where there are people about who might be in danger, but are hidden in hedges or ditches by the side of the most open roads in the country... I am entirely in sympathy with what the noble Earl said with regard to police traps. In my opinion they are manifestly absurd as a protection to the public, and they are used in many counties merely as a means of extracting money from the passing traveller in a way which reminds one of the highwaymen of the Middle Ages.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments were discussed in 1905, 1911, 1913 1914 under the titles ''Motor Car Act (1903) Amendment bill'' and ''Motor Car Act (1903) Amendment (No 2) bill''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/motor-car-act-1903|title=Motor Car Act 1903|work=Hansard|accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto von Habsburg'''&lt;ref&gt;Otto was born as ''His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia'' and became the Crown Prince of these countries in 1916. After 1919, titles of nobility were formally abolished in Austria, thus in official use the "von" disappeared before Habsburg. The same applied after Habsburg became a German citizen (see ''Printausgabe der deutschen Wochenzeitung die Zeit'' of 21 July 2011, p. 36). By courtesy, he would also be referred to by the European royal and princely courts by his former style and title, i.e. as ''His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke Otto of Austria''. In the Austrian republic the authorities referred to him from 1919 as Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, a name he never used himself. Otto did not live in Austria after 1918, and his citizenship there was revoked by Adolf Hitler in 1941, making him stateless. His Austrian citizenship was only restored in 1965. Otto later became a citizen of or was issued passports of several other countries, where his official name was Otto von Habsburg. As a Member of the European Parliament for Germany, his official name in the [[European Union]] was Otto von Habsburg. On his website, he used the style and name His Imperial and Royal Highness Dr. Otto von Habsburg.&lt;/ref&gt; (20 November 1912{{spaced ndash}} 4 July 2011),&lt;ref name="euology"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/world/europe/05habsburg.html?_r=1&amp;ref=deathsobituaries|title=Otto von Hapsburg, a Would-Be Monarch, Dies at 98|author=[[Nicholas Kulish]]|work=The New York Times|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14019319|title=Habsburg: Last heir to Austro-Hungarian empire dies |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known by his traditional royal title of '''Archduke Otto of Austria''', was the last [[List of heirs to the Austrian throne|Crown Prince]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] from 1916 until the dissolution of the empire in 1919, a realm which comprised modern-day Austria, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and parts of Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. He became the [[pretender]] to the former thrones, Head of the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], and Sovereign of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Die vielen Pflichten des Adels|url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/oesterreich/278334_Die-vielen-Pflichten-des-Adels.html|date=5 July 2011|newspaper=Wiener Zeitung|language=German|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1922, upon the death of his father. He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007.

The eldest son of [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I and IV]], the last [[Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]], and his wife, [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]], Otto was born as third in line to the thrones, as Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia.&lt;ref name="harmonische Wahlkapitulation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Croatian Coronation Oath" /&gt; With his father's accession to the thrones in 1916, he was likely to become emperor and king. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful emperor-king from 1922.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Death of former 'kaiser in exile' and last heir to Austro-Hungarian throne|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0705/1224300090924.html|date=4 July 2011|newspaper=The Irish Times|accessdate=5 July 2011|first=Derek|last=Scally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of [[European integration]]—being thoroughly disgusted with [[nationalism]]—and a fierce opponent of [[Nazism]] and [[communism]].&lt;ref name="euology"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DW&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15209153,00.html Kaiser-Sohn Otto von Habsburg gestorben] [[Deutsche Welle]], 4 July 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as one of the leaders of the [[Austrian Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Tibor Pásztory |url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/meinungen/gastkommentare/289459_Die-beliebtesten-Irrtuemer-zur-Monarchie.html |title=Die beliebtesten Irrtümer zur Monarchie  |publisher=Wienerzeitung.at |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'', where monarchists were severely persecuted in Austria and sentenced to death by the Nazis,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Otto fled Europe to the United States.

Otto von Habsburg was Vice President (1957–1973) and President (1973–2004) of the [[International Paneuropean Union]], and served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) from 1979 to 1999. As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto had an empty chair set up for the countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain in the European Parliament, and took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Otto von Habsburg played a notable role in the [[revolutions of 1989]], as a co-initiator of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. Later he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2474&amp;Itemid=1 |title=The Budapest Times – Hungary‘s leading English Language source for daily news |publisher=Budapesttimes.hu |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A noted intellectual, he published several books on historical and political affairs. Otto has been described as one of the "architects of the European idea and of European integration" together with [[Robert Schuman]], [[Konrad Adenauer]], and [[Alcide De Gasperi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathweb.at/site/focus/database/40311.html?SWS=04a92352c9cf628f76e57b8d7708989e |title= Trauer um Otto von Habsburg |publisher=Kathweb.at |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto was exiled in 1918 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria-Hungary, preparing him to become a [[Catholic]] [[monarch]]. During his life in exile, he lived in Switzerland, [[Madeira]], Spain, Belgium, France, the United States, and from 1954 until his death, finally in [[Bavaria]] (Germany), in the residence ''Villa Austria''. At the time of his death, he was a citizen of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia, having earlier been [[statelessness|stateless]] ''de jure'' and ''de facto'', and possessed passports of Monaco, the [[Order of Malta]], and Spain. In 1961, he was offered the crown of Spain by [[Francisco Franco]]. He refused, and [[Juan Carlos I|Juan Carlos]] of the [[House of Bourbon]] was made Franco's successor instead.

[[Death and funeral of Otto von Habsburg|His funeral]] took place at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in [[Vienna]] on 16 July 2011; he was entombed in the [[Imperial Crypt]] in Vienna and [[Heart-burial|his heart buried]] in [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]] in Hungary.

==Early life==
[[File:Kroenung Budapest Karl und Zita 1916a.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The young crown prince Otto with his parents posing for official photographs on the occasion of the coronation in [[Budapest]], 1916]]

Otto was born at [[Villa Wartholz]] in [[Reichenau an der Rax]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He was baptised '''''Franz Joseph Otto''' Robert Maria Anton Karl Max Heinrich Sixtus Xavier Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius'' on 25 November 1912 at Villa Wartholz by the Prince-Archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal [[Franz Xaver Nagl]]. This name was named to promote as '''Franz Joseph II''' in the future. His godfather was the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] (represented by [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]); his godmother was his grandmother [[Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wiener Zeitung'', 26 November 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1916, Otto became Crown Prince of [[Austria-Hungary|Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia]]&lt;ref name="harmonische Wahlkapitulation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Croatian Coronation Oath" /&gt; when his father, Archduke Charles, acceded to the throne. However, in 1918, at the end of the First World War, the monarchies were abolished, the republics of [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and [[Hungarian Democratic Republic|Hungary]] were founded in their place, and the family was forced into exile in Madeira.&lt;ref name="Scally"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scally|first=Derek|title=Death of former 'kaiser in exile' and last heir to Austro-Hungarian throne|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0705/1224300090924.html|accessdate=29 September 2011|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hungary did become a kingdom again, but Charles was never to regain the throne. Instead, [[Miklós Horthy]] ruled as regent until 1944, in a kingdom without a king.

Otto spoke [[German language|German]], Hungarian, [[Croatian language|Croatian]], English, Spanish, French and [[Latin]] fluently. In later life, he would write some forty books in German, Hungarian, French and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110704-36065.html|title=Otto von Habsburg, heir to Austria's last emperor, dies at 98|publisher=[[The Local]]|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother made him learn many languages because she believed he one day might rule over many lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789670,00.html|title=Habsburg Empire: Clown Prince|publisher=[[TIME]]|date=11 March 1940|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warren|first=David|title=The Europe that might have been|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/Europe+that+might+have+been/5055722/story.html|accessdate=29 September 2011|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=10 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828135955/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/Europe+that+might+have+been/5055722/story.html|archivedate=28 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years in exile==
Otto's family spent the subsequent years in Switzerland, and on the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where Charles died prematurely in 1922, leaving the nine-year-old Otto [[pretender]] to the throne. On his father's deathbed, his mother, Empress Dowager Zita, told Otto, "your father is now sleeping the eternal sleep—you are now Emperor and King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/675151/Habsburgs-Erbe-zerfiel-und-erlebte-dennoch-eine-Renaissance?_vl_backlink=/home/politik/innenpolitik/index.do |title=Habsburgs Erbe zerfiel und erlebte dennoch eine Renaissance |publisher=Diepresse.com |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family eventually relocated to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Lekeitio]], where forty Spanish [[grandee]]s bought them a villa.

Meanwhile, the Austrian parliament had officially expelled the Habsburg dynasty and confiscated all the official property via the [[Habsburg Law]] of 3 April 1919. Charles was banned from ever returning to Austria again, while Otto and other male members could only return if they renounced all claims to the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.

In 1935, he graduated with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in Political and Social Sciences from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] in Belgium. His thesis was on "the right, born of usage and of the peasant law of inheritance, of the indivisibility of rural land ownership in Austria".&lt;ref name="thenational"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/europe/otto-hapsburg-eldest-son-of-austrias-last-emperor-dies-at-98 |title=Otto Hapsburg, eldest son of Austria's last emperor, dies at 98 |publisher=Thenational.ae |accessdate=6 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711203504/http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/europe/otto-hapsburg-eldest-son-of-austrias-last-emperor-dies-at-98 |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|gunther1936}} In 1937 he wrote,&lt;ref&gt;Gedächtnisjahrbuch 1937, 9. Jg.: Dem Andenken an Karls von Österreich Kaiser und König. Arbeitsgemeinschaft österreichischer Vereine – Wien, W. Hamburger 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''I know very well that the overwhelming majority of the Austrian population would like me to assume the heritage of the peace emperor, my beloved father, rather earlier than later. ... The [Austrian] people have never cast a vote in favor of the republic. They have remained silent as long as they were exhausted from the long fight, and taken by surprise by the audacity of the revolutionaries of 1918 and 1919.

He continued to enjoy considerable public support in Austria; from 1931 to 1938, 1,603 Austrian municipalities named Otto an honorary citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Arnberger, Winfried R. Garscha, Rudolf G. Ardelt, Christa Mitterrutzner, ''Anschluß 1938'', Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes, Österreichischer Bundesverlag, 1988, {{ISBN|3-215-06824-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gunther]] believed that Zita was less popular among Austrians, however, writing in 1936 that "restoration would be a good deal closer if Otto's return would not mean also the return of his mother—to say nothing of hundreds of assorted and impoverished Habsburg cousins and aunts, who would flock to Vienna like ants to a keg of syrup". A greater obstacle, he wrote, was the opposition of Czechoslovakia and [[Yugoslavia]], which feared that their people might want to rejoin a recreated monarchy.{{r|gunther1936}}

==World War II==
Otto denounced Nazism, stating:

{{cquote|''I absolutely reject [Nazi] Fascism for Austria ... This un-Austrian movement promises everything to everyone, but really intends the most ruthless subjugation of the Austrian people ... The people of Austria will never tolerate that our beautiful fatherland should become an exploited colony, and that the Austrian should become a man of second category.''&lt;ref name="gunther1936"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16059565W/Inside_Europe | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1936 | pages=321–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He strongly opposed the ''[[Anschluss]]'', and in 1938 requested Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] to resist [[Nazi Germany]]. He supported international intervention&lt;ref name=DW/&gt; and offered to return from exile to take over the reins of government to repel the Nazis.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/royalty-obituaries/8616240/Archduke-Otto-von-Habsburg.html |title=Archduke Otto von Habsburg |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 4 July 2011|accessdate=6 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gerald Warner, "Austrian Jews were among the strongest supporters of a Habsburg restoration, since they believed the dynasty would give the nation sufficient resolve to stand up to the Third Reich".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner |first=Gerald |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/5774579/Otto_von_Habsburgs_96th_birthday_telescopes_European_history/ |title=Otto von Habsburg's 96th birthday telescopes European history  |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the German annexation of Austria, Otto was sentenced to death by the Nazi regime; [[Rudolf Hess]] ordered that Otto was to be executed immediately if caught.&lt;ref name="guardian-obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan van der Vat | authorlink = Dan van der Vat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/otto-von-habsburg-obituary |title=Otto von Habsburg obituary |work=The Guardian |date= 4 July 2011|accessdate=6 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Omeidl "Rudolf Hess, der Stellvertreter des Führers, hatte den deutschen Invasionstruppen für das neutrale Belgien den Befehl erteilt, Otto von Habsburg und seine Brüder, falls sie gefasst würden, ohne jedes weitere Verfahren sofort zu erschießen." {{cite web |url=http://www.omeidl.com/monarch.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005080553/http://www.omeidl.com/monarch.html |archivedate=5 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]], his personal property and that of the House of Habsburg were confiscated.

The leaders of the Austrian legitimist movement, i.e. supporters of Otto, were arrested by the Nazis and largely executed ([[Stefan Zweig]]'s novella ''[[The Royal Game]]'' is based on these events). Otto's cousins [[Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg|Max, Duke of Hohenberg]], and [[Prince Ernst of Hohenberg]] were arrested in [[Vienna]] by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]] where they remained throughout Nazi rule.

After the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] in 1940, the family left the French capital and fled to Portugal with a visa issued by [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], the Portuguese consul in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sousamendesfoundation.org/habsburg/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102223958/http://sousamendesfoundation.org/habsburg/ |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his own safety, Otto left the European continent for the [[United States]] and lived from 1940 to 1944 in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1941, Hitler personally revoked the citizenship of Otto, his mother and his siblings, and the imperial-royal family found themselves [[statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Baier, [[Eva Demmerle]]: Otto von Habsburg. Die Biografie. Amalthea, Wien 2002, {{ISBN|3-85002-486-5}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his wartime exile in the United States, Otto and his younger brothers were in direct contact with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the federal government. His efforts to create an "Austrian Battalion" in the [[United States Army]] were delayed and never implemented. However, he successfully convinced the U.S. to halt or limit the bombardment of Austrian cities, especially the capital, Vienna,&lt;ref name="newser" /&gt; which were consequently delayed by high-ranking commanding personnel; bombardments on Vienna began later in the war (1943). Otto tried hard to set symbolic steps for the will of Austria and Austrians to be free, independent and democratic; he expressed concern that after the war, Austria was in danger of becoming a Soviet satellite state. Otto was commonly known in the U.S. as "Otto of Austria", trying to keep Austria and its neighbors in the minds of the American people via starting a series of stamps (the Overrun Countries series) containing the German-occupied nations of Europe.

He obtained the support of [[Winston Churchill]] for a conservative "Danube Federation", in effect a restoration of Austria-Hungary, but [[Joseph Stalin]] put an end to these plans.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; He lobbied for the recognition of an Austrian government-in-exile, for the rights of the German-speaking population of [[South Tyrol]], against the deportation of the German-speaking inhabitants of [[Bohemia]] and eastern Europe, and against letting Stalin rule Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945v03/d382|title=Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1945, European Advisory Commission, Austria, Germany, Volume III - Office of the Historian|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.die-tagespost.de/Sie-nannten-ihn-bdquo-Otto-von-Europa-ldquo-;art456,125800 |title=Sie nannten ihn 'Otto von Europa' |publisher=Die-tagespost.de |accessdate=8 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707111449/http://www.die-tagespost.de/Sie-nannten-ihn-bdquo-Otto-von-Europa-ldquo-;art456,125800 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War II==
At the end of the war, Otto returned to Europe and lived for some years in France and Spain.

In 1949, he ennobled several people, granting them Austrian noble titles, although not recognized by the Austrian republic.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As he did not possess a passport and was effectively stateless, he was given a passport of the Principality of Monaco, thanks to the intervention of [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1946. As a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Malta]], the order also issued him a [[diplomatic passport]]. Later, he was also issued with a Spanish diplomatic passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathweb.at/site/nachrichten/database/40510.html|title=Kathpress - Katholische Presseagentur Österreich|first=|last=Kathpress|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 1956, Otto was recognized as an Austrian citizen by the provincial government of [[Lower Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Meidl: Monarch. A Life for Europe – Republican Recognition in Black and Yellow.  "Ottos Anwalt verfassten Text vom 21. Februar 1958, in dem es heißt: "Um in meine Heimat zurückkehren zu können, erkläre ich im eigenen Namen und im Namen meiner Gemahlin und meiner minderjährigen Kinder als österreichischer Staatsbürger, die derzeit in Österreich geltenden Gesetze anzuerkennen und mich als getreuer Bürger der Republik zu bekennen."

However, this only entitled him to a passport "valid in every country but Austria".&lt;ref&gt;Gedenkdienst Archive Zur Geschichte der „Habsburger-Gesetze“ http://www.gedenkdienst.at/index.php?id=679&lt;/ref&gt; Otto had already submitted a written statement, on 21 February 1958, that he and his family would renounce all privileges to which a member of the House of Habsburg was formerly entitled, but this first declaration did not satisfy the requirements of the [[Habsburg Law]], which stated that Otto and other descendants of Charles could only return to Austria if they renounced all royal claims and accepted the status of private citizens. In 1961, Spanish [[caudillo]] Francisco Franco offered to make him king of Spain after his own death, which Otto declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/otto-von-habsburg-saw-end-empire-dead-98-144900184.html|title=Otto von Habsburg who saw end of empire dead at 98|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305150949/http://news.yahoo.com/otto-von-habsburg-saw-end-empire-dead-98-144900184.html|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rising|first1=David|title=Otto von Habsburg who saw end of empire dead at 98|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-otto-von-habsburg-who-saw-end-of-empire-dead-at-98-2011jul04-story.html|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=1 October 2017|language=English|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He officially declared his loyalty to the Republic of Austria on 5 June 1961, but this statement was ruled insufficient as well.

In a declaration dated 31 May 1961, Otto renounced all claims to the Austrian throne and proclaimed himself "a loyal citizen of the republic", "for purely practical reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd, pg. 181&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview on the occasion of his approaching 95th birthday, Otto stated:

{{cquote|''This was such an [[infamy]], I'd rather never have signed it. They demanded that I abstain from politics. I would not have dreamed of complying. Once you have tasted the opium of politics, you never get rid of it.''&lt;ref&gt;Die Presse, Unabhängige Tageszeitung für Österreich. 10–11 November 2007. pg. 3 (German online version dated 9 November 2007: [http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/342228/index.do]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5thDm1eNS?url=http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/342228/print.do WebCite archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Austrian administrative court found on 24 May 1963 that Otto's statement was sufficient to meet this requirement.  His wife and he were then issued a Certified Proof of Citizenship on 20 July 1965.  However, several elements in the country, particularly the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialists]], were ill-disposed to welcoming back the heir of the deposed dynasty. This touched off political infighting and civil unrest that almost precipitated a crisis of state, and later became known as the "Habsburg Crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mommsen-Reindl | first = Margarete | title = Die Österreichische Proporzdemokratie und der Fall Habsburg | publisher = Hermann Böhlaus Nachf. | series = Böhlaus zeitgeschichtliche Bibliothek | volume = 1 | location = Vienna | date = 1976 | isbn = 3205071263}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only on 1 June 1966, after the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] won an outright majority in the national election, that Otto was issued an Austrian passport, and was finally able to visit his home country again on 31 October 1966 for the first time in 48 years.

==Political career==
[[Image:Habsburgotto.jpg|thumb|left|Otto von Habsburg giving a speech]]

An early advocate of a [[European Integration|unified Europe]], Otto was president of the [[International Paneuropean Union]] from 1973 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Wilhelm Schwarzer|url=http://otto.twschwarzer.de/|title=Erzherzog Dr. Otto von Habsburg|publisher=Otto.twschwarzer.de|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served from 1979 until 1999 as a Member of the [[European Parliament]] for the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) party, eventually becoming the senior member of the European Parliament. He was also a member of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revoking the moral order: the ideology of positivism and the Vienna circle|last=Peterson|first=David|year=1999|publisher=Lexington Books|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a major supporter of the expansion of the [[European Union]] from the beginning and especially of the acceptance of Hungary, Slovenia and [[Croatia]]. During his time in the European Parliament, he was involved in a fracas with fellow [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Ian Paisley]], a [[British unionism|unionist]] Protestant pastor from [[Northern Ireland]].  In 1988, [[Pope John Paul II]] had just begun a speech to the Parliament when Paisley, a vehement [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], shouted that the Pope was the [[Antichrist]], and held up a poster reading "Pope John Paul II Antichrist". Otto snatched Paisley's banner and, along with other MEPs, ejected him from the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/death-of-former-kaiser-in-exile-and-last-heir-to-austro-hungarian-throne-1.591790|title=Death of former 'kaiser in exile' and last heir to Austro-Hungarian throne|work=The Irish Times|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the men instrumental in organising the so-called [[Pan-European Picnic]] at the Hungary-Austria border on 19 August 1989.&lt;ref name="euology"/&gt; This event is considered a milestone in the collapse of Communist dictatorships in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAj8wnwIL9MC&amp;pg=PA2 |title=Hunagrian spaces and places:patterns of transition|first1=Györgyi |last1=Barta|publisher=Hungarian Academy of Sciences|year=2005|isbn=963-9052-46-9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, he observed that, "The catastrophe of 11 September 2001 struck the United States more profoundly than any of us, whence a certain mutual incomprehension. Until then, the United States felt itself secure, persuaded of its power to bombard any enemy, without anyone being able to strike back. That sentiment vanished in an instant.

[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|300px|In this 1899 [[Udo Keppler]] cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', all of New York City politics revolves around boss [[Richard Croker]].]]

A '''political machine''' is a political group in which an authoritative boss or small group commands the support of a corps of supporters and businesses (usually [[Political campaign|campaign workers]]), who receive rewards for their efforts. The machine's power is based on the ability of the nuggets to [[get out the vote]] for their candidates on election day.

Although these elements are common to most political parties and organizations, they are essential to political machines, which rely on hierarchy and rewards for political power, often enforced by a strong [[Whip (politics)|party whip]] structure. Machines sometimes have a [[political boss]], often rely on [[patronage]], the [[spoils system]], "behind-the-scenes" control, and longstanding political ties within the structure of a [[representative democracy]]. Machines typically are organized on a permanent basis instead of a single election or event. The term may have a pejorative sense referring to corrupt political machines.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = political machine | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/467617/political-machine | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "political machine" dates back to the 20th century in the United States, where such organizations have existed in some municipalities and states since the 18th century. Similar machines have been described in [[Latin America]], where the system has been called ''[[:en:clientelism|clientelism]]'' or '''''political clientelism''''' (after the similar [[:Clientela|Clientela]] relationship in the [[Roman Republic]]), especially in rural areas, and also in some African states and other emerging democracies, like postcommunist Eastern European countries. Japan's [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] is often cited as another political machine, maintaining power in [[suburb]]an and [[rural]] areas through its control of farm bureaus and road construction agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The American Journey, Reconstruction to the Present |edition=Student | year = 2005 | publisher = Glencoe/McGraw-Hill | ISBN=0078609801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the word ''jiban'' (literally "base" or "foundation") is the word used for political machines.&lt;ref name=safire&gt;{{cite book | last = Safire |first= Nicole |title = Safire's Political Dictionary | pages = 391–392 | chapter = "Machine politics" | edition = First | year = 1978 |publisher = Random House}} (although the book existed in an earlier version titled "The New Language of Politics")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo0KAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22roman+republic%22+%22political+patronage%22&amp;dq=%22roman+republic%22+%22political+patronage%22&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 | title = Editorial Research Reports| publisher = Congressional Quarterly | year = 1973 |volume= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' defines "political machine" as, "in U.S. politics, a party organization, headed by a [[political boss|single boss]] or small autocratic group, that commands enough votes to maintain political and administrative control of a city, county, or state".&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; [[William Safire]], in his ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', defines "machine politics" as "the election of officials and the passage of legislation through the power of an organization created for political action".&lt;ref name=safire/&gt; He notes that the term is generally considered pejorative, often implying corruption.

Hierarchy and discipline are hallmarks of political machines. "It generally means strict organization", according to Safire.&lt;ref name=safire/&gt; Quoting [[Edward J. Flynn|Edward Flynn]], a [[Bronx County]] Democratic leader who ran the borough from 1922 until his death in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last  = Glazer |first = Nathan  |last2=Monyhan |first2=Daniel Patrick |title =Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York | chapter = The Irish | page = 226 |publisher = The MIT Press |year = 1963 |quote = Ed Flynn ran the Bronx from 1922 until his death in 1953.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote "[...] the so-called 'independent' voter is foolish to assume that a political machine is run solely on good will, or patronage. For it is not only a machine; it is an army. And in any organization as in any army, there must be discipline."&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

Political patronage, while often associated with political machines, is not essential to the definition for either Safire or ''Britannica.''&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

== Function ==
A political machine is a party organization that recruits its members by the use of tangible incentives—money, political jobs—and that is characterized by a high degree of leadership control over member activity.

Political machines started as [[grass roots]] organizations to gain the [[patronage]] needed to win the modern election. Having strong patronage, these "clubs" were the main driving force in gaining and getting out the "straight party vote" in the election districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James Q. |last = Wilson | authorlink =  James Q. Wilson | title = [[American Government]] | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==
[[File:Boss tweed.jpg|right|thumb|1869 tobacco label featuring [[William M. Tweed]], 19th-century political boss of New York City]]

In the late 19th century, large cities in the United States—[[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]—were accused of using political machines.&lt;ref name=americans&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Americans: Reconstruction to the 21st Century: California Teacher's Edition |location=Evanston |publisher=McDougall Littell Inc |year=2006 |pages=267–268 |isbn= 978-0618184163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time "cities experienced rapid growth under inefficient government".&lt;ref name=americans/&gt; Each city's machine lived under a hierarchical system with a [[political boss|"boss"]] who held the allegiance of local business leaders, [[elected officials]] and their appointees, and who knew the proverbial buttons to push to get things done. Benefits and problems both resulted from the rule of political machines.&lt;ref name=Blumer&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=20 |year = 1914–1915|quote=The political machine is in fact an attempt to maintain, inside the formal administrative organization of the city, the control of a primary group. |page=603 |first=Herbert |last=Blumer | jstor = 2763406 | title = The City: Suggestions for the Investigation of Human Behavior in the City Environment | doi = 10.1086/212433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosnell&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/000271623316900104 |title=The Political Party versus the Political Machine |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |first=Harold F. |last=Gosnell |volume=169 |date=September 1933 |pages=21–28 |quote=When the spoils element is predominant in a political organization, it is called a political machine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system of political control—known as "[[bossism]]"—emerged particularly in the [[Gilded Age]]. A single powerful figure (the boss) was at the center and was bound together to a complex organization of lesser figures (the political machine) by reciprocity in promoting financial and social self-interest. One of the most infamous of these political machines was [[Tammany Hall]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] machine that played a major role in controlling [[New York City]] and New York politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. From 1872, Tammany had an Irish "boss". However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and political corruption, perhaps most notoriously under [[William M. Tweed|William M. "Boss" Tweed]] in the mid-19th century.

[[Lord Bryce]] describes these political bosses saying:

{{quote|An army led by a council seldom conquers: It must have a commander-in-chief, who settles disputes, decides in emergencies, inspires fear or attachment. The head of the Ring is such a commander. He dispenses places, rewards the loyal, punishes the mutinous, concocts schemes, negotiates treaties. He generally avoids publicity, preferring the substance to the pomp of power, and is all the more dangerous because he sits, like a spider, hidden in the midst of his web. He is a Boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | work = Digital History | title = Urban Political Machines | url = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/us28.cfm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080821152014/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/us28.cfm | archivedate = 2008-08-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked if he was a boss, [[James Pendergast]] said simply,

{{quote|I've been called a boss. All there is to it is having friends, doing things for people, and then later on they'll do things for you... You can't coerce people into doing things for you—you can't make them vote for you. I never coerced anybody in my life. Wherever you see a man bulldozing anybody he don't last long.&lt;ref name=americans/&gt;}}

[[Theodore Roosevelt]], before he became president in 1901, was deeply involved in New York City politics. He explains how the machine worked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The organization of a party in our city is really much like that of an army. There is one great central boss, assisted by some trusted and able lieutenants; these communicate with the different district bosses, whom they alternately bully and assist. The district boss in turn has a number of half-subordinates, half-allies, under him; these latter choose the captains of the election districts, etc., and come into contact with the common heelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore Roosevelt|title=The Works of Theodore Roosevelt: American ideals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqo3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA132|year=1897|publisher=Collier|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Voting strategy===
Many machines formed in cities to serve immigrants to the U.S. in the late 19th century who viewed machines as a vehicle for political [[enfranchisement]]. Machine workers helped win elections by turning out large numbers of voters on election day.  It was in the machine's interests to only maintain a minimally winning amount of support. Once they were in the majority and could count on a win, there was less need to recruit new members, as this only meant a thinner spread of the patronage rewards to be spread among the party members.  As such, later-arriving immigrants, such as Jews, Italians, and other immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe between the 1880s and 1910s, saw fewer rewards from the machine system than the well-established Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven P. Erie|title=Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, 1840-1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxrGXFRlbWgC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1990|publisher=U of California Press|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the machines' staunchest opponents were members of the middle class, who were shocked at the malfeasance and did not need the financial help.&lt;ref&gt;Ari A. Hoogenboom, "An Analysis of Civil Service Reformers". ''Historian'' 23#1 (1960): 54–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corruption of [[urban politics in the United States]] was denounced by private citizens. They achieved national and state civil-service reform and worked to replace local patronage systems with [[civil service]]. By [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s time, the [[Progressive Era]] mobilized millions of private citizens to vote against the machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruhil | first1 = Anirudh V.S. | year = 2003 | title = Urban Armageddon or politics as usual? The case of municipal civil service reform | url = | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1111/1540-5907.00011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, [[James A. Farley]] was the chief dispenser of the Democratic Party's patronage system through the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] and the [[Works Progress Administration]] which eventually nationalized many of the job benefits machines provided. The [[New Deal]] allowed machines to recruit for the WPA and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], making Farley's machine the most powerful. All patronage was screened through Farley, including presidential appointments. The [[New Deal]] machine fell apart after he left the administration over the third term in 1940. Those agencies were abolished in 1943 and the machines suddenly lost much of their patronage. The formerly poor immigrants who had benefited under Farley's national machine had become assimilated and prosperous and no longer needed the informal or extralegal aides provided by machines.&lt;ref name=sv;av /&gt; In the 1940s most of the big city machines collapsed, with the exception of Chicago.&lt;ref name=sv;av&gt;{{citation | title = Political Machines | url = http://autocww.colorado.edu/~toldy2/E64ContentFiles/PoliticsAndGovernment/PoliticalMachines.htm | publisher = University of Colorado, Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local political machine in [[Tennessee]] was forcibly removed in what was known as the [[Battle of Athens (1946)|1946 Battle of Athens]].

&lt;!-- Sentence needs breaking up and citations --&gt;
Smaller communities such as [[Parma, Ohio]], in the post–Cold War Era under Prosecutor Bill Mason's "Good Old Boys" and especially communities in the Deep South, where small-town machine politics are relatively common, also feature what might be classified as political machines, although these organizations do not have the power and influence of the larger boss networks listed in this article. For example, the "Cracker Party" was a Democratic Party political machine that dominated city politics in [[Augusta, Georgia]], for over half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/110799/opi_124-1871.shtml | title = Newspapers helped end long rule of corrupt Cracker Party | date = August 29, 2010 | newspaper = The Augusta Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://search.augusta.com/fast-elements.php?type=standard&amp;profile=augustachronicle&amp;querystring=%22cracker+party%22&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go | title = Search results for 'Cracker Party' | accessdate = 13 November 2012 | newspaper = The Augusta Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide14.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212142225/http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide14.html |archivedate=February 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-955 | title = Cites &amp; Counties: Augusta | publisher = The New Georgia Encyclopedia | first = Edward J. |last = Cashin | date = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324073605/http://www.augusta.com/leaders/slideshow_local/slide10.html |archivedate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political machines also thrive on Native American reservations, where the veil of sovereignty is used as a shield against federal and state laws against the practice.&lt;ref name=bbf926&gt;Fink, James (September 26, 2016).

==Evaluation==
The phrase is considered derogatory "because it suggests that the interest of the organization are placed before those of the general public", according to Safire. Machines are criticized as undemocratic and inevitably encouraging corruption.&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

Since the 1960s, some historians have reevaluated political machines, considering them corrupt but efficient. Machines were undemocratic but responsive. They were also able to contain the spending demands of special interests. In ''Mayors and Money'', a comparison of municipal government in Chicago and New York, [[Ester R. Fuchs]] credited the [[Cook County Democratic Organization]] with giving Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] the political power to deny [[labor union]] contracts that the city could not afford and to make the state government assume burdensome costs like [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and courts. Describing New York, Fuchs wrote, "New York got reform, but it never got good government." At the same time, as Dennis R. Judd and Todd Swanstrom suggest in ''City Politics'' that this view accompanied the common belief that there were no viable alternatives. They go on to point out that this is a falsehood, since there are certainly examples of reform oriented, anti-machine leaders during this time.

In his mid-2016 article "How American Politics Went Insane" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Jonathan Rauch]] argued that the political machines of the past had flaws but provided better governance than the alternatives. He wrote that political machines created positive incentives for politicians to work together and compromise – as opposed to pursuing "naked self-interest" the whole time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/|title=How American Politics Went Insane|author=[[Jonathan Rauch]]|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=June 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Professional Regulation Commission''', ({{lang-fil|Komisyon sa Regulasyon ng mga Propesyon}}) otherwise known as the '''PRC''', is a three-man commission attached to [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] (DOLE). Its mandate is to regulate and supervise the practice of the professionals (except lawyers, who are handled by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]) who constitute the highly skilled manpower of the country. As the agency-in-charge of the professional sector, the PRC plays a strategic role in developing the corps of professionals for industry, commerce, governance, and the economy.

==Short history==
The Commission was created with the signing of [[Presidential Decree]] No. 223 on June 22, 1973 by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. The first PRC Commissioner, Architect Eric C. Nubla assumed office on January 2, 1974. 

The PRC Coat-of-Arms designed by the Heraldry Commission was officially adopted on February 1, 1974. The Commission made its offices at the burned Civil Service Commission building at P. Paredes Street in Manila. The structure later became the PRC Main Building. The PRC began issuing certificates of registration in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] with English translation. Proclamation No. 1276 is issued declaring June 22 to 29 of 1974 as "Professional Consciousness Week."

1974 also saw the computerization of the database of registered professionals with the assistance of the National Computer Center. The Implementing Rules and Regulations of P.D. 223 are promulgated on December 9 of that year.

In 1975, PRC began issuing computer-printed registration cards with one-year validity. PRC starts accrediting professional organizations.

1986 saw the Hon. Julio B. Francia assume office as Commission Chairman and launch drive against graft and corruption. During his term the Chairman &amp; a member of the Board for Deck Officers were caught to be checking wrong answers (273 examinees from Master to Third Mate)resulting in their termination as Board Members and suspension of examination for two years for the 273 whose answer sheets were marked.

In 1992, Atty. Hermogenes P. Pobre|Hermogenes P. Pobre assumes office as third Commission Chairman. 

The PRC Vision and Mission is adopted during the Annual Planning Conference in 1998. 

In 1999 the commission was formally awarded [[ISO 9002]] certification by the Anglo-Japanese-American Environmental Quality and Safety Certification Services for the licensing and certification of marine deck and engineer officers.

2001 saw Commissioner Alfonso G. Abad assume office as Acting Chairman in February. The Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 8981 are adopted on February 15. Hon. Antonieta Fortuna-Ibe assumed office as the first lady Chairperson on August 1.

Former [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] Justice Nicolas P. Lapeña Jr formally assumed office on August 26, 2008, as Chairman of the PRC succeeding Dr. Leonor T. Rosero, who finished her term last July. He joins incumbent PRC Commissioners Nilo L. Rosas and Ruth Raña Padilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/116148/Former-CA-justice-is-new-PRC-chief|title=Former CA justice is new PRC chief|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Without finishing his term, Chairman Nicolas P. Lapeña Jr. retired on December 31, 2010. Commissioner Antonio S. Adriano assumed as Officer-in-Charge from January 1 to 9, 2011. Atty.Teresita R. Manzala assumed office as the new PRC Chairperson on January 10, 2010. The New Chairperson joins Commissioner Alfredo Y. Po and Commissioner Jennifer J. Manalili, who replaces Commissioner Nilo L. Rosas and Commissioner Antonio S. Adriano, respectively.

{{History of Sudan}}
The '''Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation''' ('''RCCNS-Sudan''') was the governing body of [[Sudan]] following the [[1989 Sudanese coup d'état|June 1989 coup]].&lt;ref name="Cowell"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/world/military-coup-in-sudan-ousts-civilian-regime.html|title=Military Coup In Sudan Ousts Civilian Regime|last=Cowell|first=Alan|date=July 1, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew out of the collaboration between the Sudanese military and the [[National Islamic Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyYuzczwY94C&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Revolutionary+Command+Council+for+National+Salvation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic6_nJspzSAhUn_IMKHdY_Cu0Q6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Revolutionary%20Command%20Council%20for%20National%20Salvation&amp;f=false|title=In Whose Image?

Gen. [[Omar Al-Bashir|Omar al-Bashir]] exercised power.

Al-Bashir was the Chair of the Council, as well as Prime Minister, Defense Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="Cowell"/&gt; The rest of the council consisted of fourteen military officers, all of whom were involved in and associated with the coup.&lt;ref name ="Burr and Collins"/&gt;{{rp|p. 2}} Therefore, no regulations about the selection and tenure of its members were declared to the public.

The RCCNS exercised legislative as well as some executive authority.  It appointed committees to draft various legal decrees. The RCCNS did not publish any rules of procedures over its deliberations.

It banned political activity, arrested opposition members and closed down newspapers.

The RCCNS dissolved itself in October 1993, and its powers devolved to the [[List of heads of state of Sudan|President]] and the [[National Legislature (Sudan)|National Legislature of Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa|publisher=Westview Press|year=1995|isbn=0813321263|editor-last=Long|editor-first=David|location=|pages=344|quote=|editor-last2=Reich|editor-first2=Bernard|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a majority of the power remaining with President al-Bashir.&lt;ref name ="Burr and Collins"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySUK3qoP-bsC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=members+of+the+Revolutionary+National+Command+Council+for+National+Salvation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BBG9dZcGUw&amp;sig=-ypU5jCn717ByuHhY9WxnJ9Akms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9g5vou5zSAhVF6IMKHfvSAko4ChDoAQgtMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Revolutionary%20Command%20Council&amp;f=false|title=Revolutionary Sudan: Hasan Al-Turabi and the Islamist State, 1989-2000|last=Burr|first=J.

A '''royal charter''' is a formal document issued by a monarch as [[letters patent]], granting a right or power to an individual or a [[body corporate]]. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with [[municipal charter]]s) or universities and [[Learned society|learned societies]]. Charters should be distinguished from [[warrant (law)|warrants]] and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of [[calligraphy]] on [[vellum]]. The British monarchy [[List of organisations in the United Kingdom with a royal charter|has issued over 980 royal charters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/royal-charters/chartered-bodies/ Chartered bodies | Privy Council]. Privycouncil.independent.gov.uk. Retrieved 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of [[Tain]] in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British [[The Crown|Crown]], a recent example being that awarded to [[The Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors]], in 2014.

Charters have been used in [[medieval Europe|Europe since medieval times]] to create cities (that is, localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter is granted is considered to be when a city is 'founded', regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled (which is often impossible to determine).

At one time, a royal charter was the sole means by which an [[body corporate|incorporated body]] could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for [[limited company|limited companies]]) are generally used nowadays instead.

Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the [[Merchants of the Staple|Company of Merchants of the Staple of England]] (13th Century), the [[British East India Company]] (1600), the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[Standard Chartered]], the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company]] (P&amp;O), the [[British South Africa Company]], and some of the [[British colonization of the Americas|former British colonies on the North American mainland]], [[Livery companies|City livery companies]], the [[Bank of England]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/governance/regulatory_framework/charter_agreement.html/ BBC Trust | Charter and Agreement].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
The royal decree is the equivalent in [[Belgium]] of a Royal Charter. In the period before 1958, 32 higher education institutes had been created by royal charter. These were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1503327 Non-University Higher Technical Education in Belgium] Gilbert Van Vaek and Henk Van Daele&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several non-technical higher education institutions have been founded, or refounded, under royal decree:
* [[Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique]], National Fund for Scientific Research, 1928&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hridir.org/countries/belgium/index.htm Gilbert Van Vaek and Henk Van Daele] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723172558/http://www.hridir.org/countries/belgium/index.htm |date=23 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten]], 1938&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcgeschiedenis.be/eng/histoire/histoire.html Belgium Royal Historical Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213101738/http://www.kcgeschiedenis.be/eng/histoire/histoire.html |date=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Institute for Research and Education]], 1982

Since [[State reform in Belgium#1988-1989: The third state reform|the Belgian state reform of 1988–1989]], competency over education was transferred to the federated entities of Belgium. Royal decrees can therefore no longer grant higher education institution status or university status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hogeronderwijsregister.be/faq/117/56] When is an institution considered a recognised higher education institution or a university?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[File:hudsonsbayco.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] building in [[Montreal]]]]
A Royal Charter is granted by [[Order in Council]], either creating an incorporated body, or giving an existent one special status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page26.asp|title=Royal Charter|author=|date=|website=www.privy-council.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative]], and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organisations under Royal Charters. Such organisations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities. Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.

Application for a charter is a petition to the [[Queen-in-Council]]. To receive a Royal Charter, the organisation must have corporate members who have at least first degree level in a relevant field, consist of 5,000 members or more, be financially sound, and it must be in the public interest to regulate the institution under a charter. However, meeting these benchmarks does not guarantee the issuance of a Royal Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page26.asp|title=Royal Charter|author=|date=|website=www.privy-council.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territories and communities===
Cities under Royal Charter are not subject to municipal Acts of Parliament applied generally to other municipalities, and instead are governed by legislation applicable to each city individually. The Royal Charter codifies the laws applied to the particular city, and lays out the powers and responsibilities not given to other municipalities in the province concerned.

A Royal Charter is the mechanism by which a British town is raised to the status of [[Cities of the United Kingdom|city]]. Most recently [[Chelmsford]] in [[Essex]] was granted a Royal Charter in celebration of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] in 2012. [[Inverness]], [[Brighton &amp; Hove]] and [[Wolverhampton, England|Wolverhampton]] were given their charters to celebrate the Millennium, and [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Stirling, Scotland|Stirling]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Lisburn]] and [[Newry]] to celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee of]] [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 2002.

Most [[British university|British universities]] operate under Royal Charters, giving them the authority to award degrees. The most recent generation of UK universities were granted the power to award degrees by the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] instead of by Royal Charter, while some other universities operate under [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]. The [[University of Buckingham]], [[The University of Law]] are the only private higher education institutions to have received a Royal Charter.&lt;ref&gt;BPP University College appears on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills List of Recognised Bodies (those institutions or bodies, including universities, which have their own UK degree awarding powers (see [http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/higher-education/recognised-uk-degrees/recognised-bodies BIS Recognised Bodies]) but does not appear among the 987 bodies listed on the [[Privy Council]]'s website as holders of Royal Charters (see [http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/royal-charters/chartered-bodies/ Privy Council Office – Chartered Bodies]).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of English public schools such as [[Harrow School]], [[Roedean School|Roedean School for Girls]] and [[Malvern College]] have received Royal Charters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fluencycontent-schoolwebsite.netdna-ssl.com/FileCluster/Roedean/MainFolder/Documents/Old-Roedeanians/Certified-copy-Royal-Charter-and-Bye-Laws---01-09-11.pdf|title=Roedean School - Royal Charter &amp; By Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost without exception, the longstanding learned societies, such as the [[Royal Society]], the [[Royal Society of Literature]], and the [[Royal Medical Society]] have Royal Charters.

Most new grants of Royal Charters these days are reserved for eminent [[British professional bodies|professional institutions]], [[Learned society|learned societies]], or charities, which have a solid record of achievement and are financially stable.&lt;ref name=privy /&gt; Though a royal charter is not necessary for them to incorporate or operate, it is often sought as recognition of "pre-eminence, stability and permanence" in representing their field of activity. For example, the five accountancy institutes which make up the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]] each have a Royal Charter which allows their qualified members to style themselves ''[[Chartered Accountants]]''.

The [[BBC]] operates under a Royal Charter which lasts for a period of ten years, after which it is renewed.

A Royal Charter changes a body from a collection of individuals into a single legal entity. Once incorporated by Royal Charter, amendments to the Charter and by-laws require government approval.&lt;ref name=privy /&gt;

In January 2007, the UK Trade Marks Registry refused to grant protection to the American [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] trademark, as the word "chartered" in the UK is associated with royal charters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/o31506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Although several American universities which predate the [[American Revolution]] purport to hold royal charters, in a number of cases they were in fact created by a grant from a local council such as a colonial legislature.

Colleges created by royal charter from [[William III of England|King William III and Queen Mary II]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]]:
* [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] 1693 – (created by [[Letters Patent]])

Colleges created by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]:
* [[Columbia University]] 1754 as King's College – (probably created by [[Letters Patent]])

American colleges popularly believed to have been established by Royal Charter, but actually by some other type of grant:
* [[Harvard College]] 1639 – By Act of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
* [[Yale University]] 1701 – as Collegiate School by Act of the General Assembly of Connecticut
* [[Princeton University]] 1746 – as College of New Jersey by the letters patent from [[George II of the United Kingdom|King George II]] via the Governor of the Province of New Jersey
* [[Brown University]] 1764 – as College of Rhode Island by an Act of the Governor and General Assembly of the English Colony of Rhode Island
* [[Rutgers University]] 1766 – as Queen's College by letters patent from [[George II of the United Kingdom|King George II]] via Governor [[William Franklin]] of the Province of New Jersey
* [[Dartmouth College]] 1769 – by Letters Patent from [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] via the Governor of the province of New Hampshire.

The distinction between the Letters Patent forming Dartmouth, Princeton, and Rutgers versus those documents founding William &amp; Mary or King's College (Columbia University) is that the seal of the Province of New Hampshire appears on Dartmouth College's charter and that the seal of the Province of New Jersey appears on Princeton University's and Rutgers University's charters while the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] appears on the College of William and Mary and King's College documents.

The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was created by royal charter.

[[File:west of scotland2.png|thumb|right|450px|Map showing the International Council for Exploration of the Sea area VIa which effectively delimits waters west of Scotland]]

It is a central tenet of the EU maritime policy&lt;ref name=eumarpol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/ |title=EU maritime policy web-site |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries]]) that all seas have a particular nature, defined by their geography, their ecology, their economies and their people. Most seas are nested (e.g. Atlantic Ocean, [[Irish Sea]], [[Morecambe Bay]]) and do not, except for specific purposes such as hydrography or fisheries management, have sharp, recognised boundaries. One important sea for purposes of [[fisheries management]] is referred to{{by whom|date=May 2014}} as the "seas West of Scotland". In line with the EU maritime policy,&lt;ref name=eumarpol/&gt; the sea does not only encompass the waters but also the people and economy of the areas bordering that sea.

==Extent==
The entirety of the area has no specific name. It encompasses several [[marginal sea]]s including the [[Malin Sea]], the [[Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland]], and the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]. It can be considered largely as the International Council for Exploration of the Sea&lt;ref name=ices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ices.dk/ |title=International Council for Exploration of the Sea |publisher=Ices.dk |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; area VIa whose easternmost boundary is nearly halfway between [[Cape Wrath]] and the [[Pentland Firth]] and whose southern extent to the west is in [[Donegal Bay]]. The border with the [[Irish Sea]] is at the level of Stranraer. The countries bordering these waters are Ireland, Northern Ireland and [[Scotland]]. As far as the EU's Marine Framework Strategy Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/marine/index_en.htm |title=Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned the sea is part of the Celtic Seas. These should not to be confused with the [[Celtic Sea]] which is further south.

==Governance==
[[File:Scottish waters.png|thumb|right|150px|Map showing governance in UK part of seas west of Scotland. This map was originally produced by [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]] in preparing for the UK Marine and Coastal Access Act]] 
The UK's new [[Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009|Marine and Coastal Access Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/legislation/index.htm |title=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs website page on Marine and Coastal Access Act |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will have limited direct influence on the waters west of Scotland because they are under the jurisdiction of the devolved administrations of Scotland and Northern Ireland ([[The Scottish Executive]] introduced a Bill to their Parliament in April 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/25-MarineScot/index.htm |title=A Bill to make provision in relation to functions and activities in the Scottish marine area, including provision about marine plans, licensing of marine activities and the protection of the area and its wildlife including seals; and for connected purposes |publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one should be introduced to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2012. However the Scottish and Northern Ireland governments are collaborating on a "marine policy statement" which is the first stage in marine planning. The objective is to complete all the consultations in time to have a Statement in place by November 2011.

==People==

[[File:west of scotland population.png|thumb|right|250px|Map population density in area West of Scotland (data from Lanscan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/ |title=worldwide population database compiled on a 30" X 30" latitude/longitude grid |publisher=Ornl.gov |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)]]

Most of the Scottish coast has a very low population. The significant exception is the Firth of Clyde and the river Clyde which is in the South West Scotland Region. This is navigable to Glasgow which is the heartland of industrial Scotland and was for a time world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. Greater Glasgow has a population of 1,200,000. 
The main coastal town of Northern Ireland bordering this sea is [[Derry]] which is on the northern coast and has a population of 237,000. [[County Donegal]] had a total population of 137,575 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irelandinformationguide.com/County_Donegal]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belfast]], a major port and historic shipbuilding centre, is larger but is considered to be facing the [[Irish Sea]].
 
The west of Scotland population is small in absolute terms and, other than Glasgow and its hinterland, what the Scottish statistical office term "remote rural"  which means the people are greater than a 30-minute drive time to the nearest settlement with a population of 10,000 or more. We assume that this "remote rural" population can be used as a proxy for the coastal population. Neither the population as a whole nor the age distribution suggest that the population is declining.&lt;ref name="scotstats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/27154843/0 |title=Rural Scotland Key Facts 2008 People and Communities, Services and Lifestyle, Economy and Enterprise |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a deficit compared to the rest of Scotland in the 20–30 age group and a smaller one in the 30–40 group but, for school-age children and for those over 40 there is a net surplus. A possible explanation is that Scots leave rural areas for higher education and first job experience but these movements are compensated by English people in their 40s arriving to raise a family in wholesome surroundings. The proportion of inhabitants born in other parts of the UK is double that for Scotland as a whole.

==Language==

The coastline is part of the Celtic fringe. Gaelic is spoken as a minority language in many parts of the area with strongholds in the Outer Hebrides and Tyrconnel in Donegal. [[Scottish Gaelic]] is declining in Scotland although the compulsory teaching of the Irish language in Irish schools means that most Irish citizens understand it to some extent. The variant of Gaelic spoken in [[Donegal]] is distinctive, and shares traits with Scottish Gaelic. Its [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish speaking area) uses the West Ulster dialect. [[Inishowen]], which lost its Gaeltacht areas in the early 20th century, used the East Ulster dialect.

==Fisheries==
===Sea fisheries===
For the UK fleet as a whole, over the past 15 years there has been a sharp decline in [[Demersal fish|demersal]] fishing, a fluctuating but relatively stationary situation for [[pelagic fish]] and an increase in [[Norway lobster]] (nephrops) fisheries. Since most of the pelagic and demersal fishing is carried out by [[Fishing in the North Sea|North Sea]]-based vessels, it is the nephrops fishery that dominates the fisheries economy for ports facing the west of Scotland waters.

A number of alterations and new regulations were introduced to the UK and Scottish fisheries management regime in 2009 including a reduction in days at sea allocations, the Conservation Credits Scheme and the West of Scotland Management Measures. Interim measures were introduced between February and April, with the new schemes fully implemented from May onwards.
Skippers interviewed in a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seafish.org/pdf.pl?file=seafish/Documents/SR626_UKFleet_Financial_2009_MidYearReview.pdf |title=UK Fleet Financial Performance 2009 Mid Year Review, Adam Brown, September 2009 |publisher=Seafish.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought that these restrictions did affect the way they fished and their costs. But these were not the major concern. Whitefish skippers were concerned about low quotas and low prices in equal measure. The nephrops skippers from the West of Scotland did not feel that quotas were a limiting factor but were very concerned with low prices. Although a minority thought the management measures affected prices, most admitted that the falling demand was mainly due to the recession and other forces affecting the market that are beyond the control of the Common Fisheries Policy.

Recovery is still some way off for the demersal fishery. Even with protective measures in place, cod is still being exploited through by-catches at a higher rate than recommended by scientists, haddock is being fished above the precautionary level and although the anglerfish is profitable, lack of scientific data means that the stock's [[ecological stability]] is unknown.

The nephrops fishery that has been growing in volume and value over the past five years to compensate for the declining whitefish. Fisheries scientists define the rate at which the stock is removed by fishing as the [[Fish mortality|fishing mortality]]. ICES&lt;ref name=ices/&gt; advise that the fishing mortality for nephrops should vary between F&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;. and F&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; which, for the stocks here, correspond to annual removal rates of 8.8% and 15.4% respectively. The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/governance/stecf_en.htm Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130031641/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/governance/stecf_en.htm |date=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (STECF) believe that this is too lax and that the target should be F&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;. Current exploitation rates are largely above F&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and therefore unsustainable. For 2009 the total allowable catch for regions VI and Vb was 18891 tonnes. STECF's advice in 2010 was to aim for lower catches.

Profitability in the fisheries sector is unlikely to come from greater volumes of landings in the foreseeable future. One can expect a pelagic catch that fluctuates about a mean at approximately today's level, little recovery in the demersal stocks and reduced nephrops landings.

===Aquaculture===
[[File:aq production percent scotland.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Production (mass of salmon and rainbow trout, number of smolts) expressed as percentage of 2008&lt;ref name="scotff"/&gt;]]

[[File:aq jobs scotland.jpg|thumb|right|180px|employment (full-time+part-time) for aquaculture in Scotland.&lt;ref name="scotff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlab.ac.uk/FRS.Web/Uploads/Documents/survey%20%202008version5.pdf |title=Scottish Fish Farms, Annual Production Survey 2008, Marine Scotland Science |publisher=Marlab.ac.uk |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers do not include processing]]

Scotland is the largest producer of farmed salmon in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/Fisheries/Fish-Shellfish |title=Scottish Government web-site, January 2010 |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the third largest producer in the world, behind Norway and Chile. Scotland is responsible for 80 per cent of UK aquaculture production.

In 2007 Scottish production of Atlantic salmon stood at 129,930 tonnes. This was followed by rainbow trout (7,414 tonnes), and smaller amounts of other species such as cod (1,111 tonnes), brown trout/sea trout (124 tonnes), halibut (147 tonnes) and Arctic charr (6.5 tonnes). The shellfish industry produced 4,850 tonnes of mussels; 3.5 million Pacific oysters; 283,000 Native oysters; 384,000 Queen scallops; and 60,000 King scallops. The aquaculture industry in Scotland is estimated to have a farm gate value of £346 million (2007). This includes £324 million for farmed salmon, about £14 million for rainbow trout, and around £5 million for shellfish. Brown trout, sea trout, halibut and Arctic charr are also farmed in Scotland.
Aquaculture has grown remarkably in the past years.

The Renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/272866/0081461.pdf A Fresh Start. The renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture] May 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7559-8019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to implement the main aims of the May 2009 Communication i.e. promote the competitiveness of the EU aquaculture sector, ensure the sustainability of the sector and improve both the sector's image and its governance framework.

===Wild salmon===

Wild [[Atlantic salmon|salmon]] are iconic creatures whose [[Fish migration|anadromous migrations]] require undisturbed pathways from highland streams to feeding grounds off Greenland. So their presence in Scottish rivers is not only a great tourist attraction but an indicator that conservation measures in all aquatic environments are working. This explains the general dismay at calamitous drops in returns to the rivers from the sea despite largely successful efforts at reducing fishing mortality through net bans and shorter recreational fishing seasons. It is generally accepted that the mortality is at sea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasco.int/pdf/media/2009%20Press%20Release.pdf |title=Press release – North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) 26th Annual meeting, Molde, Norway 2nd – 5th June 2009 |format=PDF |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the reason is still unknown. Several explanations have been postulated but none are totally convincing: influence of aquaculture through escape of farmed fish or transfer of parasites (although most salmon rivers flow to the east of Scotland and most aquaculture is to the west), global warming (although salmon populations have survived temperature changes as significant as the present ones) or catching at sea (although few salmon are found in nets). The three year, €5.5 million SALSEA-Merge research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasco.int/sas/salseamerge.htm |title=SALSEA-merge web-site |publisher=Nasco.int |date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the EU Framework Programme and partner organisations (the Total Foundation and the Atlantic Salmon Trust) is investigating this question.

==Renewable energy==

The waters west of Scotland are some of the most appropriate in Europe for offshore renewable energy: very strong winds, shallowish water and strong tides.

In 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/scottish-offshore-wind Crown estate web-site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420104441/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/scottish-offshore-wind |date=20 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consortia were awarded exclusive development rights over potential windfarm sites in Kintyre, Islay and the Arran Array for a total of 2.558GW over 524.98&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; allowing the project developers to commence with further site surveys and investigations prior to submitting consent applications. On 8 January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn10_004/pn10_004.aspx UK Department of Energy and Climate Change web-site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115141048/http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn10_004/pn10_004.aspx |date=15 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; new 'Round 3' were rights granted in 9 UK coastal zones with a potential for 6,400 additional turbines generating 32GW which far exceeds previous plans. None of these areas are in waters west of Scotland.

The long distance from potential consumers of electricity and the consequent power losses along long transmission lines are the major challenge. A recent report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ensg.gov.uk/assets/1696-01-ensg_vision2020.pdf Our Electricity Transmission Network: A Vision For 2020] A Report by the Electricity Networks Strategy Group, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; into the investment needs for meeting UK needs in 2020 suggested that an investment of €2.7 billion was needed and that 70% of this would be for transferring Scottish-generated power southwards.

The long sea lochs on Scotland's western coast might be suitable for storing energy.
 
Even onshore renewable energy has a maritime aspect. Plans to build an onshore wind farm on the Isle of Lewis will require undersea cabling. These may cross marine protected areas and will therefore be subject to planning and licensing constraints.

==Ferries==

Transport to the islands in the waters west of Scotland is largely assured by a ferry service that is run by [[Caledonian MacBrayne|CalMac Ltd]] which serves 26 routes. In 2006, it transported 5,3 million passengers, 1,1 million cars, 94 000 commercial vehicles and 14 000 coaches on these routes. The company is owned by the Scottish Executive and receives a subsidy of around £45 million a year to offer a lifeline service. In 2009 the European Commission found&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union (2008/C 126/07)&lt;/ref&gt; that, with the exception of the Gourock-Dunoon ferry, these subsidies did not break state aid rules . A review of the services was undertaken in 2009 with a view to providing a ferry service that will achieve more balanced growth across Scotland, to give the most remote areas of Scotland the chance to contribute to, and benefit from, sustainable economic growth and therefore give them the chance to succeed. So far no reports have neen made public.

'''Swayne, Robinson and Company''' also known as "Swayne, Robinson &amp; Co." or simple "Swayne, Robinson" was an iron and aluminum casting factory founded in 1842 by Francis W. Robinson. The company operated until 1997, when it closed and its owners filed for bankruptcy. The building was located at 214 East Main Street [[Richmond, Indiana]] until 2001. A fire in 1999 destroyed a third of the building. It is the current site of the Wayne County Jail. Until it closed, it was the oldest family-owned business in America.

==History==

===1800s===
Swayne, Robinson and Company was founded in 1842 by Francis W. Robinson when Robinson had bought out their competitor, Edward Borton &amp; Son,&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/swayne-robinson.pdf|title=Swayne Robinson &amp; Company|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name F.W. Robinsons.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrl.lib.in.us/history/business/swaynerobin.htm |title=Swayne, Robinson and Co |publisher=Morrisson-Reeves Library |accessdate=2012-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192511/http://mrl.lib.in.us/history/business/swaynerobin.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company made farm equipment which Robinson had grown an interest in and wanted to make an effort in helping decrease waste and increase farm profits. It would manufacture "traveling separators" which allowed farmers to collect more grain per field. By 1860, the company not only manufactured separators but began producing portable steam engines with several patents.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; In 1866, Robinson's son, Henry, would join the company&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt; and Henry, his son-in-law and Robinson's son-in-law, Samuel E. Swayne, who served as a secretary, would buy out the parties in the company and in 1872 would change their name to Robinson Machine Works. The company began manufacturing steam-engine governor, a straw stacker, and a clover-gathering attachment in the 1880s&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; and in 1889 they incorporated as Robinson and Company. Upon his father's death in 1897, Henry would become president of the company.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

===Early 1900s===
In 1909, upon Henry Robinson's death, Samuel Swayne became president of the company&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; and in 1912 the company had expanded three city blocks in four buildings and had branches in Indianapolis, Columbus and St. Louis, as well as several other states across the Midwest and the South. While most of the company's sales percentages came from the Midwest most of the products could be found in India, Africa, the Dutch East Indies, and Argentina.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; In 1914, the company would again change its name to Swayne, Robinson and Company&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; to reflect the work done by Swayne.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; During World War I, the company began to manufacture lawn mower castings to compete with companies like John Deere and International Harvester, for the local lawn manufacturer, Dille &amp; McGuire and F &amp; N Lawn Mowers. The company began making pieces for the [[Starr Piano Company]] as well.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; In 1933, Henry R. Robinson would take over as president of the company after the death of Samuel Swayne.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; During World War II, the company switched to producing war materials, in particular piston ring castings and parts for the manufacture of bombs. Due to the post-war economic boom, this created a huge demand for new parts for new products. In 1946, Charles K. Robinson took over the company after the death of Henry R. Robinson.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

===Late 1900s===
At the end of World War II, the company once again switched production to auto manufacturing and by the mid-fifties at least twenty percent of American made cars included parts from the company. The company soon began to experience declines in sales, and began focusing on iron casting for other companies, including boat anchors, transmission parts, gears, and pulley parts.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Unable to compete, the company in July 1997&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; filed for bankruptcy&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/ifa/brownfields/files/Swayne_Robinson_Richmond.pdf|title=Site Highlight - New Jail Opens on Former Brownfield Site in Richmond|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed its doors putting an end to the 155-year-old family run business,&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; making it the longest family-owned business in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waynet.org/facts/history_dates.htm |title=Date Synopsis for the History of Wayne County, Indiana |publisher=Waynet.org |date=1948-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire and fate of Swayne, Robinson==
On March 17, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waynet.org/waynet/homepage_images/1999/99march.htm |title=March 1999 Home Page Pictures |publisher=Waynet.org |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly two years after the company closed,&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt; a fire engulfed the northwest corner of the building by Main Street and Third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrlinfo.org/history/bicentimeline/businesses.htm |title=Richmond Businesses |publisher=Morrisson-Reeves Library |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although abandoned, the factory still contained several unknown canisters of liquid within it,&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt; and as the building burned, several of these canisters exploded, causing the foundation to crack and the roof to collapse in on itself. Afterwards, in June 2000, the county purchased the property and, after environmental test on the grounds,&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; began construction in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waynet.org/waynet/spotlight/2001/010108-swayne-robinson-removal.htm |title=Removal of the remains of the Swayne-Robinson Foundry in Richmond, Indiana |publisher=Waynet.org |date=2001-01-04 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Wayne County Sheriff's Office and Correctional Center, which opened in 2004.&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt;

'''''The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change?'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-226-72703-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;was written by [[Gerald N. Rosenberg]] and published in 1991. A highly controversial work, it produced labels ranging from "revolutionary" to "insulting." A Second Edition of the book was published in 2008 by the [[University of Chicago Press]] ({{ISBN|9780226726717}}).

==Basic thesis and controversy==
In his book, Gerald Rosenberg questions the validity of the commonly accepted axiom that the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is able to affect widespread social change. Naturally, such a drastic departure from conventional beliefs drew the ire of many critics, both within and beyond academia.

==Dynamic Court and Constrained Court==
Rosenberg examines two views of the United States Supreme Court: the view of the [[Dynamic Court]] and the view of the [[Constrained Court]]. The Dynamic Court view maintains that the United States Supreme Court is indeed capable of affecting widespread change, often citing cases such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' as examples. The Constrained Court view, on the other hand, holds that because of the existing constraints imposed upon the Court by the [[United States Constitution]] and the [[United States Congress]], the Court is unable to accomplish significant change.

Rosenberg sides largely with the Constrained Court view. He studies several landmark cases that have been handed down from the Court, such as ''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka'' (1954) and ''Roe v. Wade'' (1973), and asserts that in each examined situation, the Court was largely unable to attain any tangible, empirically-measurable change. Rosenberg names three constraints that preclude the US Supreme Court from being truly effective, and arrives at the conclusion that although the Court is indeed capable of accomplishing significant change, such change can only occur when these three constraints are overcome.

===First Constraint===
The First Constraint is that the nature of constitutional rights precludes the Court from hearing or effectively acting on many significant social reform claims, and lessens the chances of popular mobilization. This Constraint can be overcome if there exists sufficient precedent for change based on the Judiciary's interpretation of the Constitution.

===Second Constraint===
The Second Constraint is that the Court does not have sufficient independence from the [[legislative]] and [[executive (government)|executive]] branches to affect significant social reform. This Constraint can be overcome by securing support from substantial numbers in Congress and securing the support of the executive branch.

===Third Constraint===
The Third Constraint is that the Court does not have the power to develop necessary policy and implement decisions that could affect significant reform. Because, as [[Alexander Hamilton]] put it, the Court controls neither the sword (Executive branch) nor the purse (Legislative branch), it must rely on cooperation from the other two branches in order to enforce its decisions. This Constraint can be overcome either by securing support of citizens, or at least not having significant opposition from all citizens.

==Empirical studies==
Rosenberg maintains that the efforts made by women's rights, pro-choice, and civil rights activists to use the courts to produce social change have not been very effective. To prove and support this claim, he examines a great deal of statistical information. In looking at the effects that ''Brown v. Board'' had on desegregation, for example, Rosenberg looks at the percentage of black schoolchildren attending mixed schools in the South in the years preceding this landmark decision, and the years following it. He finds that almost no measurable change had occurred in the ten years following this decision. Indeed, it is not until the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that the percentage begins to increase annually. Similarly, in looking at ''Roe v. Wade'', he finds that the annual number of legal abortions did not seem to be greatly affected by the Court's decision.

==Criticism==
There is a great deal of criticism leveled at ''The Hollow Hope.'' Critics maintain that Rosenberg's argument ignores the implications of court decisions on future actions that created more direct change. There are similar omissions in discussion of [[Martin Luther King]], who cited ''Brown v. Board'' as a reason for mobilizing his followers in a speech given on a night preceding a boycott.

Despite these drawbacks, many agree that Rosenberg presents a provocative if flawed argument against the conventional wisdom that the [[United States Supreme Court]] is a powerful judicial body capable of introducing significant change.  However, these same critics maintain that Rosenberg relies on faulty assumptions, such as the duality of man.

'''Tin bounds''' were an ancient legal arrangement used in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in South West England to encourage the exploitation of land for the extraction of [[tin]].&lt;ref name="brown-2006"/&gt;

Tin bounds were created by the miner (or 'bounder') pitching stones or turves at the four corners of the land he intended to work.&lt;ref name="brown-2006"/&gt; The bounder was required to declare his bounds to the [[Stannary Court]] and to renew them annually by re-pitching the stones or turves. During the early history of mining, the bounder was also required to actually work the land for tin in order for the bounds to remain valid, although this requirement was diluted over time.

Tin bounds did not confer any rights of ownership over the land, only protection against others mining for tin in the same plot of land. The arrangement applied only to tin, not to other metals or minerals.

The bounder was required to pay the freeholder of the land a portion of the tin extracted. This portion was known as [[toll tin]].

Although tin bounding has never been abolished, the use of tin bounds as the mechanism for permitting and regulating the right to work for tin was later superseded by the use of [[mining sett]]s.

{{USBankruptcy}}

A '''trustee in bankruptcy''' is an entity, often an individual, in charge of administering a [[bankruptcy]] estate.

== United States ==
In the United States, a '''Trustee in Bankruptcy''' is a person who is appointed by the [[United States Trustee Program]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]]. In limited circumstances, the creditors involved in a bankruptcy case can elect a trustee.

In a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] Bankruptcy ("Liquidation") the trustee gathers the debtor’s non-exempt property, managing the funds from the sale of those assets, and then paying expenses and distributing the balance to the owed creditors.

In a [[Chapter 13]] Bankruptcy ("Reorganization") the trustee is responsible for receiving the debtor’s monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to the debtor's creditors. The Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of the debtor to guarantee that both the creditors’ and the debtor’s interests are maintained in accordance with the bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties.

Since the 1990s, duties similar to those of a trustee are sometimes performed by an individual called a [[Chief restructuring officer]] (CRO), generally prior to, or subsequent to, a bankruptcy proceeding (generally, a Chapter 11 proceeding). A CRO is an official of the company who has direct contact with the creditors and who has executive power to implement changes. The advantage of using a CRO is that the arrangement gives both the creditor and debtor more say over the future of the company than might be the case where a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is appointed.

==Canada==

See: [[Bankruptcy in Canada]]

In Canada, a trustee in bankruptcy is an individual or a corporation licensed by the official superintendent to hold in trust and, subsequently, to distribute bankrupt’s property among the creditors in accordance with the distribution scheme under the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] (BIA). The bankrupt and all other persons holding bankrupt’s property must transfer the property to trustee. The trustee may also assist individual in preparing and submitting a consumer proposal to creditors. The trustee must arrange mandatory counselling of the bankrupt. The trustee must follow the procedures under the BIA, call creditors meetings and send the parties required notices of proceedings and documents. The trustee is responsible for preparation of pre-discharge report and may oppose the bankrupt’s discharge.

'''UltraSurf''' is a freeware [[Internet censorship circumvention]] product created by UltraReach Internet Corporation.  The software enables its users to bypass [[Internet censorship]] and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] using an HTTP [[proxy server]], and employs [[encryption]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] for privacy.
 
The software was developed by Chinese [[dissident]]s as a means of allowing internet users to bypass the [[Golden Shield Project|Great Firewall of China]]. It currently boasts as many as 11 million users worldwide. The tool has been lauded as "one of the most important [[Freedom of speech|free-speech]] tools on the Internet" by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', and as the "best performing" circumvention tool by Harvard University in a 2007 study; a 2011 study by [[Freedom House]] ranked it fourth. Critics in the [[open-source software|open-source]] community, George Turner Says, have expressed concern about the software's [[closed-source]] nature and alleged [[security through obscurity]] design; UltraReach says their security considerations mean they prefer third party expert review to open source review.&lt;ref name=reply&gt;UltraSurf, [http://ultrasurf.us/Ultrasurf-response-to-Tor-definitive-review.pdf "Tor's critique of UltraSurf: A reply from the UltraSurf developers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118162858/http://ultrasurf.us/Ultrasurf-response-to-Tor-definitive-review.pdf |date=18 January 2016 }}, 16 April 2012. Retrieved 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In 2002, UltraReach was founded by Chinese dissidents in [[Silicon Valley]]. Shortly after, UltraSurf was created to allow internet users in China to evade government censorship and monitoring.&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;Vince Beiser, [https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/11/ff_firewallfighters/ Digital Weapons Help Dissidents Punch Holes in China's Great Firewall], ''Wired'', 1 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 UltraSurf reported over eleven million users worldwide.&lt;ref name=Applebaum/&gt; During the Arab Spring, UltraReach recorded a 700 percent spike in traffic from Tunisia.&lt;ref name=Applebaum/&gt; Similar traffic spikes occur frequently during times of unrest in other regions, such as Tibet and Burma during the [[Saffron Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Beiser"/&gt; [[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]] in 2010 called UltraSurf "one of the most important free-speech tools on the Internet" for enabling citizens to access and share information from oppressed countries during times of humanitarian or human rights crises.&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt;
 
UltraSurf is funded, in part, through contracts with the U.S. government's [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], which administers [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Asia]].&lt;ref name=Applebaum&gt;Anne Applebaum, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-has-the-state-department-run-into-a-firewall-on-internet-freedom/2011/04/03/AFYnn9eC_story.html “Why has the State Department run into a firewall on Internet freedom?”], ''Washington Post'', 4 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, UltraReach has had difficulty serving its growing user base due to insufficient funding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tools-to-skirt-web-censors-swamped-by-demand-8220125.html "Tools to skirt web censors swamped by demand], James Ball, ''The Washington Post'' via ''The Independent'', 22 October 2012. Retrieved 24 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

=== Client software ===
UltraSurf is free to download, and requires no installation. UltraSurf does not install any files on the user's computer, and leaves no registry edits after it exits.&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt; In other words, it leaves no trace of its use. To fully remove the software from the computer, a user needs only to delete the exe file named u.exe. It is only available on a Windows platform, and runs through Internet Explorer by default, with an optional plug-in for Firefox and Chrome.&lt;ref&gt;UltraSurf, [http://ultrasurf.us/security.html “Your Security”].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The UltraReach website notes that "Some anti-virus software companies misclassify UltraSurf as a malware or Trojan because UltraSurf encrypts the communications and circumvents internet censorship."&lt;ref&gt;UltraSurf, [http://ultrasurf.us/user-center.html “User Center”].&lt;/ref&gt; Some security companies have agreed to [[whitelist]] UltraSurf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/082809-chinese-anticensorship.html "Developer denies software to beat Chinese censors is malicious: UltraSurf programmer says the software acts suspiciously, but it’s just trying to put one over on the Great Firewall of China"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830190613/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/082809-chinese-anticensorship.html |date=30 August 2009 }}, Tim Greene, ''Network World'', 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Applebaum, the UltraSurf client uses [[anti-debugging]] techniques and also employs [[executable compression]].&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt; The client acts as a local proxy which communicates with the UltraReach network through what appears to be an [[obfuscation|obfuscated]] form of [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]/SSL.&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt;

=== UltraSurf servers ===
The software works by creating an encrypted HTTP tunnel between the user's computer and a central pool of [[Open proxy|proxy servers]], enabling users to bypass firewalls and censorship.&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt; UltraReach hosts all of its own servers.&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt; The software makes use of sophisticated, proprietary anti-blocking technology to overcome filtering and censorship online.&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt; According to Wired magazine, UltraSurf changes the "IP addresses of their proxy servers up to 10,000 times an hour."&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; On the server-side, a 2011 analysis found that the UltraReach network employed [[Squid (software)|squid]] and [[ziproxy]] software, as well as [[BIND|ISC BIND]] servers bootstrapping for a wider network of open recursive DNS servers, the latter not under UltraReach control.&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt;

UltraSurf is designed primarily as an anti-censorship tool, but also offer privacy protections in the form of industry standard encryption, with an added layer of obfuscation built in.&lt;ref name=reply/&gt; UltraReach uses an internal content filter which blocks some sites, such as those deemed pornographic or otherwise offensive.&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt; According to Wired magazine: "That's partly because their network lacks the bandwidth to accommodate so much data-heavy traffic, but also because Falun Gong frowns on erotica."&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; Additionally, the Falun Gong criticism website facts.org.cn, alleged to be operated by the Chinese government, is also unreachable through UltraSurf.&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt;

==Evaluation==

In a 2007 study, Harvard University's [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] found UltraSurf to be the "best performing" of all tested circumvention tools during in-country tests, and recommended it for widespread use. In particular, the report found that UltraSurf effectively bypassed various forms of censorship and blocking, include IP block, DNS block, and keyword filtering. It was also the fastest tool during in-country tests, and was noted for being easy to use and install with a simple user interface.&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt;

The report noted, however, that UltraReach is designed primarily as a circumvention product, rather than as an anonymity tool, and suggested that users concerned about anonymity should disable browser support for active content when using UltraSurf.&lt;ref name=Berkman&gt;Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, John Palfrey, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2009/2007_Circumvention_Landscape_Report '2007 Circumvention Landscape Report'], Berkman Center of Law and Society, Harvard University. 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2011 report by the U.S.-based human rights group [[Freedom House]] ranked UltraSurf fourth overall among censorship circumvention and privacy tools, as measured by a combination of performance, usability, support and security. In particular, the tool was recommended for users interested in downloading or viewing information, who required a relatively high degree of privacy, and who favored a fast connection speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/Censorship.pdf “Leaping Over the Firewall: A Review of Censorship Circumvention Tools”], Cormac Callanan, Hein Dries-Ziekenheiner, Alberto Escudero-Pascual, and Robert Guerra, Freedom House, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some technologists have expressed reservations about the UltraReach model, however. In particular, its developers have been criticized by proponents of open-source software for not allowing peer review of the tool's design, except at the discretion of its creators. Moreover, because UltraReach operates all its own servers, their developers have access to user logs. This architecture means that users are simply required to trust UltraReach not to reveal user data.&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berkman/&gt; UltraReach maintains that it keeps logs for a short period of time, and uses them only for the purpose of analyzing traffic for signs of interference or to monitor overall performance and efficacy; the company says it does not disclose user logs to third parties.&lt;ref name=reply/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; According to [[Jacob Appelbaum]] with the [[Tor Project]], an UltraSurf competitor, this essentially amounts to an example of "privacy by policy".&lt;ref name=Appelbaum&gt;Jacob Appelbaum, [https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-04-16-ultrasurf-analysis.pdf “Technical analysis of the UltraSurf proxying software”], Tor Project, 16 April 2011. [https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ultrasurf-definitive-review Blog announcement] with updates.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an April 2012 report, Appelbaum further criticized UltraSurf for its use of internal content filtering (including blocking pornographic websites), and for its willingness to comply with subpoenas from U.S. law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt; Appelbaum's report also noted that UltraSurf pages employed [[Google Analytics]], which had the potential to leak user data, and that its systems were not all up to date with the latest security patches and did not make use of [[Perfect forward secrecy|forward security mechanisms]].&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt; Furthermore, Applebaum claims that "The UltraSurf client uses Open and Free Software including [[PuTTY|Putty]] and [[zlib]]. The use of both Putty and zlib is not disclosed. This use and lack of disclosure is a violation of the licenses."&lt;ref name=Appelbaum/&gt; In a response posted the same day, UltraReach wrote that it had already resolved these issues. They asserted that Appelbaum's report had misrepresented or misunderstood other aspects of its software. UltraReach also argued that the differences between the software approaches to Internet censorship represented by Tor and UltraSurf were at base philosophical and simply different approaches to censorship circumvention.&lt;ref name=reply/&gt; A top-secret [[NSA]] presentation revealed as part of the [[2013 global surveillance disclosures]] dismisses this response by UltraSurf as "all talk and no show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity |title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity' |publisher = [[The Guardian]] |date = 4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potentially unwanted program==

Due to restrictions imposed by some organizations, [[McAfee VirusScan]] is flagging some Ultrasurf versions as a [[Potentially unwanted program]], avoiding its execution on those machines.
Ultrasurf is not a virus.

{{Wiktionary|unanimity|unanimous}}
'''Unanimity''' is agreement by all people in a given situation. Groups may consider unanimous decisions as a sign of agreement, solidarity, and unity. Unanimity may be assumed explicitly after a unanimous [[voting|vote]] or implicitly by a lack of objections. It does not necessarily mean uniformity and can sometimes be the opposite of majority in terms of outcomes.

==Voting==
Practice varies as to whether a vote can be considered unanimous if some voter [[abstention|abstains]]. In ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', a "unanimous vote" is not specifically defined, although an abstention is not counted as a vote regardless of the voting threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#6|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 6)|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this book, action could be taken by "[[unanimous consent]]", or "general consent", if there are no objections raised.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 54–56|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unanimous consent may not necessarily be the same as a unanimous vote (see [[Unanimous consent#Not the same as unanimous vote|Not the same as unanimous vote]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In either case, it does not take into account the members who were not present.

In contrast, a [[United Nations Security Council resolution]] is not considered "unanimous" if a member abstains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/4690652a351277438525634c006dce10!OpenDocument |title=Resolution 904 |date=18 March 1994 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Note 7: The result of the voting on the second and sixth preambular paragraphs of the draft resolution S/1994/280 was as follows: 14 in favour, none against and 1 abstention (United States of America); all the other paragraphs were approved unanimously. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210062143/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/4690652a351277438525634c006dce10!OpenDocument |archivedate=February 10, 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] introduced the concept of "constructive abstention", where a member can abstain in a vote where unanimity is required without thereby blocking the success of the vote. This is intended to allow states to symbolically withhold support while not paralysing decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Philippart |first=E. |author2=Monika Sie Dhian Ho  |title=Nederland en de Europese grondwet |editor=Jacques Pelkmans |editor2=Monika Sie |editor3=Dhian Ho |editor4=Bas Limonard |publisher=[[Amsterdam University]] Press |location=Amsterdam |date=2003 |pages=128–136 |chapter=Flexibility and the new constitutional treaty of the European Union |isbn=90-5356-656-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracies===
The occurrence of unanimity in a [[representative democracy]] can be elusive with the [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and variety of opinions in a [[participatory democracy]]. Unanimity is often a political endeavor. Although governments and [[international organization]]s may occasionally achieve unanimous decisions, [[popular consent]] is most often a more achievable aspiration for elected officials.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; Agreements do occur between political parties, governments and international organizations, infrequent it may seem nevertheless.|date=October 2012}}

===Dictatorships===
The legitimacy supposedly established by unanimity has been used by dictatorial regimes in an attempt to gain support for their position. Participants in a legislature may be coerced or intimidated into supporting the position of a dictator, with the legislature becoming little more than a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for a more powerful authority.

[[One-party state]]s can restrict nominees to one per seat in elections and use [[compulsory voting]] or [[electoral fraud]] to create an impression of popular unanimity. The [[North Korean parliamentary elections, 1962]] reported a 100% [[Voter turnout|turnout]] and a 100% vote for the [[Workers' Party of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=McFarlan |first=Donald |author2=[[Norris McWhirter]]  |title=[[Guinness Book of World Records]] |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |date=1990 |page=361 |chapter=Most One-Sided Elections |isbn=0-553-28452-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 100% votes have also been claimed by [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] in [[Guinea]] in 1975 and 1982, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] in 1985, and [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juries===
In [[criminal law]] [[jury trial]]s, many jurisdictions require a guilty verdict by a jury to be unanimous. This is not so in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] jury trials.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Apodaca v. Oregon]]'' that the Due Process Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] does not require jury unanimity in [[State court (United States)|state courts]], with a [[concurring opinion]] that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment to the Constitution]] mandates unanimity for a guilty verdict in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Apodaca v. Oregon]]'', {{ussc|406|404|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding this, many U.S. states do require jury unanimity for a finding of guilty; for example, article 21 of the [[Maryland Constitution]]'s Declaration of Rights states:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/43const/html/00dec.html#20 |title=Maryland Constitution - Declaration of Rights |date=4 November 2008 |publisher=Maryland Government |accessdate=2009-01-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|
That in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accusation against him; to have a copy of the Indictment, or charge, in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence; to be allowed counsel; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have process for his witnesses; to examine the witnesses for and against him on oath; and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.}}

[[Jury (England and Wales)|In England and Wales]], since the Juries Act 1974, a guilty verdict may be returned where not more than 2 jurors dissent.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6477">'''United States federal laws governing offenders with mental diseases or defects''' ({{usc|18|4241|4248}}) provide for the evaluation and handling of defendants who are suspected of having mental diseases or defects. The laws were completely revamped by the [[Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984]] in the wake of the [[John Hinckley]] verdict.

==Incompetence to stand trial==
A defendant can be found [[incompetent to stand trial]] if he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him and to assist properly in his defense. In such a case, he is involuntarily committed until his competency is restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|4241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has ruled that the government has a legitimate interest in bringing defendants to trial and that therefore incompetent defendants can be forcibly medicated under certain circumstances. See ''[[Sell v. United States]]''. Time served while waiting to be restored to competence generally counts as "[[dead time (imprisonment)|dead time]]," because it is not official detention but rather is (in theory) devoted to treatment.  The Supreme Court has ruled that an insanity acquittee can be held indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|463|354|1983|name=Jones v. U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made by the defendant in the course of his evaluation cannot be admitted as evidence against him on the issue of guilt.

Between 1940 and 1984, the law provided for a board of examiners to be established for each federal and penal correctional institution that would consist of three medical officers, one appointed by the warden or superintendent of the institution; another by the [[U.S. Attorney General]]; and another by the [[U.S. Public Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Act Oct. 12, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-1984 law did not have the same stringent 30- and 45-day time limits for examinations, but merely provided that "For the purpose of the examination the court may order the accused committed for such reasonable period as the court may determine to a suitable hospital or other facility to be designated by the court." The law provided that even if mental competency was not raised as an issue before conviction, if a board of examiners found probable cause to believe the defendant had been incompetent at the time of his trial, the court could vacate the judgment of conviction and grant a new trial.

==Insanity==
Per [[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 12.2, a defendant intending to pursue an insanity defense must timely notify an attorney for the government in writing. The government then has a right to have the court order a psychiatric or psychological examination. If the defendant does not submit to the examination, the court may exclude any expert evidence from the defendant on the issue of the defendant’s mental disease, mental defect, or any other mental condition. Federal law provides for the commitment of those found [[not guilty only by reason of insanity]]. Once such a verdict is handed down, the defendant has the burden of proof of showing that his release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage of property of another due to a present mental disease or defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|4243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the difficulty in proving such a thing, in some cases, defendants found not guilty only by reason of insanity serve more time in a mental hospital than they would have served in prison had they been found guilty. A [[risk panel]] is typically tasked with making such assessments.

==Persons due for release but suffering from mental disease or defect==
There is also a provision allowing the hospitalization of a person due for release but suffering from mental disease or defect. If the director of a facility in which a person is hospitalized certifies that a person in the custody of the [[Bureau of Prisons]] whose sentence is about to expire, or who has been committed to the custody of the Attorney General due to incompetence, or against whom all criminal charges have been dismissed solely for reasons related to the mental condition of the person, is suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another, and that suitable arrangements for State custody and care of the person are not available, the court will hold a hearing on the matter. If it finds by [[clear and convincing evidence]] that the person is indeed presently suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another, then it can hold him until such time as his condition has sufficiently improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|4246}}&lt;/ref&gt; When proceedings are initiated under this act, the person is entitled to an adversarial hearing with the right to counsel, the opportunity to testify, to present evidence, subpoena witnesses, and confront and cross-examine witnesses.

==Sexually dangerous offenders==
The 2006 [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] has been codified as {{usc|18|4248}}. It allows a person deemed  "sexually dangerous" to be civilly committed after the expiration of a federal criminal sentence. The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] found that civil  commitments were within the power granted to Congress under the  Constitution's [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] as an extension of the  government's custodial responsibility for federal inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=U.S. v. Volungus |opinion= 09-1596| url= http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=09-1596P.01A| date=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision of indefinite holding of prisoners after the expiration of their terms was ruled constitutional in 2010 in ''[[United States v. Comstock]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10916">The '''urban survival syndrome''', in United States [[jurisprudence]], can be used  either as a [[defense (legal)|defense]] of [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or of [[excuse (legal)|excuse]]. The first case using, unsuccessfully, the defense of "[[Urban decay|urban]] survival syndrome" is the 1994  [[Fort Worth, Texas]] murder trial of Daimion Osby.

The use of the urban survival syndrome as a defense to criminal charges followed the success of the [[battered woman syndrome]] defense in ''[[State v. Kelly]]'' (1984), which was  based on the acceptance that the presence of such a [[syndrome]] may cause  the defendant, a victim of [[domestic violence]], to  reasonably believe she was in peril and was therefore justified in using deadly force, given the circumstances.&lt;ref name=criminal&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense==
As an excuse defense, the urban survival syndrome is presented as a version of the [[abuse defense]]. Here an individual experiencing the daily life of [[racial segregation]] and violence common in many inner cities in the United States causes a subjective state equivalent to that caused by  survival in a violent battleground of war. As such it leads to a condition similar to a [[syndrome]] already recognized in both psychological and psychiatric practices, that is, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref name=ncjrs&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=www.ncjrs.gov
|accessdate=2008-08-15
|last=Clarke
|first=George W.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a justification defense, the urban survival syndrome is offered to bolster [[self-defense]] claims in which a defendant argues that he or she should not be held [[crime|criminally]] responsible for [[action (philosophy)|action]]s which broke the law, as the defendant was objectively reasonable in believing his or her lethal actions were necessary for survival. In this case, the act would be termed [[justifiable homicide]]. A defense of justification is a codification of the [[common law]] defense of [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]].&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

==History==
===''State v. Brown''===
In ''State v. Brown'', [[Case citation|91 N.M. 320, 573, P.2d 675]] (N.M. 1977), the court was dealing with a similar situation to that of Osby,  and a justification defense was used. The term, urban survival syndrome, had not yet come into being.  Brown, a black man living in an [[inner city]] neighborhood,  was charged with  two counts of [[assault]] with intent to kill upon a police officer. Brown  said that he was in fear of the police officers and acted in self-defense when he shot them. The court allowed defense witnesses to describe the verbal and physical harassment of blacks by police officers, including Brown, although the court refused to allow a [[social psychologist]] to testify describing studies of  police conduct toward minority groups, nor those that concluded  that minority groups might perceive police officers as hostile to them and would be apt to fear them in any street encounter. These studies could offer evidence of justification. Brown was convicted and appealed.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

The [[New Mexico Court of Appeals]] reversed the decision to exclude expert testimony and remanded the case back for a new trial. The court felt such testimony supported Brown in his claim that he was in fear of immediate bodily harm when he shot the police officers, rather than acting out of anger and rejection of authority, as the prosecution alleged. Therefore, evidence bearing on Brown's state of mind at the time of the offense had been excluded as a reversible error.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

===''People v. Goetz''===
In ''[[People v. Goetz]]'', [[Case citation|68 N.Y.2d 96]] (N.Y. 1986), [[Bernhard Goetz]], a white man,  used the defense of a subjective state of terror and fear to justify the shooting of four black teenagers on a [[New York City]] [[rapid transit|subway]].  The court held that the test for whether the use of [[deadly force]] is justified should be entirely [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and focus on the defendant's state of mind at the time of the incident and dismissed the criminal indictments of [[attempted murder]], assault, and [[reckless endangerment]]. However, upon appeal the [[New York Court of Appeals]], in a unanimous finding, held that the use of an entirely subjective test to determine the appropriateness of  deadly physical force by a defendant could permit a jury to acquit every defendant who believed that his actions were reasonable, regardless of how bizarre the rationale, creating a slippery slope. The jury could  determine a different reasonable test  for every single defendant claiming justification.  The Court explained that the justification statute requires an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] element; deadly physical force is only permissible if a [[reasonable person]] would believe that he is in imminent fear of serious physical injury or death.&lt;ref name=nygoetz&gt;

==Osby trial==
''State v. Kelly'' (1984), by allowing testimony on battered woman syndrome, opened the door to considering the subjective state of the perpetrator as a pathological syndrome caused by environmental factors and  allowing a defense on those grounds.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;  

The term "urban survival syndrome" was first used in 1994 in a [[Fort Worth, Texas]] murder case in which two defense attorneys, David Bays and Bill Lane, defended Daimion Osby, their 17-year-old black client, who had shot and killed two unarmed men in a parking lot and was on trial on two counts of first degree murder. The victims were also black, and the defendant told the police he shot them because he was in fear for his life and had to kill them before they killed him. The attorneys argued that Osby had reason to be fearful because he lived in a dangerous community, an inner city neighborhood with one of the highest crime rates in the country.  [[Expert testimony]] was allowed into evidence, provided by a [[sociologist]] who had written on [[race relations]] and who produced statistics that the Fort Worth area where the crime took place was a dangerous area with a high crime rate, and that the two men who were killed fit the [[FBI]] profile of America's most dangerous men. He also testified that being killed is the greatest danger facing young men in such neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=blackrage&gt;

|title=Black Rage Confronts the Law - Google Book Search
|publisher=|accessdate=2008-08-15

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Osby claimed that for the past year the two men had repeatedly harassed and threatened him and his family over the payment of a gambling debt. Evidence was also presented that the two men had a gun in their car.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

Based on the testimony, the defense attorneys argued that the defendant's belief that he was in danger for his life was reasonable, and therefore he was justified in using lethal force. The jury of nine whites and three blacks deadlocked, eleven to one, in favor of conviction. The prosecutor was a black attorney who forcefully argued that there was no such syndrome in the field of psychiatry as "urban survival syndrome". The one holdout was a black man from the same neighborhood as Osby and who agreed that the area was a "war zone".&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt; Six jury members interviewed after the trial said they disregarded the defense as far-fetched. Further, a coalition of black ministers from Osby's neighborhood publicly disavowed that the neighborhood was so dangerous and complained that the defense reinforced racial stereotypes.&lt;ref name=blackrage/&gt; 

Upon retrial on the murder charges, the defense attempted to introduce testimony from a [[psychologist]], in addition to that of the sociologist, on the psychological effects of living in a violent urban area. The psychologist's testimony was disallowed and Osby was convicted on the two murder counts and sentenced to serve life in prison.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

==Criticisms==
The "urban survival syndrome" has been criticized by blacks as a  [[stereotype|stereotyping]]  of blacks as if all blacks react in the same way: that as a group blacks are violent, angry and more than likely guilty.&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; This perspective demonstrated the flaw in any defense that depends on the rules and [[mores]] of a subculture as a replacement for those of the dominant society.&lt;ref name=nygoetz/&gt; Forth Worth minister Ralph Waldo Emerson stated:
{{quotation|[The Osby mistrial] says 'these folks' can't help shooting each other,... And it says to already nervous law-enforcement officials that they'd better be ready to draw when they stop someone in our community.&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The battered woman syndrome has been criticized on similar grounds: that it encourages the societal stereotype of women as helpless and incapacitated. While the court testimony can support the woman's actions as reasonable under the circumstances as self-defense, the courts seem to focus on testimony that portray the battered woman as "dysfunctional". Further problems arise with this defense when an analogous syndrome, the "battered child syndrome" is used as a defense, as the unique susceptibility of a woman to domestic violence can seem to be undercut.&lt;ref name=criminal/&gt;

Usucaption is a method by which [[ownership]] of property (i.e. [[title]] to the property) can be gained by [[Possession (law)|possession]] of it beyond the lapse of a certain period of time ([[acquiescence]]). While usucaption has been compared with [[adverse possession]] (that is, [[squatting]]), the true effect of usucaption is to remedy defects in title.

==Roman law==

===Background to usucapion===
{{main|Usucapio}}
The necessity for usucapion arose in [[Roman law]] with the divide between ''[[res mancipi]]'' and ''[[res nec mancipi]]''. ''Res mancipi'' required elaborate and inconvenient formal methods of conveyance to transfer [[title (property)|title]] (a formal ''[[mancipatio]]'' ceremony, or ''[[in iure cessio]]'').&lt;ref name="Gaius"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Zulueta|first=Francis|title=The Institutes of Gaius|year=1946|publisher=OUP|isbn=0-19-825112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaius (online)"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institutes of Gaius|url=http://thelatinlibrary.com/law/gaius.html|publisher=thelatinlibrary.com|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Res nec manicipi'' could be transferred by ''[[traditio]]'' (delivery) or ''in iure cessio''.

The remaining form of [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] was ''traditio''. This was an informal conveyance which required only an intention to transfer and [[deed|delivery]] of the property. If ''res mancipi'' were transferred by ''traditio'', full [[ownership]] would not pass and the recipient would become a [[bonitary owner]].

Therefore another form of conveyance was required that did not necessitate a ceremony or appearance before the [[praetor]]. Because Rome was becoming mercantile, it was simply inconvenient to perform a formal conveyance simply because property was classed as ''res mancipi''. There might also be a demand to transfer property in private between the transferring parties, such as in the establishment of ''[[fideicommissa]]'' (Roman trusts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=David|title=The Roman Law of Trusts|year=1988|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-825216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for establishing ownership by means other than conveyance was also a result of the practical defect of a system of ownership based on valid transfer. Title to [[property]] could be challenged under this system, because it depended on the good title of the person from whom you acquired the property and so on. If any person's title in the chain were challenged successfully, then this would defeat any title derived from it. This defect required a means of establishing [[ownership]] that was not contingent upon a chain of title but could be established independently.&lt;ref name='Johnston, "Context", pp.54-55'&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=David|title=Roman Law in Context|year=1961|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-63961-1|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Roman Law of Usucapio===
If however a [[bonitary owner]] kept the ''res'' (property) in his [[Possession (law)|possession]] for a certain amount of time (two years for land, one year for [[Personal property|chattel]]s) his [[title]] would become full [[title]] and he could assert himself as ''[[Dominus (title)|dominus]]''.

Usucapion was the solution that emerged to address the defects of Roman [[ownership]]. It required five elements:&lt;ref name="Nicholas p. 122"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|year=1962|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0-19-876063-9|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Uninterrupted possession of the property for the requisite period (one year for chattels, two years for land);
# The [[property]] was capable of being owned. Not a free man for example;
# [[Good faith]]. For example, a buyer might purchase a [[slave]] (categorised as [[res mancipi]]) in [[good faith]] but find twelve months on that the [[vendor]] did not himself have good [[title]] to that [[slave]];
# ''[[Iusta causa]]''. A proper ground for acquiring the [[property]], e.g. showing that the acquirer paid for the [[property]].
# The property must not have been at any time stolen or taken by force.

This largely ameliorated the problems experienced by [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] as a means of establishing [[ownership]], but could still yield harsh results. A purchaser of res mancipi could be on his way to successfully usucaping the property (e.g. 11 months in possession) but would lose his claim to it if his possession was challenged before the period of usucapion by someone who could establish title.

Usucapion was altered by the [[Actio Publiciana]] (see [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] 4.36&lt;ref name=Gaius /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaius (online)" /&gt;) which gave scope in the [[vindicatio]] (the action for property) for a fictitious usucapion. Such a situation would only arise where the claimant's possession of the [[property]] had been interrupted before the period required to usucape it had elapsed. The [[Actio Publiciana]] made provision for the possessor of the [[property]] to be taken to have usucaped it successfully, if he could show that he would have usucaped the [[property]] had his possession of it not been interrupted. In this way usucaption became the dominant form of establishing [[ownership]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

'''Walter Kriege''' (15 March 1891 – 1 December 1952) was [[Germany|German]] [[jurist]] who also had a political role in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=WKlautGedenkst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/biographie/view-bio/kriege/

==Life==
Walter Adolf Florens Hermann Kriege was born in [[Paraguay]] in 1891.   His father, [[Johannes Kriege]] (1859-1937), was a [[German empire|German]] diplomat who during the early 1890s worked as the German Consul in [[Asunción]].

After taking part in the [[First World War]] Kriege completed his studies in [[jurisprudence]] at Berlin, where he obtained his doctorate.&lt;ref name=WKlautGedenkst/&gt;   Between 1921 and 1923 he worked at the [[Reichsbank|Reichsbank (German Central Bank)]].&lt;ref name=Kabprotokoll&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/cocoon/barch/0000/k/k1949k/kap1_2/kap2_19/para3_5.html|title=[B.] Organisatorischer Aufbau der Bundesministerien |work=Kabinettsprotokolle 1949|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=Bundesarchiv, Koblenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Between 1923 and 1944 he worked in the Prussian Justice Ministry, later transferring to the national [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|State Justice Ministry]].&lt;ref name=Kabprotokoll/&gt;   In April 1940 he was appointed Ministerial Director in the Justice Ministry, a post he retained till his arrest in July 1944.&lt;ref name=Fans&gt;{{cite web|title=In stillem Gedenken an ALLE Widerstandskämpfer/innen gegen das Naziregime.

Walter Kriege was nominated a member of the planned [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler|Goerdeler]] [[:de:Schattenkabinett Beck/Goerdeler|Shadow Cabinet]] as Secretary of State at the Justice Ministry&lt;ref name=WKlautGedenkst/&gt; or, according to another source, as Justice Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Ritter]]: [[Carl Goerdeler]] und die deutsche Widerstandsbewegung. DVA, Stuttgart 1984. pp. 617-619.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, the planned government never came to power because the [[20 July plot|assassination plot]] against [[Adolf Hitler|Germany's incumbent chancellor]] failed.   Instead, Walter Kriege was arrested.   Unlike many of those arrested at this time&lt;ref name=Fans/&gt; he was released a few months later, however, in November 1944.&lt;ref name=WKlautGedenkst/&gt;

[[Second World War|War]] ended in May 1945 and what remained of Germany was divided into four [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]], each administered by one of the four principal [[Allies of World War II|victorious powers]].   Later, in May 1949, three of the four occupation zones would be bundled together and re-founded as the [[West Germany|German Federal Republic (West Germany)]].   Between 1946 and 1949 Walter Kriege worked as deputy president of the "German Finance Council", located within the US occupation zone at [[Stuttgart]], also holding the directorship of the "Finance Administration Office" (''"Verwaltung für Finanzen"'')&lt;ref name=Kabprotokoll/&gt; which in 1949 would mutate into the West German Finance Ministry.   With the foundation of West Germany the country's new [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Chancellor]], [[Konrad Adenauer]], was keen to appoint Walter Kriege as his Administrative Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

'''William Laud''' (7 October 1573 – 10 January 1645) was an English [[archbishop]] and academic. He was [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 1633, during the [[personal rule of Charles I]]. Arrested in 1640, he was executed in 1645.

In matters of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church polity]], Laud was [[Autocracy|autocratic]]. [[Laudianism]] refers to a collection of rules on matters of ritual, in particular, that were enforced by Laud in order to maintain uniform worship in England and Wales, in line with the king's preferences. They were precursors to later [[High Church]] views. In theology, Laud was accused of being an [[Arminian]] and opponent of [[Calvinism]], as well as covertly favouring [[Roman Catholic]] doctrines (see [[Arminianism in the Church of England]]). On all three grounds, he was regarded by [[Puritan]] clerics and laymen as a formidable and dangerous opponent.

Laud favoured scholars, and was a major collector of manuscripts. He pursued ecumenical contacts with the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].

The [[pun]] "give great praise to the Lord, and little Laud to the devil" is a warning to King Charles attributed to [[Archibald Armstrong]], the official [[Jester|court jester]]. Laud was known to be touchy about his diminutive stature.

==Early life==
Laud was born at [[Reading, Berkshire]] on 7 October 1573, the only son of William Laud, a clothier, and Lucy, née Webbe, widow of John Robinson, another clothier of the town, and sister of [[William Webbe (mayor)|William Webbe]], [[Lord Mayor of London]]. He was educated at [[Reading School]], and went in 1589 to [[St John's College, Oxford]], matriculating on 17 October. In 1593 he became a fellow of the college. He graduated B.A. in 1594, M.A. in 1598, and D.D. in 1608. As an undergraduate Laud had for his tutor [[John Buckeridge]], who became [[president]] of St John's College in 1605.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Laud, William|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud was ordained deacon on 4 January 1601, and priest on 5 April in the same year. On 4 May 1603, he was one of the proctors for the year.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Under James I==
When Buckeridge left St John's in 1611, Laud succeeded him as President, but only after a hard patronage struggle reaching high court circles. The rival candidate, [[John Rawlinson (clergyman)|John Rawlinson]], was chaplain to [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], who was both Chancellor of the university and [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. Laud was chaplain to [[Richard Neile]], who was [[Clerk of the Closet]]. Eventually King James brushed aside irregularities in the election, settling matters in Laud's favour.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Laud became [[Dean of Gloucester]] in 1616. At [[Gloucester Cathedral]] he began ceremonial innovations with the [[communion table]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Platten|author2=Christopher Woods|title=Comfortable Words: Polity, Piety and the Book of Common Prayer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3GfTeT9NgQC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2012|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=978-0-334-04670-7|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; By local custom, the table stood in the middle of the [[choir (architecture)|choir]], as was then usual in a parish church, rather than at the east end as was typical of cathedrals. Laud believed he had the king's blessing to renovate and improve the run-down building, but he offended his bishop, [[Miles Smith (bishop)|Miles Smith]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Neile was Laud's consistent patron. Neile attempted, but could not obtain, Laud's appointment as [[Dean of Westminster]], a post that [[John Williams (archbishop of York)|John Williams]] retained. But at the end of 1621, and despite the king's view of Laud as a troublemaker, Laud received the relatively lowly see as the [[Bishop of St David's]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|first=Anthony|last=Milton|id=16112|title=Laud,  William (1573–1645)|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud became a confidant of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], at the end of the reign. The Buckingham household employed [[John Percy]] (''alias'' Fisher), a [[Jesuit]], as chaplain, and the king wished to counter well-founded rumours that Percy was making Catholic converts there. In a three-day series of private debates with Percy in 1622, Laud was introduced to argue the Protestant case on the final day; pamphlets followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=9499|title=Percy, John|first=Timothy|last=Wadkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then displaced [[John Preston (clergyman)|John Preston]] as religious adviser to the Duke, a change that became clear around December 1624.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan D. Moore|title=English Hypothetical Universalism: John Preston and the Softening of Reformed Theology|year=2007|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2057-0|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe Laud had [[homosexual]] leanings, which he nevertheless seems to have managed discreetly. His private diary does contain evidence of erotic dreams he had about Buckingham and other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]|title=Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|page=517|isbn=0 140 28534 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Charles I==

===1625 to 1628===
Laud ascended rapidly to a position of influence in the period 1626 to 1628, advancing not alone but with a group of like-minded clerics who obtained bishoprics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Suellen Mutchow Towers|title=Control of Religious Printing in Early Stuart England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8u87-D44jwC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2003|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-0-85115-939-3|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1626 he took the court position of [[Dean of the Chapel Royal]], vacant by the death of [[Lancelot Andrewes]]. A few days later, Buckingham told him outright that he was to succeed as Archbishop of Canterbury, when [[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]] died.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He immediately changed the Chapel services to privilege prayer over preaching, since King Charles's views were the opposite of his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Colclough|title=John Donne's Professional Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vehTu2WHAKEC&amp;pg=PA199|year=2003|publisher=DS Brewer|isbn=978-0-85991-775-9|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bishop of London, and "Thorough"===
In July 1628 Laud was translated from [[Bath and Wells]] to become [[Bishop of London]], in moves that followed on from the death of Andrewes. After this breakthrough in church politics, it becomes meaningful to define "Laudians" or "Lauders" as his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Coward|title=A Companion to Stuart Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIkgk-HkQcUC&amp;pg=PA259|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99889-2|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the political stage, the [[personal rule of Charles I]] began in 1629 and Laud shortly became a key part of it, in alliance with [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]]. Historian Mark Perry argues that by 1626 in private consultations with the king and Buckingham, and in his public role in the House of Lords, Laud was a highly effective parliamentarian and a key adviser and policy-maker.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Parry, "Bishop William Laud and the Parliament of 1626." ''Historical Research'' 88.240 (2015): 230-248.&lt;/ref&gt; Laud distrusted parliamentary bargaining, and was always determined to resist all encroachments upon the royal prerogative, especially in matters of taxation. His strong positions were the focus of attack during his trial in 1644.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Parry, "William Laud and the Parliamentary Politics of 1628–9."

[[File:Wolverhampton St Peters - 17th century altar 01.jpg|thumb|Altar, ''c''. 1635, the centre of dispute between Puritans and Laudians, possibly consecrated by Laud himself]]

Laud was almost 60 years old when he became archbishop and, having waited for a decade to replace George Abbot, was no longer prepared to compromise on any aspect of his policy.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot's chaplains had licensed ''[[Histriomastix]]'' for publication in 1630; the book which attacked English theatre and Christmas celebrations, among others, had caused scandal when it appeared in late 1632. One of Laud's early moves was to bring in his own men as censors: [[Samuel Baker (divine)|Samuel Baker]] (who was chaplain to [[William Juxon]]), [[William Bray (clergyman)|William Bray]] and Matthew Weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kevin Sharpe (historian)|Kevin Sharpe]] |title=The Personal Rule of Charles I |year=1992 |publisher=Yale University Prees |isbn=0 300 05688 5 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Baker, Samuel|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations of the censors, including [[William Haywood (priest)|William Haywood]] who joined them, became a focus of the [[Long Parliament]] as soon as it was convened in November 1640, and Laud ultimately had to answer for Haywood at his own trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dagmar Freist|title=Governed By Opinion: Politics, Religion and the Dynamics of Communication in Stuart London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMOXgtjz-I4C&amp;pg=PA58|date=15 June 1997|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-110-7|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Haywood, William|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Wentworth (who became the Earl of Strafford in early 1640) saw the political dangers of Puritanism, Laud saw the Calvinist movement's threat to the [[episcopacy]]. But the Puritans themselves felt threatened: the [[Counter-Reformation]] was succeeding abroad and Protestants were not winning the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In this climate, Laud's high church policy could be seen as sinister. A year after Laud's appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury, the ship ''Griffin'' left for America, carrying religious dissidents such as [[Anne Hutchinson]], the Reverend [[John Lothropp]] and the Reverend [[Zechariah Symmes]].

Laud's desire to impose uniformity on the Church of England was driven by a belief that this was his office's duty, but his methods seemed persecution to those of differing views. Thus, they had the [[unintended consequence]] of garnering support for the most implacable opponents of the Anglican compromise. In 1637, ''Histriomastix's'' author, [[William Prynne]], was convicted of [[seditious libel]] along with [[John Bastwick]] and [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and had their ears cropped and faces branded. Prynne reinterpreted the "SL" ("Seditious Libeller") branded on his forehead as "[[Stigmata]] Laudis". Laud also moved to silence his critic among the bishops, [[John Williams (archbishop of York)|John Williams]], who was convicted of various offences in [[Star Chamber]]. Contrary to Laud's expectation, Williams refused to resign as [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and the Lords forced his release, after which Williams supported the impeachment of both Strafford and Laud. Williams specifically urged the king not to commute Strafford's death sentence, and he was executed in 1641, months before Charles I promoted Williams to Archbishop of York (only to be re-imprisoned by Parliament and then join the King in Yorkshire upon his release).

Toward the end of his life, Charles I admitted that he had put too much trust in Laud, and allowed his "peevish humours" and obsession with points of ritual to inflame divisions within the Church: he warned [[Charles II of England|his son]] not to rely entirely on anyone else's judgment in such matters. Laud, on his side, could not forgive the king for allowing Strafford's execution, and dismissed his royal master as "a mild and gracious Prince, that knows not how to be or be made great".&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and execution===
{{details|Trial of Archbishop Laud}}
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Trial of Laud (State 2).jpg|thumb|Etching by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], Laud being tried for treason, with several people present labelled]]

The [[Long Parliament]] of 1640 accused Laud of [[treason]] and, in the [[Grand Remonstrance]] of 1641, called for his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;points 123–124. See {{Cite book|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur043.htm|title=The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution 1625–1660|chapter=The Grand Remonstrance, with the Petition accompanying it|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1906|editor=Samuel Rawson Gardiner|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laud was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], where he remained throughout the early stages of the [[English Civil War]]. Apart from a few personal enemies like [[William Prynne]] (and possibly Archbishop Williams), Parliament showed little anxiety to proceed against Laud; given his age, most members would probably have preferred to leave him to die of natural causes. In the spring of 1644 he was brought to trial which, however, ended without a verdict: as with Strafford, it proved impossible to point to any specific action which could be seen as treasonable. Parliament took up the issue and eventually passed a [[bill of attainder]] under which he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 10 January 1645 on [[Tower Hill, London|Tower Hill]], notwithstanding being granted a royal pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Wedgwood, C.V ''The King's War'' Fontana Reissue pp.376–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud was buried in the chapel of [[St John's College, Oxford]], his [[alma mater]].

Laud is remembered in the [[Anglican Communion]] with a [[Commemoration (observance)|commemoration]] on 10 January. His collected works in seven volumes were published between 1847 and 1860 in the ''[[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]]''.

Emeritus Professor at Cambridge, [[Patrick Collinson]], an expert in Elizabethan [[Puritan]]s, in 1980 published this rebuke of Laud in his book on the decades until 1625: "the greatest calamity ever visited upon the English Church".&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson, ''The Religion of Protestants: The Church in English Society 1559–1625'' (Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, following [[King's School, Gloucester]], [[Reading School]] named their newest students' division Laud House after him.
