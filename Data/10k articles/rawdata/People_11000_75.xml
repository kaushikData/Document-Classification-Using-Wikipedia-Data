[[File:Villemain, Abel-François - 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Abel-François Villemain]]'''Abel-François Villemain''' (9 June 1790{{snd}}8 May 1870) was a French politician and writer.

==Biography==
Villemain was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and educated at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. He became assistant master at the [[Lycée Charlemagne]], and subsequently at the [[École Normale]]. In 1812 he gained a prize from the Academy with an essay on [[Michel de Montaigne]]. Under the restoration he was appointed, first, assistant professor of modern history, and then professor of French eloquence at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Here he delivered a series of literary lectures which had an extraordinary effect on his younger contemporaries.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Villemain, Abel François|volume=28|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villemain had the great advantage of coming just before the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]], of having a wide love of literature without being an extremist. Most of the clever young men of the brilliant generation of 1830 passed under his influence; and, while he pleased the Romanticists by his frank appreciation of the beauties of English, German, Italian, and Spanish poetry, he did not decry the classics—either the classics proper of [[Greece]] and Rome or the so-called classics of France.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1819 he published a book on [[Oliver Cromwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Histoire de Cromwell, d'après les Mémoires du Temps, et les Recueils Parlementaires'' par M. Villemain ...|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=July 1821|volume=25|pages=279–347|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2I-Zwu1sb4C&amp;pg=PA279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later he was elected to the Academy. Villemain was appointed by the restoration government ''Chef de l'imprimerie et de la librairie'', a post involving a kind of irregular censorship of the press, and afterwards to the office of master of requests. Before the [[July revolution|revolution of July]] he had been deprived of his office for his liberal tendencies, and was elected deputy for [[Évreux]] in [[French legislative election, 1830|July 1830]]. Under [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]] he was made a [[Peer of France]] in 1832. He was a member of the council of public instruction, and was twice minister of that department, and he also became secretary of the Academy. During the whole of the [[July monarchy]] he was one of the chief dispensers of literary patronage in France, but in his later years his reputation declined. He died in Paris.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His wit was legendary; an anecdote has a fellow professor saying to him "I have discovered a [[gallicism]] in [[Cicero]]." The professor had been a revolutionary during the revolution, a follower of Napoleon during the Empire and a royalist during the restauration. Villemain answered quickly to him: "I found one too: «Quantae infidelitates! Quot amicorum fugae!»"{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Villemain's chief work is his ''Cours de la littérature française'' (5 vols., 1828–1829). Among his other works are: ''Tableau de la littérature au Moyen Âge'' (2 vols., 1846); ''Tableau de la littérature au XVIII siècle'' (4 vols., 1864); ''Souvenirs contemporains'' (2 vols., 1856); ''Histoire de Grégoire VII'' (2 vols., 1873; Engl. trans., 1874).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Lautréamont]] assessed him thus: "Villemain is thirty-four times more intelligent than [[Eugène Sue]] and [[Frédéric Soulié]]. His preface to the ''Dictionary of the Academy'' will outlive the novels of [[Walter Scott]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper|Fenimore Cooper]], and all the novels conceivable and imaginable."{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Among notices on Villemain may be cited that of [[Louis de Loménie]] (1841), E. Mirecourt (1858), J.L. Dubut (1875). See also [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], ''Portraits'' (1841, vol. iii), and ''Causeries du lundi'' (vol. xi, "Notes et pensées").&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

|description=[[Carlos Gardel]] and Alfredo Le Pera's classic 1935 tango, ''[[Por una cabeza]]''.
|format      = [[Ogg]]}}
|}
'''Alfredo Le Pera''' (4 June 1900 &amp;ndash; 24 June 1935) was an Argentine [[journalist]], [[dramatist]], and [[lyricist]], best known for his brief but fruitful collaboration with the renowned [[Tango music|tango]] singer [[Carlos Gardel]].  He died in a plane accident with Gardel when he was at the height of his career.

==Biography==
Le Pera was born in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], the son of [[Italians|Italian]] immigrants who moved to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina in 1902.  At the beginning of his career, he worked for several Argentinian periodicals as a journalist and theatre critic and in 1928 became involved in the film industry.  He worked for [[Paramount Pictures]] while living in [[Paris]] and in 1932 the studio arranged for him to work with Carlos Gardel, at a time when the company was looking for ways to increase Gardel's international appeal .  Le Pera wrote the scripts for a series of films, including ''Melodía de Arrabal'' (1933), ''Cuesta abajo'' (1934), ''El Tango en Broadway'' (1934), ''[[El día que me quieras (1935 film)|El día que me quieras]]'' (1935) and ''Tango Bar'' (1935), and also wrote the lyrics for tangos composed and performed by Gardel in these films.  These tangos would become classics of the genre across the Spanish-speaking world.

Gardel and Le Pera were coming to the end of a promotional tour for the film ''El dia que me quieras'' when, on Monday, 24 June 1935, the plane in which they were taking off from the airport in [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]] crashed into another plane on the runway, killing them both and most of the other passengers on board, including the other musicians travelling with them.

Le Pera is credited with elevating the literary quality of tango lyrics while respecting the popular character of the musical form.

'''Amr Moussa''' ({{lang-ar|عمرو محمد موسى}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈʕɑmɾe mæˈħæmmæd ˈmuːsæ|IPA}}, '''Amr Muhammad Moussa'''; born 3 October 1936) is an [[Egypt]]ian [[politician]] and [[diplomat]] who was the Secretary-General of the [[Arab League]], a 22-member forum representing [[Arab World|Arab states]], from 1 June 2001 to 1 June 2011. Previously he served in the government of Egypt as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1991 to 2001. On 8 September 2013, he was elected president of the committee of 50 that will amend the [[Egyptian constitution]].&lt;ref name="ao8sept"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Egypt liberals tighten grip on constitution drafting|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/81117.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=8 September 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born on 3 October 1936 in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], the son of former parliamentarian Muhammad Moussa. His father also had a son named Pierre during his studies in France in the 1920s. However, Moussa's half-brother Pierre is a [[French nationality law|French citizen]] and has no ties to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/amr-moussa-denies-having-jewish-relatives/ Amr Moussa: No, I don’t have an Israeli half-brother], Times of Israel, by Elhanan Miller, dated 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moussa finished his education after earning a degree in [[law]] from [[Cairo University]] in 1957.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Diplomatic career ==
Moussa then began his [[Diplomacy|diplomatic career]] between 1958 and 1972 he worked in several missions, including Egypt's Embassy in [[Switzerland]] and the Egyptian mission to the [[United Nations]]. From 1974 to 1977 he was an advisor to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].  From 1977 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1990, he was the Director of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1981 to 1983, Moussa was the Deputy Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations]] in New York, then from 1983 to 1986 Ambassador to [[India]].&lt;ref name=lat11&gt;{{cite news|last=Phelps|first=Timothy M.|title=Diplomat seen as a solid leader, but too old to be Egypt's president|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/17/world/la-fg-egypt-moussa-20110217|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he was promoted Permanent Representative of Egypt to the [[United Nations]]. He was named [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] by [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]] [[Atef Sedki]] on 20 May 1991. He was minister until 15 May 2001 when he was elected as Secretary-General of the [[Arab League]].

Moussa has been heavily involved with [[Foreign relations of Egypt|Egypt's foreign policy]] since 1958. He was Egypt's ambassador to the United Nations, India, and Switzerland for a total of 21 years. Moussa was among the many Arab and international diplomats who tried to resolve the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990). After serving as Egypt's Foreign Minister from 1991 to 2001, he served as the Secretary General of the Arab League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United|first=Nations|title=Biography of Amre Mahmoud Moussa|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/hlpanel/amre-moussa-bio.pdf|newspaper=United Nations|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussa has been an extremely popular political figure in Egypt due to his criticism of Israeli policies towards Gaza and the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Amre Moussa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1766776.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=23 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Forum for [[New Diplomacy]] in February 2010, Moussa gave a speech in which he criticized the U.S. government's double standard supporting Israel's nuclear weapons policy but not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear energy.  He also criticized Western countries, including the U.S., for not recognizing the results of the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian election]] that brought [[Hamas]] into power.&lt;ref name="Seale"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seale|first=Patrick|title=An Arab Voice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/opinion/06iht-edseale.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=amrmoussa|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Mohamed El-Baradei]] and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], he supports opening the [[Gaza Strip]]/Egypt border.&lt;ref name="Seale" /&gt;  His criticisms have made Moussa extremely popular.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Secretary-General of the Arab League==

On 15 May 2001, Moussa was selected as Secretary-General of the [[League of Arab States]] and took office on 1 June 2001. Critics of former-[[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] allege that Moussa's appointment to the office of Secretary-General of the Arab League was motivated by Mubarak's desire to remove him from the public spotlight, and so he would not compete as a candidate in the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On 2003, he became a member of the United Nations High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change for International Peace and Security.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On 2009, he signed a memorandum of understanding with the [[Holy See]] and met with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in order to strengthen joint projects and to promote peace and dialogue on a cultural and political level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0901836.htm|title=Vatican, Arab League sign new agreement to promote peace, dialogue|publisher=Catholic News|date=23 April 2009|first=Cindy|last=Wooden|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June 2010, Moussa visited [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in a move to pressure Israel to lift its [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|economic blockade]] over Hamas-ruled Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Franks|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10303301.stm |title=Arab League chief Amr Moussa in first visit to Gaza|publisher=BBC|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit by Moussa was the first by an official of the Arab League since the election of Hamas in 2007. Immediately after the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], Moussa said the Arab League would go to the [[UN Security Council]] to demand the blockade be lifted. On 15 May 2011, [[Nabil Elaraby]] was elected as Secretary-General of the Arab League and succeeded Moussa on 1 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-15747941|title=Arab League, BBC|publisher=BBC|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005 presidential election ===
{{Main|Egyptian presidential election, 2005}}

In 2004 an online community gathered tens of thousands of signatures petitioning for Moussa to run in the 2005 elections, but there was no response. In a ''Doha Debate'' Forum televised by the BBC in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedohadebates.com/output/page13.asp |title=What the media say about the Doha debates |accessdate=2006-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516043543/http://www.thedohadebates.com/output/page13.asp |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussa was asked about his presidential hopes. Moussa merely replied that he hoped to continue the recent run of successes that have occurred under his leadership at the Arab League until the end of his term.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== 2012 presidential election ===

When asked in October 2009 about rumours that he might run for the presidency in 2012, Moussa did not deny his intention to run for office or rule it out, leaving the door open to speculations. He argued that "It's the right of every citizen that has the capacity and efficiency to aspire to any political office that would allow him to contribute to the service of his nation".&lt;ref name="Amr Moussa opened the way for speculation about his candidacy for the presidency of Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabic.cnn.com/2009/middle_east/10/20/Amro.Mousa/ |title=Amr Moussa opened the way for speculation about his candidacy for the presidency of Egypt|work=CNN Arabic|date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110307154216/http://arabic.cnn.com/2009/middle_east/10/20/Amro.Mousa/|archivedate=7 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated to the press that the qualities required to be the President of Egypt also apply to [[Gamal Mubarak]], son of Hosni Mubarak.&lt;ref name="Amr Moussa did not rule out running for the presidency of Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ara.reuters.com/article/topNews/idARACAE59I1E020091020|title=Amr Moussa did not rule out running for the presidency of Egypt|work=Reuters Arabia|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed appreciation "for the confidence expressed by many people when they talk about his candidacy for the presidency and that the message reached him".&lt;ref name="Amr Mousa to (Al-Shorouk): Every qualified citizen has the right to aspire to serve the country and become the president"&gt;[http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=143426 Amr Mousa to (Al-Shorouk): Every qualified citizen has the right to aspire to serve the country and become the president].&lt;/ref&gt;

Moussa held talks with Mohamed El-Baradei after his return to Egypt. Many{{who|date=January 2011}} speculate that this meeting was held to discuss Constitutional reforms that will allow transparency in the election process as well as lifting restrictions on independent candidates. On 26 January 2011, at the Annual Horasis meeting in [[Zurich]], Moussa shared strong views on the need for economic and political reforms in Egypt, and made it clear that he was considering a run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horasis.org/Horasis%20Annual%20Meeting%202011%20-%20Report%20.pdf|title=Horasis Annual Meeting|accessdate=30 November 2011|author=Frank-Jurgen Richter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February  2011, following the announcement by President Hosni Mubarak that he would not stand in the upcoming presidential elections, Moussa told CNN that he would seriously think about standing himself as a candidate in the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2011/feb/01/egypt-protests-live-updates|title=Egypt protests |newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=2 February 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201234717/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2011/feb/01/egypt-protests-live-updates| archivedate=1 February 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 8 February broadcast of ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' English's Empire, well-connected American journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] stated that Moussa was considered the U.S.'s favored "Plan B" should Mubarak resign, "whether he knows it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hersh|first=Seymour|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDp8TnY3IsA |title=Empire |work=Al Jazeera|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 February  2011, Al Jazeera English Online read from a Reuters report that stated Moussa was resigning from his position with the Arab League; on the day that President Mubarak resigned the presidency this furthered rumours he might make a strong bid for president when elections are announced in Egypt.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} On 12 February  2011, the Egyptian daily newspaper ''Alwafd'' reported that a group of Egyptian youth met with Moussa to discuss a possible nomination for the presidential election. Moussa reportedly agreed to the nomination, but stated that  he would await the currently proposed constitutional reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alwafd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15975:ثوار-يلتقون-موسى-وزويل-لبحث-مرشح-الرئاسة&amp;catid=98:محلية&amp;Itemid=92 ثوار يلتقون موسى وزويل لبحث"الرئاسة"]. Alwafd&lt;/ref&gt;

Amr Moussa announced that he would be running as a presidential candidate on 1 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Badawi|first=Rania|title=Moussa To Run For President, Will Announce Election Platform Soon|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/335453|newspaper=Al-Masry Al-Youm|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll conducted during the 2011 protests asking "who do you think should be the next President of Egypt?" showed Moussa in the lead, with 26% of respondents naming him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/Egypt-Poll/d/48662607 "Phone Survey of Cairo and Alexandria", Scribd Middle East Polls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313164501/http://www.scribd.com/Egypt-Poll/d/48662607 |date=13 March 2011 }}. Scribd, Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moussa placed fifth in the election with 11.13% of the first round vote. After the election, he formed the [[Conference Party]] with which a number of smaller opposition parties aligned.

== Criticisms ==
Although credited with shaking up the Arab League's bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Moran|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9061/arab_league_and_iraq.html|title=The Arab League and Iraq|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=20 October 2005|accessdate=2 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402104412/http://www.cfr.org/publication/9061/arab_league_and_iraq.html|archivedate=2 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moussa has been criticized by former and current staff members of the Arab League for his management of the organization. In his book, ''The League of the Arab States: what’s left of it'', former Arab League and Syrian diplomat Kawkab Najib El Rayess accused Moussa of favoritism and promoting his loyalists into the high ranks of the Arab League at the expense of the more-qualified diplomats.&lt;ref name=nasrawi&gt;{{cite news|last=Nasrawi|first=Saif|title=Egypt’s opposition divided over counter-attack strategy|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/egypt’s-opposition-divided-over-counter-attack-strategy|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=Egypt Independent|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angela Gheorghiu''' ({{IPA-ro|anˈd͡ʒela ɡe̯orˈɡi.u|-|Ro-Angela Gheorghiu.ogg}}; née '''Burlacu'''; born 7 September 1965) is a Romanian [[soprano]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Warrack]] and Ewan West, 'Gheorghiu, Angela', ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', Oxford University Press, 1996; [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] and Laura Diane Kuhn, ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'', Gale Group, 2001, p. 1264; David M. Cummings, [https://books.google.com/books?id=48V3kmpJEEgC&amp;pg=PA9 "Gheorghiu, Angela"], ''International Who's Who in Classical Music'', Routledge, 2003, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her professional debut in 1990, she has performed in leading roles of several operas at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]], London's [[Royal Opera House]], the [[Vienna State Opera]], Milan's [[La Scala]], and many other opera houses in Europe and the United States. She has a substantial discography primarily with [[EMI Classics]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] and is especially known for her performances in the operas of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]].

== Biography ==
Gheorghiu was born in 1965 in [[Adjud]], Romania. Along with her sister [[Elena Dan]], she sang opera music from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcarreras.homestead.com/AlagnaArtPeople1999.html|title=Roberto Alagna – People Magazine 21 June 1999|website=www.jcarreras.homestead.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14, Gheorghiu began to study singing at the [[National University of Music Bucharest]], primarily under Mia Barbu. Her graduation in 1990 followed the overthrow of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] the previous year, enabling her to seek an international career immediately. Her professional opera debut took place at the [[Cluj-Napoca Romanian National Opera]] as Mimì in ''[[La bohème]]'' in 1990, the same year she won third prize in the Belvedere International Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belvedere-competition.com/winners/|title=Belvedere-Competition: Winners|website=www.belvedere-competition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gheorghiu made her international debut in 1992 at the [[Royal Opera House]] as Zerlina in ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelagheorghiu.com/files/biography/biography-en.pdf Biography on Official website (2004)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828005043/http://www.angelagheorghiu.com/files/biography/biography-en.pdf |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She debuted at the [[Vienna State Opera]] as Adina in ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' and at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] as Mimì in ''La bohème''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/bio.aspx?id=690&amp;type=1|title=Biography of Angela Gheorghiu |publisher=The Metropolitan Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she was auditioned by the conductor Sir [[Georg Solti]] for a new production of ''[[La traviata]]'' at the Royal Opera House. Her debut as Violetta led her to international stardom.

Gheorghiu has concentrated her repertoire on several different roles: Violetta, Mimì, [[La rondine|Magda]], Adina, and [[Roméo et Juliette|Juliette]]. In 2003, she debuted as Nedda in ''[[Pagliacci]]'' and as Marguerite in ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. A soprano with a large range and a dark coloured voice,&lt;ref&gt;Crory, Neil (2005) "Recommended CD Recordings: Puccini: Angela Gheorghiu" [[Opera Canada]] 46(2): p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Gheorghiu is also able to sing ''[[spinto]]'' roles. She has recorded ''[[Tosca]]'' (also made into a film in 2001, directed by the French director [[Benoît Jacquot]]) and Leonora in ''[[Il trovatore]]'' for EMI and sang in her first Tosca at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 2006. Her performance was an overall success, although because the famous [[Franco Zeffirelli|Zeffirelli]] production of 1964 was replaced by a new production (which premiered with her), there was comparison between the Toscas of Gheorghiu and [[Maria Callas]], for whom the Zeffirelli production was designed.

Gheorghiu took part in many concerts, singing alone or together with her colleagues. Among the most important ones, the reopening of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden (1999) and [[Teatro Malibran]] in Venice (2001) and at the opening the new Opera House in Valencia, in the presence of the [[Queen Sofia]] of Spain (2005). She sang at the [[Prom at the Palace]] (2002), the event that marked the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]], a concert that is available on DVD. In 2012, Gheorghiu was the guest of honor at a London Royal Opera House gala which was also attended by [[Elizabeth II]]. The Romanian soprano sang at the event, which was organized to raise funds for the Royal Opera House Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romania-insider.com/two-romanians-perform-for-queen-elisabeth-ii-at-royal-opera-house-gala/|title=Two Romanians perform for Queen Elizabeth II at Royal Opera House gala  |first=Romania|last=Insider|date=31 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also sang at the [[Queen Beatrix]]'s Jubilee Gala in Amsterdam (2005), at the New Year's Eve Concert at [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris (2006), at the Met Summer Concert in [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], New York (2008), and at the Memorial Concert for [[Luciano Pavarotti]] in [[Petra]], where she also performed an unconventional duet of "[[Là ci darem la mano]]" from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Sting/Angela+Gheorghiu|title=Sting Angela Gheorghiu Photostream|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Gheorghiu was invited to honor [[Grace Bumbry]] during the 32nd Annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]], in Washington, DC. She performed "[[Vissi d'arte]]" from Puccini's ''Tosca'' in the presence of [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, Kelly Jane [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/07/kennedy-center-honorees-reflect-americas-diversity/?page=3 Kennedy Center honorees reflect America's diversity], ''The Washington Times'', December 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, Gheorghiu performed the title role in the film ''Tosca'', directed by Benoit Jacquot, together with [[Roberto Alagna]] and [[Ruggero Raimondi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0240122|Tosca|(2001)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, in 2002, Gheorghiu interpreted Juliette in the movie ''Roméo et Juliette'', alongside Roberto Alagna and [[Tito Beltrán]], also released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0327118|Roméo et Juliet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Gheorghiu made her debut in [[Francesco Cilea]]'s ''[[Adriana Lecouvreur]]'', a new production of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote, "It's hard to imagine anyone bettering Angela Gheorghiu in this part. Her voice, feather-light and creamy yet with a core of steel, matches the liquid way she moves on stage. She's a natural actress and made the improbable death scene heartbreakingly believable and her signature aria 'Poveri fiori' simply unforgettable."&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, Stephen [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/21/adriana-lecouvreur-cilea-tansy-davies The Observer], London, November 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph'' wrote, "''Adriana'' is known as a nice, easy sing for ageing or challenged prima donnas (no difficult top notes, and a tame orchestra), so Gheorghiu, in her vocal prime, should have found it a doddle. But her first aria was bumpy and nervous, and she fudged the end of the second. Elsewhere, in duet and declamation, she often sang exquisitely."&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Rupert [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8147350/Adriana-Lecouvreur-Royal-Opera-House-London-review.html ''The Daily Telegraph''], London, 19 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Gheorghiu sang the title role in ''Tosca'' at the Royal Opera House conducted by [[Antonio Pappano]], and the following September returned there for the revival of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', which was broadcast live in cinemas all over the world. In April 2012, she appeared for the first time at the [[Teatro Colón]], Buenos Aires, in a concert of duets with Roberto Alagna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucharestherald.com/star-gossip/42-star-gossip/32210-angela-gheorghiu-to-perform-on-buenos-airescolon-teatro-stage-in-premiere-together-with-roberto-alagna Article in Bucharest Herald] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414013241/http://www.bucharestherald.com/star-gossip/42-star-gossip/32210-angela-gheorghiu-to-perform-on-buenos-airescolon-teatro-stage-in-premiere-together-with-roberto-alagna |date=April 14, 2012 }}, 9 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Gheorghiu was the special guest at the [[Vienna Opera Ball]], where she performed accompanied by conductor [[Georges Prêtre]] and the [[Vienna State Opera]] Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2521250/|title=Glanz und Glamour beim Opernball |website=wien.ORF.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Gheorghiu celebrated 20 years since her debut on the stage of the Royal Opera House, London, by performing in ''[[La bohème]]'' with Roberto Alagna. In July 2012, she held her first [[master class]] at the [[Georg Solti]] Accademia in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], Italy. She returned to [[Tuscany]] for a second masterclass at the [[Georg Solti]] Accademia in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgsoltiaccademia.org/2016-gsa-summer/|title=2016 Bel Canto Masterclasses|date=8 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012 she returned to San Francisco Opera to perform in Puccini's ''Tosca''. In an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/buehne/angela-gheorghiu-warum-muss-sie-sterben/51.519.938|title=Angela Gheorghiu: "Warum muss sie sterben?"|first=|last=peter.jarolin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Kurier]]'' from February 2014, Gheorghiu expressed interest in performing the role of Norma and in recording the role of Desdemona (Otello). Her most recent role debut was as Charlotte in Massenet's ''[[Werther]]'' in March 2015 at the [[Vienna State Opera]], to great critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bachtrack.com/kritik-werther-gheorghiu-terzier-chaslin-wien-staatsoper-maerz-2015|title=Aufwühlender Seelenschmerz|website=bachtrack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gheorghiu also performed the role of Charlotte in August 2015 at the [[Salzburg Festival]] in a concert version with great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/klassik/4800481/Festspiele_Werther-als-hoeherer-Naturbursch|title=Festspiele: Werther als höherer Naturbursch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gheorghiu at the Met and elsewhere==
On occasion, Gheorghiu has had difficult relationships with opera house managements and directors. Some, but not all, of them have stemmed from her opposition to directors who, as she put it in an interview with ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' "want to express their own fantasies, forgetting about the characters. At times, she says, what they put on stage goes against both the story and the music."&lt;ref&gt;''"que quiere expresar sus fantasías, olvidándose de los personajes. A veces, lo que se representa en el escenario va en contra de la historia y de la música."'' in Susana Gaviña, [http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-18-05-2007/abc/Espectaculos/yo-tengo-el-control-en-la-opera-angela-gheorghiu-_-soprano_1633176191100.html «Yo tengo el control en la ópera»], ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', May 18, 2007. Retrieved 3 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She has attributed her outspokenness to her upbringing in Romania under the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Because I grew up in a country where there was no possibility of having an opinion, it makes me stronger now. Lots of singers are frightened about not getting invited back to an opera house if they speak out. But I have the courage to be, in a way, revolutionary. I want to fight for opera, for it to be taken seriously. Pop music is for the body, but opera is for the soul."&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Thompson, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1742639.ece Her serene highness], ''[[The Times]]'', May 4, 2007. Retrieved 3 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gheorghiu had a problematic relationship with former [[Metropolitan Opera]] General Manager [[Joseph Volpe (opera manager)|Joseph Volpe]] after her debut there as Mimì in 1993. In 1996, Gheorghiu was cast as Micaela in a new production of [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', opposite [[Waltraud Meier]] and [[Plácido Domingo]]. The production by [[Franco Zeffirelli]] called for Micaela to wear a blonde wig, which Gheorghiu disliked. When the Met toured the production in Japan in 1997, she refused to wear it on the first night to which Volpe famously declared, "The wig is going on, with you or without you" and replaced her with an understudy.&lt;ref name=AT98&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]] (April 4, 1998).

She appeared at the Met again in 1998 for six performances of Gounod's ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' with her husband, tenor Roberto Alagna as Roméo. Volpe had planned to engage Gheorghiu in Violetta Valery for a new production of ''[[La traviata]]'', to premiere in November 1998 and directed by Zeffirelli. Alagna was to sing the role of Violetta's lover, Alfredo Germont. According to Volpe, Gheorghiu and Alagna argued with the staff and the director over production details and continually delayed signing the contract. They eventually signed their contracts, and faxed them to the Met one day past their deadline. Volpe refused to accept them. The production opened with [[Patricia Racette]] and [[Marcelo Álvarez]] as the lovers.&lt;ref name=AT98 /&gt;

Despite these issues, Gheorghiu and Alagna returned to the Metropolitan Opera for five performances of Donizetti's ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' in 1999 and for four performances of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' in 2003. Gheorghiu also performed at the Met as Liù in Puccini's ''[[Turandot]]'' in 2000; as Violetta in ''[[La traviata]]'' opposite [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in 2006 and 2007; as Amelia in Verdi's ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' in 2007; as Mimì in ''[[La bohème]]'' in 2008; as Magda in the 2008/2009 season in the ROH/SFO production of ''[[La rondine]]'', the Met's first performance of the opera since 1936; and for the 2009/2010 season she appeared as Violetta, replacing her previous engagement as Marie Antoinette in a rare revival of [[John Corigliano]]'s ''[[The Ghosts of Versailles]]'', which was replaced due to the recession.

In September 2007, Gheorghiu was dismissed from [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]]'s production of ''La bohème'' by General Manager William Mason, for missing rehearsals and costume fittings, and generally "unprofessional" behavior. Gheorghiu said in a statement that she had missed some rehearsals to spend time with her husband, who was singing at the Met in ''Roméo et Juliette'' and rehearsing for Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and added, "I have sung ''Bohème'' hundreds of times, and thought missing a few rehearsals wouldn't be a tragedy. It was impossible to do the costume fitting at the same time I was in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/28/arts/NA-A-E-MUS-US-Opera-Gheorghiu-Fired.php "Lyric Opera of Chicago fires soprano Angela Gheorghiu"], Associated Press, via ''[[The International Herald Tribune]]'', September 28, 2007.

On December 31, 2008, Gheorghiu premiered the new production of ''La rondine'' at the Metropolitan Opera, together with Roberto Alagna, Marius Brenciu, [[Lisette Oropesa]] and Samuel Ramey.

In March 2011 she cancelled all her scheduled performances of Gounod's ''Roméo et Juliette'' at the Met, citing illness. Only days later she cancelled all her performances in the scheduled new production of ''[[Faust]]'' during the Met's 2011/2012 season. According to her manager, "She felt uncomfortable in the concept". Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said that her frequent cancellations had become "an increasingly difficult problem for (the Met)." Gelb went on to say that, as of then, plans were still in place for Gheorghiu's return to the Met stage. He also said, "This has nothing to do with wigs.".&lt;ref&gt;Wakin, Daniel J..

'''Archduke John of Austria''' ({{lang-de|Erzherzog Johann Baptist Joseph Fabian Sebastian von Österreich}}; 20 January 1782 – 11 May 1859), a member of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], was an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] [[field marshal]] and [[List of German monarchs|imperial regent]] (''Reichsverweser'') of the short-lived [[German Empire (1848/1849)|German Empire]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]].

==Biography==
John was born in [[Florence]], the thirteenth child of the Habsburg grand duke [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold of Tuscany]] and [[Maria Louisa of Spain]]. He was baptized with the name of John Baptist Joseph Fabian Sebastian,{{sfn|Schlossar|1878|p=319}} after the patron saint of the Tuscan capital. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and his family moved from the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] court in Vienna. Only two years later, John's elder brother [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] ascended the Imperial throne.
[[File:Arciduca Giovanni d'Austria.jpg|thumb|left|Archduke John of Austria, {{circa|1799}}]]
John's native language was [[Italian language|Italian]], he learned to speak [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] fluently. Educated by the Swiss historian [[Johannes von Müller]], he developed wide-ranging skills and interests, especially in the history and geography of the [[Alps|Alpine]] countries.

===Military service===
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], John was given command of the [[Military history of Austria|Austrian army]] in September 1800, despite his personal reluctance to assume the position. He showed personal bravery in the [[War of the Second Coalition]], but his troops were crushed at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]] on 3 December. Demoralized by defeat, the army nearly disintegrated in the subsequent retreat, which was only stopped by an armistice arranged on 22 December. After the [[Treaty of Lunéville|Peace of Lunéville]] in 1801, Archduke John was made General Director of the Engineering and Fortification Service, and later commander of the [[Theresian Military Academy]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].

In the [[War of the Third Coalition]], John again fought the [[First French Empire|French]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavarian]] forces. From 1805 he directed an able defence of several [[County of Tyrol|Tyrolean]] passes against the French and was awarded the Commander Cross of the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]]. However, according to the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]], Austria had to cede Tyrol and [[Vorarlberg]] to Bavaria. John remained obliged to Tyrol and maintained friendly contact with Baron [[Joseph Hormayr, Baron zu Hortenburg|Joseph Hormayr]] who forged a resistance movement against the Bavarian occupation. In 1808, John pressed for the creation of Tyrolean [[Landwehr]] forces based on the success of the [[Prussian Army|Prussian Landwehr]], which played a vital role in the [[Tyrolean Rebellion]] led by [[Andreas Hofer]].

At the commencement of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] in 1809 he became commander of the Army of [[Inner Austria]], fighting against the French forces of [[Eugène de Beauharnais]] in Italy. Under his command were the VIII Armeekorps led by [[Albert Gyulai]] and the IX Armeekorps headed by Albert's brother [[Ignaz Gyulai]]. After winning a significant victory at the [[Battle of Sacile]] on 16 April 1809, his army advanced almost to [[Verona]]. Having detached forces to besiege [[Venice]] and other fortresses, John's army was soon outnumbered by Eugène's heavily reinforced host. Worse, news of the Austrian defeat at the [[Battle of Eckmühl]] reached him and compelled him to order a retreat. Before withdrawing, he fought off Franco-Italian attacks at the [[Battle of Caldiero (1809)|Battle of Caldiero]] between 27 and 30 April. Attempting to blunt the Franco-Italian pursuit, he stood to fight on 8 May and was beaten at the [[Battle of Piave River (1809)|Battle of Piave River]]. Trying to defend the entire border, he sent Ignaz Gyulai to defend [[Ljubljana]] (Laibach) in [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]], while holding [[Villach]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] with his own forces. Eugène's pursuit overran the frontier defenses at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1809)|Battle of Tarvis]] and wrecked a column of hoped-for reinforcements at the [[Battle of Sankt Michael]]. Forced to flee northeast into [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], John offered battle again but was defeated at [[Battle of Raab|Raab]] on 14 June 1809. Ordered to join his brother [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] at the [[Battle of Wagram]] on 5 and 6 July, John's small army arrived too late to avert an Austrian defeat. His brother criticized him for tardiness.

After the conclusion of the campaign, John again evolved plans for a widespread rebellion. However, upon the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] Austrian policies under Minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] sought a rapprochement to France. John's friend Baron Hormayr and other conspirators were arrested, the archduke himself effectively was sidelined and retired to his estates in [[Scheiblingkirchen-Thernberg|Thernberg]].

John, tired of warfare, turned away from the military and developed a great interest for nature, technology and agriculture. He collected [[minerals]] and was active as an [[alpinist]] and [[hunter]] in the [[Duchy of Styria]]. In his early days Archduke Johann and his brother [[Archduke Louis of Austria|Louis]] had the habit of travelling to France, where the latter married [[Castle of Boisclaireau|Madame de Gueroust]]. In 1815, on his visit to the [[United Kingdom]], John received a ''Doctor honoris causa'' degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Schlossar|1878|p=319}}

In the history of Styria, he is remembered as a great modernizer and became an important figure of identification for Styrians. His proximity to the people is given evidence to by his many contacts with the common man, by wearing the local [[Tracht]], the ''Steireranzug'', and by collecting and promoting the material and spiritual culture of the country. 
In 1811, he founded the [[Landesmuseum Joanneum|Joanneum Museum]] in [[Graz]] and the predecessor of [[Graz University of Technology]]. Some other foundations were initiated by him, such as the Styrian State Archive 1817, the ''Steiermärkisch-Ständische Montanlehranstalt'', which was founded in 1840 in Vordernberg and later became the [[University of Leoben]], the Styrian Society for Agriculture 1819, the Mutual Fire Insurance, the Styrian Building Society, the ''Landesoberrealschule'' in 1845 and the Society for Styrian History in 1850. His routing of the [[Austrian Southern Railway]] from [[Vienna]] to [[Triest]] over the [[Semmering Pass]] and through the [[Mur River|Mura]] and [[Mürz]] valleys to Graz is particularly notable. The inheritance of his maternal uncle Duke [[Albert Casimir, Duke of Teschen|Albert Casimir of Teschen]] enabled him to acquire a [[tin]] factory in Krems near [[Voitsberg]] and coal mines near [[Köflach]], thereby he also became an industrialist. In 1840, he bought the [[Stainz]] dominion, where he was also freely elected as mayor in 1850. He was already the lord of the Brandhof manor in [[Mariazell]].

In 1829, he married {{Interlanguage link multi|Anna Plochl|de}} (1804-1885), the daughter of Jakob Plochl, [[postmaster]] of [[Bad Aussee|Aussee]], and his wife Maria Anna Pilz, during a nocturnal ceremony in Brandhof. By this [[morganatic marriage]], John was excluded from succession to the throne. Emperor Francis elevated Anna to a "Baroness of Brandhofen" in 1834 and in 1839 she gave birth to a son, [[Franz, Count of Meran|Franz]], the only child from the marriage. His descendants were styled "Counts of Meran" and "Barons of Brandhofen", Proprietors of Stainz and Brandhofen.

John was also a passionate mountaineer in the [[Eastern Alps]] and attempted to be the first to climb the [[Großvenediger]]. For that reason, the Erzherzog-Johann-Hütte (''Adlersruhe'') at the [[Grossglockner]], and the [[Nigritella|Archduke John's Vanilla Orchid]] (''Nigritella rubra'' subsp. ''archiducis-joannis''), an [[orchid]] growing on mountain meadows, are named after him.

===Imperial regent===
Even though Johann did not consider himself a [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]], he promoted some liberal ideas. He was often in conflict with the Habsburg court, especially because of his morganatic marriage, though he never openly rebelled. He had earned great recognition in the Styrian lands, moreover he gained general acceptance by his jovial manners and his marriage with a middle-class woman.

Upon the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|March Revolution of 1848]], the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] discussed the appointment of an all-[[German Confederation|German]] government replacing the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]]. On a proposal by the liberal politician [[Heinrich von Gagern]], the assembly on 28 June 1848 voted for the establishment of a central authority (''[[Provisorische Zentralgewalt]]'') and on the next day a broad majority elected Archduke John [[regent]] of the realm (''Reichsverweser'').

Archduke John accepted the nomination as [[head of state|head]] of the short-lived [[German Empire (1848/1849)|German Empire]] and on 12 July 1848 the delegates of the Federal Convention, in response to public pressure, ceded their powers to him. On July 15, he appointed the ministers [[Anton von Schmerling]], [[Johann Gustav Heckscher]] and Eduard von Peucker to office, completed by Prince [[Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen|Carl of Leiningen]] as minister president and [[head of government]]. Nevertheless, his political office did not offer many opportunities, though all laws had to be signed by him. 

First attempts by the government to obtain supreme command of the [[German Federal Army]] faced entrenched resistance from the member states. To strengthen support, the left-wing politician [[Robert von Mohl]] joined the Leiningen Cabinet on August 9. Leiningen himself resigned on September 6, after the Frankfurt assembly rejected to ratify the armistice of Malmö, signed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] during the [[First Schleswig War]]. Minister Anton von Schmerling acted as head of government, until from November 1848 the cabinet gradually lost the support of the centrist [[Casino faction]] and finally its majority in parliament. Schmerling was forced to resign and on December 17, Archduke John had to appoint Heinrich von Gagern new minister president, though he opposed his '[[Lesser Germany|Lesser German]]' ideas. 

Archduke John did not take part in the draft of the [[Frankfurt Constitution]], which was adopted on 28 March 1849 after lengthy negotiations led by Gagern, and he pronounced against the strong position of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. Determined to resign, he was once more turned over by the ministers. When in April 1849 King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] disappointed Gagern's hopes and openly rejected the Constitution, Archduke John remained passive and Gagern handed in his resignation on May 10. John insisted that he would exert central authority out of a sense of obligation, nevertheless he departed for a prolonged stay at the health resort of [[Bad Gastein]]. After the final failure of the March Revolution, he finally resigned from his office on 20 December 1849.

When Archduke Johann came back to Frankfurt on a visit in 1858, he openly regretted the failure of the German unification. He died in 1859 in Graz, where a fountain erected in his honour (''illustration'') dominates the central square. He is buried in [[Schenna]] near [[Meran]]. He was the great-grandfather of noted conductor [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] (1929–2016).

'''Basil Lewis D'Oliveira''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Order of Ikhamanga|OIS]] (4 October 1931 – 19 November 2011)&lt;ref name="Cap"&gt;{{cite book |title=If The Cap Fits |last=Bateman |first=Colin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Tony Williams Publications |location= |isbn=1-869833-21-X |page=52 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[England cricket team|England]] international cricketer of South African [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] background, whose potential selection by England for the scheduled 1968–69 tour of [[apartheid]]-era South Africa caused the [[D'Oliveira affair]]. Nicknamed "Dolly",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/19112011/58/basil-d-oliveira-dies-aged-80.html|title=Yahoo UK &amp; Ireland - Sports News {{!}} Live Scores {{!}} Results|website=Yahoo Sports|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira played [[county cricket]] for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] from 1964 to 1980, and appeared for England in 44 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] and four [[One Day International]]s between 1966 and 1972.

==Early life==
Born into a religious [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family of [[Indian-Portuguese]] descent in [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], [[Cape Town]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/sports/cricket/basil-doliveira-a-symbol-for-cricket-and-for-equality-dies-at-80.html Obituary], ''New York Times'', 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/basil-d-rsquo-oliveira-the-man-who-triggered-the-international-cricket-boycott-of-south-africa-31689|title=Basil D’Oliveira: The man who triggered the international cricket boycott of South Africa|last=Sengupta|first=Arunabha|publisher=Cricket County|date=4 October 2013|accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a boy he would make his way down to the [[Newlands Cricket Ground]] in Cape Town, and climb the trees outside to watch the games.&lt;ref name=BBC15804126/&gt;

D'Oliveira captained South Africa's national non-white cricket team, and also played [[Association football|football]] for the non-white national side.&lt;ref name="cricpro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/PLAYERS/ENG/D/DOLIVEIRA_BL_01001283/|title=Player Profile: Basil D'Oliveira|last=Thicknesse|first=John|work=CricInfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
With the support of [[John Arlott]], and the members and supporters of St Augustine's Cricket Club in Cape Town, he emigrated to England in 1960, where the journalist [[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]] found him a place in his [[Central Lancashire Cricket League|Central Lancashire League]] team of [[Middleton Cricket Club|Middleton]].&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt;  D'Oliveira noted his surprise at seeing white people doing menial work, and waiting on him in restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20050625006302200.htm&amp;date=tss2826/&amp;prd=tss&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[first-class cricket|first-class]] county team [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club]] in 1964, and became a British citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|author=Rob Steen|title=D'Oliveira, Basil Lewis (1931?–2011)|date= Jan 2015 |id= 104335|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/dnb/104335.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he was selected for the [[England cricket team]] as an [[all-rounder]] to face the West Indians in the second Test. He made a solid debut, scoring 27 before being run out, and returning bowling figures of 1 for 24 and 1 for 46 in 39 overs. In the third Test he scored 76 and 54, while capturing 2 wickets for 51 and 2 for 77 at [[Trent Bridge]]; though the West Indies cantered to a 139-run victory. He contributed a fighting 88 in the fourth Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], although England once again lost, by an innings and 55 runs. D'Oliveira was quietly efficient in the final Test as England turned the tables on the West Indies, winning by an innings and 34 runs to lose the series 3-1. Against India he hit 109 in the first Test where England won by six wickets and went on to win the series 3-0. Facing Pakistan he hit fifties in both innings of the first Test, in a series that England won 2-0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safrica.info/about/sport/greats/doliveira.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] for 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154547.html|title=Basil D'Oliveira|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next up was an away series against the West Indies, early in 1968. D'Oliveira didn't turn in his best showing in the five matches, scoring only 137 runs at an average of 27.4. He did a lot of bowling, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, it was time for a five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D'Oliveira's top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the subsequent three Tests. He was recalled by the selectors for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968–69 Test series in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt; He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country.

He was selected in June 1969 to face the West Indies, this time in a three-Test series. He followed that with a three-match series against New Zealand and then a seven-Test Ashes series in Australia, in which he scored 369 runs at an average of 36.9, including 117 in the fifth Test at the MCG.

England then went to New Zealand for two Tests, with D'Oliveira scoring 100 in the first one and 58 and five in the second. Pakistan next visited England in 1971, and D'Oliveira enjoyed a fine series with the bat, making 241 runs at an average of 60.25. He was below par in the three-Test series against India that followed, but was in better form for the visit of Australia in June 1972.

D'Oliveira completed his career having played 41 Tests. He scored 2484 runs at an average of 40.06, with five centuries and 15 fifties. He also captured 47 wickets at 39.55.

==Playing style and personality==
D'Oliveira was a successful batsman with a low backlift and powerful strokes.&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt; He was also a tough competitor. When he toured [[English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71|Australia in 1970–71]] on the night after they won the series 2–0 he pushed his forefinger into the chest of every Australian he met, saying "We stuffed you."&lt;ref name="snow"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cricket Rebel |last=Snow |first=John | authorlink =John Snow (cricketer)|year=1976 |publisher=Hamlyn |location= |isbn=0-6003-1932-6 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanting to play international cricket, D'Oliveira was somewhat cagey about his date of birth. After his death, journalist [[Pat Murphy (sports journalist)|Pat Murphy]] with whom he collaborated on his autobiography stated:&lt;ref name=BBC15804126/&gt;
{{cquote|Basil had to lie about his age because he thought if they realised how old he was they would not pick him for England. So he came down from born in 1935 at that time, solidifying his place in the team as 1933 born and when I wrote his book in 1980 he finally conceded he was born in 1928. So by my calculation he was 38 when he first played for England in 1966 and 83 when he died.}}

==The D'Oliveira Affair==
{{main|D'Oliveira affair}}
South African cricket officials in 1968 realised that the inclusion of D'Oliveira in the England squad would lead to the cancellation of the tour, and probable exclusion of South Africa from Test cricket. This exerted pressure on the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) hierarchy leading to the decision not to pick him, which was felt by opponents of apartheid to be a way of keeping cricket links with South Africa open. There was dissent in the press to this course of events and when [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire's]] [[Tom Cartwright]] was ruled out because of injury, D'Oliveira was called up into the squad.&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt; South African prime minister [[B. J. Vorster]] had already made it clear that D'Oliveira's inclusion was not acceptable, and despite many negotiations the tour was cancelled; South Africa was excluded from Test cricket for 22 years. This was seen as a [[wiktionary:Watershed|watershed]] in the [[sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of South African Cricket |author= Jon Gemmell|year= 2004|publisher=Routledge (UK)|url=https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-7146-5346-2&amp;id=CTIZdi9DjBQC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22Basil+D%27Oliveira%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html|isbn=0-7146-5346-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The D'Oliveira Affair had a massive impact in turning international opinion against the apartheid regime in South Africa. It prompted changes in South African sport and eventually in society. The events of 1968 were dramatized on BBC Radio 4 in April 2009 in a play by Christopher Douglas entitled ''Dolly''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jngcx|title=BBC Radio 4 - Afternoon Drama, Christopher Douglas - Dolly|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-17}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2000, he was nominated as one of 10 South African cricketers of the century, despite not having played for South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3818857.stm|title=D'Oliveira exposed apartheid disgrace|last=Gough|first=Martin|date=29 November 2004|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a perpetual trophy was struck for Test series between England and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], and named the [[Basil D'Oliveira Trophy]]. In 2005, he was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[British honours system|Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4078158.stm|title=D'Oliveira 'proud' to get honour |date=10 June 2005|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a stand at [[New Road, Worcester]], was named in his honour.

In 1980 after the end of his playing career, he wrote an autobiography with the BBC's [[Pat Murphy (sports journalist)|Pat Murphy]], titled ''Time to Declare''. In it, he stated for the first time that he was glad that the proposed South African cricket tour to England in 1970 was called off, for fear of public disturbances.&lt;ref name=BBC15804126&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/15804126.stm | work=BBC News | title=D'Oliveira was a hero - Murphy | date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, journalist [[Peter Oborne]] wrote a biography entitled ''Basil D'Oliveira: Cricket and Conspiracy'' ({{ISBN|0-3167-2572-2}}), which  was awarded the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4052663.stm |title=Book on D'Oliveira wins award  |work=[[BBC News]] |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=201-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and was accompanied by [[Paul Yule]]'s RTS award-winning documentary ''Not Cricket—The Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{BBC programmes|b0074qcq|The Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|422843|Not Cricket: The Basil d'Oliveira Conspiracy (2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married to Naomi, and their son [[Damian D'Oliveira]] also played first-class cricket for Worcestershire, while his younger brother [[Ivan D'Oliveira|Ivan]] played briefly for [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]].&lt;ref name="cricpro" /&gt;  His grandson [[Brett D'Oliveira]] is currently contracted with Worcestershire and made his debut for the county in 2011.

==Death==
D'Oliveira had [[Parkinson's disease]] in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basildoliveira.com/about/family/naomis-story/|title=Naomi’s Story|accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died aged 80 in England, on 19 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/541152.html |title=England news: Basil D'Oliveira dies aged 80 &amp;#124; England Cricket News |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date= |accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/Basil-dOliveira-passes-away-20111119 |title=Basil d'Oliveira dies: Sport: Cricket |publisher=Sport24.co.za |date= |accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/15803140.stm|title=England legend D'Oliveira dies|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date= 19 November 2011|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A farewell for D'Oliveira was written on the last 2011 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine by [[Trevor Manuel]], [[South Africa's Minister in the Presidency for National Planning]]. It highlights the personal successes of the cricket player, together with the impact he had on South African sport and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101745_2102136_2102479,00.html | work=Time | title=Person Of The Year 2011 | date=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 he was posthumously awarded the Freedom of the City of Worcester in recognition of his contribution to the city. The award was accepted by his son Shaun at a ceremony in the Guildhall in Worcester on 14 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worcester.gov.uk/news-alerts/-/blogs/cricket-legend-basil-d-oliveira-to-receive-posthumous-freedom-of-city|title=Cricket legend Basil D'Oliveira to receive posthumous Freedom of City|date=2018-09-07|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-45535246|title=Basil D'Oliveira awarded freedom of Worcester|date=2018-09-15|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manyolo, a [[Baganda|Muganda]] and one of ten children, studied art at the School of Fine Art at [[Makerere College]]. Later in her career she worked as an artist for Uganda's Department of Health. Several of her linocut prints, along with an oil painting, were exhibited through the [[Harmon Foundation]] beginning in 1961; her work was also included in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibit of Contemporary African Printmakers from 1966 until 1968.&lt;ref name="Brown1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Evelyn S.

==Foundations==
The Birla family belongs to the [[Maheshwari]] subcaste of the [[Vaishya]] (trader) caste, and are [[Marwari people|Marwari]] since they hail from the [[Marwad]] region of present-day [[Rajasthan]]. Specifically, the family originates from the town of [[Pilani]] in the [[Shekhawati]] region lying between Marwad.

===Shiv Narayan Birla===
In Pilani during the early 19th century lived Seth Shobharam, grandson of Seth Bhudharmal, a local tradesman of modest means.&lt;ref&gt;Maheshwari Jati Ka Itihas, Maheshwari History Office, Bhanpura,   Birla, June 1940, p. 183–190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDlj7rwlDK0C&amp;pg=PT684&amp;lpg=PT684&amp;dq=birla+daughters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c8DJbj8f7J&amp;sig=iLvCokhf2N03_-OBQhAlHW6X5dM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q1JJVa28AoiZyATZ54GQCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=birla+daughters&amp;f=false|title=Brushes With History|first=Krishna Kumar|last=Birla|date=17 April 2009|publisher=Penguin UK|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his son, Seth Shiv Narayana (1840–1909), who first ventured outside Pilani. At this time, Ahmedabad was the railhead which serviced trade from a large region of northwest India. Goods (mainly cotton) would be brought from the hinterland to the city and sent from there by train to Bombay for export to England and other countries. Several cotton ginning units were also set up in Ahmedabad, to clean the cotton before shipment to England. Shiv Narayana  Birla was one of the early Indian traders to participate in this cotton trade. Later, Britain vigorously fostered the trade of opium with China and developed the cultivation of poppy in India. The [[Ratlam]]-[[Mandsaur]] region (not far from Ahemdabad) became prime poppy cropland due to suitable soil and climate. Shiv Narayan Birla and his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, made an enormous fortune by trading opium with China, and this formed the basis of the family's fortune.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; With growing wealth and increasing confidence, Shiv Narayana Birla moved up the value chain and began chartering cargo ships in partnership with other Marwadi tradesmen to trade opium with China, thus by-passing British middlemen. To facilitate this, he moved to Bombay in 1863.

===Baldeo Das Birla===
Shiv Narain Birla had one overwhelming sorrow in his life: he had no children. By the early 1880s, Shiv narayan (Narain) had passed on the baton of his business interests to his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, established Shivnarayan Baldevdas, a trading house based in Bombay. His son, Baldeo Das Birla moved to Calcutta set up Baldevdas Jugalkishor in 1887.
Baldeo Das was succeeded by four sons&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhe3-G5aBkg|title=The story of the Birla empire by Talveen Singh- Part I|first=|last=Aditya Birla Group|date=31 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;– Jugal Kishore, Rameshwar Das, [[Ghanshyam Das Birla|Ghanshyam Das]] and Braj Mohan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20Strategy3/BSTA034.htm The Birla Family Crisis - Case Studies, Case Study in Business, Management|Case Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221045/http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20Strategy3/BSTA034.htm |date=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/battle-for-m.p.-birla-fortune-icai-indicts-lodhas/1/175181.html|title=Battle for Billions: Birlas vs Lodhas|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/What-keeps-the-Marwaris-thriving/articleshow/35380786.cms|title=What keeps the Marwaris thriving? - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldeo Das was awarded the Raibahadur title in 1917. In 1920 he retired from business and started living in Banares pursuing religious studies. In 1925 he was awarded the title of "Raja" by the government of Bihar and Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Entrepreneurship of Shekhawati Marwaris, D.K. Taknet, Kumar Prakashan, Jaipur, 1987, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded D. Litt. by Beneras Hindu University.

===Ghanshyam Das Birla===
Ghanshyam Das Birla laid the foundation of his industrial empire by establishing GM Birla Company, trading in [[jute]], in 1911. The [[First World War]] began in 1914 greatly increasing the demand for jute sacks. During the war the Birla's worth is estimated to have risen from 2 million rupees to 8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcbBEHHI-90C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=India's Industrialists|first1=Margaret|last1=Herdeck|first2=Gita|last2=Piramal|date=9 July 1985|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, he became among the first group of Indian entrepreneurs to become owner of a Jute mill named [[Birla Corporation|Birla Jute]].&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/corporate-dossier/family-spirit-and-frugality-help-the-birlas-keep-pace-with-changing-times/articleshow/41702203.cms?intenttarget=no|title='Family' spirit and frugality help the Birlas keep pace with changing times|date=6 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years he acquired several cotton mills. He later started several sugar mills. The publication [[Hindustan Times]] was co-founded by GD Birla in 1924 and fully acquired by him in 1933.  [[Hindustan Motors]] was started in 1942. After India's independence in 1947 he started [[Grasim]] (Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing, 1948) and [[Hindalco]] (Hindustan Aluminium Company 1958) among others.

Baldeo Das, as well his sons were among the key supporters of the [[swaraj]] movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, in addition to being dedicated Hindu activists. They were active supporters of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] founded by Pt. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and were also financial supporters of activities initiated by Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Business Legends, Gita Piramal, Penguin UK, Dec 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Laxminarayan Temple]] in Delhi was built by Jugal Kishore Birla and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi and as asked by Mahatma, all Hindus, including [[harijan]]s were welcomed in this temple.

In the few decades before India's independence, Indian merchants, including the Birlas, made successful attempts to enter and acquire industries in India which were once dominated by [[Scot]]s from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/01/02/archives/british-investors-see-peril-in-india-managing-agents-fear-loss-of.html|title=British Investors See Peril in India – Managing Agents Fear Loss of Immense Profits on Half of Country's Industries – Natives Seek Business – Huge Sterling Credits Already Available to Buy Out the Foreign Companies|first=Herbert L.|last=Matthews|date=2 January 1943|page=5| work=New York Times|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a part of Mahatma Gandhi's [[Swadeshi]] movement.

Birlas remained close to some of the leaders of India, like [[Sardar Patel]] after India's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Debajyoti Burman, Mystery of Birla House, Jugabani Hahitya Chakara, 3rd reprint 1951, P. 111&lt;/ref&gt; As leading industrialists, they were often accused by the leftists of exploiting their workers and aspiring to be among the richest in the world. Still when [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]] became the chief minister of Kerala (1957–59), as a result of the first elected Marxist government anywhere, Birlas were invited to establish a pulp factory there.&lt;ref&gt;Phrases And Facts: About Kerala, Partha Choudhuri, Liberation, Vol. II, No. 3 (January 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent past, the Birlas, as well as several other Indian industrialists have expanded overseas.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Gandhi at the Laxminarayan Temple.jpg|thumbnail|right| [[Gandhi]] inaugurating the [[Laxminarayan Temple]], Delhi, 1938, with the Birla family (Jugalkishor, Rameshwardas, Ghanshyamdas in black caps, Baldevdas in turban]]

Birla philanthropy began in the 1880s, when the Birla family donated over 100,000 rupees for setting up goshalas (shelters for the protection of cows) in Kolkata. By early 1900, the Birla family began to support education, influenced by  Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. They supported educational charities in Kolkata and in Mumbai teaming up with [[Jamnalal Bajaj]]. In 1918, the family established the first high school in Pilani which evolved into [[BITS Pilani]], which now has branches in Hyderabad, Goa and Dubai. They also opened a Sanskrit library in Benares and a library in Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Specials/XaccWERecP1ckwaJ4spx5O/Rajashree-Birla--Giving-is-in-fact-living.html|title=Rajashree Birla - Giving is in fact living|first=Rajashree|last=Birla|date=3 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known for the financial support of Indian's freedom struggle and for building temples (see [[Birla Temple]]) in several major Indian cities.

==Birla values==

In a letter, Ghanshaym Das offered this advice to Aditya (his grandson) when he was studying at MIT: 
:“eat only vegetarian food, never drink alcohol or smoke, keep early hours, marry young, switch-off lights when leaving the room, cultivate regular habits, go for a walk everyday, keep in touch with the family, and above all, don’t be extravagant.” &lt;ref&gt;India's Industrialists, Volume 1,
Margaret Herdeck, Gita Piramal, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1985 p.&amp;nbsp;97&lt;/ref&gt;

GD Birla instructed his son Basant Kumar to 'never utilize wealth only for fun and frolic,' to 'spend the bare minimum on yourself,' and to deride 'worldly pleasures.'&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

This  advice symbolised the ethic of the rising Marwari community, with restraint and austerity its defining attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gurcharandas.org/node/634|title=Marwari ethic and the spirit of Capitalism - Gurcharan Das|website=gurcharandas.org|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birla Family ties==

Although the Birlas are perceived as a single entity, the different branches of the family are now financially independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2004/08/26/stories/2004082602130600.htm|title=The Hindu Business Line : `Mahatma was witness  to Birla clan partition'|first=|last=cakml|website=www.thehindubusinessline.com|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/after-months-of-tension-birlas-part-ways-amicably/1/337575.html|title=After months of tension, Birlas part ways amicably|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they have continued to maintain family relationships that go back to the times when "Birla Brothers" were an actual entity and Raja Baldevdas was still alive.

Both of GD Birla's wives died early because of tuberculosis (He remarried after the death of his first wife), a common affliction at that time. The families of his brothers [[Ghanshyam Das Birla#Family history|Brij Mohan and Rameshwar Das Birla helped in raising his children]]. When Yash Birla's parents died in a plane crash, Priyamvada Birla, ("Badi Ma") helped take care of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/yash-gets-candid/article5875980.ece|title=Yash gets candid|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that Kumar Mangalam Birla had dipped into his own resources to help his beleaguered relative Yash with his financial issues with creditors, in order to preserve the family name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/family-values/238587|title=Family Values|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Tata-Birla" word pair==
For many decades the extreme wealth in India was associated with the Tatas and Birlas. The words Tata-Birla were often used together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/news/columns/below-the-belt/capitalists-of-the-world-unite-4323.html Capitalists of the world, unite!

Ltd., Delhi, India|last=9811747788|website=www.businessandeconomy.org|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan for development of India was developed by a group of industrialists in 1944, which was termed the Tata-Birla plan or the Bombay plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLvyf6jQYqYC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Tata+Birla&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8a8YVYHjLtPaoASit4DgBA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tata+Birla&amp;f=false|title=Tata Consultancy Services Story- and Beyond|first=Subramaniam|last=Ramadorai|date=9 July 2017|publisher=Penguin Books India|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is said to have served as a blueprint for India's [[Five-Year Plans of India#First Plan .281951-1956.29|first five-year plan]].

Two South India comedy movies [[Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila]] and [[Tata Birla]] use the word pair. It also occurs in some songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/tata-birla-song-is-not-meant-to-disrespect-anyone-prakash-jha/297699-8-66.html|title=News18.com: CNN News18 Latest News, Breaking News India, Current News Headlines|website=News18|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her graduation with a BSc degree in geology, she was hired full-time as a geologist. Her responsibilities include reviewing the work plans submitted by the oil companies to make sure the plans are efficient and geologically, environmentally and commercially "viable". If all the criteria are met, permission to proceed with drilling is granted. In this capacity, she interacts with [[corporate executive]]s of international oil companies, on the best plan of action.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-amusugut-833a6440/ | title=Cathy Amusugut, Geologist at Petroleum Exploration and Production Department, Uganda Ministry of Energy and Minerals | date=8 November 2017 |accessdate=8 November 2017 |publisher=[[Linkedin.com]] | author=Cathy Amusugut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christoph Sutter''' (born 20 March 1973)&lt;ref name="up.ethz.ch"/&gt; is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] carbon expert and [[entrepreneur]]. Christoph attended the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] where he studied for an MSc in Environmental Science (1993–1999) and a Master of Didactics on Environmental Science. He also concluded his PhD on the Topic "Sustainability Assessment of CDM Projects under the Kyoto Protocol" there. His thesis was awarded the ETH medal for the best PhD thesis in 2003.&lt;ref name="up.ethz.ch"/&gt; He completed his education with a McKinsey mini MBA in Toronto in Summer 2005.

After working for the consultancy Ernst Basler &amp; Partner in Zurich during his studies he was part of setting up the [[myclimate]] foundation based on his PhD results. Myclimate is an offset provider for the voluntary offsetting market, focused on [[CDM Gold Standard]] Certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nachhaltigkeit.org/200911113422/mensch-gesellschaft/interviews/klimamarkt-braucht-klare-signale |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214170120/http://www.nachhaltigkeit.org/200911113422/mensch-gesellschaft/interviews/klimamarkt-braucht-klare-signale |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this activity, Christoph was called to work for the [[UNFCCC]] Methodology Panel in 2005 where he worked for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzz.ch/vermittler_zwischen_umwelt_und_wirtschaft-1.812553|title=Vermittler zwischen Umwelt und Wirtschaft - NZZ|date=21 August 2008|publisher=|via=NZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unsatisfied with the exclusive focus on voluntary offsetting, he later founded the company [http://www.southpolecarbon.com] [[South Pole Carbon]] with his former colleagues Thomas Camerata and [[Renat Heuberger]].

He was Co-CEO of South Pole Carbon Asset Management Ltd from 2006 until 2012, but continue to act as non-executive chairman and shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203030354/http://www.southpolecarbon.com:80/media/archive_news|title=Archive – News - South Pole Carbon|date=3 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 1 June 2012 he joined Swiss power generator Axpo as Head of Asset Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/1999/issuu.com/carbon-tradingmagazine/docs/carbon_trading_june_2012#d604c21a-a326-11e1-bc49-12313b063a65|title=ISSUU - Page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded as one of the WEF [[Young Global Leaders]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirtschaft.ch/WEF+nominiert+Christoph+Sutter+als+Young+Global+Leader/374795/detail.htm|title=WEF nominiert Christoph Sutter als Young Global Leader|first=VADIAN.NET|last=AG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Christoph is actively engaged in the work-life balance community, as he reduced his workload to 80%, taking off on Fridays, after the birth of his son.&lt;ref name="karriere-journal.monster.de"/&gt;

The '''Coptic diaspora''' consists of [[Copts]] who live outside of their primary area of residence within parts of present-day [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Sudan]].

The number of Copts outside [[Egypt]] has sharply increased since the 1960s. The largest Coptic diaspora populations are [[Coptic Americans|in the United States]], [[Coptic Canadians|in Canada]] and [[Coptic Australians|in Australia]], but Copts have a presence in many other countries.

{{Copts}}

[[Copts in Egypt]] make up about 5-20% of the population.{{refn|Independent estimates of the size of the Egyptian Coptic population vary. The ''Oxford Handbook of Global Religions'' reports: "There are conflicting estimates for the size of Egypt's Coptic population. As is often the case with minorities, official counts tend to underestimate their size, while the minority group inflates its own numbers."&lt;ref&gt;Juan E. Campo &amp; John Iskander, "The Coptic Community" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions'' (ed. Mark Juergensmeyer:  Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported in 2004 that Copts make up between 5% and 10% of the Egyptian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egyptian Coptic protesters freed |first= |last= |newspaper=BBC |date=22 December 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4117831.stm |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' reported a 2012 estimate that the Christian community in Egypt (including both Copts and non-Copts) is about 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html |title=Egypt |author= |date= |work=The World Factbook |publisher=[[CIA]] |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 report by the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] reported that "Christians make up 10-20 percent of Egypt's population of seventy-seven million, though precise estimates of the number of Copts vary widely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2386 |title=The Copts and Their Political Implications in Egypt |author=Khairi Abaza and Mark Nakhla |date=25 October 2005 |work= |publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

[[Copts in Sudan]] make up about half a million or 1% of Sudanese population.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"&gt;Minority Rights Group International, World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Sudan : Copts, 2008, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749ca6c.html [accessed 21 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 60,000 [[Copts in Libya]], making up the majority of [[Christianity in Libya|that country's Christian community]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason Morgan et al., ''Culture and Customs of Libya'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 60,000 [[Copts in Libya]], 1% of Libyan population, &lt;ref&gt;[http://i-cias.com/e.o/coptic_c.htm Looklex Encyclopedia: 1% of Libya's population (6 million), or 60,000 people in Libya, adhere to the Coptic Orthodox faith]&lt;/ref&gt; making up the majority of [[Christianity in Libya|that country's Christian community]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason Morgan et al., ''Culture and Customs of Libya'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the traditional Coptic areas in Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the largest Coptic diaspora populations are [[Coptic Americans|in the United States]], [[Coptic Canadians|in Canada]] and [[Coptic Australians|in Australia]].&lt;ref name="Gabra"&gt;"Diaspora, Copts in the" at ''The A to Z of the Coptic Church'' (ed. Gawdat Gabra: [[Scarecrow Press]], 2009), pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one scholar: "Estimations of the actual number of Egyptian Copts (and their descendants leaving abroad vary enormously, with those circulated by Coptic expatriate activists. The biggest Coptic community abroad, that of the United States, included up to 1,000,000 persons in the late 2010s according to Coptic advocacy groups, but only 300,000 according to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States]] itself, and even less&amp;mdash;roughly between 100,000 and 200,000--according to the scarce statistical evidence supplied by the Egyptian and U.S. governments."&lt;ref name="Elsässer"/&gt; Smaller communities of Copts exist [[Copts in Australia|in Australia]] (estimated 32,000 in 2006)&lt;ref name="Elsässer"/&gt; and in Canada (estimates vary: one 2001 estimate placed the population at 10,000&lt;ref name="Elsässer"/&gt; while a 1995 estimate placed the population at 50,000&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;). Smaller communities (under 10,000 people) exist in Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy.&lt;ref name="Elsässer"/&gt; 

In 2009 one scholar placed the total Coptic population of [[North America]] at more than 500,000.&lt;ref name="Shami"&gt;Seteney Shami, "'Aqualliyya/Minority in Modern Egyptian Discourse" in ''Words in Motion: Toward a Global Lexicon'' (eds. Carol Gluck &amp; Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing: Duke University Press, 2009), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, it was reported that there were "over eighty Coptic churches, two theological colleges, and a monastery in the United States in Canada; twenty-five churches, a theological college, three schools, and two monasteries in Australia, and thirty churches and two monasteries in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Friedrich August Meinardus, ''Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity'' ([[American University in Cairo Press]]: 1999), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Coptic presence in [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], and well as the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], such as the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Friedrich August Meinardus, ''Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity'' ([[American University in Cairo Press]]: 1999), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Coptic presence (due to recent missionary work) in the [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries of Zambia, Kenya, Zaire, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Friedrich August Meinardus, ''Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity'' ([[American University in Cairo Press]]: 1999), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and history of the Coptic diaspora==
The Coptic diaspora began primarily in the 1950s as result of [[discrimination]], [[persecution of Copts]] and low income in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Shami"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afe Adogame, ''The African Christian Diaspora: New Currents and Emerging Trends in World Christianity'' ([[A &amp; C Black]], 2013), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;Ken Parry, ''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] rose to power, economic and social conditions deteriorated and many wealthier Egyptians, especially Copts, emigrated to Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Parry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabra"/&gt; Emigration increased following the [[1967 Arab-Israeli war]], and the emigration of poorer and less-educated Copts increased after 1972, when the [[World Council of Churches]] and other religious groups began assisting Copt immigration.&lt;ref name="Parry"/&gt; Emigration of Egyptian Copts increased under [[Anwar al-Sadat]] (with many taking advantage of Sadat's "[[Infitah|open door]]" policy to leave the country) and under [[Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref name="Gabra"/&gt;

Many Copts are university graduates in the professions, such as medicine and engineering.&lt;ref name="Gabra"/&gt;

'''Daniel Lind Lagerlöf''' (born 6 February 1969; missing since 6 October 2011) is a [[presumed dead]] [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[film director|director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film producer|producer]]

== Career ==
Lagerlöf began his work in television as an assistant, and directed his first film, ''Föreställningen'' (''The Performance'') in 1990. In 1997 he began working on ''Skärgårdsdoktorn'', a highly successful drama series in Sweden and Norway. After it ended in 2000, Lagerlöf worked on several ''Beck''-films, before returning to television. His last completed project was the three-part mini-series ''Bibliotekstjuven'' (the Library Thief), written by his wife Malin Lagerlöf.

== Personal life ==
Lagerlöf met his wife, Malin Lagerlöf, in the early 1990s, and they married soon after. They had three children together. A screenwriter, Malin Lagerlöf often wrote projects for her husband to direct, including his final series, ''Bibliotekstjuven''.

== Disappearance ==
On 6 October 2011, Lagerlöf disappeared during preparations for the filming of [[Camilla Läckberg]]'s ''[[Fjällbackamorden]] - Strandriddaren'' while scouting a planned filming location in the Tjurpannan nature reserve, leaving a wife and three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/gt/malins-man-forsvann-finns-mycket-hopp/|title=Malins man försvann: "Finns mycket hopp"|access-date=2018-08-28|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed Lagerlöf was caught on slippery rocks by large waves sweeping the area and pulled out to sea near the steep cliffs outside [[Tanumshede]] in [[Bohuslän]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/gt/malins-man-forsvann-finns-mycket-hopp/|title=Malins man försvann: "Finns mycket hopp"|access-date=2018-08-28|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no witnesses to what actually happened. {{as of|2016}} no remains have been found, and Lagerlöf is presumed deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article13750407.ab |title=Försvann vid havet: Regissören Daniel Lind Lagerlöf försvunnen |trans-title=Vanished at Sea: Director Daniel Lind Lagerlöf missing |date=9 October 2011 |work=[[Aftonbladet]] |accessdate=28 June 2014 |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Roxborough |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/swedish-director-david-lind-lagerlof-246078 |title=Swedish Director David Lind Lagerlof Still Missing, Presumed Dead |accessdate=21 June 2012 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="screendaily"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gunnar |last=Rehlin |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/europe/swedish-director-lagerlof-presumed-dead-after-location-scouting-accident/5033090.article |title=Swedish director Lagerlof presumed dead after location scouting accident |accessdate=21 June 2012 |work=[[Screen Daily]] |date=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101095426/http://www.screendaily.com/news/europe/swedish-director-lagerlof-presumed-dead-after-location-scouting-accident/5033090.article |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dany Chamoun''' ({{lang-ar|داني شمعون}}) (26 August 1934&amp;nbsp;– 21 October 1990) was a prominent [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] politician.  A [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] Christian, the younger son of former [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] [[Camille Chamoun]] and brother of [[Dory Chamoun]], Chamoun was also a politician in his own right, and was known for his opposition to the occupation of Lebanese territory by foreign forces, whether [[Military of Syria|Syrian]] or [[Military of Israel|Israeli]].

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Chamoun was born in [[Deir el-Qamar]] on 26 August 1934.&lt;ref name=wofl&gt;{{cite web|title=Dany Chamoun |url=http://wars.meskawi.nl/people.html#6|publisher=Wars of Lebanon|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger son of the former President [[Camille Chamoun]]. He studied civil engineering in [[the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=tatro&gt;{{cite news|last=Tatro|first=Earleen F.|title=Lebanon: Dynasties dominate life...|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ohGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_IMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1402,1319470&amp;dq=dany+chamoun&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 December 2012|newspaper=The Lewiston Journal|date=10 February 1983|agency=AP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
Chamoun reported that he had not had any interest in politics before the Lebanon civil war.&lt;ref name=tatro/&gt; He became the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] Secretary of Defense in January 1976, after the death of its predecessor Naim Berdkan. As Supreme Commander of the NLP's military wing, the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers]], he also played a major role in the early years of the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Jaber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaber|first1=Ali|title=Leader of a Major Christian Clan in Beirut Is Assassinated with His Family|work=The New York Times|page=3|date=22 October 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/22/world/leader-of-a-major-christian-clan-in-beirut-is-assassinated-with-his-family.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the NLP Tigers under Dany's command along with the [[Kataeb|Phalangist]] [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]], [[Al-Tanzim]], and [[Guardians of the Cedars]] formed a joined militia command under the name [[Lebanese Forces]].

By 1980, the [[Kataeb|Phalangist]]-dominated [[Lebanese Forces]] were under the command of [[Bachir Gemayel]]. Rivalry began to arise between Bashir and Dany. Dany's Tigers were eliminated as a military force in a [[Safra massacre|massacre]] perpetrated on 7 July 1980 by the rival Phalangists. Chamoun's life was spared and he fled to the [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]]-dominated West [[Beirut]]. He then went into self-imposed exile.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon's Christians|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pn8xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C6UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1470,378444&amp;dq=ehden+massacre&amp;hl=en|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=22 September 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamoun was a supporter of the nationalist Christian cause at heart, however, and he soon returned to the cause to which he, like his father, had dedicated his life. He served as General Secretary of the National Liberal Party from 1983 to 1985, when he replaced his father as the party leader.&lt;ref name=gherald&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria has Waite, says Christian leader|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RxA1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sKULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3423,524318&amp;dq=dany+chamoun&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 December 2012|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=3 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he became President of the revived [[Lebanese Front]]—a coalition of nationalist and mainly Christian parties and politicians that his father had helped to found. The same year, he announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Lebanon to succeed [[Amine Gemayel]] (Bashir's brother), but [[Syria]] (which by this time occupied some 70 percent of Lebanese territory) vetoed his candidacy.

Gemayel's term expired on 23 September 1988 without the election of a successor. Chamoun declared his strong support for [[Michel Aoun]], who had been appointed by the outgoing president to lead an interim administration and went on to lead one of two rival governments that contended for power over the next two years. He strongly opposed the [[Taif Agreement]], which not only gave a greater share of power to the Muslim community than they had enjoyed previously, but more seriously, in Chamoun's opinion, formalized what he saw as the master-servant relationship between Syria and Lebanon, and refused to recognize the new government of the President [[Elias Hrawi]], who was elected under the Taif Agreement.

===Assassination===
On 21 October 1990, Chamoun, along with his German-born second wife Ingrid (forty-five), and his two sons, Tarek (seven) and Julian (five), were murdered.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-25/news/mn-17158_1_civil-war-crimes "Lebanese Ex-Warlord Sentenced in Rival's Slaying : Mideast: Christian is the first militia chief convicted of civil war crimes. Many received amnesty. Eleven associates are also sentenced."], ''Los Angeles Times'', 25 June 1995. Retrieved on 22 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 1995, the Lebanese Tribunal found [[Samir Geagea]] guilty of the assassination of Dany Chamoun and his family.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; Overwhelming evidence derived from investigations led to Geagea receiving a life sentence.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; The heavy sentence allegedly having been issued due to Syrian occupation influence on the tribunal, Geagea was released after the Syrian departure.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Robert.

'''Denis Lortie''' (born March 10, 1959) is a former [[Canadian Forces]] [[corporal]]. In 1984, he stormed into the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|National Assembly of Quebec building]] and opened fire with several firearms, killing three [[Quebec]] [[public servant|government employees]] and wounding 13 others. The National Assembly's [[Sergeant-at-Arms]], [[René Jalbert]], volunteered himself to serve as a hostage, and conversed with Lortie for several hours before convincing him to surrender to authorities. After a 1985 conviction of first-degree murder was overturned by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]], Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987, for which he was convicted to [[life imprisonment]] with no [[Parole#Canada|parole]] for ten years. Lortie was granted [[day parole]] in 1995, then full parole in 1996, and has since kept a low profile.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Joseph Laurent Paul Denis Lortie was born in Quebec, the youngest son of eight children, all of whom were physically and sexually abused by his father.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/symptom15/?p=4|title=The Père-version of the Political in the Case of Denis LortieWolfram Bergande  – the SINTHOME 15|website=www.lacan.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lortie's father reportedly fathered a child with one of his daughters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of them finally went to the police and in 1969, Lortie's father was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon his release he did not return to his family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lortie joined the army and was stationed in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], where he met and married Lisa Levesque in 1980.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFPAvt5iDnoC&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;ots=LqyTpG2a_Z&amp;dq=lortie%20access%20to%20weapons&amp;pg=PA264#v=onepage&amp;q=Lortie&amp;f=false|title=Rampage: Canadian Mass Murder and Spree Killing|last=Mellor|first=Lee|date=2013-03-09|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781459707221|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a son in 1982 and a daughter in 1983.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the time of the shooting, Lortie was stationed in [[CFS Carp]], near [[Ottawa]], was ranked a corporal, and worked as a [[supply technician]] in the [[Canadian Forces]] [[Logistics Branch]].

Lortie was bilingual, but his English was relatively poor, and even when speaking French (his native language), he encountered pronunciation difficulties, resulting in irregular and halting speech.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lortie blamed his social and professional failures on his inability to speak English flawlessly,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and was keenly aware that his poor English reinforced negative stereotypes of [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]] and [[Québécois people|Québécois]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the birth of his daughter, Lortie worried that he would become abusive in the manner of his father,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and contemplated killing himself and his family before placing blame on the governing pro-[[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty]] [[Parti Québécois]] for his problems (disliking the party's advocation of a "Francophone identity" for Quebec).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lortie planned the killing spree as a means of broadcasting his discontent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Events==

===Prior to the shooting===
On May 7, 1984, Lortie left the [[CFS Carp]] military base (originally built as a [[Diefenbunker]] during the Cold War), pretending that he needed time off to arrange a divorce with his wife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Instead, he rented a car, drove to [[Quebec City]] and took a guided tour of the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He then rented a room in a motel for the night.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Lortie had previously attempted to secure leave from his base, but was refused. It was during this encounter that Lortie later claimed he saw the face of his father on the face of the officer that denied his request.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_YioojS82I&amp;list=WL&amp;index=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, May 8, 1984, at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Lortie walked into [[CJRP]] radio station in [[Quebec City]], identified himself as "Mr. D", and dropped off a sealed envelope containing an audiotape for one of the station's hosts, [[André Arthur]]. He instructed the radio staff not to open the envelope until 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. but they opened it anyway, discovering that it was a statement of Lortie's plans, in which he declared, "The government now in power is going to be destroyed." However, by the time radio staff contacted police, Lortie's plan had already been put into action.

===The shooting===
At 9:45&amp;nbsp;a.m., Lortie entered the Parliament Building through a side door located on Grande-Allée. He was dressed in combat fatigues and armed with two [[Sterling submachine gun|C-1 submachine gun]]s, an [[Browning Hi-Power|Inglis pistol]], a duffel bag containing four hundred rounds of [[9mm NATO]] ammunition, as well as a knife strapped to his leg. As he entered the building, he shot and mortally wounded a receptionist, then killed a messenger whom he encountered in a corridor. He then went into a smoking room and shot and wounded a person there before moving to the cafeteria, but finally found his way into the Assembly Chamber, outside of which dozens of armed [[Sûreté du Québec]] (SQ), as well as more than a dozen [[List of special police units#Canada|Groupe d'Intervention]] operatives and [[Service de police de la Ville de Québec|Quebec City Police]] (many carrying [[M1 carbine#Carbine.2C Cal .30.2C M2|M2 carbines]]), helicopters, and snipers were taking position.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klm5YwCwK60&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on later testimony, it is clear that he intended to assassinate Premier [[René Lévesque]] and other members of the governing Parti Québécois. His plan was to enter the Assembly Chamber during the parliamentary committee meeting, which was starting at 10:00 that morning. However, instead of using a watch, Lortie timed his attack by listening to [[CJRP]] and waited for the station's host, André Arthur, to end his segment. Fortunately, on that day, Arthur ended his broadcast 20 minutes early, leading Lortie to enter the building and make his way to the Assembly Chamber while it was mostly empty. Lortie opened fire on the government employees still inside the Assembly Chamber, killing two and wounding 11 others. No politicians were killed or wounded.

===Lortie's surrender===
The National Assembly's [[Sergeant-at-Arms]], [[René Jalbert]], was informed that there was a man in military uniform with a gun in the Assembly Chamber. Upon stepping out of the elevator, Lortie asked him why he came, and fired his [[Sterling submachine gun|C-1 Submachine gun]] inches from his face.

Jalbert proceeded to inform him that he too had been a soldier with the [[Van Doos]] (slang for the [[Royal 22nd Regiment]]), and that if Lortie would allow it, he would show him his discharge card. Lortie agreed, after which Jalbert persuaded him to show his own identification.

After this exchange, Jalbert persuaded Lortie to come into his office to discuss the matter, and release the other civilians in the Assembly Chamber. Jalbert talked to Lortie for more than four hours, ultimately promising him that he would be able to surrender to military police (since he was unwilling to surrender to civilian police). At 2:15 PM, Lortie surrendered to officers of the SQ, Quebec City Police, and the National Assembly security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=603&amp;param=110&lt;/ref&gt;

For his heroic actions, which likely prevented further death, the Canadian government awarded Jalbert the [[Cross of Valour (Canada)|Cross of Valour]] several months later, in the same National Assembly chamber that Lortie had burst into.

===Victims===
The following were killed in the shooting:

* Georges Boyer
* Camille Lepage (not to be confused with the late [[French people|French]] photojournalist [[Camille Lepage]], who was also the victim of an apparent murder)
* Roger Lefrançois

==Aftermath==
One of the contributing factors to the shooting was, allegedly, the easy access that Lortie had to both weapons and ammunition. Unlike other non-combat Canadian Forces Bases, CFS Carp, the base at which he was stationed, apparently did not have an [[Armory (military)#Operational subdivision|armory]], or even ammunition lockers.

According to psychiatrist [[Pierre Mailloux]], who was assigned to the case, Lortie suffered from [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and had organized his crime during a psychotic episode, believing that he was acting on instructions given to him from God. Nevertheless, in 1985, Lortie was convicted of first-degree murder, but a new trial was ordered when the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] determined the trial judge had made errors while instructing jurors about how they should weigh testimony from psychiatrists heard in the case.

Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=885c67db-68e2-4a59-bccc-26cba6d512b6&amp;k=95107 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116024014/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=885c67db-68e2-4a59-bccc-26cba6d512b6&amp;k=95107 |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Lortie was released on day parole to a [[halfway house]] in [[Hull, Quebec]], after being released from a minimum security correctional facility north of [[Montreal]] where he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment, classes to deal with aggression, and serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 10 years. According to officials from the [[Parole Board of Canada]], Lortie no longer posed a threat to society, and "patched his life together despite being responsible for one of the most notorious events in Quebec history".{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Under the release terms, Lortie was required to spend every night at the halfway house between 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. He was also required to let parole board supervisors know where he was at all times, and was restricted to a 40 kilometer (24.8 mile) radius from the house. The relatives of some of Lortie's victims believed he was not punished severely enough, with some believing he should have been [[executed]], a punishment that could not and cannot be applied as Canada abolished its death penalty in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lortie-released/&lt;/ref&gt;

Granted full parole in July 1996 (the same year Jalbert died of cancer), he has since kept a low profile.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

He is last known to have worked at a [[dépanneur]] in the [[Hull—Aylmer]] district of Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;http://coolopolis.blogspot.com/2012/09/dark-moments-for-politics-in-kweeb.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is now married, with a steady job and a house, and has reportedly been forthcoming with "the people who monitor his case".&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt;

'''Edward Belbruno''' (born August 2, 1951 in [[Heidelberg, Germany]]) is an artist, mathematician and scientist whose interests are in [[celestial mechanics]], dynamical systems, dynamical astronomy, and aerospace engineering. His artistic media is paintings.
Belbruno received his associate degree from [[Mitchell College]], his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from [[New York University]] and his PhD in mathematics from New York University’s [[Courant Institute]] in 1981, where his mentor was mathematician [[Jürgen Moser]].
He was employed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] from 1985 to 1990 as an orbital analyst on such missions as [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]], [[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]], [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]], [[Mars Observer]], and others. His artwork in the NASA collection, Charles Betlach II collection, and exhibited in Paris, Rome, Los Angeles, Washington DC, New York City, Minneapolis, Shanghai, WeiHai, and Princeton.

During that time, he laid the foundations for the first systematic application of [[chaos theory]] to space flight originally called [[Interplanetary travel#Fuzzy orbits|fuzzy boundary theory]], which allows for the construction of very low energy paths for spacecraft.

In 1990 Belbruno applied his ideas for [[low energy transfer]] orbits to the Japanese lunar probe [[Hiten]], which had been designed only for lunar swing-by and had suffered a failure of the Hagoromo lunar orbiter.  The main Hiten probe lacked the fuel to enter lunar orbit using a conventional [[Hohmann transfer orbit|Hohmann transfer trajectory]], but Belbruno was able to devise a ballistic capture trajectory that would put it in lunar orbit using only a negligible amount of fuel.  The probe entered lunar orbit in 1991, the first time that Belbruno's ideas had been put to the test.

Belbruno had first proposed using a low-energy transfer orbit for a JPL probe in 1988.  However, he faced a great deal of skepticism, and found himself in conflict with engineers.  He had also expected to make no progress on ''Hiten'', but the Japanese proved receptive to his ideas and called ballistic capture an "amazing result."  He left JPL in fall of 1990 and took a position at [[Pomona College]].&lt;ref name="belbruno_fly"&gt;Belbruno, Edward.  ''Fly me to the moon: an insider's guide to the new science of space travel''.  Princeton University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belbruno is president and founder of the company Innovative Orbital Design, Inc., based in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and holds patents on routes in space.  He consulted on the rescue of the [[PAS-22|Asiasat-3]] communications satellite for Hughes, although a different trajectory was ultimately used for the rescue.

Belbruno's books include ''Fly Me to the Moon'' and ''Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics''.  He is a consultant with the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and has made appearances on NBC's [[Today (NBC program)|''Today Show'']] and NPR's 360. He was invited by TedX to give a talk on his art, math and science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2668">'''George Gifford''' (c.1548–1620) was a Puritan preacher at [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]], [[Essex]].

==Life==

Gifford was born in [[Dry Drayton]], near [[Cambridge]] and attended [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1570 and MA in 1573.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GFRT569G|name=Giffard, George}}&lt;/ref&gt; He afterwards lived at Maldon, but was discharged from the priesthood for refusing to subscribe to Archbishop Whitgift's articles of conformity. He was later reinstated as a lecturer at Maldon, serving there as a lecturer until his death in 1600.

It is possible that in 1586 he attended the deathbed of Sir Philip Sidney in the Low Countries, where Gifford was serving as chaplain to the Earl of Essex's troops. Gifford may well have penned ''The Manner of Sir Philip Sidney's Death''.

==Works==

Gifford wrote some twenty-two published works. These include a translation of [[William Fulke]]'s ''Praelections vpon the sacred and holy Reuelation of S. Iohn'' (1573; STC:11443); ''A briefe discourse of certaine points of the religion which is among the common sort of Christians, which may bee termed the countrie diunitie'' (1581; STC:11845), which was his most popular work; ''A dialogue betweene a Papist and a Protestant'' (1582; STC:11849); and two works on witchcraft, ''A discourse of the subtill practises of deuilles by witches and sorcerers'' (1587; STC:11852) and ''A Dialogue Concerning Witches and Witchcrafts'' (1593; STC:11850). It is the last work for which he is best known.

Gifford was a moderate in the [[witchcraft]] debate, although he still believed in the existence of witches, and that they should be severely punished. His main concern in the ''Dialogue'' was to ensure more care was taken in witchcraft prosecutions, and to attempt to restrain the persecuting fervour with which witches were sought out and indicted.

[[File:George-Prokopiou-the-Painter-01-egypt-1907-high.jpg|thumb|200px|Georgios Prokopiou (1907; possibly a wedding picture)]]
'''Georgios Prokopiou''' (Greek: Γεώργιος Προκοπίου; 1876, in [[İzmir|Smyrna]] &amp;ndash; 20 December 1940, near [[Tepelenë]]) was a Greek [[war artist]], photographer and [[documentary film]] maker. He also served as [[court painter]] to Emperor [[Menelik II]] and was a recipient of the Greek Military Cross.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.aspromavro.net/alx/articles1/afieromata/229-prokopiou-giorgos.html Brief biography] @ Aspromavro.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
At the age of fifteen he was working as an [[icon]] painter and attracted the attention of Hortense Wood, an English artist who was living near Smyrna. She gave him drawing lessons and presented his work to [[Nikiforos Lytras]], who recommended Prokopiou to the [[Athens School of Fine Arts]]. He enrolled there in 1895, studying with Lytras and [[Georgios Roilos]]. In 1901, after completing his studies, he returned to Smyrna and held his first exhibition. Two years later, he travelled to Alexandria and Cairo, where he painted portraits of notable figures in the Greek communities there, including [[Pavlos Melas]], who introduced him to the head of Ethiopia's diplomatic mission.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/culture/article/?aid=373525 Biographical notes] @ To Vima.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prokopiou-Studio.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Prokopiou in his studio (late 1920s)]]
This resulted in an invitation to visit [[Addis Ababa]] to do a portrait of Emperor Menelik. He went there by caravan from [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]], accompanied by his brother Socrates, who would later write a book about the trip. After competing with several other painters, he was chosen to become the Court Painter in 1905.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In addition to painting the [[Solomonic Dynasty|Royal Family]], he portrayed several ambassadors as well as landscapes and village scenes. Lavish with honors, the Emperor awarded him the [[Order of Solomon]], the [[Order of the Star of Ethiopia]] and other lesser-known medals.

In 1907, he returned to Athens to marry, travelled extensively, and settled in Smyrna in 1913. The beginning of [[World War I]] found Smyrna blockaded by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Soon after, the [[Ottomans]] began persecuting Christians. This included setting up "labor battalions" which were soon revealed as actually being death battalions. Most of the Greek population, including Prokopiou and his family, went into hiding. Somehow, he found work as an art teacher for the daughter of an Ottoman official, which afforded him protection. It was at this time that he created his first war art; depictions of the [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|campaign in the Dardanelles]].

===Greco-Turkish and Greco-Italian Wars===
[[File:PROKOPIOU-EPITESI.jpg|thumb|200px|Greek attack on the Albanian front (1940)]] 
After the war, Smyrna came under [[Occupation of Smyrna|Greek control]]. The following year, General [[Leonidas Paraskevopoulos]] commissioned him to produce paintings, photographs and films of the Greek campaigns against the Turks during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]].&lt;ref name="I"&gt;[http://istoria.gr/aug02/3.htm Brief Biography] @ Istoria.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they admired his courage, a few commanders complained that his activities interfered with military operations. After the [[Liberation of İzmir|Turkish recapture of Smyrna]], he returned home to be with his family and remained to take photographs of the [[Great Fire of Smyrna|Great Fire]].
 
When the chaos had subsided, he was arrested and sentenced to death by a Turkish tribunal.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Luckily, the prison commandant allowed him to say goodbye to his family. With the assistance of his neighbors and the French Consul, he and his family were able to escape aboard a French ship that took them to [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; In 1925, he settled in Athens. He continued to paint military scenes from memory until 1928, after which he produced a variety of nudes, scenes of ruins and portraits, including one of [[Haile Selassie]], who visited his studio shortly before becoming Emperor.

In 1940, the [[Greco-Italian War]] began when Greece refused to capitulate to the [[Axis Powers]]. Although Prokopiou was sixty-four years old and ill with [[bronchitis]], he went to the War Ministry, begging to be sent to the front.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; Finally, he wrote to Prime Minister [[Ioannis Metaxas|Metaxas]], saying that he was ashamed to stay at home when his two sons were out fighting for Greece. Metaxas agreed to his request, and Prokopiou left for Albania to join the Greek counter-offensive. He met up with his son, Angelos, sketching and taking photographs almost immediately. One night, several weeks later, when the temperature fell below zero, he died of heart failure.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; He was given the posthumous rank of Colonel, brought back to Athens, and buried with full military honors.

'''Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald''' (1792 – September 18, 1848) was a [[Prussia]]n general and politician.
==Biography==
Auerswald was born in [[Ulnowo|Faulen]], [[West Prussia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA306 
|title=Kleineres Brockhaus'sches Konversationslexikon|first=|last=|publisher=[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|F.A. Brockhaus]]|year=1854|isbn=|page=306| language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the family possessed the estates of [[Pławty Wielkie|Plauth]] and [[Trumieje|Tromnau]].

He entered the [[Prussian army]] in 1813 and by 1848 had become a major general.  Three precincts had elected him to the [[Frankfurt parliament]] where he joined the conservatives, but he did not participate in the party leadership or the debates.  On September 17, 1848, a gathering on the Pfingstweide in [[Frankfurt]] led by [[Franz Zitz]] had, on account of the parliament's decision regarding the [[First Schleswig War|truce of Malmö]], declared the members thereof traitors to the fatherland, freedom and honor.  The result was the uprising on the next day where a mob went looking for Reichsminister Hekscher and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]].  Auerswald had ridden out with Lichnowsky, and by the Friedberger Gate, the mob discovered them.  They tried to flee.  At the Bethmann villa, Auerswald was mortally felled by a pistol shot.  Lichnowsky was beaten up and died the next day.

'''Jess Stearn''' (April 26, 1914 – March 27, 2002) was a [[Jewish-American]] journalist and author of more than thirty books, nine of which were bestsellers.

==Early life==
Stearn was born in [[Syracuse, New York]] to David Stearn, a [[rabbi]]. He graduated from [[Syracuse University]].

==Career==
Stearn became a journalist for the [[New York Daily News]] and later an associate editor for [[Newsweek]].&lt;ref name=NYTIMES&gt;{{cite news|title=Jess Stearn, 87; Wrote Best Sellers on the Occult|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/02/arts/jess-stearn-87-wrote-best-sellers-on-the-occult.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an author, Stearn specialized in [[sensationalist]] speculative non-fiction. His early work focused on outsiders and [[marginalized]] individuals such as prostitutes, [[drug addicts]], and homosexuals. His later work focused on [[spirituality]], [[the occult]], and [[psychic phenomenon|psychic phenomena]]. His most popular works were two biographies on the American psychic [[Edgar Cayce]]; Stearn was a conference speaker for the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] and a proponent of Cayce's theories.&lt;ref name=DICKSUTPHEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Jess Stearn|author=Sutphen, Dick|url=http://www.dicksutphen.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Stearn married twice and had two children, Martha and Fred. He had a longtime close friendship with actress and radio/television personality [[Arlene Francis]]. That may have had a connection to the first mention of his name in a nationally syndicated newspaper column. A reference to his latest book appeared in the Voice of Broadway column written by Francis' television colleague [[Dorothy Kilgallen]].  Either Kilgallen or her editor at the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' placed a plug for ''Yoga, Youth and Reincarnation'' in that paper's September 15, 1965 edition immediately after an item about an upcoming [[Johnnie Ray]] concert in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen, Dorothy. "Joan Baez in Serious Trouble Over Tax Protest." ''[[New York Journal American]]'' September 15, 1965, pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, Francis discussed one of her recurring [[dreams]] with Stearn for a book he was writing that included a section on dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stearn, Jess|title=A Matter of Immortality: Dramatic Evidence of Survival|date=1976|publisher=Atheneum Publishers|isbn=978-0689107214|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Francis, Arlene|title=Arlene Francis: A Memoir|date=1978|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0671228088|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stearn and Francis shared interests in yoga and [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis, Arlene|title=Arlene Francis: A Memoir|date=1978|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0671228088|pages=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Stearn died of [[congestive heart failure]] on March 27, 2002 in his [[Malibu, California]] home. He chose not to have a funeral because of his belief in [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name=SOLSTICEPOINT&gt;{{cite web|title=The Astrologers' Memorial Web Page|publisher=Solstice Point|url=http://www.solsticepoint.com/astrologersmemorial/whowas2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATIMES&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 1, 2002|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin''' is a fictional character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s [[graphic novel]] series ''[[Sin City (comics)|Sin City]]'', featured prominently in ''[[The Hard Goodbye]]''. He is a [[muteness|mute]], [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]] who preys on the titular city's prostitutes, [[The Girls of Old Town]]. He is protected by the powerful Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark, who also acts as his accomplice. Kevin lives at the [[Roark family]] farm, and uses the basement as an execution chamber for his victims; after he kills and eats them, he stuffs and mounts their heads on the walls like hunting trophies.

While he appears harmless and unassuming, Kevin is a fierce, inhumanly fast fighter adept in [[martial arts]]; accordingly, the Roark family uses him as an [[assassin]] from time to time. He is usually accompanied by his pet wolf, which he feeds whatever parts of his victims he does not eat himself.

==Appearances==

===''The Hard Goodbye''===
''The Hard Goodbye'' establishes Kevin's back story, as related by Cardinal Roark. He first meets Roark when going to him for [[Confession (religion)|confession]], wracked with guilt over the murders he is committing. Roark eventually comes to believe that Kevin is doing God's work by consuming his victims' souls as well as their bodies, and eventually joins him in cannibalistic rituals. Roark also claims that Kevin is [[selective mutism|mute by choice]], and when he speaks it is with "the voice of an angel".

In the main plot, Kevin kills [[Marv (Sin City)|Marv]]'s one true love, Goldie, at Cardinal Roark's behest when she learns the truth about their murder spree; he then frames Marv for the crime. Marv swears revenge, and cuts a bloody swath through the city's underworld until he learns the identity of the killer he seeks. He then follows Kevin to the Farm, where Kevin surprises him and knocks him unconscious. He also kidnaps and imprisons Marv's parole officer, Lucille, and forces her to watch while he eats her hand.

Marv eventually escapes, however, and confronts Kevin again. This time, Marv overpowers him and subjects him to brutal, systematic torture, eventually sawing his limbs off and feeding him to his pet wolf. Much to Marv's frustration, Kevin does not make a sound the entire time, and dies with a blissful smile on his face.

===''That Yellow Bastard''===
Kevin makes a cameo appearance in ''[[That Yellow Bastard]]'', set a few years before ''The Hard Goodbye''. He appears at the Farm, sitting in a rocking chair and reading the [[Bible]] while Roark Junior tortures [[Nancy Callahan]].

==In other media==
Kevin is portrayed by [[Elijah Wood]] in [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s [[Sin city (film)|2005 film adaptation of ''Sin City'']].&lt;ref name="totalfilm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/30-craziest-movie-casting-moments|title=30 Craziest Movie Casting Moments &amp;#124; TotalFilm.com|publisher=totalfilm.com|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reelz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/4382/elijah-wood-discusses-sin-city-9-and-the-hobbit/ |title=REELZ: Movie News |publisher=reelz.com |accessdate=2014-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083614/http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/4382/elijah-wood-discusses-sin-city-9-and-the-hobbit/ |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character notes==
Frank Miller has stated in the ''Sin City: Recut and Extended'' DVD commentary that Kevin and another supporting character, [[Miho (Sin City)|Miho]], are the supernatural beings in Sin City. Miller characterizes them as "[[demon]]s"; Miho is a good "demon" and Kevin is an evil one.

==Reception==
In 2011, [[UGO Networks]] ranked Kevin together with Miho as #1 in their list "Quiet as the Grave: The Silent Killers of Film and TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Kevin|title=Quiet as the Grave: The Silent Killers of Film and TV|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/silent-killers-miho-kevin|website=Ugo.com|accessdate=4 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529210346/http://www.ugo.com/tv/silent-killers-miho-kevin|archivedate=May 29, 2014|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Klaas Annink''' (18 June 1710 – 13 September 1775), better known as '''Huttenkloas''', was a notorious [[Dutch people|Dutch]] serial killer in [[Twente]], [[Netherlands]]. Records of his life frequently mention that he was born in [[Bentelo]].

He was reputedly responsible, together with his wife Aarne Spanjers and his son, Jannes, for numerous robberies and murders in the region in and around [[Hof van Twente|Hengevelde]].

In 1774, a merchant from [[Hanover]] investigated and found convincing evidence that Annink was responsible for the disappearance and murder of one of his family members. Huttenkloas was then arrested and held for 114 days in a specially-made chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molenaarshuis.nl/huttenkloas.htm www.molenaarshuis.nl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620072915/http://www.molenaarshuis.nl/huttenkloas.htm |date=June 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a controversial trial, he and his wife were sentenced to death and executed.

The seat in which Klaas Annink sat, known as the "Chair of Huttenkloas", is still on display in the Ancient Chamber room in the [[Palthehuis Museum]] in [[Oldenzaal]].

Klaas Annink's infamous nickname, Huttenkloas, has not been forgotten, having been adopted by a local brewery. The company Hengelose Huttenkloas B.V. has outlets in Twente, [[Salland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Achterhoek]], selling Huttenkloas beer.
Also, the Dutch accordion player and singer Alexander Schoemaker, in 2009, released a CD about twents legends, including a ballad `de ballade van Hutnkloas`.

==Biography==
Monique Corzilius was born and raised in [[Pine Beach, New Jersey]], the youngest of the three children of Fred and Colette Corzilius. While she was a child, her mother began taking her to [[New York City]] on child acting auditions. Working under the stage name '''Monique Cozy''', her first job came at age two, modeling in a print advertisement for [[Lipton]] soup. A successful audition at the offices of the advertising office of [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] earned her the starring role in "Daisy", for which her parents were paid $105 (${{Inflation|US|105|1964|r=-1|fmt=c}} today). According to her, her parents were unaware of what the ad was for until they saw it air. She, herself, did not see the spot until 36 years later, in 2000.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=David|title=How a Little Girl Beat Barry Goldwater|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/19/how-a-little-girl-beat-barry-goldwater.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|work=[[Daily Beast]]|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Robert|title=Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds: LBJ, Barry Goldwater, and the Ad That Changed American Politics|date=2011|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=080714293X|pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wat"/&gt;

Corzilius continued to appear in television and print advertisements for several years following "Daisy". In 1967, she appeared in an ad for [[Kool-Aid]] [[Popsicles]]. In 1975 she moved, with her parents, to France, where she remained until adulthood, eventually marrying and finally returning to the U.S. in 1983 and settling in [[Arizona]]. Her Portuguese husband Manuel Luiz was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in about 2011.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Daly| first1=Michael| title=A Grown 'Daisy Girl' Recalls Her Infamous Attack Ad| url=http://www.newsweek.com/grown-daisy-girl-recalls-her-infamous-attack-ad-63733| accessdate=31 October 2016| work=[[Newsweek]]| date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wat"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Hruby| first1=Patrick| title=Where Are They Now?: Daisy Girl| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/24/where-are-they-now-daisy-girl-tot-picks-a-daisy-in/| accessdate=31 October 2016| work=[[The Washington Times]]| date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult, Luiz appeared in the 2014 documentary ''Bombs Away'' about the 1964 election and its role in ushering "in a new age of highly negative television advertising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Sabato| first1=Larry| title='Bombs Away' Tackles LBJ, Goldwater and 1964 Election| url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/bombs-away-tackles-lbj-goldwater-1964-election/| accessdate=31 October 2016| work=Sabato's Crystal Ball| publisher=[[University of Virginia]]| date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bombs Away: Participants Biographies| url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/bios.html| website=centerforpolitics.org| publisher=[[University of Virginia]]| accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she was enlisted to appear in a television campaign advertisement for the [[Hillary Clinton]] presidential campaign. The ad featured Luiz introducing herself, in voice-over, with footage from the "Daisy" ad, after which she appears on-screen and announces, "The fear of nuclear war that we had as children, I never thought that our children would have to deal with that again." The spot was aired during the commercial breaks of evening newscasts in [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[Iowa]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Griffiths| first1=Brent| title=Clinton campaign invokes 'Daisy Girl' to attack Trump on nuclear weapons| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-daisy-ad-trump-230528| accessdate=31 October 2016| work=[[Politico]]| date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olivia Shakespear.jpg|thumb|300px|alt= photograph of Olivia Shakespear | Photograph of Olivia Shakespear published in the 1897 ''Literary Yearbook'']]
'''Olivia Shakespear''' (née '''Tucker'''; 17 March 1863&amp;nbsp;– 3 October 1938) was a British [[novelist]], [[playwright]], and [[patron of the arts]]. She wrote six books that are described as "marriage problem" novels. Her works sold poorly, sometimes only a few hundred copies. Her last novel, ''Uncle Hilary'', is considered her best. She wrote two plays in collaboration with [[Florence Farr]].

Olivia was the daughter of a retired [[Adjutant General]], and had little formal education. She was well-read however, and developed a love of literature. In 1885 she married London [[barrister]] Henry Hope Shakespear, and in 1886 gave birth to their only child, [[Dorothy Shakespear|Dorothy]]. In 1894 her literary interests led to a friendship with [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] that became physically intimate in 1896. He declared that they "had many days of happiness" to come,&lt;ref name="C104"&gt;qtd. in Carpenter (1988), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; but the affair ended in 1897. They nevertheless remained lifelong friends and corresponded frequently. Yeats went on to marry [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], Olivia's step-niece and Dorothy's best friend.

Olivia began hosting weekly [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] frequented by [[Ezra Pound]] and other [[Modernism|modernist]] writers and artists in 1909, and became influential in London [[literary society]]. Olivia's daughter [[Dorothy Shakespear]] married Pound in 1914, despite the less than enthusiastic blessing of her parents. After their marriage, Pound would use funds received from Olivia to support [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[James Joyce]]. When Dorothy gave birth to a son, [[Omar Pound]], in France in 1926, Olivia assumed guardianship of the boy. He lived with Olivia until her death twelve years later, in 1938.

==Early life and marriage==
Olivia's father, Henry Tod Tucker, was born in [[Edinburgh]] and joined the [[British Indian Army]] as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] at age 16. He rose to the rank of Adjutant General in [[Bengal]], but retired in 1856 at age 48 owing to ill health. Within a year of returning to Britain he married Harriet Johnson (b. 1821) of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. The couple moved to the [[Isle of Wight]] where their two daughters were born: Florence in 1858 and Olivia on 17 March 1863. Soon after they relocated to [[Sussex]] where their third child, Henry, was born in 1866. In 1877 the family moved to London and raised their daughters in a social world that encouraged the pursuit of leisure. 

Olivia often visited her many Johnson relatives in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin [[Lionel Johnson]]—the only one of many uncles and cousins not to join the military—who went on to become a poet and friend to [[W. B. Yeats]].&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 1–7, 10&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Olivia received little formal education; she may have been educated by tutors, and appears to have become well-read as a young woman.&lt;ref name="Hassett 2010, 11"&gt;Hassett (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885 Olivia married Henry Hope Shakespear, a man described by Terence Brown in ''The Life of W.B. Yeats: A Critical Biography'' as "worthy" but "dull".&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1999), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Born in India in 1849, he was descended from 17th-century [[East End of London|East London]] [[Rope#History|ropemakers]] and, like Olivia, came from a military family, although of less prestige and wealth than the Tuckers and Johnsons.

Henry had attended [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], studied law, and joined a law practice in 1875. The couple were married on 8&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1885, and honeymooned in [[Boulogne]] and Paris. Olivia's father endowed them with a comfortable income in the form of a trust. Nine months after the wedding their only child, [[Dorothy Shakespear|Dorothy]], was born on 14 September 1886; Olivia realised soon that the marriage was devoid of passion.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats' biographer Alexander Jeffares writes, "she was unselfcentered, unselfish, deeply imaginative and sympathetic and, until she met Yeats, she seems to have accepted the fact of her unhappy loveless marriage".&lt;ref name ="J60"&gt;Jeffares (2001), 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespear dissolved his legal partnership in the late 1880s—his partner may have been embezzling from clients' trusts—and formed his own practice. Harwood writes that Shakespear's attitude to the situation showed a certain amount of "timidity" on his part and a definite "dislike of scenes". During this period Olivia moved from socialising with military wives to literary women: Valentine Fox (unhappily married to a [[Kent]] brewer) and Pearl Craigie, a divorced American writer who published as [[John Oliver Hobbes]].&lt;ref name = "H21ff"&gt;Harwood (1989), 21–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==W. B. Yeats==
===Friendship===
[[File:Yeats Celtic Twilight.png|thumb|right|alt=Painting of W.B. Yeats |An 1896 portrait of [[W.B. Yeats]] by his father, [[John Butler Yeats]], is the frontispiece of ''Celtic Twilight''.]]
Accompanied by [http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/837 Pearl Craigie], on 16 April 1894, Olivia attended a literary dinner to launch ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. Olivia was seated opposite W. B. Yeats.&lt;ref name ="J60"/&gt; Recently returned from visiting [[Maud Gonne]] in Paris, Yeats was in London for the production of his play ''[[The Land of Heart's Desire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The two were not introduced that evening but Yeats, probably through Lionel Johnson (who became disruptively drunk at the dinner), enquired about the woman seated opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hassett12"&gt;Hassett (2010), 12&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats was deeply affected, later writing in his memoirs of the encounter: "I noticed opposite me&amp;nbsp;.... a woman of great beauty&amp;nbsp;... She was exquisitely dressed&amp;nbsp;... and suggested to me an incomparable distinction."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Hassett (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Soon after, Olivia attended a showing of ''The Land of Heart's Desire'', and found herself moved by the performance. She wanted to meet the "tall and black haired" poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, "I shall be so glad to see you".&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Memoirs'' Yeats referred to her as "Diana Vernon", writing, "In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly in my ears and will suit as well as any other".&lt;ref&gt;Yeats (1973), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
They quickly established a strong friendship, with Olivia listening sympathetically to his obsessive love for Maud. When Yeats later described their friendship, he wrote, "I told her of my love sorrow, indeed it was my obsession, never leaving by day or night".&lt;ref name="Hassett12"/&gt; Writing in ''The Last Courtly Lover'', Gloria Kline suggests Olivia and Yeats began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work.&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1983), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Unterecker, writing in "Faces and False Faces", sees friendship as the most important aspect in the relationship, explaining, "she found in Yeats, as he in her, a person who could discuss literature and ideas&amp;nbsp;... she was one of the few persons with whom he could be completely relaxed". Comparing the difference between Maud and Olivia he writes, "Maud Gonne offered Yeats subject matter for poetry, the 'interesting' life he had hoped for, and Olivia Shakespear offered him repose".&lt;ref name="U28"/&gt; 

According to Kline, Yeats compared Olivia to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and Maud to [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; he was attracted to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as "a little darker than a Greek's would have been and her hair was very dark".&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1983), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Literary scholar [[Humphrey Carpenter]] writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia was one of a woman with "a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends".&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1988), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, she was working on her third novel, ''Beauty's Hour'', and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, suggested revisions, and may have contributed to the characterisations.&lt;ref name = "F153"/&gt; Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the [[occult]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1983), 18; Foster (1997), 193&lt;/ref&gt; For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.&lt;ref name="Hassett 2010, 11"/&gt;

In August Yeats returned to Ireland, continuing his correspondence with Olivia, writing to her about Maud who had recently given birth to a daughter, [[Iseult Gonne|Iseult]]. In her letters Olivia may have been honest about her feelings toward him; in April 1895 he wrote to her, "I no more complain of your writing of love, than I would complain of a portrait painter keeping to portraits".&lt;ref name="H45f"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love affair===
Yeats delayed visiting Olivia in London a month later; he instead tended to Johnson who was involved in the [[Oscar Wilde#Trials|Wilde case]] and descending into the alcoholism that would kill him.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffares (1996), 84&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, "here is the same weakness I thought&amp;nbsp;... Her beauty&amp;nbsp;... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, and how could it help but wring my heart. I took a fortnight to decide what I should do". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.&lt;ref name="Yeats86"/&gt;

Yeats finally visited Olivia at her Porchester Square home a few weeks later to present his well-thought out intentions but, to his bewilderment, Olivia declared her love for him. Unsure of himself, he took another absence, during which he decided that if Maud was unattainable, or unavailable due to circumstances, he would have Olivia, writing "but after all if I could not get the woman I loved it would be a comfort for a little while to devote myself to another".&lt;ref name="H45f"/&gt; For Yeats, Olivia was willing to lose her daughter, financial security, social standing, and the goodwill of her family. Although her husband had grounds to sue Yeats and consequently destroy his reputation, her best hope against complete ruin was Shakespear's strong dislike of public scenes. Then Yeats lost his nerve again, suggesting instead each seek advice from a friend (a "sponsor"). He probably chose Florence Farr to be his sponsor while Olivia chose Valentine Fox—Harwood speculates that the sponsors advised the two to go ahead with the affair, perhaps to Yeats' discomfort.&lt;ref name="H45f"/&gt; 

On 15 July 1895, Yeats and Olivia traveled to Kent to visit Valentine Fox; the trip Harwood says "would have been, emotionally speaking a highly charged outing".&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Of the railway trip, Yeats wrote in his memoirs, "when on our first railway journey together—we were to spend the day at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, I was startled &amp; a little shocked".&lt;ref name="Yeats86"&gt;Yeats (1973), 86&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.&lt;ref name="C104"/&gt;
[[File:Maud Gonne .png|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of Maud Gonne |Maud Gonne in about 1896: Olivia ended her affair with Yeats due to his love for Gonne.]]
Still distressed about Lionel, Yeats turned to [[Arthur Symons]] for companionship, moving into a room adjacent to his in October 1895. One day while preoccupied and thinking about Maud he locked himself out for a visit just before Olivia and her sponsor arrived to visit; as soon as she left he stayed up all night telling Symons about Maud.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffares (1996), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived in London a few weeks later for a brief visit.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yeats was ambivalent about Olivia despite the advice of the sponsors; with no money to support her, he suggested she seek a legal separation (instead of a divorce), sparing her social ostracism and financial ruin.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 50–52&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra Pound biographer Jay Wilhelm suggests Shakespear knew that Olivia loved Yeats but seemed more concerned about the loss of social status in the event of divorce, causing Yeats and Olivia to decide that "it was kinder to simply deceive him than totally abandon him".&lt;ref name="W14ff"/&gt; 

In January 1896 Yeats moved again, into a small flat in Woburn Place, so as to be nearer to her.&lt;ref name= "E160"&gt;Ellmann (1999), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats describing "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, "at last she came to me in my thirtieth year&amp;nbsp;.... and we had many days of happiness".&lt;ref name="C104"/&gt; Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.&lt;ref&gt;Hassett (2010), pp. 12, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hassett describes Yeats' "He Remembers Forgotten Beauty", published in ''[[The Savoy (periodical)|The Savoy]]'' in January 1896, as a "moving encomium to Olivia" in which she is symbolically cast as a White Goddess or lunar goddess. See Hassett (2010), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months later he was in back in Ireland, and in August Olivia was visiting Valentine Fox with her husband where she received news of her father's death. She left for an extended stay in [[Torquay]] where she stayed until September before leaving for a visit to Scotland with her husband. Yeats left Ireland for Paris to visit Maud in November, and did not return to London until January 1897, with Maud following close behind and arriving in London in February. Yeats wrote of Maud's visit: "Maud wrote to me&amp;nbsp;... she was in London &amp; would I come to dine. I dined with her &amp; my trouble increased—she certainly had no thought of the mischief she was doing&amp;nbsp;– &amp; at last one morning&amp;nbsp;.... [Olivia] found my mood did not answer hers and &amp; burst into tears—'There is someone else in your heart' she said. It was the breaking between us for many years". The affair ended that spring when Yeats again returned to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Olivia did not visit him again at Woburn Place for many years, according to Yeats biographer Richard Ellmann.&lt;ref name="E160"/&gt;

==Pembroke Mansions==
Olivia's life is not well documented between 1897 and 1908. She visited her cousin Lionel for the last time in 1897 before he was isolated by his alcoholism. He died alone of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 the family suffered an unspecified financial setback that forced them to move into an apartment in [[Bayswater]] to Pembroke Mansions, which a friend described by as "an uninviting Bayswater slum". A few months later Olivia's mother died. Within a week Olivia received a letter of condolence from Yeats, which may have been the first letter she received from him in two years, since 1897.&lt;ref name="H105"/&gt; Several scholars and biographers speculate that they resumed their love affair at some point between 1903 and 1910; Pound biographer Wilhelm believes they reconciled as early as 1903,&lt;ref name= "W14ff"&gt;Wilhelm (2008), pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt; while Yeats biographers Jeffares and Ross suggest the affair likely reignited for a period in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffares (2001), p. 118; Ross, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time in 1901 Olivia held a position as a book reviewer for ''The Kensington Review'', a small literary magazine, until it succumbed to poor sales.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt; After, she dabbled in the [[occult]] and became friendly with prominent London occultists. In 1902 she co-wrote with Florence Farr — who for a time led the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Order of Golden Dawn]] — two plays on the occult, ''The Beloved of Hathor'' and ''The Shrine of the Golden Hawk'', which were subsequently published as a pair.&lt;ref name="T79"&gt;Tryphonopoulos (1990), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the family received an inheritance from Olivia's mother, they continued to live in Bayswater.&lt;ref name="H105"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 105–06&lt;/ref&gt; For a period Dorothy was at boarding school, after which she was sent to a finishing school in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="W14ff"/&gt; To save money, the family often left London during the summer, to take long visits to relatives in the country, in particular her brother Henry Tucker.&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Reynolds (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1905 did the family lease a house in Brunswick Gardens, near [[Kensington Palace]], when Dorothy returned home to live with her parents.&lt;ref name="H123"&gt;Harwood (1989), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dorothy and Ezra Pound==
Records of Olivia's life resume through Dorothy's letters and diaries surrounding the arrival of the American poet [[Ezra Pound]] in London in 1909. Following her friends in [[Kensington]] society, Olivia opened her home once a week for a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]], beginning an important period in her life. When Yeats returned to London that year, Olivia became the centre of a blossoming literary movement. Yeats held a Monday evening salon; those who attended usually also visited Olivia's. She hosted, and became a nexus for, much of the pre-war literary activity in London. Notable attendees included Pound, [[H.D.|Hilda Doolitle]], Yeats, [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], [[Walter Morse Rummel]], [[Richard Aldington]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[T. E. Hulme]] and [[John Cournos]].&lt;ref name="H130ff"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 130–37&lt;/ref&gt; The gatherings were held in her drawing room, a place Pound described in a letter as "full of white magic".&lt;ref name="W14ff"/&gt; Olivia was by now a well-known occultist and hosted [[séances]] in her drawing room.&lt;ref name="H130ff"/&gt; She became well-versed in [[astrology]] and [[palmistry]], passing on what she knew to Dorothy who shared her interest. Both read [[grimoire]]s; Olivia was an expert at "drawing occult symbols" and quite familiar with the symbology of the occult.&lt;ref name="T79"/&gt; 
[[File:Ezra Pound 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Ezra Pound |[[Ezra Pound]], photographed in 1913, during his long courtship with Dorothy]]
Olivia met Pound in January 1909 at a Kensington salon hosted by a friend; she invited him for tea on 16 February 1909, and, at his insistence, introduced Pound to Yeats in May 1909.&lt;ref name="H130ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats had recently returned to London and began a thorough investigation of spiritualism and the occult, turning to Olivia for advice. She took the young American poet to Yeats' rooms at Woburn Place, fostering their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy soon fell in love with Pound.&lt;ref name="H130ff"/&gt; In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy attended his lectures at the [[London Polytechnic Institution]]; in June 1910 they joined him in [[Sirmione]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Stock (1970), pp. 70, 81&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11.&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.&lt;ref name="H130ff"/&gt;

In 1910 Yeats thought his [[horoscope]] suggested a return to Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound.&lt;ref name="H130ff"/&gt; A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Olivia's brother Henry Tucker married Georgie's mother Nelly Hyde-Lees in 1909. See Foster (1997), p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound returned from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused on the basis of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once a week or every two weeks.&lt;ref name="H142ff"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 142–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivia became concerned about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and [[Richard Aldington]], whom H.D. married in 1913.&lt;ref name="H142ff"/&gt; In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:&lt;blockquote&gt;You told me you were prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way&amp;nbsp;.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly ''decent''! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience &amp; bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come &amp; see her&amp;nbsp;... She must marry—She &amp; I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, &amp; we haven't money enough to separate&amp;nbsp;... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, &amp; any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her!&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1913, Olivia introduced Pound to [[vorticism|vorticist]] sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] at an art exhibition at the [[Albert Hall]]. At the same exhibition the sculptor met [[Nina Hamnett]], whom he subsequently used as a model for a series of nudes bronzes, one of which Olivia bought.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), pp. 127, 150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Olivia translated a grimoire for Yeats and Pound, who spent November 1913 to January 1914 in the countryside at Stone Cottage in Ashdown Forest—Pound acting as secretary to Yeats—researching the occult. They read several grimoires, and Olivia provided for them a translation of the Abbot of Villar's 1670 grimoire ''Le Comte de Gabalis''. Her translation was serialised in the literary magazine ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914 Olivia seems to have realised that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; ironically Pound was then earning less than he had in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), 150&lt;/ref&gt; Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20&amp;nbsp;April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (2008), pp. 151–54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
After Dorothy's wedding much of the documentation of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, throwing away personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in [[West Kensington]], taking with her two maids who had been with the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, [[Omar Pound]], who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.&lt;ref name="Hickman"&gt;Hickman (2005), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
In 1926 Yeats spent several weeks in London, likely visiting Olivia frequently. He showed regret for his behaviour in 1897, writing to her, "I came across two early photographs of you yesterday&amp;nbsp;... Who ever had a like profile?—a profile from a Sicilian coin. One looks back to one's youth as to a cup that a mad man dying of thirst left half tasted. I wonder if you feel like that?"&lt;ref name="H184"/&gt; The two maintained their correspondence, as they had for many years.&lt;ref name="H170ff"/&gt;

Olivia continued to socialise and had many friends, one of whom, Wyndham Lewis, painted her portrait; he enjoyed her company despite finding it difficult to relate to others. She stopped writing but remained an avid reader, turning to detective stories for light relief although she also kept up with literary authors. She became friendly with [[Thomas MacGreevy]], whom she invited for tea, later writing to him, "WBY has given me the new edition of ''Reveries and the Veil'', &amp; I am re-reading it all. It is very beautifully done. He was about 29 when I first knew him". McGreevy told Yeats that Olivia was "always a symbol of elegance, a kind of gold and ivory image". Harwood writes of her, "Olivia Shakespear was avant-garde in literature, agnostic in religion, and conservative in politics, at least later in life".&lt;ref name="H170ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H178ff"/&gt;

Olivia's correspondence with Pound continued throughout the 1920s and 1930s, when she acted in part as his agent in London. In 1924, at Pound's request, she welcomed [[George Antheil]] into her social circle, procured artwork and books that were sent on to Dorothy and Ezra in [[Rapallo]], and mediated in a dispute between Pound and Lewis. She was uninterested in Pound's politics and economic views and particularly disliked his later [[The Cantos|Cantos]].&lt;ref name="H170ff"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 170–73&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband's death, Olivia's income was sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle. During the 1920s and 1930s she gradually increased Dorothy's income (which was also increased by various family bequests), and in the 1930s she made investments in Dorothy's name, sending the proceeds to Dorothy and Pound. In a very real sense, according to Harwood, Olivia Shakespear is the "unsung heroine" of the modernist period, because much of the money Ezra Pound generously used to support struggling writers such as [[T.S. Eliot]] and [[James Joyce]] came from her.&lt;ref name="H178ff"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 178–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivia died of complications brought on by [[gall bladder]] disease on 3&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1938. The day before her death she wrote in a letter to Dorothy: "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope &amp; an injection and pain gradually went&amp;nbsp;... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 192-93&lt;/ref&gt; John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:&lt;blockquote&gt;Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman&amp;nbsp;... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude&amp;nbsp;... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.&lt;ref name="U28"&gt;Unterecker (1963), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dorothy was ill when her mother died, unable to travel to London. She sent Pound to organise the funeral and to clear out the house.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm (1994), 136&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra sorted through Olivia's correspondence and returned to Yeats many of her letters. Unterecker writes that Yeats made an effort to keep the correspondence private: "Shortly before his death he methodically destroyed a large group of letters to Olivia Shakespear. These, returned to him after her death&amp;nbsp;... Yeats wanted no one to read".&lt;ref&gt;Unterecker (1963), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels: description and reception==
Olivia had six novels published between 1894 and 1910, which as described by Foster are about women unhappy in love, with insipid and uninspiring male characters.&lt;ref name="F153"&gt;Foster (1997), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The heroines—frequently orphaned, educated by elderly tutors, and depicted in country house libraries—fall in love with much older men in the later novels.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two novels were published in 1894 to mixed reviews. ''Love on a Mortal Lease'' (title from [[George Meredith]]) was released in June, followed in November by ''The Journey of High Honour'', at 30,000&amp;nbsp;words considerably shorter than the 355 pages of ''Love on a Mortal Lease''. Each novel sold only a few hundred copies. Harwood describes the early work such as ''Love on a Mortal Lease'' as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes ''Love on a Mortal Lease'' as a work in which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.&lt;ref name="H21ff"/&gt;

In the summer of 1896, "The Savoy," edited by Arthur Symons, published a two-part novella by Shakespear called "Beauty's Hour". Anne Margaret Daniel says that the story was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1886), with the dilemma of good vs. evil translated here into that of an unattractive woman who longs for beauty. In 2016, Valancourt Books published Daniel's edition of "Beauty's Hour", marking the first return to print of Shakespear's fiction for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel (2016)&lt;!-- page(s)?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She dedicated ''The False Laurel'', published in 1896, to Lionel Johnson. The plot features a poetess who falls in love with and marries an insipid young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to his needs. She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. ''The False Laurel'' was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from ''[[The Bookman (London)|The Bookman]]'' but a good one from ''The Athenaeneum''.&lt;ref name="H90ff"/&gt;

''Rupert Armstrong'' was published in 1899 by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Brothers]], dedicated to Valentine Fox. In this, the fourth of her novels, Harwood believes her writing and voice became more original. The complicated plot—a mother and daughter struggle for "possession of the [father's] artistic soul"—shows hints of incestuous love, a theme found in her later work. Written during the affair with Yeats, Harwood sees the characters presented "in a precise, bitter intensity unlike anything in the earlier work".&lt;ref name ="H90ff"&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 90–98&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Devotees'' was published by Heinemann in December&amp;nbsp;1900. Like ''Rupert Armstrong'', the plot of ''The Devotees'' depicts a mildly incestuous love: a young man and girl, raised together since childhood, devote themselves for decades to his drug-addicted mother before they marry. The reviews were mostly unkind.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 108–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivia's final novel, ''Uncle Hilary,'' was published in 1910 and is considered her best work. Of ''Uncle Hilary'' Jane Eldridge Miller writes in ''Rebel Women: Feminism, Modernism, and the Edwardian Novel'', "Shakespear demonstrates the ways in which that ideal leads to disillusionment and resentment".&lt;ref name = "Miller74ff"&gt;Miller (1997), pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; In the complicated plot a young woman unwittingly marries her stepfather, leaves him, and accepts a marriage proposal from her guardian. Harwood believes her loveless marriage, the love affair with Yeats, the frustration with Dorothy, and Pound's unfaithfulness to Dorothy, built in her a strength and acceptance of life that bordered on the spiritual and she no longer needed to write.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood (1989), pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; 

Miller writes that in the novel Olivia explores "marriage laws, divorce, and bigamy", with a focus on the nature of romantic love—rejected in favour of spiritual and intellectual pursuits.&lt;ref name="Miller74ff"/&gt; Leon Surette writes in ''The Birth of Modernism'', Olivia's ''Uncle Hilary'' highlights the ties between spiritualism, occultism and feminism, seeing ''Uncle Hilary'' as a feminist novel which he describes as "quite readable".&lt;ref&gt;Surette (1993), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Miller characterises the works as "marriage problem" novels in which the wife confronts the reality of marriage, its restrictions, and the need to achieve independence. By finding interests outside marriage the wife loses the overwhelming need for love within the marriage. Miller writes that in ''Uncle Hilary'' Olivia examines issues such as marriage laws, divorce, and bigamy, while focusing on the nature of romantic love. It was in ''Uncle Hilary'' that Olivia wrote of love: "Love is the worst slavery that exists&amp;nbsp;... it is the most persistent of illusions".&lt;ref name="Miller74ff"/&gt;

'''Broderick "Rickey" Smiley''' (born August 10, 1968) is an American stand-up comedian, television host, [[actor]], and [[radio personality]], known for his [[Prank call|prank phone calls]]. The calls feature Smiley disguising his voice and carrying on a conversation with the recipient of the call.  He is the host of the nationally syndicated ''Rickey Smiley Morning Show'' based in [[Atlanta]] from its flagship affiliate [[WHTA]] "Hot 107.9". Smiley has starred in sitcom ''[[The Rickey Smiley Show]]'', which aired on [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]. He is also a featured columnist on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-produced tabloid nationally-syndicated show ''[[Dish Nation]]''. In 2015, Smiley started appearing on ''[[Rickey Smiley For Real]]'', a reality television series about his life.

Smiley is a member of [[Omega Psi Phi|Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. ]] and [[Kappa Kappa Psi |Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity, Inc. ]]

==Career==

Smiley appeared as the host of the 2000 season of [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s "ComicView" program. He has also appeared on "Showtime at the Apollo", [[HBO]]'s "Def Comedy Jam", HBO's "Snaps", "The Nashville Network", "Uptown Comedy Club", and "Comic Escape".  His original comedy routines often feature the role-play of fictional characters such as "Bernice Jenkins" (AKA Granny Swims, Ms. Johnson or Mrs. Francis), "Lil' Daryl", "Rusty Dale" and "Beauford". Bernice Jenkins has a grandson named Rufus, who's a [[stereotype]] of the modern day "[[Gangster|Gangsta]]". He is referenced in "Two Of My Toes Fell Off" and another prank phone call where Smiley calls a pharmacy.

Smiley became the morning show personality for radio station [[KBFB]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in April 2004. The show features the trademark prank calls, as well as news, information and the latest [[hip hop music]].  In 2008, Smiley signed a deal with Syndicated One (a syndicated radio division of [[Radio One (company)|Radio One]]) to take the show nationwide, and ''The Rickey Smiley Morning Show'' is now heard on a number of [[mainstream urban]] radio stations.

He has also released several humorous songs based on his bits, such as "Roll Tide" featuring his [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] character Buford, and "We Miss Robert", based on a routine of his in which a friend of a deceased drug dealer performs a rap song called "We Miss Robert" at the funeral, which is actually a song about a woman, performed in hopes of landing a record deal. He currently has a syndicated morning show that is aired on urban radio stations throughout the United States.

Smiley had a starring role in [[Ice Cube]]'s ''[[Friday After Next]]''.

===Prank calls===
Some of Smiley's most notable calls include:
*"Buried Alive" - Smiley plays a [[narcoleptic]] who works at a funeral home and "fell asleep in one of these caskets" who calls a cemetery claiming that "they done buried me alive" and insists he is calling from inside a casket on his cell phone. He then requests that someone come and "dig all these graves open".
*"Come Over" - in a bit of a reverse prank (similar to the ones the [[Jerky Boys]] innovated), a hapless caller known as "K.D." calls a Smiley character named "Gina", a woman who initially entices him with statements like "I'm just 'bout to go crazy over here" and "I want you to come over and hurt me" before revealing she is a [[hermaphrodite]] ("that means I got both genitals"). K.D. assures Gina he is "still comin'", which prompts her to up the stakes by announcing that "my grandmama over here too...she a ''real freak''." K.D. then speaks to the grandmother who demands "I want you to scrub my head to the white meat" and wants to know "what kind of draws you got on."
*"Uncle Melvin" - Smiley prank calls his uncle, as a man who believes his girlfriend has left him, and who punctuates every remark with the word "dawg" ("Is my girl over there dawg...tell her I love her, dawg").
*"Churches" - Smiley plays two characters in this call, both of whom call [[Church's Chicken]]. One is an elderly lady whom mistakes Church's for a "[[wikt:church|church]]" (i.e. wants to know "what time do y'all start service" and asks "who is y'all's pastor", and "well when d y'all have Sunday school?"); when informed that she has called a restaurant, asks "Don't the chicken belong to the church?" The other caller is "Willie", who claims to be a heavyset man with a [[thyroid]] problem ("I can't get out the house no more"), and who asks for a rundown of the menu ("Is y'all [[okra]] fried, or is it all slimy in the pot, like grandmama used to make") and who constantly requests delivery of food to his house.
*"Pray For Me" - Using his "Granny" voice again, Smiley calls "Miss Ola Mae Benton Carter Jackson Glenn", and asks her to pray for a member of her church, who had been:
**stabbed
**involved in an [[ambulance]] crash
**hit by a train
**had a leg cut off by the [[Jaws of Life]]
**shot "in the right eye"
:Smiley then gets the woman to lead her in several verses of "Walk With Me, Lord", each verse increasing in silliness.
*"She P-E-E-D" - Smiley prank calls an elderly woman using his "Granny" voice; the aftermath of the call causes the woman to laugh so hard that she ends up [[urinating]] on herself.
*"Is My Daddy Over There" - Smiley plays Lil' Daryl and his brother Brandon as they call a lady claiming their father was supposed to return home with milk for their cereal. The brothers ask the lady what she has cooked for dinner over there as she ultimately hangs up on them in frustration.
*"Whose Funeral is Today?" - Smiley uses his "Granny" voice and calls a funeral home, asking for her deceased neighbor named Wilbert Smith. She learns that he was cremated and she was oblivious to his death, screaming out in agony when the funeral director repeats that he was cremated. The lady then asks who they are burying this week and offers to go to that funeral to make up for missing Wilbert's. The man tells her that the person they are burying is Hattie Mae Barkley, as she screams out again in agony as it is another person she knows.

'''Mercurius''' ({{lang-cop|Ⲫⲓⲗⲟⲡⲁ ⲧⲏⲣ Ⲙⲁⲣⲕⲟⲩⲣⲓⲟⲥ}}; d. AD 250) was a [[Christian]] saint and a [[martyr]]. He was born in the city of Eskentos in [[Cappadocia]], in Eastern Asia Minor (modern day Turkey). His original name, ''Philopater'' (variant spellings include ''Philopateer'' and ''Philopatyr''), means "lover of the Father". Saint Mercurius is also known by the name ''Abu-Seifein'' (أبو سيفين), which in [[Arabic]] means "the holder [literally, owns/possess] of two swords," referring to a second sword given to him, by the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]].

==Traditional biography==

===Family===
Some accounts state that Philopater was born in Eskentos in Cappadocia. However, others refer to Rome as his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://birminghamcopts.org/index.php/saints/st-abu-sefein-the-martyr | title=St. Abu-Sefein (Philopateer Mercurius) | work=Coptic Orthodox Churches in Birmingham, UK | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201100116/http://birminghamcopts.org/index.php/saints/st-abu-sefein-the-martyr | archivedate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philopater was the son of Yares, a [[Scythian]] officer in the [[Roman army]]. One day, while Yares was hunting in the forest with his father, the two were attacked by an animal. The animal jumped on Yares' father, causing Yares to faint. While Yares was unconscious, he had a vision with a brilliant light and a voice saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yares, I am your God who loves you. I know that you have a good heart and that you hate the pagan idols. I want to inform you that your son, Philopatyr, will become like a tree bearing good fruits, and because of him, I will bless you and your wife. Philopatyr will be my witness and will defy all prejudice in my name.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|direct quote = http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/synexarion/abusifein.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930193907/http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/synexarion/abusifein.html|archivedate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yares, his wife, and his son were baptized shortly after. All three were given new names. Yares became ''Noah'', his wife became ''Saphina'', and Philopater became ''Mercurius''. News of their [[baptism]] spread quickly in the city and the prince ordered them to be arrested and thrown to wild animals. However, the animals did not harm them and the prince decided to release Noah and his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/synexarion/abusifein.html "Philopatyr Marcorios", Coptic Orthodox Church Network]&lt;/ref&gt;
When the [[Berber people|Berbers]] attacked, Noah went to fight them. He was taken prisoner and was brought to their country where he was kept for seventeen months. When the war finally ended, he went back to his city and joined his family, but died shortly after.

St. Philopater Mercurius is also said to be the cousin of [[St. George]] of [[Cappadocia]].

===Military career of Saint Mercurius===
After the death of Noah, the [[pagan]] [[Roman Emperor]] [[Decius]] (ruled 249-251) chose Mercurius to replace his father. Described as very strong and courageous, Mercurius earned the respect of his fellow soldiers and gained renown as a swordsman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://st-takla.org/Saints/Saint-Philopater.html "Saint Philopater Mercurius", St. Takla Haymanout]&lt;/ref&gt; When the Berbers attacked Rome, Decius went out to fight them but became afraid when he saw how many there were. Mercurius then came to him and said, "Do not be afraid, because God will kill our enemies and will bring us victory."&lt;ref name=cocn&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/synaxarium/3_25.html#1 "The Martyrdom of St. Mercurius Known as the Saint with the Two Swords", Coptic Orthodox Church Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

After several days of fighting, the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] appeared to Mercurius holding a shining sword. The saint took the sword from the archangel, hence the name ''Abu-Seifein'' - "the holder of two swords": a [[military]] sword and a [[Divinity|divine]] sword.&lt;ref name=cocn/&gt; He conquered the Berbers. When Decius heard news of the triumphant victory, he named Mercurius as a prince.

===Martyrdom of Saint Mercurius===
[[Image:Yuhanna-Mercurius.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Coptic Icon of St Mercurius by [[Yuhanna al-Armani]] in [[The Hanging Church]], [[Cairo]].]]
Nonetheless, in 249, Decius began his persecution of Christians, compelling everyone to offer sacrifices to his pagan gods. The Archangel Michael appeared to Mercurius and told him to remember God and not be fearful of persecution. The saint was encouraged and spent the whole night praying fervently, confessing his weakness to God.

The Emperor sent messengers to summon Mercurius to the palace, saying: "Dear Mercurius, let us go offer incense to the gods who helped us attain victory in the war." As they were leaving, Mercurius slipped through the crowd and went away. However, one of the guards reported his absence, and the Emperor called Mercurius and asked him: "Is it true that you refused to worship the idols who helped us during the war?"&lt;ref name=amsm&gt;
[http://amsmcoptic.org/38064.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val* "Saint Mercurius", Archangel Michael &amp; Saint Mercurius Coptic Orthodox Church]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercurius declared himself a Christian, saying, "I do not worship anyone except my Lord and my God, Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name=cocn/&gt;

The Emperor tried to persuade him to give up his faith but failed. He then ordered Mercurius to be stripped of his rank and tortured.&lt;ref name=amsm/&gt; Fearing a revolt because the people loved Mercurius, the emperor had him bound in iron fetters and sent him to [[Caesarea]]. Mercurius was beheaded on 4 December 250 AD.&lt;ref name=amsm/&gt; He was only 25 years old.

==Other traditions==
[[Image:Triptych Harbaville Louvre OA3247 n5.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Arethas of Caesarea|St. Arethas]] with Saint Eustratius. In the roundels, '''Mercurius''' and [[Thomas the Apostle]]. From the [[Harbaville Tryptych]].]]
After the end of the first persecution, the place of the saint's burial was revealed. Mercurius appeared to a poor man in the city and told him that he was "Mercurius, the Martyr of the Lord." "My body is buried in [[Cappadocia|Cappadocia Gardens]], under the old house on the way to the royal palace. My body looks as white as snow, because Jesus was present at the time of my [[martyr]]dom," said the saint.

The next morning, the man went to dig under the old house. He began to smell the scent of perfume, seeing the body of the saint. The news spread quickly and many people came to take a look at the blessed body. They moved it temporarily to the local church until they built a new church bearing his name where Mercurius' body was buried with respect and devotion.

A few years later, the [[Catholicos of Armenia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and the Chief [[bishop]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], visited Egypt and met with the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], the leader of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]. The latter asked him if Egypt could have part of the relics of Saint Mercurius to be placed in the church that bears his name in Egypt. On [[Paoni 9 (Coptic Orthodox liturgics)|9 Paoni]] (16 June), part of the blessed relics of Saint Mercurius were transferred to Egypt.

According to one tradition, [[Saint Basil]] once prayed before an icon on which Mercurius was portrayed as a soldier carrying a spear. He asked God not to permit the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] (361-363) to return from his war against the Persians and resume his oppression of Christians. The image of the holy Great Martyr Mercurius depicted on the icon became invisible, only to reappear later with a bloodied spear. Julian the Apostate, on his Persian campaign, was mortally wounded by the spear of an unknown soldier.&lt;ref name=oca&gt;[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/11/24/103383-greatmartyr-mercurius-of-caesarea-in-cappadocia "Greatmartyr Mercurius of Caesarea, in Cappadocia", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuns at the St. Mercurius Monastery in Cairo credit the saint's intercession for the reversal of a government decision to confiscate their property for the Defense Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/75811.htm Nedosekin, Pavel.

The '''''sans-culottes''''' ({{IPA-fr|sɑ̃kylɔt|lang}}, literally "without [[culottes|breeches]]") were the common people of the lower classes in [[Early modern France#France in the 17th and 18th centuries|late 18th century France]], a great many of whom became radical and militant partisans of the [[French Revolution]] in response to their [[French Revolution#Causes|poor quality of life]] under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.&lt;ref name="britannica2011sansculotte"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/522646/sansculotte ''Sansculotte'']. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''sans-culottes'' refers to their clothing, and through that to their lower-class status: ''[[culottes]]'' were the fashionable silk [[Breeches|knee-breeches]] of the 18th-century [[French nobility|nobility]] and [[Bourgeoisie#In France and French-speaking countries|bourgeoisie]], and the [[working class]] ''sans-culottes'' wore [[Trousers#Modern Europe|''pantaloons'']], or trousers, instead.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"&gt;Chisholm, Hugh (1911) ''Sans-culottes''. Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.) (Cambridge University Press, 1911). This saying meant "ordinary patriots without fine clothes", and referred to the fancy clothes that famous patriots wore. They wore pants with cuffed, rolled up bottoms.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sans-culottes'', most of them urban labourers, served as the driving popular force behind the revolution. Though ill-clad and ill-equipped, they made up the bulk of the [[French Revolutionary Army|Revolutionary army]] during the early years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref name=Soboul&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sans-Culottes: The Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793–1794 |last=Soboul |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Soboul |year=1972 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-691-00782-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvxDQsze6r8C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0691007829&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-02-17 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–22}}

The most fundamental political ideals of the ''sans-culottes'' were [[social equality]], [[Economic egalitarianism|economic equality]], and [[popular democracy]]. They supported the abolition of all the authority and privileges of the [[House of Bourbon|monarchy]], nobility, and [[History of Roman Catholicism in France#The Revolution|Roman Catholic clergy]], the establishment of fixed wages, the implementation of [[General maximum|price controls]] to ensure affordable food and other essentials, and vigilance against [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]].&lt;ref name=Soboul/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy1981Women1"&gt;Darline Levy (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GtE-7skLY6AC&amp;pg=PA145 Women in Revolutionary Paris 1789–1795] (University of Illinois Press, August 1, 1981). Translated by Harriet Applewhite, Mary Johnson. Pg 144. Quotation:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''sans-culottes'' (...) campaigned for a more democratic constitution, price controls, harsh laws against political enemies, and economic legislation to assist the needy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The height of their influence spanned roughly from the original overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 to the [[National Convention#Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidorian Reaction]] in 1794.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt; Throughout the revolution, the ''sans-culottes'' provided the principal support behind the more radical and anti-bourgeoisie factions of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], such as the [[Enragés]] and the [[Hébertists]], and were led by populist revolutionaries such as [[Jacques Roux]] and [[Jacques Hébert]].&lt;ref name="britannica2011sansculotte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Higonnet1998Goodness1"&gt;Patrice Higonnet (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk8v9yD7rwgC&amp;pg=PA118 Goodness beyond Virtue: Jacobins during the French Revolution] (Harvard University Press, October 25, 1998). Pg 118. Quotation:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1793 the sans-culottes, the Parisian ''enragés'' especially, accused even the most radical Jacobins of being too tolerant of greed and insufficiently universalist. From this far-left point of view, all Jacobins were at fault because all of them tolerated existing civil life and social structures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sans-culottes'' also populated the ranks of [[paramilitary]] forces charged with physically enforcing the policies and legislation of the revolutionary government, a task that commonly included violence and the carrying out of executions against perceived enemies of the revolution.

During the peak of their influence, the ''sans-culottes'' were seen as the truest and most authentic sons of the French Revolution, held up as living representations of the revolutionary spirit. During the height of revolutionary fervor, such as during the [[Reign of Terror]] when it was dangerous to be associated with anything counter-revolutionary, even public functionaries and officials actually from middle or upper-class backgrounds adopted the clothing and label of the ''sans-culottes'' as a demonstration of solidarity with the working class and patriotism for the new [[French First Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt;

But by early 1794, as the bourgeois and middle class elements of the revolution began to gain more political influence, the fervent working class [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] of the ''sans-culottes'' rapidly began falling out of favor within the National Convention.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt; It wasn't long before [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] and his now dominant [[Jacobin Club]] turned against the radical factions of the National Convention, including the ''sans-culottes'', despite their having previously been the strongest supporters of the revolution and its government. Several important leaders of the Enragés and Hébertists were imprisoned and executed by the very [[Revolutionary Tribunal|revolutionary tribunals]] they had supported.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt; The execution of radical leader [[Jacques Hébert]] spelled the decline of the ''sans-culottes'',&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt; and with the successive rise of even more conservative governments, the [[Thermidorian Convention]] and the [[French Directory]], they were definitively silenced as a political force.&lt;ref name=Soboul /&gt;{{rp|258–259}} After the defeat of the [[Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III|1795 popular revolt in Paris]], the ''sans-culottes'' ceased to play any effective political role in France until the [[July Revolution|July Revolution of 1830]].

==Montagnard influence==


       
The working class was especially hurt by a hail storm which damaged grain crops in 1788, which caused bread prices to skyrocket.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. (London: Routledge, 2016), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; While the peasants of rural France could sustain themselves with their farms, and the wealthy [[French_nobility|aristocracy ]] could still afford bread, the urban workers of France, the group that comprised the ''sans-culottes'', suffered. In the city, division grew between the ''sans-culottes'' and these wealthy aristocrats; the former had a particular hostility “towards those with large private incomes.”&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, The ''Sans-culottes'': ''The Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government 1793-1794''. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton U.P., 1980), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The faction known as the [[The_Mountain|Montagnards]] expressed concern for the working classes of France.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, ''A Short History'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[National_Convention|National Convention]] met to discuss the fate of the former king [[Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis XVI]] in 1792, the ''sans-culottes'' vehemently opposed a proper [[Trial_of_Louis_XVI|trial]], instead opting for an immediate [[Execution_of_Louis_XVI|execution]]. The moderate [[Girondins|Girondin]] faction voted for a trial, but the radical Montagnards sided with the ''sans-culottes'', deeming that a trial was not necessary, and won with a slim majority. Louis XVI was executed on January 17, 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, ''A Short History'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The demands of the ''sans-culottes'' did not stop with the execution of the King, and the Montagnards worked hard to fulfill their mounting orders. This increased pressure from the radical masses exacerbated the ideological split between the Montagnards and the Girondins, and tensions began to grow within the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, ''A Short History'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, by May of 1793, the Montagnards worked with the [[National_Guard_(France)|National Guard]] -- which was, at this time, mostly ''sans-culottes'' -- to depose many of the Girondin deputies. Jeremy Popkin writes, “[the Montagnards and the ''sans-culottes''] surrounded the Convention, and two days later they intimidated assembly suspended twenty-nine Girondin deputies. The defeated Girondin leaders fled to the [[Provinces_of_France|provinces]]. The Montagnards were left in control of the Convention, which itself was clearly at the mercy of whoever could command the armed ''sans-culottes'' battalions.”&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, ''A Short History'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, whoever was in control of France’s destiny had to answer to the ''sans-culottes'', who “effectively exercised legislative power” in situations of unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Soboul, ''The Sans-culottes'', 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, they would risk a similar uprising and their own exile, or possibly even execution. This political shift towards radicalism would soon turn into the Reign of Terror.

==Reign of Terror==
The mass violence of the ''sans-culottes'' created a lasting impact on the Reign of Terror. These revolutionaries allied themselves most readily with those in power who promised radical change. The ''sans-culottes'' believed in a complete upheaval of the government, pushing for the execution of any that were considered corrupt by the leaders, even going as far as wanting “the enemies of the republic [to] hang-main and the [[Guillotine|guillotine]] to stand like the first patriots, the finisher of the law.”&lt;ref&gt;“''The Appearance, Predictions and Advice of the Devil, to the National Convention of France, in the Month of Nov. 1793.''” ''Taken from the Sans Culottes Gazette''. (London: N.p, 1793).&lt;/ref&gt; The support of the ''sans-culottes'' could be used as a political weapon to get rid of enemies of the Revolution. The key to Robespierre’s Terror lay in their willingness and ability to mobilize. Thus, the [[Committee_of_Public_Safety|Committee]] leaders used speeches to gain their support. In a speech ''On the Principles of Political Morality.''&lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, ''"On the Principles of Political Morality"'' (speech, Paris, February 1794), Internet History Sourcebooks, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1794robespierre.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; Robespierre proclaimed: “It has been said that terror was the mainspring of despotic government. Does your government, then, resemble a despotism? Yes, as the sword which glitters in the hands of liberty's heroes resembles the one with which tyranny's lackeys are armed.” Robespierre expressed a desire for liberty that the ''sans-culottes'' admired. They pushed the Committee for radical changes and often found a voice with Robespierre. Their desperate desire for immediate changes and their aptitude for violence made the ''sans-culottes'' a necessary group in implementing the Terror.  
==Legacy==
The popular image of the ''sans-culotte'' has gained currency as an enduring symbol for the passion, idealism and [[patriotism]] of the common man of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="merriam2011sansculottism"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sansculottism ''Sansculottism'']. Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Merriam-Webster, 2011. Web. 17 Feb. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''sans-culottism''', ''sans-culottisme'' in French, refers to this idealized image and the themes associated with it.&lt;ref name="merriam2011sansculottism"/&gt; Many public figures and revolutionaries who were not strictly working class styled themselves ''citoyens sans-culottes'' in solidarity and recognition.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt; However, in the period immediately following the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] the ''sans-culottes'' and other [[left-wing politics|far-left]] [[political faction]]s were heavily persecuted and repressed by the likes of the [[Muscadin]]s.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt;

The [[French Republican Calendar]] at first termed the complementary days at the end of the year ''[[Sansculottides]]''; however, the [[National Convention]] suppressed the name when adopting the [[Constitution of the Year III]] (1795) and substituted the name ''jours complémentaires'' ("additional days").&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911Sans"/&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Sally Waller, part of the ''sans-culottes'' mantra was "permanent anticipation of betrayal and treachery".&lt;ref&gt;Waller, Sally. "How Significant was the Part Played by the Crowd and the Sans Culottes?" France in Revolution, 1776–1830. Oxford: Heinemann, 2002. 162. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the ''sans-culottes'' were constantly on edge and fearing betrayal, which can be attributed to their violent and radical rebellion tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=SvxDQsze6r8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=the+sans+culotte&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0m2x3ajUKG&amp;sig=xm2__X34LrJuqmEX5zX2EsXWtVg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjavvbjrbHWAhWLyIMKHSXdA8A4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20sans%20culotte&amp;f=false|title=The Sans-culottes: The Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793-1794|last=Soboul|first=Albert|date=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691007829|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] observes that the ''sans-culottes'' were a 'shapeless, mostly urban movement of the labouring poor, small craftsmen, shopkeepers, artisans, tiny entrepreneurs and the like'.&lt;ref name="hobsbawm1962theage"&gt;Eric Hobsbawm 'The Age of Revolution' (St Ives, 1962; repr. 2008), p.84&lt;/ref&gt; He further notes they were organised notably in the local political clubs of Paris and "provided the main striking-force of the revolution".&lt;ref name="hobsbawm1962theage"/&gt; Hobsbawm writes that these were the actual demonstrators, rioters and constructors of street [[barricade]]s. However, Hobsbawm maintains, ''sans-culottism'' provided no real alternative to the bourgeois radicalism of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]];&lt;ref name="hobsbawm1962theage"/&gt; from Hobsbawm's Marxist perspective, the ideal of the ''sans-culottes'', which sought to express the interests of the 'little men' who existed between the poles of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and the [[proletariat|proletarian]], was contradictory and ultimately unrealizable.&lt;ref name="hobsbawm1962theage"/&gt;

The Marxist historian [[Albert Soboul]] emphasized the importance of the ''sans-culottes'' as a social class, a sort of proto-proletariat that played a central role in the French Revolution. That view has been sharply attacked by scholars who say the ''sans-culottes'' were not a class at all. Indeed, as one historian points out, Soboul's concept has not been used by scholars in any other period of French history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=Contesting the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsCf8Q0xqO4C&amp;pg=PA95|date= 2009|publisher=John Wiley|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern colloquial usage==

Ironically, given its origin as a term to describe men's breeches, the term "culottes" in [[French language|French]] is now used to describe women's [[underpants]], an article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historic culottes.  The term ''"sans-culottes"'' has been used colloquially to mean not wearing underpants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = sans-culotte | contribution-url = http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/sans-culotte | title = Passons de la sans-soutif de l'Upper East Side à la sans-culotte de Times Square | quote = And from no bra on the Upper East Side ... ... to no panties in Times Square.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sean O'Callaghan''' (26 January 1954 – 23 August 2017)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imgur.com/a/GWvRA Date of death], imgur.com; accessed 25 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). From the late 1970's to the mid-1980's he worked against the organisation from within as an [[intelligence agent]] for the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] with the [[Garda Síochána]]'s [[Special Detective Unit|Special Branch]]. 

In the mid-1980's he left the Provisional IRA and subsequently voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution for actions he had engaged in as a PIRA gunman in the 1970's. Following his release from imprisonment, he published a memoir detailing his life in Irish paramilitarism entitled ''The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man's War on Terrorism'' (1998). 

Former Irish [[Taoiseach|Prime Minister]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] described O'Callaghan as one of the Irish Government's most important spies operating within the Provisional IRA during the late 20th Century's [[The Troubles|paramilitary war in Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;'Sean O'Callaghan,: Former Provisional IRA Commander &amp; Informer', obituary, 'Irish Times', 2 September 2017. https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/sean-o-callaghan-former-provisional-ira-commander-and-informer-1.3205149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
O'Callaghan was born on 26 January 1954, into a family with a [[Fenian]] paramilitary history, in [[Tralee]], [[County Kerry]]. His paternal grandfather had taken the Anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] side during the [[Irish Civil War]], and his father had been interned by the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] at the [[Curragh Camp]] in [[County Kildare]] for [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|IRA]] activity during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, the teenaged O'Callaghan had ceased practising the Catholic faith, adopted [[atheism]] and had become interested in the theories of [[Marxist]] revolutionary politics, which found an outlet of practical expression in the sectarian social unrest in [[Ulster]] at that time, centred on the activities of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. In 1969, an outbreak of [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|communal violence]] broke out in Ulster and believing that [[British imperialism]] was responsible, O'Callaghan joined the newly founded [[Provisional IRA]] at the age of 17. 

Soon afterwards, he was arrested by local [[Gardaí]] after he accidentally detonated a small amount of explosives, which caused damage to the homes of his parents and their neighbours.&lt;ref name="smearing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harnden|first=Toby|authorlink=Toby Harnden|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/15th-february-1997/16/the-smearing-by-the-green|title=The smearing by the green|work=[[The Spectator]]||date=15 February 1997|accessdate=27 August 2006|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After demanding, and receiving, treatment as a political prisoner, O'Callaghan quietly served his sentence.

==Provisional Irish Republican Army activity==
After becoming a full-time paramilitary with the Provisional IRA, in the early to mid 1970's O'Callaghan took part in over seventy [[terrorist]] operations, including bomb materials manufacture, attacks on multiple PIRA targets in Ulster, and robberies to provide funding for the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for O'Callaghan, 'The Independent' 28 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 May 1974 he was part of an attack by a PIRA force on a lightly manned [[6th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment]] facility at the village of [[Clogher]] in [[County Tyrone]], with sustained automatic-rifle fire, [[RPG-7|anti-tank rockets]], and rounds fired from an improvised mortar &lt;ref&gt;'The Royal Irish - The Irish Soldier in Service to the Crown' website. Account of the attack on the UDR Clogher base on 2 May 1974. https://www.royal-irish.com/events/first-female-soldier-udr-pte-eva-martin-killed-ira-clogher&lt;/ref&gt; which was operated by O'Callaghan.&lt;ref&gt;'James Connolly, My Search for the Man, the Myth &amp; his Legacy', by S.

London: Corgi Books. pp. 95–99; {{ISBN|0-552-14607-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 1974 O'Callaghan killed Detective Inspector Peter Augustine Flanagan, a 47 year old Ulster Catholic police officer and head of the Omagh Division of the [[RUC Special Branch|Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch]], by shooting him repeatedly with a handgun in a two man PIRA attack in a public house in the town of [[Omagh]] in County Tyrone.&lt;ref&gt;Photo of Peter Flanagan, Victor Patterson website (2018). https://victorpatterson.photoshelter.com/image/I0000rCF7LUZXkrE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan, pp. 103–13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, aged 22, O'Callaghan ended his involvement with the Provisional IRA after becoming disillusioned with its activities, and what he perceived was an undercurrent of [[ethnic hatred]] in its rank and file, and he left Ireland and moved to London. In May 1978, he married a Scottish woman of Protestant [[Unionism in Scotland|unionist]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1970s, he ran a successful mobile cleaning business.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to fully settle in his new life, later recalling: "In truth there seemed to be no escaping from Ireland. At the strangest of times I would find myself reliving the events of my years in the IRA. As the years went on, I came to believe that the Provisional IRA was the greatest enemy of democracy and decency in Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 O'Callaghan was approached by the IRA seeking to recruit him again for its paramilitary terrorist campaign.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, he decided to [[turncoat]] against the organization and become an agent within its ranks for the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]]. In his memoir, O'Callaghan described his reasoning as follows: 

&lt;Blockquote&gt;I had been brought up to believe that you had to take responsibility for your own actions. If you did something wrong then you made amends. I came to believe that individuals taking responsibility for their own actions is the basis for civilisation, without that safety net we have nothing.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Soon after being approached by the IRA to re-join he returned to [[Tralee]] from London, where he arranged a clandestine meeting with an officer of the [[Special Detective Unit|Garda Special Branch]] in a local cemetery, at which O'Callaghan expressed his willingness to work with it to subvert the IRA from within. At this point, O'Callaghan was still opposed to working with the [[British Government]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, O'Callaghan made contact with Kerry IRA leader [[Martin Ferris]] and attended his first IRA meeting since 1975. Immediately afterwards, he telephoned his Garda contact and said, "We're in".&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Callaghan, "Over the next few months plans to carry out various armed robberies were put together by the local IRA. It was relatively easy for me to foil these attempts; an occasional Garda car or roadblock at the 'wrong time'; the routine arrest of Ferris or myself; or simple 'bad planning', such as a car arriving late – a whole series of random stratagems".&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strike]] in the [[Maze Prison]], he attempted to start his own hunger strike in support of the Maze prisoners but was told to desist by the IRA for fear it would detract focus from the prisoners. O'Callaghan successfully sabotaged the efforts of republicans in Kerry from staging hunger strikes of their own.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), pp. 109–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, he notified the Garda of an attempt to smuggle in a fishing trawler named the ''Valhalla'' across the Atlantic seven tons of [[AK-47]] assault rifles from the United States to Ireland for the arsenal of the Provisional IRA's units. The shipment had been organised by the [[Winter Hill Gang]], an Irish-American [[crime family]] based in [[South Boston, Massachusetts]]. As a result, the cargo was intercepted by a combined force of the [[Irish Navy]] and the [[Garda Síochána]].&lt;ref&gt;"The IRA informer who kept Gardaí on track in search for Shergar", ''Irish Examiner'', 20 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Callaghan claimed to have been tasked in 1983 by the IRA with placing 25[[Pound (mass)|lb]] of [[Frangex]] in the [[Dominion Theatre]] in London,&lt;ref name="DM1"&gt;Whitaker, James, "John and Norma aghast at wedding", ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 23 May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; to try to kill [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] who were due to attend a charity pop music concert there.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; A warning was phoned into the Garda, and the Royal couple were hurriedly ushered from the theatre by their police bodyguard during the concert. The theatre had been searched before the concert and a second search following the warning revealed no device.&lt;ref name="DM1"/&gt;

In 1985, O'Callaghan was elected as a [[Sinn Féin]] councillor for Tralee Urban District Council, and unsuccessfully contested a seat on [[Kerry County Council]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Imprisonment==
After becoming disillusioned with his work with the Irish Government after the murder of another of its agents within the Provisional IRA  (Sean Corcoran in [[County Kerry]] in 1985), which it had failed to prevent despite O'Callaghan's warnings of the threat to him, and sensing a growing threat to himself from the organization which had become suspicious of aspects of his actions, O'Callaghan withdrew from the Provisional IRA and left Ireland to live in England, taking his wife and children with him. His marriage ended in a divorce in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Sean O'Callaghan, 'The Independent', 28 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 29 November 1988 he walked into a police station in [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent, England]], where, presenting himself to the officer on duty at the desk he confessed to the murder of [[Ulster Defence Regiment|UDR]] Greenfinch (female member) Eva Martin and the murder of D.I. Peter Flanagan during the mid-1970s, and voluntarily surrendered to British prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan, pp. 307–09.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the Royal Ulster Constabulary offered him [[witness protection]] as part of the [[Supergrass (informer)|informer]] policy, O'Callaghan refused it,{{cn|date=August 2017}} and was prosecuted under charges of two murders and 40 other crimes, to all of which he pled guilty, committed in British jurisdiction with the Provisional IRA. Having been found guilty he was jailed for a total of 539 years.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Sean O'Callaghan, 'The Independent', 28 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Callaghan served his sentence in prisons in Ulster and England. While in jail, he published his story in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]''. He was released as part of a [[Prerogative of Mercy]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1996.

==Post-IRA life==
In 1998 O'Callaghan published an autobiographical account of his experiences in Irish paramilitarism, entitled ''The Informer: The True Life Story of One Man's War on Terrorism'' (1998). In the book's text he stated (shortly before the death in Ulster of [[Eamon Collins]], another former Provisional I.R.A. member who had prominently turned upon Irish paramilitarism);

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know that the organisation led by [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Martin McGuinness]] would like to murder me. I know that that organisation will go on murdering other people until they are finally defeated. It is my belief that in spite of IRA/Sinn Féin's strategic cunning, and no matter how many people they kill, the people of the Irish Republic expect, because they have been told so by [[John Hume]], that there will be peace. There may come a time when their patience runs out. If that were to happen there would be no place for IRA/Sinn Féin to hide. We must work tirelessly to bring that day forward.&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan (1998), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Callaghan lived relatively openly in London for the rest of his life, having refused to adopt a new identity. He was befriended in the city by the Irish writer [[Ruth Dudley Edwards]], and worked as a security consultant, and also occasional advisor to the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] on how to handle [[Irish Republicanism]] in general, and [[Sinn Fein]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;'Ex-informer defends RUC against critics', Newsletter (Pub. Belfast) 25 January 2007. http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/ex_informer_defends_ruc_against_critics_1_1842337&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, O'Callaghan appeared in a London court with regard to an aggravated robbery that had occurred in which he was the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dudley-Edwards|first=Ruth|authorlink=Ruth Dudley Edwards|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/revealed-the-naked-truth-about-me-the-ira-whistleblower-and-the-gay-bondage-orgy--26415826.html|title=Revealed, the naked truth about me, the IRA whistle-blower &amp; the gay bondage orgy|work=The Independent|location=Eire|date=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 O'Callaghan published ''James Connolly: My Search for the Man, the Myth &amp; his Legacy'' (2015), a book containing a critique of the early 20th Century Irish revolutionary [[James Connolly]], and what O'Callaghan considered to be his destructive legacy in Ireland's contemporary politics.&lt;ref&gt;'Sean O'Callaghan, how I lost my faith in James Connolly', 'Irish Times', 25 November 2015. https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/sean-o-callaghan-how-i-lost-my-faith-in-james-connolly-1.2443428&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed claims of O'Callaghan's account==
Sources in Sinn Féin have publicly denied aspects of the statements made by O'Callaghan with regard to his IRA career, particularly the claim that he had attained the leadership of the IRA's ''Southern Command'', and had been a delegate to the [[IRA Army Council]], claims O'Callaghan made both in print and before a Dublin jury under oath. A 1997 article in ''[[An Phoblacht]]'', published by Sinn Féin, the political wing of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|PIRA]], alleged that O'Callaghan "has been forced to overstate his importance in the IRA, and to make increasingly outlandish accusations against individual republicans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republican-news.org/archive/1997/March06/06tout.html|title=AN PHOBLACHT/REPUBLICAN NEWS|website=Republican-news.org|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed to have attended an IRA finance meeting  in [[Letterkenny]] in 1980 alongside, among others, [[Pat Finucane]] and [[Gerry Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/04/18/do1801.xml&amp;sSheet=/opinion/2003/04/18/ixop.html|title=Opinion|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200010/ai_n8905397|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finucane denied being an IRA member, and Adams has never acknowledged membership in any proscribed organisation. In Finucane's case, the RUC and the [[Stevens Report]] indicated he was not an IRA member, although he came from an Irish Republican background and three of his brothers (Dermot, John, and Seamus) were members of the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2288775.stm|title=Adams denies IRA book allegations|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
O'Callaghan died by drowning after suffering a heart-attack at the age of 62 while in a swimming-pool in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in August 2017, while visiting his daughter, Tara. His death was reported on 23 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRA informer and author Sean O'Callaghan dies aged 62|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ira-informer-and-author-sean-ocallaghan-dies-aged-62-36064774.html|website=Irish Independent|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial service was held to his memory on 21 March 2018 at [[St Martin's in the Fields]] Church, in London, which was attended by representatives from [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionist]] parties and the [[Irish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;'Son pleased at recognition of O'Callaghan for fighting terror', 'News Letter' (Pub.

'''Shang Tsung''' (尚宗 - pinyin: ''shàng zōng'') is a fictional [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] and [[player character]] from the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series. A powerful evil warlock, he is a demonic [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] who absorbs  the living souls of those he defeats in order to maintain his youth and power and is able to change his appearance, including by morphing into other characters while retaining their abilities and movesets [[gameplay|in-game]]. Shang Tsung is usually portrayed as the right-hand man of series archvillain [[Shao Kahn]] and the main rival and [[archenemy]] of [[Liu Kang]]. 

Shang Tsung debuted in the original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', serving as the in-game tournament's grandmaster and the game's [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. He has since appeared in several games and other media spawned from the franchise, and was received positively by game critics.
==Appearances==
===Video games===
According to the first [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|''Mortal Kombat'' comic]], Shang Tsung was cursed by his gods to steal souls, or he would age rapidly and die prematurely. However, stealing souls allowed him to absorb his victims' knowledge and fighting skills as well. He entered the Mortal Kombat tournament, overcoming all competition and becoming Grand Champion. After his defeat, he became the tournament's coordinator, unfairly tipping the scales in Outworld's favor for nine tournaments so that [[Shao Kahn]] could conquer Earth. He and his protege and champion [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] are defeated by the Shaolin Monk [[Liu Kang]] in the tenth tournament.

In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', Shao Kahn restores Shang Tsung's youth and tries to lure Earth's warriors into Outworld to give the emperor the advantage. While Shang Tsung and his master are defeated, this plot is merely a distraction while Shang Tsung resurrects Shao Kahn's wife Sindel in Earthrealm. Kahn crosses the dimensional boundaries to claim her, which merges Earthrealm with Outworld and enslaves the souls of billions of people. Shang Tsung is assigned to hunt down survivors, but is defeated by Liu Kang again.

In [[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance|Deadly Alliance]], Shang Tsung joins forces with fellow sorcerer Quan Chi in a bid to conquer the realms by resurrecting the Dragon King's invincible army. Their plan goes awry when the Dragon King himself returns from the dead, reclaiming his army. When [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] releases his godly essence in a last-ditch effort to defeat the Dragon King, Shang Tsung dies as well, but he is revived in ''[[Mortal Kombat Armageddon]]'' before the final battle between good and evil.

He is also featured as a playable character in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (2011).  As the game is a reboot of the first three titles in the series, his role is mostly consistent with these; however, near the story's end, Shao Kahn steals his soul and uses it to empower Sindel before sending her to kill the Earthrealm defenders.

Shang Tsung was not included in the roster of ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' (2015), but appears in Ermac's ending by stealing Ermac's souls in order to reconstitute himself, and in a flashback in [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Erron Black|Erron Black]]'s ending that sees him slowing Black's aging process in exchange for his assassination of an Earthrealm warrior. He is additionally mentioned by name in several mirror-match introductions as a possible explanation as to why the characters fight themselves.

====Character design====
[[File:Shang Tsung sketch.png|thumb|upright|left|"Shang Lao's" design and story in [[John Tobias]]' sketchbook (1990)]] 

Shang Tsung (originally named "Shang Lao") was based on the Chinese sorcerer Lo Pan from the film ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. A character named "Kitsune", which was later developed into [[Kitana]], "was going to fit into the story as Shang Lao’s (Tsung) princess daughter - the spoil of victory for winning the tournament", who would betray her father after she fell for Liu Kang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/therealsaibot John Tobias (therealsaibot) on Twitter] (a series of posts on September 7, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mortal Kombat'' art director Herman Sanchez said that as the series progressed he decided to emphasize Tsung's air of "sinister regality."&lt;ref&gt;Shang Tsung Bio Card video in ''MK: Armageddon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shang Tsung's design varies throughout the series. The initial history of the character was explained in the 1992 Midway-produced comic book based on the original ''MK'' game, in which he was the first-ever Mortal Kombat (then the Shaolin Tournament) champion over 500 years ago from the date of the then-current tournament depicted in the actual game, yet he was stricken with a curse that forced him to consume the souls of his defeated opponents in order to keep his youth. The book cited his "failure to appease the gods" as the reason for his premature aging to a withered old man, but he was noticeably younger in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', in which [[Shao Kahn]] had restored Shang Tsung's youth and powers as part of his plan to take over Earthrealm by luring Liu Kang and his fellow Earth warriors into Outworld for the next MK tournament.

According to ''[[GamePro]]'' magazine in 1993, the ''MKII'' version of Shang Tsung was nineteen years old, and an article about the game also included a rough sketch by ''Mortal Kombat'' co-creator [[John Tobias]] of Tsung's "true form," a twisted demon, which has never actually appeared in the video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mksecrets.net/mk2/eng/mk2-development.php |title=Mortal Kombat Secrets: Mortal Kombat II - In Development |publisher=Mksecrets.net |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobias wanted Shang Tsung's long hair to hang loose in ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', but potential problems with it flopping about whenever he jumped resulted in it being tied back into a ponytail. Responding to player queries about how Shang Tsung's last name is pronounced, [[Acclaim Entertainment]] stated in 1994 that there is no one definitively correct way of pronouncing the character's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Fightin' Words|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=59|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Gameplay====
In the original ''Mortal Kombat'' game Shang Tsung is a computer-controlled [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. He fires flaming skull projectiles and can morph into other characters at will; this gives him access to all of the Kombatants' signature moves. As a player character, he retains his morphing ability, but can only transform into player characters. Also, his skull projectile's versatility is expanded: he can summon skulls from above or below the opponent as well as shoot multiple skulls from his hands.

Tsung's shapeshifting went mostly unused in ''Deadly Alliance'', ''Deception'', ''Armageddon'', and ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''. [[Ed Boon]] explained this was due to a lack of sufficient memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Justin |last= Deering |title= 2008 MKO Fan Interview |url= http://tabmok99.mortalkombatonline.com/sdcc_2008_mko_fan_interview.txt |date= July 2008 |publisher= MortalKombatOnline |accessdate= 2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It returns in the 2011 game, but its use is more limited; a player-controlled Shang Tsung can only morph into his current opponent.

===Other media===
Shang Tsung plays his original role of main villain in the first series of the [[Malibu Comics]]' ''Blood &amp; Thunder'' miniseries, with his backstory mostly unchanged as an old man serving Shao Kahn to open the portal through 10 consecutive Mortal Kombat wins. He and Raiden share a bitter relationship, usually ending in either verbal assaults or draw fights. While Shang Tsung hosted the tenth tournament, he secretly planned to gain the powers of the mystical book Tao Te Zhan, which granted immense strength to whoever resolves its seven riddles. Shang Tsung and Raiden later join forces to stop Goro after he took the power of the book, since he cannot be trusted with such strength. During the ''Battlewave'' miniseries, it is implied that Shang Tsung resumed the tournament after his plans were foiled and lost it alongside Goro at the hands of Liu Kang. He is seen in the first pages of issue #1 being pursued and punished by Shao Kahn, [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat character)|Kintaro]], and Gorbak (Goro's father). Even though Shao Kahn supposedly punished him, he later appears in the last page of issue #5 completely rejuvenated and still under Shao Kahn's servitude. Shang Tsung would later serve as leader of Shao Kahn's team during the tournament he prepared in the last issue of the series, "Tournament Edition II". Shang Tsung's last appearance is during the 1995 ''Kung Lao'' one-shot comic, in which he serves as antagonist, attempting to kill Kung Lao through deceptive tricks using his shapeshifting abilities. In the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' prequel published by [[DC Comics]], in which he has not appeared, his island is described as having been taken over by Reiko and Havik following his death.

[[Image:Shangtsung23.png|thumb|upright|[[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Shang Tsung in the 1995 film ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]''|alt=]] Shang Tsung is the [[main antagonist]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', and was played by [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]. He regularly resorted to intimidation and trickery to try to manipulate the outcome of the tournament, which ultimately proved unsuccessful as he was defeated and killed by Liu Kang in the final battle.

Shang Tsung is also the prime villain of the animated film ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. In this version, he is portrayed as having the ability to read his opponent's thoughts during battle (an ability which is not present in the game series), allowing him to predict their attacks and adapt his own strategy to exploit the opponent's greatest weakness.

Shang Tsung appeared in several episodes of the animated series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', voiced by [[Neil Ross]].

In the ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'' TV series, Shang Tsung was portrayed by [[Bruce Locke]] as a sorcerer eager to take revenge on the Great Kung Lao, who had defeated him in Mortal Kombat. For most of the series, he was confined to Shao Kahn's [[cobalt]] mines for his failure in the Mortal Kombat tournament, although he occasionally escapes, since his powers are unaffected by the cobalt in the mines due to his human heritage. While in the mines, he keeps Kreeyan princess Vorpax as his personal slave (both literal and pleasure), and generally mistreats her until she receives her mother's powers.

Shang Tsung appeared briefly in the short film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Rebirth]]'', portrayed by [[James Lew]], and in the third episode of the webseries ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'', played by Johnson Phan. Tagawa reprised his role from the movie for the second season.

==Reception==

===Cultural impact===
Shang Tsung was featured along with Raiden, Ermac, Jax, and Scorpion in a 2014 animated [[short film]] parodying ''Mortal Kombat'' that was produced by [[Comedy Central]] and titled "The Tournament of Fighting Styles." He was renamed "Yao Zhang" and was the host of a secret underground tournament that is halted when a match featuring "Iron Shogun" (Scorpion) goes awry after the tournament's other contestants are no-shows, leaving Zhang scrambling to find a replacement. Iron Shogun is eventually declared the tournament winner when he kills a pizza deliveryman who unwittingly enters the arena.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/mortal-kombat-gets-an-amazing-animated-short-film-parody/|title=Mortal Kombat Gets An Amazing Animated Short Film Parody|first=John|last=Papadopoulos|publisher=Dark Side of Gaming|date=April 2, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shang Tsung appeared in a 2012 episode of ''[[The Annoying Orange]]'', played by Bobby Jennings (Bobjenz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=3/1/12 |url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/745089/the-annoying-orange-vs-shang-tsung-clip.jhtml |title=The Annoying Orange 'VS.

===Critical reaction===
The character was met with a positive critical reception. Shang Tsung was ranked 17th on [[GameDaily]]'s 2009 list of top evil masterminds of all time, which noted his attack style and goals while stating he is "one twisted freak."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-evil-masterminds-of-all-time/?page=9 Top 25 Evil Masterminds of All Time]. [[GameDaily]].

'''Shapur Sorab Kharegat''' (1 November 1932 – 29 September 2000) was a [[Parsi]] journalist, editor and former Asia Director of ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine.

Kharegat was born in Bombay, at "Palm Land", the home of his maternal great-grandfather, the ship chandler magnat Kavasjee Dadabhoy Dubash (+31.10.1921), to Col. Dr. Sorabjee Merwanjee Kharegat *1900 +19.10.1963 (son of Col. Dr. Mervanji Pestanji Kharegat of Madras Medical Service *20.11.1855 +17.12.1932), and his wife Dinbai Mehta (daughter of Navazbai Dubash and Byramji Mehta).  He spent his childhood at "The Clif" on [[Carmichael Road]], Bombay at "Babington House" in [[Mahabaleshwar]] and at 17 [[Carlyle Mansions]], Chelsea, London. Kharegat, who had a younger sister, Ratanbai (*15.1.1941 +11.8.2003), was a Parsi and a descendant of [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]], the first Indian Baronet and a first cousin once removed of [[Russi Mody]], Chairman and Managing Director of [[Tata Steel]].

His maternal step-cousin was the World War II hero Lt. George Clement, né Spiridonoff, (20.11.1917 - 7.9.1944). His first cousin was the late wife of [[Rustom K. S. Ghandhi]].

His paternal family was responsible for the building of "Kharegat Colony", a charitable housing estate scheme in India.
[[Sam Manekshaw]], a family friend and his father served together during [[World War II]] in [[Indo China]].
Kharegat was a member of the [[Travellers Club]].

As one of the very last great old colonial characters, he was Asia director of ''[[The Economist]]'', based in Hong Kong from August 1966 until his retirement in 1993, and died in London.

He was a major catalyst for ''The Economist's'' inclusion in Asia and according to ''The Economist's'' publisher David Hanger, S.S. Kharegat is remembered as "a huge character who travelled the world in his own inimitable style. He argued the case for the business side to enter Asia long before many of us realised its potential, and made all of the early running to develop the region ahead of many of our rivals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/search/83679/Old-Asia-hand-Kharegat-dies/ |title=Old Asia hand Kharegat dies - Media news |publisher=Media Week |date=2000-09-29 |accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shelley Taylor-Smith''' (born 3 August 1961) is a former Australian [[Long-distance swimming|long-distance swimmer]].

Born in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], Taylor-Smith suffered from [[scoliosis]], an abnormal curvature of the spine, throughout her school years. The condition required her to wear a [[back brace]], although she was successful in national age group swimming competitions. While on a swimming scholarship to the [[University of Arkansas]] in the [[United States]], the heavy  training regime caused a lower-body paralysis. During her recovery, her coach noticed that her swimming improved at greater distances, and encouraged her to take up marathon swimming, a sport which would also allow her to avoid potentially back-damaging "tumble turns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/1998/sportsf/sf980605.htm The Competitive Ocean] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214000727/http://www.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/1998/sportsf/sf980605.htm |date=14 February 2007 }}, ''The Sports Factor'' ([[Radio National]]), 5 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor-Smith's first major achievement was breaking the world four-mile record in 1983. Subsequently, she won the [[Manhattan Island Marathon Swim]] five times, breaking the world record in 1995 for swimming the 48&amp;nbsp;km distance in five hours, 45 minutes and 25 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Cynthia: [http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny041105story,0,3191598.htmlstory It Happened In New York] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235326/http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny041105story,0,3191598.htmlstory |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Newsday'', 14 July 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the [[Australian Marathon Swimming Championships]] three times, and seven consecutive [[FINA]] Marathon World Cups. She won a gold medal in the inaugural [[open water swimming]] event at the [[1991 World Aquatics Championships]] in Perth, and a bronze at the [[1994 World Aquatics Championships|1994 Championships]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=ABC Australian Sports Almanac |year=2002 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |location=Sydney |isbn=978-1-74064-056-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her autobiography, ''Dangerous When Wet: The Shelley Taylor-Smith Story'' ({{ISBN|1864480750}}) was published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1864480750 Dangerous when wet: The Shelley Taylor-Smith story], [[Amazon.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Taylor-Smith was diagnosed with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] after prolonged exposure to polluted water and ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' infection, and was given six months to live. She nonetheless went on to win her fifth consecutive Manhattan Island marathon, and then retired from swimming.

Taylor-Smith currently lives in Perth, where she works as a [[motivational speaker]] for her company, Champion Mindset.

In 1997, [[Transperth]] named a ferry the ''[[MV Shelley Taylor-Smith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Court/1997/08/New-Perth-ferry-to-be-named-after-Shelley-Taylor-Smith.aspx New Perth ferry to be named after Shelley Taylor-Smith] Premier of Western Australia 18 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen F. Hale''' (born '''Stephen Fowler Hale'''; January 31, 1816 – July 18, 1862) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from [[Alabama]] to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]] from 1861 to 1862. In July 1862, he died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Gaines's Mill|Battle of Gaines' Farm]], in [[Virginia]].

==Early life and education==
Hale was born on January 31, 1816, in [[Crittenden County, Kentucky]]. His father was a Baptist minister, a South Carolinian, who married a Miss Manahan, of the same state. He was a graduate of Cumberland University, came to Alabama about 1837, and taught school in Greene County for a year. He read law while teaching school, and in 1839 graduated from the law school at [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Locating in Eutaw, he practiced at different times in association with Alexander Graham and T.C. Clarke.

==Political career==
In 1843 he was elected to the State legislature from Greene County. After serving his term in the house, he met and married Mary Kirksey on June 12, 1844&lt;ref&gt;Greene County, Alabama, Marriages, 1823–1860&lt;/ref&gt; and retired to private life until the outbreak of the Mexican War in 1846, when he volunteered and was elected lieutenant of a company. He served in Mexico until the conclusion of peace in 1848, he then returned to Eutaw to his law practice. He was the nominee of his party for congress in 1853, but was defeated; was elected to the legislature again in 1857; was re-elected in 1859; and was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Alabama in 1859.

In December 1860, Hale, who was [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]]'s commissioner to [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|State of Kentucky]] at the time, wrote to that state's governor of Alabama's justification for secession. In it, he voiced support for the ''Dred Scott'' decision, condemned the Republican Party, and stated that the state's secession, which would perpetuate slavery, was the only way to prevent prospective freedmen, whom Hale referred to as "half-civilized Africans", from raping southern "wives and daughters":

{{quote|[I]n the South, where in many places the African race largely predominates, and, as a consequence, the two races would be continually pressing together, amalgamation, or the extermination of the one or the other, would be inevitable. Can Southern men submit to such degradation and ruin? God forbid that they should. [...] [T]he election of Mr. Lincoln cannot be regarded otherwise than a solemn declaration, on the part of a great majority of the Northern people, of hostility to the South, her property and her institutions - nothing less than an open declaration of war - for the triumph of this new theory of Government destroys the property of the South, lays waste her fields, and inaugurates all the horrors of a San Domingo servile insurrection, consigning her citizens to assassinations, and her wives and daughters to pollution and violation, to gratify the lust of half-civilized Africans.|Stephen F. Hale|letter to the Governor of Kentucky, December 1860&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civilwarcauses.org/hale.htm |title=Letter of S.F. Hale, Commissioner of Alabama to the State of Kentucky, to Gov. Magoffin of Kentucky |date=December 1860 |first=Stephen F. |last=Hale |accessdate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114142125/http://civilwarcauses.org/hale.htm |archivedate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==American Civil War==
When the secession ordinance was passed, he was appointed commissioner to Kentucky by Governor Moore and delivered an able address before the legislation at Frankford. That same year, he was elected to represent his district in the provisional congress of the Confederacy. While holding that position, he was chosen as a lieutenant colonel of the 11th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and repaired with it to Virginia. He remained with that command until after the battle of Seven Pines, when he was temporarily assigned to the Ninth Alabama regiment and led it into battle. The fall of Col. Moore obliged him to return to the Eleventh regiment, which he led &lt;ref&gt;Clifton W. Crisler, Grand Masters of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Alabama Who Served the Confederate States of America&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Battle of Gaines's Mill|Battle of Gaines' Mill]],&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior, The Civil War, Battles, Gaines' Mill&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia.

This was the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign, March–July 1862). Original documentation of the battle, at the National Archives, Washington DC, states "S.F. Hale, Lt. Col 11th Ala. Regt. Appears on a Report of casualties, of the 4th Brigade, Longstreet's Division, in the action at Gaines' Mill, Va., June 27, 1862, Remarks: Dangerously wounded".&lt;ref&gt;National Archives Trust Fund, Washington, DC, Series 1, Vol. 11, part 2, page 770.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hale died of wounds on July 18, 1862 at Richmond, after lingering for 22 days. He was laid to rest in Mesopotamia Cemetery (Oak Hill), Greene County, Alabama, Burial Row/Column 34/34. His tombstone bears the epitaph "Statesman, Jurist, Patriot, Soldier &amp; Christian Gentleman"&lt;ref&gt;Mesopotamia Cemetery, Greene County, Eutaw, Alabama&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Hale County, Alabama]] (established 1867), is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

{{nihongo|'''Susanoo'''|須佐之男 (スサノオ)|extra=also [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as '''Susano-o''', '''Susa-no-O''', '''Susano'o''', and '''Susanowo'''}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Takehaya Susanoo-no-Mikoto'''|建速須佐之男命}} and '''Kumano Ketsumiko no kami''' at [[Kumano shrine]], is the [[Shinto]] [[God (male deity)|god]] of the [[sea]] and [[storms]]. He is also considered to be ruler of Neno-Katasu-Kuni (根之堅洲國) (now [[Yasugi, Shimane|Yasugi]], [[Shimane Prefecture|Shimane-ken]]). He is married to [[Kushinadahime]].

==Myths==
In [[Japanese mythology]], Susanoo, the powerful storm god of Summer, is the brother of [[Amaterasu]], the goddess of the [[Sun]], and of [[Tsukuyomi]], the god of the [[Moon]]. All three were born from [[Izanagi]], when he washed his face clean of the pollutants of [[Yomi]], the underworld. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susanoo from the washing of the nose. Susanoo used [[Totsuka-no-Tsurugi]] as his weapon.

The oldest sources for Susanoo myths are the ca. 712 CE ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ca. 720 CE ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. They tell of a long-standing rivalry between Susanoo and his sister. When he was to leave [[Takama-ga-hara|Heaven]] by orders of Izanagi, he went to bid his sister goodbye. Amaterasu was suspicious, but when Susanoo proposed a challenge to prove his sincerity, she accepted. Each of them took an object of the other's and from it birthed gods and goddesses. Amaterasu birthed three women from Susanoo's Totsuka-no-Tsurugi while he birthed five men from her necklace. Claiming the gods were hers because they were born of her necklace, and the goddesses were his, she decided that she had won the challenge, as his item produced women. The two were content for a time, but Susanoo, the Storm God, became restless. In a fit of rage, he destroyed his sister's rice fields, hurled a [[flayed]] pony at her loom, and killed one of her attendants. Amaterasu, who was in fury and grief, hid inside the [[Ama-no-Iwato]] ("heavenly rock cave"), thus effectively hiding the sun for a long period of time.

Though she was persuaded to leave the cave (with the help of a ceremony and a unique style of dancing), Susano-o was punished by being banished from Heaven. He descended to the province of [[Izumo Province|Izumo]], where he met an elderly couple who told him that seven of their eight daughters had been devoured by the eight-headed [[Japanese dragon|dragon]] [[Yamata no Orochi]] and it was nearing time for their eighth, {{nihongo|[[Kushinada-hime]]|櫛名田比売}}. The [[Nihon Shoki]], here translated by [[William George Aston]] in ''Nihongi'', gives the most detailed account of Susanoo and Amaterasu slaying Yamata no Orochi. Compare to that found in the [[Kojiki]], translated by [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]] in ''The Kojiki'' (1919:71-3), where Susanoo is translated as "His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness":&lt;ref name="Sacredtexts"&gt;{{cite book|author=Basil Hall Chamberlain|title=The Kojiki: Records of Ancient Matters|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/kj/kj025.htm|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then Susanoo no Mikoto descended from Heaven and proceeded to the head-waters of the River Hi, in the province of Idzumo. At this time he heard a sound of weeping at the head-waters of the river, and he went in search of the sound. He found there an old man and an old woman. Between them was set a young girl, whom they were caressing and lamenting over. Susanoo no Mikoto asked them, saying:-"Who are ye, and why do ye lament thus?" The answer was:-"I am an Earthly Deity, and my name is Ashi-nadzuchi. My wife's name is Te-nadzuchi. This girl is our daughter, and her name is Kushi-nada-hime. The reason of our weeping is that formerly we had eight children, daughters. But they have been devoured year after year by an eight-forked serpent and now the time approaches for this girl to be devoured. There is no means of escape for her, and therefore do we grieve.” Sosa no wo no Mikoto said: "If that is so, wilt thou give me thy daughter?" He replied, and said: "I will comply with thy behest and give her to thee." Therefore Sosa no wo no Mikoto on the spot changed Kushi-nada-hime into a many-toothed close-comb which he stuck in the august knot of his hair. Then he made Ashi-nadzuchi and Te-nadzuchi to brew eight-fold sake, to make eight cupboards, in each of them to set a tub filled with sake, and so to await its coming. When the time came, the serpent actually appeared. It had an eight-forked head and an eight-forked tail; its eyes were red, like the winter-cherry; and on its back firs and cypresses were growing. As it crawled it extended over a space of eight hills and eight valleys. Now when it came and found the sake, each head drank up one tub, and it became drunken and fell asleep. Then Susanoo no Mikoto drew the [[Totsuka-no-Tsurugi|ten-span sword]] which he wore, and chopped the serpent into small pieces. When he came to the tail, the edge of his sword was slightly notched, and he therefore split open the tail and examined it. In the inside there was a sword. This is the sword which is called Kusa-nagi no tsurugi.&lt;ref name="London1896"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. G. Aston, C.M.G.|title=Supplement: Nihongi, chronicles of Japan from the earliest times to A.D. 697|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJ5OAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|volume=Vol. I|year=1896|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co., Limited|location=London|pages=52–53|chapter=Book I: The Age of the Gods}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sword from the dragon's tail, the ''Ama-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi'' ("Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven") or the ''[[Kusanagi|Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi]]'' ("Grasscutter Sword"), was presented by Susanoo to Amaterasu as a reconciliation gift. According to legends, she bequeathed it to her descendant [[Ninigi]] along with the ''[[Yata no Kagami]]'' mirror and [[Magatama#Yasakani no Magatama|Yasakani no Magatama]] jewel or orb. This sacred sword, mirror and jewel collectively became the three [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]].

==Izumo==
While Amaterasu is enshrined at the [[Honden]] of the [[Ise Grand Shrine]], Susanoo is enshrined at Kumano Taisha located in Shimane (formerly the Izumo region), where he descended when banished from heaven.

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''William Hobson''' [[Royal Navy|RN]] (26 September 1792 – 10 September 1842) was a British naval officer who served as the first [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] of New Zealand. He was a co-author of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

Hobson was dispatched from London in August 1839 with instructions to take the constitutional steps needed to establish a [[British colony]] in New Zealand. He was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor in [[Sydney]] (under [[George Gipps]]) and arrived in New Zealand on 29 January 1840. On 5 February 1840, Hobson met with [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]], where they signed a treaty by which the chiefs voluntarily transferred sovereignty to the [[British Crown]] in return for guarantees respecting their lands and possessions and their rights as British subjects. Three months later, Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand. He also selected the site for a [[capital of New Zealand|capital]] in the North Island, which he named [[Auckland]].

In May 1841, New Zealand was constituted as a separate [[Crown colony]], with Hobson promoted to Governor and Commander in Chief. In his final months Hobson was dogged by poor health which left him detached from political affairs. He died in office in September 1842.

==Early life==
William Hobson was born in [[Waterford]], Ireland, the son of Samuel Hobson, a barrister. He was raised in an [[Anglo-Irish]], [[Anglican]] family.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hobson"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Simpson|first=K. A.|id=1h29|title=Hobson, William|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He joined the [[Royal Navy]] on 25 August 1803 as a second-class volunteer. He served in the [[Napoleonic wars]] and was later involved in the suppression of [[piracy in the Caribbean]]. He became a [[midshipman]] in 1806 and some seven years later was a [[first lieutenant]]. He was promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] in May 1824 and commanded {{HMS|Scylla|1809|6}} between 1826 and 1828. In December 1834, he obtained a commission from [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]] to the [[East Indies]] on {{HMS|Rattlesnake|1822|6}}.

==Career in Australia==
In 1836, he was ordered to [[Australia]], arriving at [[Hobart]] on 5 August 1836 and at Sydney 18 days later. On 18 September 1836, [[HMS Rattlesnake (1822)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']] left for Port Phillip District (later [[Melbourne]]) conveying [[William Lonsdale (colonist)|Captain Lonsdale]] and other officials to the new colony. During the next three months, Hobson and his officers thoroughly surveyed [[Port Phillip]], the northern portion of which, by direction of Governor [[Richard Bourke|Sir Richard Bourke]], was named [[Hobsons Bay]], after him. His ship was involved in the founding of [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]. He was offered the position of Superintendent of the Bombay Marine at a salary of £2000 a year, but he had taken a liking to Australia and was a candidate for the governorship of Port Phillip, although the salary was not expected to be more than £800 a year.

The more recently created [[City of Hobsons Bay]] is also name after William.

==Career in New Zealand==
[[File:NZ Retro Pattern Crown 1840 Victoria Waitangi.jpg|thumb| Retro Pattern Crown: [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] shaking hands with Hobson at Waitangi on 6 February 1840]]
On 26 May 1837 Hobson sailed to the [[Bay of Islands]], New Zealand, in response to a request for help from [[James Busby]], the British Resident, who felt threatened by wars between Māori iwi (tribes).  For three months in 1837 [[Pōmare II (Ngāpuhi)|Pōmare II]] (Whiria) fought with [[Tītore]] until a peace agreement was negotiated by Tareha.&lt;ref name=AB&gt;{{cite web|first=Angela |last=Ballara |title = Pomare II - Biography|date =1 Sep 2010 |url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/1p20/1|publisher= Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate= 12 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to England in 1838, Hobson submitted a report on New Zealand, in which he proposed establishing British sovereignty over the islands in small pockets similar to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="birth_certificates"&gt;{{cite book|title= New Zealand Birth Certificates – 50 of New Zealand's Founding Documents|editor= [[Paul Moon]] |year= 2010|publisher= AUT Media|ISBN= 978-0-9582997-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lieutenant-Governor===
At the time, the British government recognised the sovereignty of the Māori people, as represented in the [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]] of October 1835.  Hobson was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor]] under the [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor of New South Wales]], Sir [[George Gipps]] (ratified on 30 July 1839) and British [[consul]] to New Zealand (confirmed on 13 August 1839).  On 14 August 1839 [[Constantine Henry Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby|Lord Normanby]] issued him with detailed instructions, giving{{clarify|date=August 2013|reason=Who? Hobson or Normanby?}} reasons for intervention in New Zealand and directions for the purchase of land "by fair and equal contracts".  (The land was later resold to [[Pākehā settlers]] at a profit to provide for further operations.)

Hobson arrived in the [[Bay of Islands]] aboard [[HMS Herald (1822)|HMS ''Herald'']] on 29 January 1840 (which northern New Zealanders mark as [[Auckland Anniversary Day]]) with a small group of officials, including an Executive Council consisting of Colonial Secretary [[Willoughby Shortland]], Colonial Treasurer [[George Cooper (public servant)|George Cooper]] and Attorney-General Francis Fisher.  The Legislative Council comprised the above officials and three [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]]. Hobson appointed as three [[Magistrates]], Messrs. Shortland, Johnson, and Matthew.&lt;ref name="CARv2-1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |page=22 |pages= |chapter= Vol. II |chapterurl= http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1048&amp;page=1&amp;action=null|quote= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty of Waitangi===
{{Main|Treaty of Waitangi}}
[[File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg|thumb|An extant copy of Hobson's treaty]]
The Treaty of Waitangi was first proposed by Hobson on his return to Britain from his first visit to New Zealand. Upon arrival in New Zealand, Hobson almost immediately drafted the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] together with his secretary James Freeman and James Busby. Busby had previously drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.

Hobson headed the British signatories. Of the 40 or so Māori chiefs, the [[Ngapuhi]] chief [[Hōne Heke]] was the first to sign the treaty. As each chief signed, Hobson said "''He iwi tahi tātou''", meaning "We are [now] one people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orange |first=Claudia |title=An Illustrated History of the Treaty of Waitangi |year=2004 |publisher=Bridget Williams Books |location=Wellington |isbn=1-877242-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enhance the authority of the treaty eight further copies were made and sent around the country to gather additional signatures. After obtaining signatures to the Treaty at the Bay of Islands (6 February 1840), he travelled to [[Waitematā Harbour]] to obtain more signatures and to survey a suitable location for a new [[Capital of New Zealand|capital]] (he also sent the Deputy Surveyor-General, [[William Cornwallis Symonds]], to other areas to obtain more signatures). After suffering a [[stroke]] on 1 March 1840, he was taken back to the Bay of Islands, where he recovered sufficiently to continue work.&lt;ref&gt;archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/treaty&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 1840, in response to the creation of a "republic" by the [[New Zealand Company]] settlers of [[Port Nicholson]] (later [[Wellington]]), who were laying out a new town under the flag of an independent New Zealand, Hobson asserted British [[sovereignty]] over the whole of New Zealand, despite the incompleteness of the treaty signing.  He sent [[Willoughby Shortland]] and some soldiers to Port Nicholson on 25 May 1840, and the council of the settlers was disbanded.  Their leader, [[William Wakefield]], later travelled to the Bay of Islands to pledge allegiance to the Crown.  His suggestion to make Port Nicholson the capital was rejected in favour of Hobson's plan for a new town on Waitematā Harbour, to be named [[Auckland]] after the [[Baron Auckland|Earl of Auckland]].

On 11 July 1840 the French [[frigate]] ''L'Aube'' arrived at the Bay of Islands on its way to [[Banks Peninsula]] as part of the settlement plan of the [[Nanto-Bordelaise Company]].  Hobson immediately sent two [[magistrate]]s to the area to establish the British claim to sovereignty by holding courts.

Near the end of 1840, the [[Port Nicholson]] settlers sent a [[petition]] to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] calling for Hobson's dismissal over his treatment of them.  Hobson responded on 26 May 1841 to the Foreign Secretary.

===Governor===
In November 1840, the Queen signed a [[royal charter]] for New Zealand to become a [[Colony of New Zealand|Crown colony]] separate from [[New South Wales]]. Hobson was sworn in by the [[Chief Justice of New Zealand|Chief Justice]] as [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor and Commander in Chief]] on 3 May 1841.

Hobson travelled to Wellington in August 1841, where he heard the complaints of settlers and selected magistrates. He then visited [[Akaroa]] to settle the French claims. Back in Auckland, he had some difficulty with the Māori, and his government was ridiculed by journalists in Wellington and Auckland. He responded by closing down the ''[[New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette]]''. With his government low on funds, he resorted to issuing unauthorised bills on the British Treasury in 1842. Hobson faced opposition from the "Senate clique" radicals who sent a petition to the Foreign Secretary to have Hobson recalled. One of Hobson's last actions was to declare an [[Auckland Anniversary Day]], to mark the anniversary of his arrival in the Bay of Islands.

[[File:William Hobson Grave.jpg|thumb|William Hobson's grave at the Symonds Street cemetery, central Auckland.]]

Hobson suffered a second stroke and died on 10 September 1842, prior to being recalled from office. He was buried in the [[Symonds Street cemetery]] in Auckland. The [[Waitakere]] suburb of [[Hobsonville]] is named after him.

== Biography ==
Yuri Velykanovych was born in a family of teachers Emilia and Dnytro Velykanovych in the village of [[Ilnyk]] (Austria-Hungary, nowadays [[Turka Raion]], [[Lviv Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]) where he graduated from school. Since 1920 he studied in the Ukrainian grammar school in [[Lviv]]. Then he entered the Faculty of Philology at the Jan Kazimierz University (nowadays [[University of Lviv|Ivan Franko National University of Lviv]]). Being a student he joined the Communist Party of Western Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donchenko|first=S.

Since the summer of 1936, he is a fighter of the [[International Brigades]] in Spain during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://propaganda-journal.net/9977.html|title=Первый бой фашизму в Испании:  участие в этом выходцев из Западной Украины|last=|first=|date=|website=propaganda-journal.net|language=Russian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since July 1937, he is a member of the [[Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko|Company named after Taras Shevchenko]] (a part of the [[XII International Brigade|XIII Dabrowski Brigade]]) composed of Ukrainian communists from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uacrisis.org/es/48229-guerra-civil-espanola-1|title=Los ucranianos en la Guerra Civil Española: parte 1 – a favor del bando republicano {{!}} UACRISIS.ORG|date=2016-10-18|work=Ukraine crisis media center|access-date=2018-02-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interbrigadist press Velykanovych publishes his articles and correspondence in Polish, Spanish and Ukrainian about [[Taras Shevchenko]]'s life and creativity, about the battle way of the company ("Taras Shevchenko", "The Ukrainians in the International Brigades", "Taras Shevchenko in the Aragon Front" and others).

On September 4, 1938, he was mortally wounded in the [[Battle of the Ebro|battle of the Ebro river]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Homage ==

During the Soviet era, in 1982, a monument to Yuri Velykanovych was erected in Lviv. In addition a street received the name of Velykanovych (renamed by the authorities in 1991 after gaining [[Independence of Ukraine|independence]]). On that street there was a school with deep learning of Spanish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In May 2015, the vandals cut off the head of the statue. The monument was dismantled for restoration, and then returned to its place.

At night on December 2, 2017, members of the [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group C14 threw the sculpture to the ground, drew the slogan "Down with the communist!" on the pedestal, and left the signature of their gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://korrespondent.net/city/lvov/3913295-vo-lvove-povredyly-pamiatnyk-kommunystu-velykanovychu|title="Во Львове повредили памятник коммунисту Великановичу"|last=|first=|date=December 4, 2017|work=Корреспондент.net|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
