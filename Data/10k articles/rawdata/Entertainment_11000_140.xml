'''Alfred Jarry''' ({{IPA-fr|al.fʁɛd ʒa.ʁi|lang}}; 8 September 1873 – 1 November 1907) was a French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] writer who is best known for his play ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896).&lt;ref&gt;Jarry, Alfred. "Ubu Roi". Dover (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; a pataphysical work which depicts the bourgeoisie as the super-mediocre.  He coined the term and philosophical concept of [['pataphysics]] which uses absurd irony to portray symbolic truths (and playfully vice versa)  .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bookbyte.com/textbooks/pataphysics/9780810118775-0810118777 "Pataphysics - 01 edition"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarry was born in [[Laval, Mayenne]], France, and his mother was from [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;Brotchie, Alastair. ''Alfred Jarry, a Pataphysical Life''. MIT Press (2013). {{ISBN|978 0 262 01619 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was associated with the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. His play ''Ubu Roi'' is often cited as a forerunner of [[Dada]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movements of the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles, prefiguring the [[Post-modern literature|postmodern]], including novels, poems, short plays and opera bouffes, absurdist essays and speculative journalism. His texts are considered examples of [[absurdist literature]] and [[Post-modern philosophy|postmodern philosophy]].

==Biography and works==
[[File:Alfred Jarry, Deux aspects de la marionnette originale d'Ubu Roi.jpg|thumb|Alfred Jarry, ''Deux aspects de la marionnette original d'Ubu Roi'', premiered at the Théâtre de l'Œuvre on 10 December 1896]]

His father Anselme Jarry (1837-1895) was a salesman who descended into alcoholism; his mother Caroline, née Quernest (1842-1893), was interested in music and literature, but her family had a streak of insanity, and her mother and brother were institutionalized. The couple had two surviving children, a daughter Caroline-Marie, called Charlotte (1865-1925), and Alfred. In 1879 Caroline left Anselme and took the children to Saint-Brieuc in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Nigey. ''Alfred Jarry: The Man with the Axe''. San Francisco: Last Gasp, 1984, pp. 16-18. {{ISBN|0-86719-382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 the family moved to [[Rennes]], where Jarry entered the lycée at 15. There he led a group of boys who enjoyed poking fun at their well-meaning, but obese and incompetent physics teacher, a man named Hébert. Jarry and his classmate, Henri Morin, wrote a play they called ''Les Polonais'' and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends. The main character, ''Père Heb'', was a blunderer with a huge belly, three teeth (one of stone, one of iron and one of wood), a single, retractable ear and a misshapen body. In Jarry's later work ''Ubu Roi'', Père Heb would develop into Ubu, one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature.

At 17 Jarry passed his [[baccalauréat]] and moved to Paris to prepare for admission to the École Normale Supérieure. Though he was not admitted, he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems. A collection of his work, ''Les minutes de sable mémorial'', was published in 1893.

That same year, Jarry contracted influenza. His mother and sister tended him, but once he recovered his mother fell ill of the disease and died; two years later his father perished from influenza as well, leaving Jarry a small inheritance which he quickly spent.&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Nigey. ''Alfred Jarry: The Man with the Axe'', pp. 34, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol, which he called "my sacred herb" or, when referring to [[absinthe]], the "green goddess." A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour (and possibly under its influence).

When he was drafted into the army in 1894, his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline. The sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5-foot frame—the army did not issue uniforms small enough—was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills. Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons. His military experience eventually inspired his novel ''Days and Nights''.

[[File:Véritable portrait de Monsieur Ubu.png|thumb|left|Père Ubu (later: Ubu Roi), from a woodcut by Alfred Jarry]]
Jarry returned to Paris and applied himself to writing, drinking and the company of friends who appreciated his witty, sweet-tempered and unpredictable conversation. This period is marked by his intense involvement with [[Remy de Gourmont]] in the publication of ''[[L'Ymagier]] ,'' a luxuriously produced "art" magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as an art movement was in full swing at this time, and ''L'Ymagier'' provided a nexus for many of its key contributors. Jarry's play ''[[Caesar Antichrist]]'' (1895) drew on this movement for material. This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated. Using the biblical [[Book of Revelation]] as a point of departure, ''Caesar Antichrist'' presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which Christ is resurrected not as an agent of [[spirituality]] but as an agent of the [[Roman Empire]] that seeks to dominate spirituality. It is a unique narrative that effectively links the domination of the soul to contemporaneous advances in the field of [[Egyptology]] such as the 1894 excavation of the [[Narmer Palette]], an ancient artifact used for situating the [[rebus]] within [[hermeneutics]]. The character Ubu Roi first appears in this play.&lt;ref&gt;Cody, Gabriele. Sprinchorn, Everet. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama, Volume 1''. Columbia University Press (2007) {{ISBN|9780231144223}} page 53&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Jarry - Alfred Vallette Corbeil.png|thumb|Jarry (left) and Alfred Vallette, editor of the literary magazine, ''Mercure de France''. Vallette hosted a presentation of ''Ubu Roi'' in Vallette's home in 1894.]]

The spring of 1896 saw the publication, in Paul Fort's review ''Le Livre d'art'', of Jarry's 5-act play ''[[Ubu Roi]],'' the rewritten and expanded ''Les Polonais'' of his school days. ''Ubu Roi''{{'}}s savage humor and monstrous absurdity, unlike anything thus far performed in French theater, seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage. However, impetuous theater director Aurélien-Marie Lugné-Poe took the risk, producing the play at his Théâtre de l'Œuvre.

On opening night (10 December 1896), with traditionalists and the [[avant-garde]] in the audience, King Ubu (played by Firmin Gémier) stepped forward and intoned the opening word, "Merdre!" (often translated as "Pshit" or "Shittr!" in English). A quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued: outraged cries, booing, and whistling by the offended parties, countered by cheers and applause by the more degenerate contingent. Such interruptions continued through the evening. At the time, only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held, and the play was not revived until after Jarry's death.

The play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry, and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created. Gémier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry's own staccato, nasal vocal delivery, which emphasized each syllable (even the silent ones). From then on, Jarry would always speak in this style. He adopted Ubu's ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech; for example, he referred to himself using the [[royal we|royal ''we'']], and called the wind "that which blows" and the bicycle he rode everywhere "that which rolls."

Jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition. The diminutive Jarry could just manage to stand up in the place, but guests had to bend or crouch. Jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver. In response to a neighbor's complaint that his target shooting endangered her children, he replied, "If that should ever happen, ma-da-me, we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you."

[[File:Jarry velo.jpg|thumb|250px|Jarry in [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]] in 1898 on his ''cycle Clément''.]]

With [[Franc-Nohain]] and [[Claude Terrasse]] he co-founded the [[Théatre des Pantins]], which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of ''Ubu Roi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.schubertiademusic.com/details/multiple_catalogs:yes/desc:Bonnard,+Pierre.+(1867+-+1947)%3B+Terrasse,+Claude.+(1867+-+1923)%3B+Jarry,+Alfred.+(1873+-+1907) PADA, Schubertiade Music Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in worsening poverty, neglecting his health and drinking excessively, Jarry went on to write the novel ''Le Surmâle'' (''[[Supermale (novel)|The Supermale]]''), which is partly a satire on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] ideal of self-transcendence.

Unpublished until after his death, his fiction ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician]]'' (''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'') describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who, born at age 63, travels through a hallucinatory Paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of ''[['pataphysics]]''. 'Pataphysics deals with "the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one."  In 'pataphysics, every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event.

Jarry once wrote, expressing some of the bizarre logic of 'pataphysics, "If you let a coin fall and it falls, the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way; hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion."

In his final years, he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris. [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Salmon]] and [[Max Jacob]] sought him out in his truncated apartment. [[Pablo Picasso]] was fascinated with Jarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/08/pablo-picasso-trivia_n_7018574.html|title=5 Things You Didn't Know About Pablo Picasso|date=2015-04-08|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jarry's death Picasso acquired his revolver and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in Paris. He later bought many of his manuscripts as well as executing a fine drawing of him.

Jarry died in Paris on 1 November 1907 of [[tuberculosis]], aggravated by drug and alcohol use. When he could not afford alcohol, he drank ether.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/05/10/alfred-jarry-king-charisma/&lt;/ref&gt; It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick. He was interred in the [[Cimetière parisien de Bagneux|Cimetière de Bagneux]], near Paris.

The complete works of Alfred Jarry are published in three volumes by [[Gallimard]] in the collection ''[[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]''.

The '''All-Channel Receiver Act''' of 1962 ('''ACRA''') ({{USCSub|47|303|s}}), commonly known as the '''All-Channels Act''', was passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 1961, to allow the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to require that all [[television set]] [[manufacturer]]s must include [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[tuner (television)|tuner]]s, so that new UHF-[[band (radio)|band]] [[TV station]]s (then [[television channel frequencies|channels]] 14 to 83) could be received by the [[general public|public]].  This was a problem at the time since the [[Big Three television networks]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]]) were well-established on [[VHF]], while many local-only stations on UHF were struggling for survival.

The All-Channel Receiver Act provides that the Federal Communications Commission shall "have authority to require that apparatus designed to receive television pictures broadcast simultaneously with sound be capable of adequately receiving all frequencies allocated by the Commission to television broadcasting."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Notices/1995/fcc95389.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Under authority provided by the All Channel Receiver Act, the FCC adopted a number of technical standards to increase parity between the UHF and VHF television services, including a 14dB maximum UHF [[noise figure]] for television receivers.

== History ==
While the first U.S. commercially licensed UHF television stations signed on as early as 1952, the majority of the 165 UHF stations to begin telecasting between 1952 and 1959 did not survive. UHF local stations of the 1950s were limited by the range their signals could supposedly travel, the lack of UHF tuners in most TV sets and difficulties in finding advertisers and TV network affiliations. Of the 82 new UHF TV stations in the United States broadcasting as of June 1954, only 24 remained on the air a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tulsatvmemories.com/tvthesi3.html|title=Tulsa TV history thesis, Chapter 3 (KCEB)|work=tulsatvmemories.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-network operators such as the [[DuMont Television Network]], forced to expand using UHF affiliates due to a lack of available VHF channels, were not viable and soon folded. The fraction of new TV receivers that were factory-equipped with all-channel tuners dropped from 20% in 1953 to 9.0% by 1958, a drop that was only partially compensated for by field upgrades or the availability of [[set-top box|UHF converters]] for separate purchase. By 1961, with 83 commercial UHF stations still on-air, the number of new TVs capable of receiving UHF as well as VHF channels had fallen to a record low of 5.5%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OSEC/library/legislative_histories/612.pdf The FCC and the All-Channel Receiver Bill of 1962], LAWRENCE D. LONGLEY, JOURNAL OF BROADCASTING. Vol. XLII. NO. 3 (Summer 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; with a small number of viable stations situated in localities where a [[UHF television broadcasting#UHF islands|lack of available VHF frequencies]] had forced early expansion onto UHF.

While public [[educational television]] was available from 105 US stations by 1965,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.current.org/pbpb/legislation/ETVProgressRept1965.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305232419/http://www.current.org/pbpb/legislation/ETVProgressRept1965.html |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them in the already-crowded VHF spectrum, only 18 percent of the large number of UHF frequencies reserved for educational use in US cities were in active use. In areas where audiences had no UHF receivers, a station broadcasting above channel 13 was unlikely to survive.

Under the All-Channel Receiver Act, FCC regulations would ensure that all new TV sets sold in the U.S. after 1964 had built-in UHF tuners. By 1971, there would be more than 170 full-service UHF broadcast stations nationwide;&lt;ref&gt;Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting; pp 387-388; Christopher H. Sterling, John M. Kittross; Erlbaum 2002; {{ISBN|978-0-8058-2624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of UHF stations would grow further to accommodate new television networks such as the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (1970), [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (1986), [[Univision]] (1986) and [[Telemundo]] (1987).

UHF TV stations would ultimately outnumber their long-established VHF counterparts.

==Digital television==
The act has most recently been used in 2005-2007 ({{USCFR|47|15|115|c}} and {{USCFR|47|15|117|b}}) to require TV manufacturers to include [[List of ATSC standards|ATSC]]-T ([[terrestrial TV]]) tuners for [[digital television]], in any [[TV]] set that includes an [[NTSC]] [[analog TV]] [[tuner (radio)|tuner]].  This requirement has been phased-in during the mid-2000s, starting with the largest TV sets. By early 2007, every device capable of receiving [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] TV (including [[VCR]]s) was forced to include an [[ATSC tuner]]. Millions of dollars in fines were imposed in 2008 by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] against vendors, including various name-brand retail chains such as [[Best Buy]], [[Sears]]/[[Kmart]] and [[Wal-Mart|Walmart]]. Best Buy is disputing both the fines and the authority of the FCC to impose the penalties;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080519-best-buy-fcc-has-no-power-to-fine-us-over-analog-tvs.html|title=Best Buy: FCC has no power to fine us over analog TVs|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Circuit City Stores|Circuit City]] and Sears also disputed the charges.

In late March 2008, the [[Community Broadcasters Association]] filed a [[lawsuit]] in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]], seeking an [[injunction]] to halt the sale and distribution of DTV [[set-top box|converter box]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtvnow.org/links.php?linkno=273|title=Community Broadcasters Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=dtvnow.org|access-date=2008-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101101058/http://www.dtvnow.org/links.php?linkno=273|archive-date=2009-01-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; charging that their failure to include analog tuners or [[analog passthrough]] violates the All-Channel Receiver Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/community_broadcasters_association_petitions_0328 Community Broadcasters Association petitions court to order DTV converter halt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204165323/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/community_broadcasters_association_petitions_0328 |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responding to CBA's actions, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]] urged manufacturers to include the feature voluntarily in all converter boxes, and manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature.  In early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/pages/s.0157/t.13436.html |title=Broadcast – Production – NAB - Broadband – Satellite – Mobile – www.tvtechnology.com |work=tvtechnology.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724082750/http://tvtechnology.com/pages/s.0157/t.13436.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively telling the association that it had not exhausted all its efforts, and that there was not enough merit to take the case to the courts.

In July 2010, the FCC granted a [[waiver]] allowing [[Dell]], [[LG]], and [[Hauppauge Computer Works|Hauppauge]] to fail to include tuners for NTSC analog TV or standard ATSC digital TV in [[mobile television]] [[TV set|device]]s designed to receive [[ATSC-M/H]] signals. While all full-power stations have been forced to turn off their analog signals, and most [[low-power TV]] stations therefore have been forced to digital as the ''[[de facto]]'' standard, the vast majority of stations do not transmit a mobile-TV signal, which will leave viewers with these devices unable to receive most broadcasts.  Because LPTV stations have already had their limited financial resources drained by having to buy and install new digital equipment, it is unlikely that any LPTV stations will be seen on mobile TV because of this waiver, which also applies to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/media-bureau-grants-waiver-ntsc-a_53-receiver-requirement-mobile-dtv-devices-0804/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcast radio ==
In the 1980s, this law was used to require that all [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] be able to pick up the new [[Extended AM broadcast band|expanded band]] stations from 1610 to 1700 [[kilohertz]].  This requirement was enacted in advance of new stations being allotted in the 1990s.

It has been proposed in 2009 to require [[HD Radio]] receivers to be included in all [[satellite radio]] ([[SDARS]]) receivers, in response to the [[monopoly]] created by the [[XM/Sirius merger]].  All three use [[Property|proprietary]] systems, and there have been no considerations to require the inclusion of [[open standard]]s like [[FMeXtra]], [[DRM+]], [[DAB+]] or [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]], which are compatible anywhere outside of the United States.  A [[notice of inquiry]] (a predecessor to a full [[rulemaking]] proceeding) is before the FCC as [[docket (court)|docket]] 08-172.  A [[bill (law)|bill]] had been submitted to the [[U.S. House]] as the '''Radio All Digital Channel Receiver Act'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiomagonline.com/digital_radio/hd_radio/fcc-may-mandate-reception/|title=FCC may mandate HD Radio reception by satellite receivers|work=radiomagonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/rep-markey-launches-bill-for-hd-radio-mandate-in-all-satellite-radios.html|title=Rep.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Antiptosis''', which translates from the Greek ανταλλαγή (exchange of) and περίπτωση (case), is a [[rhetoric|rhetorical device]].  Specifically, it is a type of [[enallage]] (the substitution of grammatically different but semantically equivalent constructions) in which one [[case (grammar)|grammatical case]] is substituted for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Gideon |title=Antiptosis |url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/A/antiptosis.htm |work=Silvia Rhetoricea |accessdate=21 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023123955/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/A/antiptosis.htm |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]], this technique is utilized only with pronouns, and is more effective with languages that utilize [[inflection|inflected]] nouns, such as [[Greek (language)|Greek]] and [[Latin (language)|Latin]] (or any other derivative romance language).

== Forms of Antiptosis ==

One form of the device is to replace the [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] ''and'' with the [[preposition]] ''of'', thus changing the case of the second noun from a case agreeing with the first noun to the [[genitive case]].

This is similar to the technique [[hendiadys]], by applying “of” rather than “and” as well as the technique [[hypallage]], except the governing noun becomes the adjective instead of the noun in regimen.

== Usage ==
The classic example of the use of antiptosis is:
: ''the kingdom of glory''
instead of
: ''the kingdom and the glory''
Where the relation of kingdom and glory are altered by antiptosis.

In another example, one might say "That dress is you!" rather than "That dress is becoming to you," placing ''you'' in the [[nominative case]] rather than the expected [[objective case]] to emphasize the point being made.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prime example is "Me Jane, Tarzan," where "me" is used (the objective case pronoun) instead of the proper subjective case pronoun, "I". This example also includes ellipsis of the verb "am.”

'''''Around the Boree Log''''' is a 1925 Australian [[silent film]] adapted from the poems of "John O'Brien" ([[Patrick Joseph Hartigan]]). It tells stories of a priest's life around the 1870s in the [[Goulburn]] area.&lt;ref name="pike"&gt;Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21005532 |title=THE MAJESTIC. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=8 February 1926 |accessdate=22 February 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many Australian silent films, a copy of it survives today.

==Plot==
A priest reads from the book of poems by John O'Brien and recalls his earlier life in the country. He remembers travelling hawkers, his first school, a bishop inspection, childhood romance, and the marriage of a girl to another man.

==Cast==
*Molly O'Donohue as Laughing Mary

==Production==
The movie was shot on location in the New South Wales bush, mostly at the Wollondilly River area near Goulburn, in early 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21005532 |title=THE MAJESTIC. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=8 February 1926 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director had previously worked as an assistant on ''[[While the Billy Boils]]'' (1921) and would direct ''[[The Birth of White Australia]]'' (1928).&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt; He also tried to make a film of the novel ''Love Blind'' but was unable to raise finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85951866 |title=DISTINGUISHED FILM PRODUCER. |newspaper=[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]] |location=NSW |date=23 April 1926 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the cast were anonymous people who lived in the area.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16245022 |title=NEW FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 September 1925 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film met with resistance from distributors who felt it was Roman Catholic propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21841739 |title=FILM INQUIRY. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=9 June 1927 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also criticised for having little plot and consisting mostly of a travelogue of scenery and incidents in the country.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

However it did screen throughout Australia.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt;

'''''Atonement''''' is a 2007 [[Romance film|romantic]] [[war film|war]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Joe Wright]] and based on [[Ian McEwan]]'s [[Atonement (novel)|2001 novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[James McAvoy]], [[Keira Knightley]], [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[Romola Garai]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], and chronicles a crime and its consequences over the course of six decades, beginning in the 1930s. It was produced by [[Working Title Films]] and filmed in England. Distributed in most of the world by [[Universal Studios]], it was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 7 September 2007 and in North America on 7 December 2007.

''Atonement'' opened both the 2007 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] and the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]], making Wright, at the age of 35, the youngest director ever to open the latter event. A commercial success, the film earned a worldwide gross of approximately $129 million against a budget of $30 million. Critics gave the drama positive reviews, praising its acting performances, its [[cinematography]] and [[Dario Marianelli]]'s score.

''Atonement'' won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[80th Academy Awards]], and was nominated for six others, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Ronan.&lt;ref name="NomineesOscars2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oscar.com/nominees/?pn=film&amp;film=Atonement%20Film |work=Oscar.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |title=Academy Award nominations for 'Atonement' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129085058/http://www.oscar.com/nominees/?pn=film&amp;film=Atonement+Film |archivedate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also garnered fourteen nominations at the [[61st British Academy Film Awards]], winning both [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Production Design]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama]].&lt;ref name="WinnersBAFTA2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bafta.org/press/winners-announced,17,SNS.html |work=BAFTA.org |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |title=BAFTA Awards for 'Atonement' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211194947/http://www.bafta.org/press/winners-announced%2C17%2CSNS.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins.

Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water.

Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including the word "[[cunt]]": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter.

Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a "sex maniac". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a [[chocolate]] magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola.

Before dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then to proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack. Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off.

At dinner, Briony finds that Lola's twin brothers have run away, and Paul calls for a search of the estate grounds. In the course of it, Briony glimpses Lola having sex with a man. She goes to Lola, and they make statements to one another that appear to establish that it was rape perpetrated by Robbie. The belief is sustained during police questioning, and the earlier note is seen as corroborative evidence. Robbie's arrest and imprisonment follow.

About four years later, during [[World War II]], Robbie has been released from prison on condition that he join the [[British Army|army]], and is fighting in the [[Battle of France]]. Separated from his unit, he is making his way on foot to [[Dunkirk]], all the while thinking of his meeting with Cecilia in London six months earlier: they had renewed their love before she returned to her work as a nurse, and he set off to the French front.

Briony, now 18, has chosen to join Cecilia's old nursing unit at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London rather than go to the [[University of Cambridge]], because she wants to be of "practical use to society". She writes to her sister, but Cecilia has not forgiven her for lying in the investigation years before.

Robbie, who is falling gravely ill from an infected wound, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he waits to be [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated]].

Later, Briony—who now regrets her lie—learns from a newsreel that Paul Marshall, who owns a factory supplying rations to the British army, is about to be married to Lola. Briony goes to the ceremony, and as the priest asks if anyone objects to the union, she recalls seeing Paul assault Lola. However, she remains silent. As Paul and Lola leave the church, they glance at Briony, but also say nothing.

Afterwards, Briony visits Cecilia to apologise to her directly. She is surprised to find her sister with Robbie, who is in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has still not accepted responsibility for her actions, when soldiers younger than she have died in the war. Cecilia calms him down, and the couple ask Briony to confess and to have the legal record rectified. Briony agrees. However, she also has to tell them that Paul has married Lola. He is now most unlikely to be punished, as Lola will be [[Spousal privilege#England and Wales|unable to testify against her husband]], and Briony will be regarded as an unreliable witness.

Briony is now elderly and a successful novelist, giving an interview about her latest book that will cap her career; she is now dying of [[vascular dementia]]. She says that this autobiographical novel, entitled ''Atonement'', has been very difficult to write, because she did not know how to approach what she had done to Robbie and Cecilia. She has worked on it from the very beginning of her career. She confesses that the scene in the book describing her visit and apology to Cecilia and Robbie was entirely imaginary.

Cecilia and Robbie were never reunited: Robbie died of [[sepsis|septicaemia]] at Dunkirk on the morning of the day he was to be evacuated, and Cecilia drowned months later in the [[Balham station#Second World War|Balham tube station bombing]] during [[the Blitz]]. Briony hopes to give the two, in fiction, the happiness that she robbed them of in real life. The last scene shows an imagined, happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie living on in a house by the sea.

==Cast==
* [[James McAvoy]] as Robbie Turner, the son of the Tallis family housekeeper with a [[Cambridge]] education courtesy of his mother's employer. McAvoy, who had refused previous offers to work with Wright, was the director's first choice; producers met several actors for the role, including [[Jake Gyllenhaal]],&lt;ref name="DailyMail2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Look who's kissing Keira |work=DailyMail.co.uk |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-381600/Look-whos-kissing-Keira.html |accessdate=9 January 2008 |location=London |date=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but McAvoy was the only one offered the part. He fitted Wright's bid for someone who "had the acting ability to take the audience with him on his personal and physical journey". McAvoy describes Robbie as one of the most difficult characters he has ever played, "because he's very straight-ahead".&lt;ref name="WildAbout" /&gt;
* [[Keira Knightley]] as Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the two Tallis sisters.&lt;ref name="WildAbout" /&gt; Originally intended to play 18-year-old Briony, Knightley was the first reported to have landed one of the starring roles in ''Atonement'', having previously worked with Wright on the cinema adaptation of Jane Austen's ''[[Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride &amp; Prejudice]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name="Starpulse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Keira Knightley &amp; Director Clashed Over 'Atonement' Character |work=Starpulse.com |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/25/keira_knightley_aamp_director_clashed_ov |accessdate=4 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112074945/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/25/keira_knightley_aamp_director_clashed_ov |archivedate=12 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the director and Knightley unable to agree over which character the actress should play, Wright finally decided on Cecilia "because she has none of that [[Elizabeth Bennet]] vibe."&lt;ref name="Starpulse" /&gt; In preparing for her role, Knightley watched films from the 1930s and 1940s, such as ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and ''[[In Which We Serve]]'', to study the "naturalism" of the performance that Wright wanted in ''Atonement''.&lt;ref name="WildAbout" /&gt;
* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Briony Tallis, age 13: the younger Tallis sister and an aspiring novelist. 12-year-old newcomer Ronan was not cast until casting director Jina Jay came across her following many unsuccessful auditions around Britain. McEwan called her performance "remarkable": "She gives us thought processes right on-screen, even before she speaks, and conveys so much with her eyes."&lt;ref name="WildAbout" /&gt; Ronan received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance.
* [[Romola Garai]] as Briony Tallis, age 18:&lt;ref name="WildAbout"/&gt; Following [[Abbie Cornish]]'s refusal, backing out due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'' (2007),&lt;ref name="WorkingTitle"&gt;{{cite web |title='Atonement' Gears Up for Start of Filming |work=WorkingTitleFilms.com |url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/newsArticle.php?newsID=126 |accessdate=9 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211033306/http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/newsArticle.php?newsID=126 |archivedate=11 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was obliged to adapt her performance's physicality to fit the appearance that had already been decided upon for Ronan and Redgrave.

* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Briony Tallis, age 77: Everyone's ideal to play the oldest Briony,&lt;ref name="WildAbout" /&gt; Redgrave was the first approached (although she was not cast until Ronan had been found),&lt;ref name="Close-UpFilm"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Modern Version of that Stiff Upper Lip |work=Close-UpFilm.com |url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/Interviews/atonement_interview.html |accessdate=5 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226054326/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/Interviews/atonement_interview.html |archivedate=26 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and committed herself to the role after just one meeting with Wright. She, Ronan and Garai worked together with a voice coach to keep the character's timbre in a familiar range throughout the film.&lt;ref name="WildAbout" /&gt;
* [[Harriet Walter]] as Emily Tallis, the matriarch of the family.

* Charlie and Felix von Simson as Jackson and Pierrot Quincey, Lola's nine-year-old twin brothers.
* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Paul Marshall, Leon Tallis' visiting friend.
* [[Daniel Mays]] as Tommy Nettle, one of Robbie's brothers-in-arms.
* [[Nonso Anozie]] as Frank Mace, another fellow soldier.

==Historical inaccuracy==
The film shows an [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber flying overhead in 1935, an aircraft whose first flight was not until 1941. 
In the scene on the beach at Dunkirk, Robbie is told that the [[RMS Lancastria|''Lancastria'']] has been sunk, an event that actually happened on 17 June 1940 (two weeks after the end of the Dunkirk evacuations) and at [[Saint-Nazaire]], not Dunkirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemistakes.com/film6969/top10 |title=Atonement (2007) - Top 10 Mistakes |last1=Sandys |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.moviemistakes.com |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the interview scene at the end of the film, Briony Tallis (played by Vanessa Redgrave at this juncture) states that the flooding (leading to fatalities) of [[Balham station#Balham Underground station|Balham Underground station]] as a result of aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe whilst the station was being used as an air-raid shelter occurred on 15 October 1940; the bombing and the subsequent flooding of the station actually occurred the previous evening (14 October 1940).
During the scene in 1935 where Robbie writes and discards letters for Cecilia, he keeps playing a [[78-rpm record|record]] of the love duet from Act 1 of ''[[La bohème]]'' by [[Puccini]], with [[Victoria de los Ángeles]] and [[Jussi Björling]], which was only recorded in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. La Boheme. In: ''Opera on Record'', ed [[Alan Blyth|Blyth, Alan]]. Hutchinson &amp; Co, 1979, p589.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=October 2016}}
The film opens as Ben, Gwen, and Kevin are negotiating with a group of [[black market]] dealers at a mill, who are attempting to sell them alien [[nanotechnology|nanochips]], which are causing interference with the Omnitrix. One of them reveals herself to be Elena, a childhood friend of Ben and Gwen and a fellow Plumber's kid. Elena explains that she had set up negotiations to lure Ben out into the open, and explains that her father has been [[Alien abduction|abducted]] and that she needs their help to find him.

Just as Ben agrees to help her, the insect like chips suddenly spring to life and attack, while the group sees that they are being controlled by a man on a catwalk. Kevin sees it as a [[Double cross (betrayal)|double cross]], though Elena insists that she is not responsible. While the dealers escape, Ben gets far enough from the chips to allow him to transform into Big Chill and fight off the swarm of flying chips along with Gwen and Kevin until the man in the rafters escapes. Elena escapes in the confusion, further justifying Kevin's suspicions. Though Gwen quickly sides with Kevin, Ben is not as easily convinced.

Arriving at their [[headquarters]] underneath the Bellwood auto repair shop, the trio, along with [[List of Ben 10 characters#Grandpa Max Tennyson|Grandpa Max]], study one of the chips salvaged after fighting the swarm, learning that they are Techno-organic material/a hybrid of organic and technological components. Elena, having followed the trio, breaks in and Max orders her to leave, explaining that Elena's father, Victor Validus, was an [[apprentice]] of his who was [[Military discharge|dishonorably discharged]] after stealing the original chips. Ben refuses to believe that Elena is like her father, and breaks ranks with his grandfather and teammates to help her.

While Max is away, Gwen and Kevin [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into the computer files relating to Victor Validus and discover a video of Max interrogating Victor, in which Victor insists that "the Hive", the [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] intelligence behind the chips, is coming to take over the planet, the chips being revealed to be able to enter and possess people. It is revealed that Victor stole the chips to further research them because he realized that they were a threat, as well as that they were dormant instead of dead, as the Plumbers believed. Realizing that Max's anger towards Victor's betrayal may be clouding his judgement, Gwen and Kevin decide to aid Ben as well.

Meanwhile, Ben and Elena arrive at Victor's old [[laboratory]]. It has been cleared out by the Hive, but they left Ship-It order slips behind. Other discarded files indicate that Victor was studying and upgrading the chips. Elena reveals that her father became erratic and he stopped returning home. He also appears to be the man from the rafters controlling the chips. A mob under the control of the chips ambush Ben and Elena, forcing them to retreat. The Omnitrix again experiences interference around the chips and keeps Ben from transforming around them, but Ben utilizes a scanning function on it to temporarily repel the mob and allow him and Elena to escape. They head to the Ship-It building to investigate further, though Ben is now somewhat suspicious of Elena himself, realizing the mob expected him and Elena to go to the lab and set a trap for them. Ben finds an order slip made out for that day, when Elena claimed that Victor had already been missing for weeks.

Gwen and Kevin, having reached the building first, are too late to stop the distribution of the chips. Instead, they are met by one of the Ship-It employees, who is also under the chips' control. He summons another larger chip swarm, now capable of forming solid, weaponizable shapes, to attack Gwen and Kevin, which eventually wreck Kevin's car (a modified [[Dodge Challenger]]) during a lengthy chase. Ben, overhearing the commotion and following them, uses Humongousaur (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) to defeat the swarm, completely demolishing Kevin's car in the process.

By the time they return to headquarters, the chips have spread across the globe, and number in the millions. Gwen realizes the swarm's new ability is a sign that they can adapt to threats and become smarter. The group also deduces the chips have a queen (voiced by [[Wendy Cutler]]), as the chip's hosts have mentioned her. They believed that they can stop the chips by destroying her, but during their search for the Queen, one of the active chips they were studying possesses Max and leaves with him. Pulling together, the group notice that while world population centers are all infected, the relatively remote Barren Rock, Missouri, has the highest concentration, an apparent anomaly in their distribution. The town is home to the central headquarters of Ship-It. With Kevin's car out of commission, Kevin reveals that he has built a black and green car for Ben (a heavily modified [[Mazda RX-8]]), called DX Mark 10 (confirmed by Bandai and Dwayne McDuffie) as a "late [[birthday]] present."

Infiltrating the factory, populated by multiple infected, including Max, the group discovers that the Queen infected Elena's father, and his body is being used as a hive to rapidly [[Mass production|mass-produce]] the chips. Possessed by the Queen, Victor is also the man from the mill controlling the chips. Elena admits that she knew her father was infected, but didn't tell them because she feared they would believe she betrayed them, just as the Plumbers did to  Victor. Gwen and Kevin reluctantly suggest killing Victor to stop the Hive, but Elena and Ben refuse to consider it. Fearing being possessed by the chips while in his alien forms, Ben uses the Omnitrix to transform into a new alien that he calls "Nanomech" (voiced by the film's director [[Alex Winter]]), which was created by scanning the DNA of the chips, with Ben realizing that this was the cause of the apparent interference in the Omnitrix. He flies into Victor's head and battles the Queen, who briefly tries to assert her hive mind on him while he resists, while Gwen, Kevin, and Elena fight the infected. As the dormant chips in the factory begin to activate, Nanomech uses the chips ability to adapt to overwhelm and destroy the Queen, and all of the other chips, freeing everybody from their control.

In the aftermath, Max, after personally apologizing to Victor, decides to retire and leave his position as leader to Ben, but Ben refuses to allow him to do so. The film ends as Ben, Gwen, Kevin, and Elena drive home.

==Production==

===Development===
Major hurdles for film's initial production stage included the [[2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] as well as the threat of strikes by other guilds. Prior to a potential [[Directors Guild of America]] strike, Winter began creating [[Storyboard|animatics]] of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film. This would allow animators to complete sequences if the [[Directors Guild of America]] went on strike in January 2008, which ultimately did not happen. Winter considered making a small project in between ''Ben 10'' and its sequel, but decided against the idea, saying "you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it".

===Filming===
Inspired by its use in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'', three action sequences in ''Ben 10: Alien Swarm'' were shot using [[IMAX]] cameras. Although screenwriters [[John Turman]] and James Krieg suggested that the IMAX footage would be [[3D film|3D]], Winter late said he found 3D too gimmicky. Winter added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using [[stereoscopic]] cameras.

===Effects===
[[Cartoon Network]] became more involved in the designs of the aliens than the company was for ''Ben 10''. The company along with [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], suggested to the filmmakers that combining aliens be the main draw for the sequel.

===Music===
The score to ''Ben 10: Alien Swarm'' was composed by Michael Wandmacher, who reunited with director Alex Winter to record his score with a 71-piece ensemble of the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Sony Scoring Stage. The song "[[A Little Faster]]" by [[There For Tomorrow]] appears in the film.

==Future==
In December 2009, Warner Bros. Pictures and Cartoon Network are reportedly interested in fast-tracking a third ''Ben 10'' film due to the second film's success. However, such plans have yet to be seen.

==History==
Although the award was created by ''The Bookseller'', the idea of an award celebrating books with odd titles was proposed by Bruce Robinson and Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978.&lt;ref name="When success"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bent|first=Horace|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/when-success-not-enough-882056|title=When success is not enough|publisher=The Bookseller|date=26 October 2018|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for ''The Bookseller'', took over administrative duties.&lt;ref name="Bluffer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P 6-7"/&gt; Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given due to a lack of odd titles, ''The Bookseller'' opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on [[Twitter]] were accepted.&lt;ref name="Bluffer's"/&gt; This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880.&lt;ref name="2010 Longlist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Neilan|first=Catherine|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/111542-record-number-of-submissions-for-the-2009-odd-title-prize.html|title=Record number of submissions for the 2009 odd title prize|publisher=''The Bookseller''|date=3 February 2010|accessdate=3 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205173129/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/111542-record-number-of-submissions-for-the-2009-odd-title-prize.html|archivedate=5 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bent Longlist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bent|first=Horace|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412092943/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/111542-record-number-of-submissions-for-the-2009-odd-title-prize.html|archivedate=12 April 2010|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/111161-the-2009-diagram-prize-a-prequel.html|title=The 2009 Diagram Prize: A Prequel|publisher=''The Bookseller''|date=2 February 2010|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 prize allowed nominations from [[Self-publishing|self-published]] works, the first book being ''Strangers Have the Best Candy'' by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.&lt;ref name="Strangers Have the Best Candy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/strangers-have-best-candy-wins-diagram-prize|title=Strangers Have the Best Candy wins Diagram Prize|publisher=''The Bookseller''|date=27 March 2015|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014 nominations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebookseller.com/news/nether-regions-and-pavements-hot-diagram-prize-shortlist|title=Nether regions and pavements hot on Diagram Prize shortlist|publisher=The Bookseller|date=26 February 2015|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diagram Prize receives considerable press coverage every year.&lt;ref name="P 10"&gt;Rickett, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, more people voted for the Diagram Prize (8,500 votes) than [[Man Booker Prize|The Best of Booker Prize]] (7,800).&lt;ref name="More odd than odd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/64672-more-odd-than-odd.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202224713/http://thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/64672-more-odd-than-odd.html|archivedate=2 December 2010|title=More odd than odd|publisher=''The Bookseller''|date=7 August 2008|accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/press-releases/midnight%E2%80%99s-children-wins-best-booker|title=Salman Rushdie tops public poll 15 years after winning the Booker of Bookers|publisher=The Man Booker Prize|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=15 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322014305/http://www.themanbookerprize.com/press-releases/midnight%E2%80%99s-children-wins-best-booker|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is either a magnum of champagne or a bottle of [[Bordeaux wine|claret]] for the person who nominates the winning title,&lt;ref name="P 10"/&gt; and increased publicity for both the book and its author.&lt;ref name="Bookseller"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112081856/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/53656-oddest-book-titles-prize-shortlist-announced.html|archivedate=12 November 2010|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/53656-oddest-book-titles-prize-shortlist-announced.html|title=Oddest book titles prize shortlist announced|publisher=''The Bookseller''|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=24 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the nominator was Brian Payne, who works as the deputy chief sub-editor of ''The Bookseller''. Due to his position he decided to reject the bottle of claret that he won saying it, "would remain in the cellar."&lt;ref name="How to Poo on a Date"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bent|first=Horace|url=http://www.welovethisbook.com/news/how-poo-date-wins-diagram-prize|title=How to Poo on a Date wins Diagram Prize|publisher=[[We Love This Book]]|date=21 March 2014|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, all the nominations came from staff at ''The Bookseller'', so the claret will be awarded to a random voter who votes for the eventual winner.&lt;ref name="When success"/&gt;

===Format===
Nominees were originally limited to just books at the Frankfurt Book Fair, but this was extended to submissions sent in by ''The Bookseller'' magazine's traditional readership of librarians, publishers, and booksellers in order to decrease the risk of no award being given. In 2009, submissions could be sent to either Bent's or ''The Bookseller's'' Twitter accounts.&lt;ref name="Bluffer's"/&gt; People cannot nominate their own works, nor can they select books they publish themselves. Titles that are deliberately created to be funny are normally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Rickett, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, nominators, judges and voters are actively discouraged from reading any of the nominations, "for fear that becoming too close to the work may cloud their judgement in declaring the text's title 'odd'. Especially considering the prize champions 'odd '''titles'''' and ''not'' 'odd '''books'''' (see the Man Booker for the latter)".&lt;ref name="Bluffer's"/&gt; The winner was originally voted for by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been voted for by members of the public via the Internet. Bent resisted this move and threatened to resign, but he later reconsidered and now creates the [[short list]] of finalists.&lt;ref name="Page 9"/&gt; Also, the title of the book must be in English, although the langauge in the book can be any language.&lt;ref name="When success"/&gt;

===Books about the prize===
In September 2008, a book about the Diagram Prize was published by [[Aurum Press]] entitled ''How to Avoid Huge Ships and Other Implausibly Titled Books''. With an introduction written by Joel Rickett, the book was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the prize. It featured a collection of book covers from winners and runners-up from previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007094600/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/55684-oddest-title-is-crowned.html|archivedate=7 October 2010|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/55684-oddest-title-is-crowned.html|title=Oddest title is crowned|publisher=''The Bookseller''|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up book was released in October 2009, entitled ''Baboon Metaphysics And More Implausibly Titled Books'', including an introduction by Bent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aurum Press Catalogue: Autumn 2009|publisher=[[Aurum Press]]|location=London|year=2009|page=19|url=http://www.aurumpress.co.uk/pdf/Aurum%20autumn%2009%20lo.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724055430/http://www.aurumpress.co.uk/pdf/Aurum%20autumn%2009%20lo.pdf|archivedate=24 July 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
So far, there have been two occasions in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize.&lt;ref name="Page 9"/&gt; The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, ''The Bookseller'' castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, "There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, ''Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories''".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for ruder titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner ''If You Want Closure in Your Relationship, Start with Your Legs''.&lt;ref name="Legs"/&gt;

In 2009, the choice of ''The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais'' as winner of the 2008 award was controversial, as Parker did not write the book himself, but used an automated authoring machine which produces thousands of titles on the basis of Internet and database searches.&lt;ref name="Fromage Frais"/&gt; Philip Stone, charts editor and awards administrator at ''The Bookseller'', commented by saying: "I think it's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer, but given the number of celebrity memoirs out there that are [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]], I don't think it's too strange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/27/oddest-book-title-prize-fromage-frais|title=Oddest Book Title prize goes to treatise on fromage frais|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, one of the nominations, ''Joy of Waterboiling'', was controversial because the book was written mostly in German, but the rules of the prize state that only the title needs to be in English in order to qualify for nomination.&lt;ref name="When success"/&gt;

===Diagram of Diagrams===
Two special anniversary awards known as the "Diagram of Diagrams" (the name reflects the "[[Booker of Bookers]]")&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; have been presented to honour both the 15th and the 30th anniversaries of the Diagram Prize. The nominations of the prizes were all of the previous winners up to that point in time. In 1993, the winner of the 15th anniversary award was ''Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice'', the winner of the first Diagram Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/04/diagram.prize.oddest.book.title?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=books|title=Greek Postmen win oddest book title prize|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=5 September 2008|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greek"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The second "Diagram of Diagrams", announced on 5 September 2008, was ''[[Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers]]'', the 1996 winner.&lt;ref name="Greek"/&gt;

'''''Call of Duty 3''''' is a 2006 [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by [[Treyarch]] and published by [[Activision]]. It is the third major installment in the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series. It was released for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. It was a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia.

==Gameplay==

===Campaign===
The single player is modeled after the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy breakout]], where the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canadians|Canadian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[United States|American]], and [[French Resistance]] forces pushed into the village of [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]], France, also known as the [[Falaise Gap]]. Unlike most other games in the ''Call of Duty'' series, the events in ''Call of Duty 3'' are based on a single combined campaign, with the player being switched between the four armed forces – [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], British [[Special Air Service|SAS]], [[Canadian Army]], and the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Armoured Division]] – and their respective characters for each leg of the story. There are 14 campaign missions in total, with cinematics to link between each one. Each mission also contains various action sequences where players have to input button commands, whether arming a bomb, or fighting off a melee ambush. In addition, some missions also include multiple choices in routes to completing an objective.

===Multiplayer===
In addition to the single-player campaign, ''Call of Duty 3'' features a wide range of multiplayer modes for players to participate in – each team allowing up to 24 on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, and 16 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in a single match. This is only in the online mode. All team game modes feature the soldiers of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] versus those of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]. Multiplayer features are absent from the Wii edition.

It is the first game in the ''Call of Duty'' series to introduce two different game modes. The "Normalized" mode was added to allow console players a way to adjust to the smaller kill box of ''[[Call of Duty]]'', its expansion ''United Offensive'', and ''[[Call of Duty 2]]''.

On the Xbox 360, ''Call of Duty 3'' divides its multiplayer aspect into Player and Ranked matches. Player matches allow players to invite other players into their games, but do not contribute points toward the leader board or unlock [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|Achievements]]. Ranked matches put the player with and against teams of random players, and contribute towards player points and allow players to unlock Achievements.

==Plot==
===American campaign===
The American campaign begins with [[Private (rank)|Private]] Nichols banded with [[Corporal]] Mike Dixon, Private Leroy Huxley (voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]), the radio op [[Private First Class]] Salvatore Guzzo and the squad's CO, [[Sergeant]] Frank McCullin in the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Infantry Division]]. After the capture of [[Saint-Lô]], the squad is folded with the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] to secure [[Saint-Germain-sur-Sèves]]. The 90th then assaults [[Mayenne]] in order to capture its fortified bridge. McCullin succeeds in defusing the bombs rigged on the bridge at the cost of his life. Dixon assumes command of the squad and leads them to clear out [[Forêt d'Écouves]], to aid the 2nd battalion. The squad then liberates the suburbs to secure a vital crossroads, which helps ensure the success of the Falaise Gap plan, now that the other Allied forces have finished in the north.

Nichols unit is then defending the town of [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]] from German forces trying to escape through the [[Falaise Gap]]. After much retreating and fighting, Dixon is killed and Guzzo leads the squad, aiding the [[Baker Company]] to retake the town and force the German resistance to surrender. Two days later, the squad members receive promotions and begin their march to [[Liberation of Paris|liberate Paris]].

===British/French campaign===
In the British and French campaign, the player controls Sergeant James Doyle working alongside SAS members, Corporal Keith, and Major Ingram. The SAS have a rough parachute drop into France, where they link up with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis Resistance]], including their leader Pierre LaRoche, Isabelle DuFontaine, and a man only known as Marcel. They begin attacking a German AA position, followed by the destruction of a fuel plant. Ingram is captured, but the SAS and Maquis are able to rescue him from the outskirts of a village, along with several Resistance fighters bound for execution. Isabelle is killed as she plants a satchel charge on an armored car. The SAS and Maquis then team up to take the fight into the rest of Europe.

===Canadian campaign===
In the Canadian campaign the player controls Private Cole of the [[4th Canadian Division|4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]], led by [[World War I]] veteran [[Lieutenant]] Jean-Guy Robichaud. Robichaud commands a platoon in the [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], aided by Sergeant Jonathan Callard, squad member Pvt, Peterson, and the squad's radio operator, Pvt. Leslie Baron. The platoon attacks a German-held ridge in a night-time operation, then capture an industrial area and holding off a counter-attack. The platoon proceeds to clears a forest near the Laison River of several anti-tank positions and a motor pool. Baron is transferred to a Polish armored unit. Robichaud leads his unit to rescue a captured Canadian tank crew and with their help they capture the whole town. Callard is killed as he blows himself up along with a [[Tiger II|King Tiger]] tank. The unit then soon start helping to move more Canadian reinforcements through the town to aid the Polish struggling to defend [[Hill 262]].

===Polish campaign===
The Polish campaign revolves around Cpl. "Bohater" Wojciech, a [[Sherman Firefly]] tank driver in the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Armored Division]] hunting more German tanks in revenge to the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation]] of the homeland of his crew members, including Major Jachowicz, Corporal Rudinski, Sergeant Kowalski and Pte. Ulan. While aiding the Canadian and British forces in the area, Jachowicz's crew participates in a sweep across the French countryside, engaging German armor. Bohater and the rest of his tank crew eventually track down and destroy an infamous [[Tiger II]] tank. The Poles then capture [[Hill 262]] and endure a heavy assault by the remnants of the German [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] desperate to escape the [[Falaise Pocket]]. With their position overrun, Bohater and his crew continue to fight the Germans with Rudinski and Kowalski getting killed and later. They are joined by Canadian radio operator Baron, who is killed in the ensuing battle. After much fighting, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] repels the German invaders and Hill 262 is firmly in Allied hands.

==Development==
''Call of Duty 3'' was unveiled by Activision shortly before E3 2006. It was revealed that Treyarch would be developing the title (their second in the series after ''[[Call of Duty 2: Big Red One]]'') which was set to release later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/06/pre-e3-2006-call-of-duty-3-official |title=Pre-E3 2006: Call of Duty 3 Official |last=Dunham |first=Jeremy |date=May 5, 2006 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=July 22, 2011 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would be running on Treyarch's own internal engine, NGL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/middleware-ngl |title=Middleware: NGL |work=[[Mobygames]] |access-date=July 22, 2011 |year=2006 |last=Valenzuela |first=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game served as a launch title for the PlayStation 3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. It was also the only major ''Call of Duty'' installment not to be released for [[personal computer]] platforms (though ports were planned yet cancelled) and the only numerical sequel to date to have been a console-exclusive game alongside ''Big Red One'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Finest Hour]]''. 

In an interview with Video Gamer, ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'' senior producer, Noah Heller, revealed the team had eight months to develop ''Call of Duty 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.videogamer.com/previews/call-of-duty-world-at-war-interview |title=Call of Duty: World at War Interview |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=June 23, 2008 |work=Video Gamer |access-date=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Seminar on '''Comprehensive Musicianship''' was held at [[Northwestern University]]. Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Airlie House (a conference center) in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] to discuss means of evaluating comprehensive musicianship. The resultant document, ''Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education'', offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies.

There are two curricula that are examples of the Comprehensive Musicianship methodology: The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program and the Hawaii Music Curriculum Program.

==Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program==
{{Main|MMCP – Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program (MMCP) was funded by a grant from the [[U.S. Dept. of Education]] and was named for [[Manhattanville College]] in [[Purchase, New York]]. Its objectives were to develop a music curriculum and related materials for a sequential music learning program for the primary grades through high school. The project produced the ''Synthesis'', a comprehensive curriculum for grades 3 through 12, ''Interaction'', an early childhood curriculum, and three feasibility studies: The Electronic Keyboard Laboratory, the Science-Music Program, and the Instrumental Program.

MMCP began in 1965 with an exploratory of 92 innovative and experimental music programs. Phase One (1966) dealt with perspectives of student learning potentials, problems of curriculum reform, and classroom procedures. Phase Two (1967) dealt with the refinement and synthesis of information gained in the first exploratory period and the organization of information into a feasible curriculum. Phase Three (1968) consisted of the refinement and field testing of all curriculum items, the initial investigation of a separate curriculum for early childhood, the preparation and testing of plans for teacher retraining, and the development of an assessment instrument that reflected the program objectives.

==Hawaii Music Curriculum Program==

The Hawaii Music Curriculum Program began in 1968 under the sponsorship of the Hawaii Curriculum Center in Honolulu. Its purpose was to create a logical, continuous educational program ensuring the competent guidance of the music education of all children in the state's public schools and to test and assemble the materials needed by schools to realize this program. Students are to be involved with music in school in the same ways that people are involved with music in the outside world. The curriculum is based on seven basic concepts: tone, rhythm, melody, harmony, form, tonality, and texture, that are presented in the form of a spiral curriculum. The taxonomy of concepts was translated into a curriculum by means of division into five "zones."{{clarify|date=October 2013}}

'''Contemporary ballet''' is a genre of [[dance]] that incorporates elements of [[classical ballet]] and [[modern dance]].&lt;ref name="washington ballet"&gt;{{cite web|title=ballet 101|url=http://www.washingtonballet.org/news-media/ballet-101/|website=the washington ballet|publisher=The Washington Ballet|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs classical [[ballet technique]] and in many cases classical [[pointe technique]] as well, but allows greater range of movement of the upper body and is not constrained to the rigorously defined body lines and forms found in traditional, classical ballet. Many of its attributes come from the ideas and innovations of 20th-century modern dance, including [[floor work]] and [[turn-in (dance)|turn-in]] of the legs.

==History==
[[File:G. Balanchine (young).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[George Balanchine]], a contemporary ballet pioneer]]
[[George Balanchine]]  is often considered to have been the first pioneer of contemporary ballet. However, the true origin of contemporary ballet is credited to Russian art producer Serge Diaghilev. Diaghilev wanted to bring an understanding of the arts to the general public. He created a program that combined all forms of the arts (painting, music, theater, and art) to present to the public. When this program had success in Russia, Diaghilev was inspired to bring it to a European audience by creating a new spin on classical ballet. He created Diaghilev's Russian Ballet Company, debuting the first show in 1909. However, Diaghilev was not a choreographer, he entrusted the evolvement of his creation to several well-known choreographers, one of them being George Balanchine. 

The style of dance Balanchine developed, which lies between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet, is known by today's standards as [[neoclassical ballet]]. He used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-traditional costumes, such as leotards, tunics and "powder puff" tutus&lt;ref name="dance magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Looseleaf|first1=Victoria|title=The story of the tutu|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/October-2007/The-Story-of-the-Tutu|website=Dance magazine|publisher=DanceMedia, LLC|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of "pancake" tutus, to distance his work from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine invited modern dance performers such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] in to dance with his company, the [[New York City Ballet]], and he worked with modern dance choreographer [[Martha Graham]],&lt;ref name="paul taylor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Taylor Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-taylor-41059#synopsis|website=bio.|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC.|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which expanded his exposure to modern techniques and ideas.&lt;ref name="washington ballet" /&gt; During this period, other choreographers such as John Butler and [[Glen Tetley]] began to consciously combine ballet and modern techniques in experimentation.

== Choreographers ==
One dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neoclassical style was [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably [[Twyla Tharp]].&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Terry|title=The history and style of contemporary ballet|url=https://suite.io/terry-finch/1th62sd|website=Terry Finch|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tharp choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976;&lt;ref name="tharp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Marcia|title=Twyla Tharp|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/tharp.html|website=Dance Heritage Coalition|publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 she created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of [[pointe shoes]] and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.

Tharp also worked with The [[Joffrey Ballet]], founded in 1957 by [[Robert Joffrey]]. She choreographed ''[[Deuce Coupe]]'' for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder [[Gerald Arpino]].&lt;ref name="brief history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of contemporary ballet|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/a-Brief-History-Of-Contemporary-Ballet-1687695.html|website=study mode|publisher=StudyMode.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable contemporary choreographers include [[Jorma Elo]], [[William Forsythe (choreographer)]], [[Mark Morris (choreographer)]], [[Jiri Kylian]], [[Alonzo King]], and [[Trey McIntyre]].

== Technique ==
[[File:Grace in winter, contemporary ballet.jpg|thumb|A contemporary ballet dancer]]
Contemporary ballet draws from both modern dance and classical ballet for its training methods and technique. For a dancer to be able to embody various styles the training regimen has become more diverse. In addition to classical technique, which often includes the signature speed and style of George Balanchine for American dancers, dancers study modern as well. In addition, many dancers do various forms of cross training. Pilates and yoga are often included to loosen muscles and align the body. Since the late 1920s, [[Pilates]] has been a popular form of cross training to help prevent injury, but increasingly, the [[Gyrotonic]] Expansion System is being utilized. With contemporary work, dancers' spines need to be more supple and they need to understand how to be grounded. This is in contrast to classical and neoclassical ballet where the dancers are required to "pull up" and the upper body is held. Dancers are required to first obtain classical ballet training in order to build on it with more modern technique in order to be more versatile. Despite formal training, dancers are often affected by ankle injuries, due to the high intensity footwork.

== Costumes ==
The costumes and footwear differ from any other style of dance as well. In contemporary ballet, dancers can be asked to wear pointe shoes, regular ballet shoes, or even no shoes at all. The same versatile approach goes for the music, setting, and costumes. Contemporary ballet does not require certain standards to be met. While it has more guidelines that modern dance, it does not conform to the limits of classical ballet. Classical ballet requires tutus, pointe shoes and scenery. Contemporary ballet uses different types of costumes, ranging from traditional to more modern tunic type versions. The music choices may vary as well. In Classical ballet, most often the choreography is done to classical music. In contemporary ballet, the music can range from the traditional classical music to popular music of today.

== Present Day ==
Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers all over the world. Notable companies include [[Nederlands Dans Theater]], [[Hubbard Street Dance Chicago]], [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]], and [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]]. Likewise, many traditionally "classical" companies also regularly perform contemporary works. Most classically trained dancers who may identify as professional ballet dancers are in fact required to be very versatile and able to perform work ranging from classical to neoclassical to contemporary ballet to modern dance. They are required to have impeccable ballet technique with a mastery of [[pointe technique]] for women, but at the same time, are being asked to be just as comfortable in ballet slippers or bare foot performing the work of modern choreographers such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)]] or embracing [[Gaga (dance vocabulary)]] in the work of [[Ohad Naharin]]. It is very common for ballet companies to have an official choreographer in residence to create new work—often contemporary—on the company. As well, many contemporary choreographers are commissioned to go to companies to create new work or a company will pay for the rights to perform already existing work and an official repetiteur will come to stage it. Twyla Tharp, as previously mentioned, is a highly renowned choreographer whose work is widely performed.

'''Dead sand''', in the aquarium trade, refers to sand that has not been populated by beneficial [[bacteria]] and other organisms, unlike [[live sand]]. Adding a culture of nutrifying bacteria to a well-aerated, wet sand bed can usually produce live sand.

'''''Death Do Us Part''''' is a 2014 [[horror film]] directed by Nicholas Humphries, and written by [[Julia Benson]], Ryan Copple, and Peter Benson.

== Plot ==

A disheveled woman in a bridal gown is found stumbling along a highway, and is brought to a ranger station. As they wait for the sheriff, the only on-duty ranger asks the woman her name, and what happened to her. The bride refers to herself as Kennedy, and the film flashes back to the previous day, to when Kennedy, her fiancé Ryan, Kennedy's half-sister Hannah, their friend Emily, Ryan's cousin Derrick, and Ryan's friend Chet travelled to a secluded cabin for a [[Stag and doe]] party.

As the characters set up at the cabin, it is revealed that almost all of them have a dark secret; Kennedy's unspecified mental illness is flaring up due to wedding-related stress, Ryan is having an affair with Hannah, Derrick intends to extort Kennedy through Ryan in order to get the money he owes a drug dealer, and the caretaker, Bo, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Susan. That night, while everyone else is participating in a [[scavenger hunt]], Derrick is murdered with an axe. Upon noticing that Derrick is missing, the others go to look for him, and become separated, with Kennedy and Ryan finding Derrick's corpse, and Emily presumably being murdered after she, Chet, and Hannah encounter Bo, who has the axe that was used to kill Derrick. The remaining partiers regroup at the cabin, and discover that the power has been cut, the vehicle has been sabotaged, and that all of the cellular phones have been thrown into the stove. Chet then goes missing, Bo is found dying from a head wound, and Hannah is knifed by someone wearing a burlap sack as a mask. Kennedy stumbles onto Emily and Chet's bodies, and then Hannah's, which Ryan is with. Thinking Ryan is the killer, Kennedy attacks him, and runs off.

At dawn, Ryan returns to the cabin, where he and Kennedy fight, ending with Kennedy stabbing Ryan to death after Ryan spitefully declares that he never loved her. Kennedy then goes into hysterics, puts on her wedding dress, and runs into Emily, who claims that she had only been injured, and had faked being dead. The two women begin to walk to safety, until Emily lets slip information that only the killer could know. Kennedy confronts Emily, who asserts that she slew Derrick and Hannah, and had intended to murder Ryan, to protect her, with Chet and Bo being collateral damage. Kennedy snaps, and strangles Emily.

The film returns to the intro, and the bride lifts her veil to reveal that she is Emily, who had recovered, bludgeoned Kennedy, and taken her gown. The ranger offers his condolences for all that "Kennedy" has gone through, and when he gives Emily a pen to write down who he should contact for her, she stabs him in the neck with it, and walks out into the woods, leaving her fate unknown.

== Reception ==

Nav Qateel of ''1nflux Magazine'' said that, while ''Death Do Us Part'' had its shortcomings, it was still something "I wouldn't hesitate recommending to anyone into horror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://1nfluxmagazine.com/death-do-us-part/|title = ''Death Do Us Part''|last = Qateel|first = Nav|publisher = ''1nflux Magazine''|date = 22 April 2014|website = 1nfluxmagazine.com|accessdate = 6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lukewarn review was given was by Christian Bates-Hardy of Rock! Shock! Pop!, who concluded, "''Death Do Us Part'' does a fairly good job of building tension up between the characters and establishing subplots and drama between them, but once it becomes a horror film the whole thing unravels and quickly becomes a directionless mess. The characters do a lot of pointless running around and screaming for no apparent reason, and it becomes very tedious until the last ten to fifteen minutes. I was ready to divorce this movie until the final twist was revealed. The ending has a surprisingly nasty edge that somewhat redeems the movie, but doesn't quite make up for the lack of direction and poor script".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rockshockpop.com/forums/content.php?3920-Death-Do-Us-Part|title = ''Death Do Us Part''|last = Hardy|first = Christian|publisher = Rock! Shock! Pop!|date = 22 May 2014|website = rockshockpop.com|accessdate = 6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his coverage of ''Death Do Us Part'' for the Canadian Film Review, Mark Weeden called the picture a hackneyed affair that was devoid of fright, but full of boring kills, cringe-worthy attempts at emotion, and "Huh?"-inducing plot developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://canadianfilmreview.com/death-do-us-part-review/|title = ''Death Do Us Part'' – Review|last = Weeden|first = Mark|publisher = Canadian Film Review|date = 19 April 2014|website = canadianfilmreview.com|accessdate = 6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Verdict]]'s Patrick Bromley wrote that the "totally forgettable" ''Death Do Us Part'' is "the most frustrating kind of horror movie: the kind that strives only for mediocrity and achieves it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/deathdouspart.php|title = ''Death Do Us Part''|last = Bromley|first = Patrick|publisher = DVD Verdict|date = 30 May 2014|website = dvdverdict.com|accessdate = 6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7639">'''Disability in children's literature''' is a subject that has been the focus of changing attitudes in broader society since the 1970s. The movement to include children and youth with disabilities into mainstream [[society]] has led to new approaches on the part of authors, as well as educators.

In the [[United States]], 10% of the population has a physical, cognitive, mental or health disability, a rate that is consistent worldwide. Disabilities may also include sensory or [[learning disability|learning difficulties]], and may range from severe to mild. The approach of children and youth literature (collectively called "juvenile literature") can have a significant impact on the children reading it, whether they personally have experienced disability or not; literature "has proven to be an agent capable of influencing attitudes and acceptance of impairments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denman-West|first=Margaret W.|title=Children's Literature: A Guide to Information Sources|year=1998|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781563084485|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{blockquote|Perhaps no group has been as overlooked and inaccurately represented in children's books as individuals with disabilities. Most often they were not included in stories and when they were, many negative [[stereotypes]] prevailed, such as characters who were pitiful or pathetic, evil or superheroes, or a burden and incapable of fully participating in the events of everyday life. Often the difference or disability was the main personality trait emphasized to the reader, not a balance of strengths and weaknesses. Blaska, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1940 to 1970, around 311 books for children were published in the United States that included characters with disabilities. Some of these books romanticized the disability, some were infantilized, while others portrayed the disabled characters as avoiding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the classic children's book ''[[Heidi]]''. It portrays the character Clara as a spoiled and insulated child, who regains the ability to walk after befriending Heidi and overcoming a vague and unexplained [[psychological]] problem, the apparent cause of her physical [[paralysis]], which in reality would be medically unlikely. Another oddity is that the portrayal of [[Blindness|blind]] individuals was in excess of their actual numbers in the real population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blindness was noted as being the most common disability among African-American characters in children's fiction, used as a plot device to represent the ability to see beyond racial prejudices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Lois|title=Take up thy bed and walk: death, disability and cure in classic fiction for girls|year=2001|publisher=Women's Press|isbn=9780704346512|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the disability secondary to its significance as a plot device.

Beginning in the 1970s, the [[United States Congress]] passed several Acts to legally protect the right of children and adults with disabilities to be included in schools and the workforce, first with the [[Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973 and then the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975. In 1986, the [[Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act]] (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion of children with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. [[Barbara Holland Baskin]] and [[Karen H. Harris]] conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study ''Notes from a Different Drummer'' (1977), followed by ''More Notes from a Different Drummer'' (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since.

The evolution of the portrayal of disability can be seen in the books written since the 1970s. [[Judy Blume]] shows the experience of a teenage girl diagnosed with [[idiopathic scoliosis]] in ''[[Deenie]]'' (1973). The protagonist, Deenie, faces the challenges brought by having to wear a body brace during her treatment, which impacts her perceptions of herself and those of her family and fellow students. Deenie does not overcome the disability by the end of the story, nor is she defeated by it; the conclusion more realistically shows her continuing to face challenges and learning to adjust to them. 

A trend in current juvenile fiction is the portrayal of characters with "hidden disabilities" that have become more common diagnoses in recent decades. Examples include [[Petra Mathers]]' ''Sophie and Lou'', about extreme shyness that is an emotional and [[social disability]], and [[Caroline Janover]]'s ''The Worst Speller in Jr. High'' (1995) about a boy with [[dyslexia]]. In fiction for older youth, disability has recently been dealt with in complex situations with nuanced techniques such as multiple-perspective narrative; an example is [[Erika Tamar]]'s ''Fair Game'' (1993), about a group of male students who repeatedly sexually assault an intellectually disabled girl at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernice E. Cullinan, Diane Goetz Person|title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9780826417787|pages=238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bibliographer Debra Robertson, who wrote ''Portraying Persons with Disabilities: An Annotated Bibliography of Fiction for Children and Teenagers'' (1992), pointed out in the early 1990s that not every disability has to be a "metaphor for a protagonist's development", and the tendency of writers to romanticize or stigmatize medical conditions in this way is a persistent problem in juvenile literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent studies have indicated that educators may improve student understanding of disability with "follow-up discussion or activities and stories that portray characters with disabilities accurately, realistically, and positively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dançarinas de funaná.jpg|thumb|300px|Female funaná dancers.]]

The '''''funaná''''' {{IPA-pt|funɐˈna|}} is a music and dance genre from [[Cape Verde]]. ''Funaná'' is an accordion-based music. It is perhaps the most upbeat form of [[Cape Verdean music]]. The rhythm is usually provided by the '''''[[ferrinho]]''''' much like the use of [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]]s in zydeco, the saw in Caribbean [[ripsaw music]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, the [[Scraper (instrument)|scraper]] in Sub-Saharan African music{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and the [[güiro]] in Latin and Pre-Columbian music{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.

== Characteristics ==
As a music genre, the ''funaná'' is characterized by having a variable [[tempo]], from ''vivace'' to ''andante'', and a 2-beat [[rhythm]]. The ''funaná'' is intimately associated to the [[accordion]], more precisely to the [[Diatonic button accordion|diatonic accordion]], commonly known as '''''gaita''''' in Cape Verde. This influences a lot of musical aspects that characterize the ''funaná'', such as the fact that, in its most traditional form, the funaná uses only [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic scales]],&lt;ref name="Gonçalves"&gt;[[Carlos Filipe Gonçalves|Gonçalves, C. F.]], ''[[Kab Verd Band]]'' — 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and not chromatic ones.

The structure of a ''funaná'' composition is not very different from the structure of other musical genres in Cape Verde, i.e., basically the music is structured through a set of main [[Strophe (music)|strophes]] that alternate with a [[refrain]]. The main difference is that between the different strophes and the refrain there is a solo played on the accordion.&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; The music is generally [[Monotony (music)|monotonic]].

The accompaniment is made with the left hand on the accordion, providing a [[Bass (music)|bass]] and the [[Chord (music)|chords]]. The rhythmic model is played on the ''[[ferrinho]]''.&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt;

The [[Melody|melodic]] line of the ''funaná'' varies a lot through the composition, with a lot of series of ascending and descending notes. The ''funaná'' singers occasionally use the ''[[Dynamics (music)|sforzando]]'' technique in certain notes, specially if they are long (imitation of the accordion?).

The lyrics of the ''funaná'' generally talk about everyday situations, mentioning the sorrows and the happiness of quotidian life, but they also talk about social criticism, reflections about life and idyllic situations. Recent composers however have expanded the themes. Another characteristic of ''funaná'' is that the lyrics are not made in a direct way, but frequently use figures of speech, proverbs and popular sayings. Example:

That requires a good knowledge of popular culture and language, and that’s why recent compositions, compositions from younger authors or compositions from authors with little contact with popular culture do not always use this poetry technique.

Concerning instrumentation, in its most traditional form, of the ''funaná'' only uses the accordion and the ''ferrinho''. With the stylization and electrification other instruments are used: the rhythm provided by the ''ferrinho'' is made on a [[drum set]] together with other percussion instruments (a [[Shaker (percussion)|shaker]] or a [[cabasa]]); the bass/accompaniment played on the accordion is replaced by a [[bass guitar]] and an [[electric guitar]]; the melody played on the accordion is replaced by a [[synthesizer]]. By the end of the 90’s, there is a certain revival where the unplugged (acoustic) performances are sought after, in which electronic instruments are relegated in favor to authentic accordions and ''ferrinhos''.

== As a dance ==
As a dance, ''funaná'' is a couple dance, with the partners embracing each other with an arm while with the other arm they hold on the hands together. The dance is made through alternated quick and strong inflexions of each knee, marking the beats of the rhythm. In the more rural way of dancing, the bodies are slightly inclined to the front (having shoulder contact), and the feet lift off the ground. In the more urban way of dancing, more stylized, the bodies are more vertical (having chest contact), and the feet drag on the ground.

== History ==
The ''funaná'' is a relatively recent musical genre. According to the oral tradition,&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Veiga"&gt;Veiga, A. G., ''Badjo di Gaita na Ilha de Santiago'', in ''Voz di Povo'' — edições de 14 e 23 de Agosto de 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the ''funaná'' appeared when, in an attempt of acculturation, the accordion would have been introduced in [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] island in the beginning of the 20th century, in order to the population to learn Portuguese musical genres. The result, however, would have been completely different: it would be the creation of a new and genuine music genre. There aren’t, nevertheless, musicological documents to prove that. Even so, it’s still curious the fact that, even being a totally different musical genre, the usage of the accordion and the ferrinho in the ''funaná'' is analogous to the usage of the accordion and the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] in certain Portuguese folk music genres ([[malhão]], [[corridinho]], [[Vira (dance)|vira]], etc.)

Other sources, also from oral tradition,&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; trace back another origin. They place the origins of the ''funaná'' in the increase of accordion importations as a cheap substitute for [[Organ (music)|organs]] to play religious music. The ''funaná'' would have then appeared as an adaptation for the accordion of other musical genres that were in vogue then.

The name “''funaná''” itself is also recent,&lt;ref name="Veiga" /&gt; and dates back probably from the 60’s and 70’s. For some, the word derives from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word “''fungagá''”. For others the name comes from the merging of the names of two great players, one of accordion and the other of ''ferrinho'', named '''Funa''' and '''Naná'''. The older words for designating the ''funaná''&lt;ref name="Fernandes"&gt;Fernandes, A. N., ''O dialecto crioulo — Léxico do dialecto crioulo do Arquipélago de Cabo Verde'' — 1969&lt;/ref&gt; were “''fuc-fuc''” and “''badju l’ gaita''”.

Initially a genre exclusively from Santiago, for a long time the ''funaná'' was relegated to a rural context and/or for the less favourished social classes. It has even been forbidden its performance in the capital, where it was the ''[[Morna (music)|morna]]'' that had a more prestigious and noble character.

But during the 1970s, and mostly after the independence, there had been essays of reviving certain musical genres, among them the ''funaná''. The post-independence socialist ideology, with its struggle against the social classes differences, was a fertile field for the (re)birth of the ''funaná''.&lt;ref name="Catchás"&gt;Martins, C. A., ''Funaná, a maior conquista'' in Tribuna — Dezembro de 1986&lt;/ref&gt; These essays weren’t successful mostly because “the ''funaná'' couldn’t step away from the ''[[coladeira]]''”{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

It was necessary to wait for the 1980s in order the band [[Bulimundo]] and specially its mentor Carlos Alberto Martins (a.k.a. [[Catchás]]) make a true revival of the ''funaná''.&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; Going to “drink” directly to the source (inner Santiago island), Catchás profited his [[jazz]] and [[classical music]] knowledge{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} to make up a new style of playing the ''funaná'', leaning in [[Electric instrument|electric]] and [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic]] instruments,&lt;ref name="Catchás" /&gt; that would influence nearly all artists from now on. Thanks to the success of Bulimundo, the ''funaná'' was exported to all the islands in Cape Verde. Today, the ''funaná'' is no longer seen as a genre exclusively from Santiago, being composed, performed and appreciated by people from all the islands.&lt;ref name="Fragata"&gt;''Funaná — O cartão de Visita de Cabo Verde'' in Fragata, n.º 10 — Janeiro de 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

If the 80’s were the years of the spreading of the ''funaná'' within Cape Verde, the 90’s were the years of the internationalization.&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; The band [[Finaçon]], born from a split of the band Bulimundo, was one of the responsible for the internationalization of this genre, thanks to a contract with a renowned foreign record label.&lt;ref name="Fragata" /&gt; Not only the ''funaná'' had become known internationally, but it is also performed by musical bands abroad, being cape verdean bands or not.

Concerning musical techniques there are no big innovations to the “Catchás’ style”, maybe perhaps only regarding the instrumentation (the possibilities of electronic instruments are explored). We can also notice, in this period, the excessive commercialization and banalization of the ''funaná''. For instance, during a certain year, there has been an attempt of disclosing the ''funaná'' in [[France]]. That attempt was not successful because ''funaná'' was sold as a kind of “summer in-vogue music” (right after the [[lambada]]), and not exploring the ethno-musical particularities of the ''funaná''.

By the end of the 90’s, we can assist to a return to the roots,&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; where the bands prefer to perform with authentic accordions and ''ferrinhos'' (occasionally a bass, a drum set and/or a guitar is added). One of the leading bands of this new vague is the band [[Ferro Gaita]].

== Variants ==
The ''funaná'' has several variants,&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; not all of them well known and not all of them known by its true name. Here is the description of some:

[[Image:Funaná rhythm.png|thumb|right|300px|Rhythmic model of ''funaná kaminhu di ferru'', ± 150 [[Beats per minute|bpm]].]]

=== ''Funaná kaminhu di férru'' ===
This is the most known variant of the ''funaná''. Generally when the word “''funaná''” is used alone it refers to this variant which is the one that is more successful, specially in dancing. It is a variant that reminds a [[March (music)|march]] but with a ''vivace'' tempo.

[[Image:Funaná rhythm.png|thumb|right|300px|Rhythmic model of ''funaná maxixi'', ± 120 [[Beats per minute|bpm]].]]

=== ''Funaná maxixi'' ===
The name of this variant probably comes from the musical genre ''[[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]]'' that was once in vogue in Cape Verde. It is a variant that looks like the previous one, but with an ''allegro'' tempo.

[[Image:Tuada rhythm.png|thumb|right|300px|Rhythmic model of ''funaná samba'', ± 96 [[Beats per minute|bpm]].]]

=== ''Funaná samba'' ===
In spite of the name, this variant has no relationship with the present Brazilian genre [[samba]]. It seems to be an adaptation of the ''[[lundu (dance)|lundu]]m'' to the accordion techniques. The tempo is slower&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;Brito, M., ''Breves Apontamentos sobre as Formas Musicais existentes em Cabo Verde'' — 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (''andante'') and the rhythm is different from the other variants, it is quite similar to the ''toada''.

[[Image:Funaná lentu rhythm.png|thumb|right|300px|Rhythmic model of slow ''funaná'', ± 92 [[Beats per minute|bpm]].]]

=== ''Funaná morna'' ===
Practically, it is not known by this name, it is more known as '''slow ''funaná'''''. It seems to be an adaptation of the ''morna'' to the accordion techniques, with an andante tempo. While during a long time it was the ''morna'' (''badju di viulinu'') that enjoyed some prestige in urban contexts and noble dance rooms, in rural contexts a slower version of ''funaná'' (''badju di gaita'') was developed in contraposition.&lt;ref name="Gonçalves" /&gt; Curiously, this variant has the same tempo as the Boa Vista ''morna'' and not the Brava ''morna''.

== Examples of ''funanás'' ==
&lt;!-- This examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all funanás. They are here just for, to whoever doesn’t know this musical genre, to have at least a discographic reference. We ask to the editors not to overwhelm this list with unnecessary examples. --&gt;

'''Geofrey''' "'''Geof'''" '''Darrow''' (born October 21, 1955) is an American comic book artist, best known for his work on ''[[Hard Boiled (comics)|Hard Boiled]]'', ''[[The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot]]'', which was adapted into [[The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot (TV series)|an animated television series of the same name]], and ''[[Shaolin Cowboy]]''.

==Career==

===Character design and Moebius collaborations===
Darrow was a student at [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon studios after studying at the American Academy of Arts in Chicago. In the early 1980s he worked in character design for the ''[[Super Friends]]'', ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', and ''[[Pac-Man (TV series)|Pac-Man]]'' television series.&lt;ref name="Lambiek"&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/d/darrow_g.htm Geof Darrow] at [[Lambiek]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he met [[France|French]] [[comic book]] writer and artist "[[Jean Giraud|Mœbius]]" who was working on the film ''[[Tron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''La Cité Feu'' (US edition), Starwatcher Graphics, January 1985, introduction folio&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the two collaborated on an art portfolio of prints named ''La Cité Feu'' which saw a to 100 copies limited American release by Starwatcher Graphics &amp;ndash; Moebius' own Californian publishing house &amp;ndash; in 1985, but was later reissued on a somewhat larger scale by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] as ''City of Fire'' in 1993.&lt;ref name="comiczone"&gt;[http://geoffdarrow.comiczoneradio.com/ Geof Darrow Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321002621/http://geoffdarrow.comiczoneradio.com/ |date=2011-03-21 }} at comiczoneradio. (audio, 102 minutes)&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, Darrow's follow-up solo project, the 1986 ''East Meets West'' portfolio ({{ISBN|2905035145}}), was published by [[:fr:Aedena|Éditions Aedena]], the also Moebius (co-)owned French mother company of Starwatcher.

Geof has stated in interviews that he considers [[Hergé]], [[Jack Kirby]] (who he worked with at Hanna-Barbera), [[Osamu Tezuka]], and Jean "Mœbius" Giraud as his artistic influences.

In 1986, Geof produced "Comics and Stories," a collection of stories starring his own character Bourbon Thret, for publisher 
Aedena.&lt;ref name="Lambiek" /&gt; It contains several pin ups colored by Moebius, [[Tanino Liberatore]] and [[Francois Boucq]].

===Frank Miller collaborations===
Moebius introduced Darrow to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] which led to a friendship and eventually two collaborations. In 1990, Darrow and Miller collaborated on the comic book ''[[Hard Boiled (comics)|Hard Boiled]]'', a 3-part mini-series, for which they won the 1991 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Writer/Artist.

In 1993 and 1994, Darrow provided art for the role-playing game line ''[[Underground (role playing game)|Underground]]'', published by Mayfair Games. Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayfairgames.com/ Mayfair Games Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darrow and Miller worked together again on ''[[Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot]]'' in 1996, a far more family-oriented work, in which the protagonists save [[Tokyo]] from destruction by a giant lizard. The story was later developed into a 26-episode animated series [[The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot (TV series)|of the same name]], produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]] and [[Dark Horse Entertainment]], which aired from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,270885,00.html "God Is In The Details"]. September 24, 1999. Entertainment Weekly.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wachowskis and Shaolin Cowboy===
[[The Wachowskis]] saw his work on ''Hard Boiled'', and approached Darrow to do some conceptual work for ''[[The Matrix]]''. Darrow was credited as 'Conceptual Designer' on all three ''[[The Matrix series|Matrix]]'' movies.&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/655769?view=credit Geof Darrow] at British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; His visual style is most prominent in the scene of Neo's awakening from his biomechanical sleep. The insect-like machine that attacks Neo is a classic Darrow mechanoid made up of tubes, viewscreens and riveted joints. He has also contributed to both volumes of The Matrix comics, a series of short Matrix-inspired comic stories.

Darrow has also contributed covers to a number of other comics, including ''[[Concrete (comics)|Concrete]]'', ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' and [[Andrew Vachss]]' ''Cross'', as well as illustrating a part of Vachss' ''Another Chance To Get It Right'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vachss.com/media/comics/geof_darrow.html Geof Darrow], at collaborator [[Andrew Vachss]]' site.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geof Darrow.png|thumb|Geof Darrow at San Diego Comic Con 2009.]]
Darrow started writing and illustrating ''[[Shaolin Cowboy]]'' in 2005 (published by [[Burlyman Entertainment]]), featuring Darrow's trademark ultra-violence, irony and meticulous level of detail. Seven volumes were released until May 2007. Variety reported in April 2009 that the Wachowskis and Circle of Confusion were producing an animated feature of ''Shaolin Cowboy'', written and directed by Darrow, and animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/c2e2-top-artists-100128.html C2E2 Announces Ten Top Artist Appearances] Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo press release.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002955.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1 "Circle of Confusion hires Emery"]. April 28, 2009. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darrow is also the co-creator of the series ''[[Doc Frankenstein]]'', written by the Wachowskis, with art by Steve Skroce, also published by Burlyman Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlymanentertainment.com/site/html/br_doc_frank1.html Doc Frankenstein] at Burlyman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geof has also written forewords for other artists' works, such as ''The Art of Blade of the Immortal'' and Art Adams' ''Creature Features''.

Outside of comic books and film, Darrow has also done some artwork for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' trading card series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magiccards.info/query?q=a%3A%22darrow%22&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/thirty-two-short-columns-about-dwarves-2005-11-21]. [[Wizards of the Coast]]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as various trading card line, such as Witchblade, Star Wars, The Shadow and Mike Allred's Madman.

The Wachowskis also brought Darrow in to be the conceptual designer on ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]''.&lt;ref name="BFI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xsibase.com/articles.php?detail=145 Interview with Michael Meyers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113032944/http://xsibase.com/articles.php?detail=145 |date=2010-01-13 }}. May 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darrow serves on the national advisory board of [[Protect (political organization)|PROTECT]]: The National Association to Protect Children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/52883872 Geof Darrow receives the 2012 PROTECT Messenger Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 [[Toronto Comic Con|Toronto]], [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego]] and [[New York Comic Con|New York]] Comic Cons, Darrow said that ''Shaolin Cowboy'' would continue as a three-issue series with Dark Horse Comics. A "pulp-style" prose novel written by Andrew Vachss, with spot illustrations by Darrow, was released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vachss.com/av_novels/noway.html Shaolin Cowboy Adventure Magazine promotional page]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">'''''Gerong''''' is the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] verb meaning "to [[Singing|sing]] in a [[Choir|chorus]]." '''''Penggerong''''' is the proper name of a member of the chorus, but often the word gerong is used to refer to the unison male chorus that sings with the [[gamelan]]. The chorus or the [[melody]] may also be called the '''gerongan'''.

The gerong generally sings in distinct sections of a gamelan composition. Certain standard texts in Javanese [[poetic meter]]s of various structures are used in many compositions; some are based in Javanese poetic forms known as [[macapat]]. Some pieces have specific texts written for them, but this is often a special treatment. Female singers are referred to as ''pesindhen'', and may sing in a separate group, a combined group with the men, or as a solo female voice, with or without a male chorus.

A gerong part is different from that of a single female singer [[sindhen]], in that the chorus must sing together, and is generally more connected to the steady pulse of the underlying gamelan parts. While vocal parts for both male and female singers can be notated in the cipher or number notation called [[kepatihan notation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamelan.org/library American Gamelan Institute Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the actual realization of these parts will always be open to stylistic and other variations.

The noted Javanese musician [[K. P. H. Notoprojo]] (known to his students as Pak Cokro) wrote out vocal notation for many pieces. These are now on line in the library of the American Gamelan Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamelan.org/library The Vocal Music of K.R.T. Wasitodipuro&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karachi Gymkhana Club in 1890.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Karachi Gymkhana Club]] in 1890.]]
'''Gymkhana''' ({{lang-hi|जिमख़ाना}}, {{lang-as|জিমখানা}}, {{lang-bn|জিমখানা}}, {{lang-ur|جِمخانہ}}, {{lang-sd|جمخانه}}) is an [[India]]n term which originally referred to a place of assembly. The meaning then altered to denote a place where skill-based contests were held. "Gymkhana" is an [[Anglo-Indian]] expression, which is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word "''Jamat-khana''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLw9AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA91|page=91|title=The Globe Trotter in India Two Hundred Years Ago: And Other Indian Studies|author1=MacMillan|first1=Michael|year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most gymkhanas have a Gymkhana Club associated with them, a term coined during [[British Raj]] for [[gentlemen's club]].

More generally, gymkhana refers to a social and sporting club in the [[Indian subcontinent]], and in other Asian countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Burma and Singapore, as well as in East Africa.

In English-speaking countries outside the Indian subcontinent, a '''[[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]]''' is a multi-game equestrian competition held to display the training and talents of horses and their riders, particularly in speed events.

The term is also used as the name of a timed automotive obstacle course, see [[Gymkhana (motorsport)]] and [[Gymkhana (motorcycle)]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Bombay-Gymnkhana.jpg|thumb| [[Bombay Gymkhana]] or Bombay Gym]]
The first element of ''Gymkhana'' comes from ''gend'' meaning ''ball'' in [[Hindustani language|Hindi]]/[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]/[[Khariboli]]. This element is distinct from English word ''[[gym]]'', short for ''gymnasium'' and  ''[[gymnastics]]'' which has  Greek and Latin roots.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1252920#m_en_us1252920 Gymnasium etymology]&lt;/ref&gt; The second element, ''khānā'' (ख़ाना) has Indo-Persian or Indo-Arabic origin meaning a place or a compartment. In the [[Persian language|Persian]] (خانه) it's a term for ''dwelling, house''.&lt;ref&gt;From ''Loghat'nāmeh-ye'' [[Ali Akbar Dehkhoda|Dehkhoda]], Third Edition ([[Tehran University Press]], 2006), quoted from ''Borhān-e Ghāte' '' by [[Mohammad Moin|Dr Mohammad Moin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5823">'''Invisible theatre''' is a form of theatrical performance that is enacted in a place where people would not normally expect to see one, for example in the street or in a shopping centre. Performers disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, thus leading spectators to view it as a real, unstaged event. 

The Brazilian [[theatre practitioner|theater practitioner]] [[Augusto Boal]] and Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during their time in Argentina in the 1960s as part of his [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], which focused on oppression and social issues. Invisible theatre developed in the context of increasingly repressive dictatorship in Brazil and Argentina. The purpose of invisible theatre was to show oppression in everyday life, in an everyday setting, without the audience or [[Theatre of the Oppressed#Spect-actor|Spect-actors]] knowing. Boal went on to develop [[forum theatre|forum theater]].&lt;ref&gt;Boal, Augusto. 2000. Theatre of the Oppressed. 3rd ed. London: Pluto. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1657-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible Theatre in Argentina==
Invisible theatre was developed in [[Buenos Aires]] as public and participatory action that avoided police authority. The Brazilian [[Augusto Boal]] was in exile in Argentina from 1971 to 1976 and wrote his first invisible theatre in collaboration with a group of actors. The invisible theatre was set at a busy restaurant at lunchtime, with actors sitting at different tables. One actor ordered à la card, but at the end of the lunch told the waiter that he could not pay the 70 soles. He offered to pay with his [[Wage labour|labour]] and asked the waiter how much he would get paid taking out the rubbish. Another actor, seated at another table, informed the customers that a rubbish collector gets paid 7 sole per hour. Yet another actor, on yet another table, told everyone that a gardener gets 10 soles per hour. Eventually another member of the actor crew started to collect money from the restaurant customers to pay the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bishop| first = Clair| title = Artificial Hells| publisher = Verso| date = July 2012| location = London| pages = 122-123| url = https://www.versobooks.com/books/958-artificial-hells| isbn = 9781844676903}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boal took theatre to an audience who did not recognise that they were the audience and Boal argued it was critical that actors participating in the invisible theatre did not reveal that they were actors. In its early phase invisible theatre aimed to raise public awareness of class differences and to provide a forum for articulating dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bishop| first = Clair| title = Artificial Hells| publisher = Verso| date = July 2012| location = London| pages = 123-124| url = https://www.versobooks.com/books/958-artificial-hells| isbn = 9781844676903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invisible Theatre in Europe ==
In the late 1970s and the early 1980s Boal staged invisible theatre in Sicily, Stockholm, Paris and other European cities on issues such as [[racism]], [[ageism]], [[sexism]] and [[homelessness]]. He staged invisible theatre in public locations such as the Paris Metro and on Stockholm ferries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bishop| first = Clair| title = Artificial Hells| publisher = Verso| date = July 2012| location = London| pages = 125| url = https://www.versobooks.com/books/958-artificial-hells| isbn = 9781844676903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invisible Theatre in Brazil ==
When Boal returned to Brazil in 1986, he produced a weekly invisible theatre for a Rio TV station. In one episode a dark-skinned man sold himself as a slave in the market, informing the crowd that he earned less than a 19th-century slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bishop| first = Clair| title = Artificial Hells| publisher = Verso| date = July 2012| location = London| pages = 125| url = https://www.versobooks.com/books/958-artificial-hells| isbn = 9781844676903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to happenings==
Historically invisible theatre developed after [[happening]]s were staged in Argentina by [[Oscar Mosatta]]. Mosatta had staged happenings in the late 1960s after he had attended such performances in New York in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bishop| first = Clair| title = Artificial Hells| publisher = Verso| date = July 2012| location = London| pages = 106 &amp; 108| url = https://www.versobooks.com/books/958-artificial-hells| isbn = 9781844676903}}&lt;/ref&gt; While happenings are also used to raise awareness about an issue, take place outside a theatre or gallery, and are scripted, the audience is aware that they are attending a happening.&lt;ref&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort. "'Happenings' in the New York Scene." The NewMediaReader. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2003. 83-88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Boal states in ''Tecnicas latinoamericanas de teatro popular'' that invisible theater and happenings are distinct: "El teatro invisible no debe ser confundido con el happening, que es un hecho teatral insólito, caótico, en que todo puede ocurrir, anárquicamente. [Invisible theater must not be confused with the happening, which is an unusual theatrical event, chaotic, in which anything can occur, anarchically.]" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boal|first=Augusto|title=Tecnicas latinoamericanas de teatro popular|year=1974|publisher=Ediciones corregidor|location=Buenos Aires|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jóhann Kristinn Pétursson''' (9 February 1913 – 26 November 1984), also known as '''The Icelandic Giant''' or '''The Viking Giant''', was an Icelandic man who at his peak measured {{convert|2.34|m|ftin}} in height and weighed {{convert|163|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Skjeggete damer og siamesiske tvillinger: fra tivoli til "Big Brother"|first =Herman|last =Berthelsen|publisher =J.W. Cappelens Forlag|date =2002|page =93|language =Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Dalvík]], [[Iceland]] on 9 February 1913 as the third of nine children in his family, Jóhann had a normal development until the age of 15, after which he experienced [[gigantism|accelerated growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Giant with a Gentle Disposition|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14397597/jhann_k_ptursson_19131984/|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=July 13, 1977|page=43|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 14, 2017}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 17 he was very strong and reportedly could lift a [[lorry]]. but by age 20 had back and joint issues and had difficulty walking. In 1935, he was studied by [[Knud Krabbe]] in [[Copenhagen]], who recorded his height at {{convert|2.205|m|ftin}} and his weight at {{convert|135|kg|lb}} but doubted that he had [[acromegaly]] as his body was proportional and there was no sign of [[hypogonadism]]. However, he had an enlarged [[sella turcica]]. He was re-examined in [[Leipzig]] in 1939, measuring at {{convert|2.225|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref name=Pituitary&gt;De Herder, W. W. (2009). Acromegaly and gigantism in the medical literature. Case descriptions in the era before and the early years after the initial publication of Pierre Marie (1886). Pituitary, 12(3), 236–244. http://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-008-0138-y&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Due to his physical ailments, Jóhann was unable to find normal employment and instead toured Europe's [[vaudeville]] theatres, doing so until the outbreak of World War II. He was in Copenhagen during the German invasion of [[Denmark]] and remained there until the end of the war, working in a shipyard.

“'''''Klaatu barada nikto'''''” is a phrase that originated in the 1951 [[science fiction film]] ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''. The humanoid alien protagonist of the film, [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]] ([[Michael Rennie]]), instructs Helen Benson ([[Patricia Neal]]) that if any harm befalls him, she must say the phrase to the [[robot]] [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]] ([[Lock Martin|Lockard Martin]]). In response Gort relents from destroying the Earth and resurrects Klaatu from death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pomerance | first = Murray | title = Cinema and Modernity | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8135-3816-5 | page = 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Robot Hall of Fame]] describes the phrase as "one of the most famous commands in science fiction"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Robot Hall of Fame: Gort | work = 2006 Inductees: Gort | publisher = [[Carnegie Mellon University]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.robothalloffame.org/06inductees/gort.html | accessdate = April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Frederick S. Clarke of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' called it "the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Frederick S. | title = Fantasy Films| journal = [[Cinefantastique]] | year = 1979 | issue = Vol. 8, Issues 2-4| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXZZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=most+famous+phrase+ever+spoken+by+an+extraterrestrial+Cinefantastique+Klaatu&amp;dq=most+famous+phrase+ever+spoken+by+an+extraterrestrial+Cinefantastique+Klaatu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjil5fL-pfcAhWOTt8KHZEjB3gQ6AEIDzAB | page=2|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in the film ==
[[Edmund H. North]], who wrote ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'', also created the [[alien language]] used in the film, including the phrase "''Klaatu barada nikto''". The official spelling of the phrase comes directly from the script (as shown in the above image) and provides insight as to its proper pronunciation.

The phrase was never translated in the film and neither Edmund North nor did [[20th Century Fox]] ever release an official translation.

Near the end of the film, as Klaatu is pursued by the American military, he urges Helen Benson to memorize the phrase, saying "There's no limit to what he can do. He could destroy the Earth... If anything should happen to me you must go to Gort, you must say these words: ''Klaatu barada nikto''.' Please repeat that."

Shortly after, Klaatu is shot and killed. Knowing that Klaatu has died, Gort vaporizes the polymer cube encasing him and disables the two soldiers standing guard. Helen conveys Klaatu's message. Gort takes her inside the spaceship, and then retrieves Klaatu's lifeless body, which he revives.

=== Usage in 2008 remake ===
In the [[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|2008 remake]], the line was added at [[Keanu Reeves]]' insistence.&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite news |author=Cindy White |title=Day's Anatomy |work=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://whoaisnotme.net/articles/2008_10xx_day.htm |accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaatu uses it near the beginning of the film to shut down Gort, and again at the end, highly distorted and barely audible, when he stops the destruction of the Earth. Although the line can be heard in the film, it does not appear in the English subtitles.

== Interpretation ==
Because there is no official translation of the phrase, a few notable attempts have been made to determine the phrase's meaning:

Philosophy professor Aeon J. Skoble speculates the phrase is part of a [[fail-safe]] feature used during diplomatic missions, whereby Gort's deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is undesirably triggered into a defensive posture. Skoble observes that this theme has evolved into a "staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor = Steven M. Sanders |last = Skoble |first = Aeon J. |title = The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film |chapter = Technology and Ethics in ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' |publisher = University Press of Kentucky |year = 2007 |isbn = 0-8131-2472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation the phrase apparently tells Gort that Klaatu considers escalation unnecessary.

''[[Fantastic Films]]'' explored the meaning of "''Klaatu barada nikto''" in the 1978 article "The Language of Klaatu". In the article Tauna Le Marbe, the magazine's Alien Linguistics Editor, attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film.&lt;ref name="fantastic-films"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Le Marbe| first = Tauna| editor-last = Stein| editor-first= Michael|date=April 1978| title = The Language of Klaatu| journal = Fantastic Films| issue = 1| pages =| publisher = Blake Publishing Corp.| url = http://www.dreamerwww.com/fanfilm/fanfilm2.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040628163125/http://www.dreamerwww.com/fanfilm/fanfilm2.htm| archivedate = June 28, 2004| accessdate = July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Marbe's literal translation was "Stop Barbarism, (I have) death, bind;" the free translation was "I die, repair me, do not retaliate."&lt;ref name="fantastic-films" /&gt;

The documentary ''Decoding "Klaatu Barada Nikto": Science Fiction as Metaphor'' examined the phrase ''Klaatu barada nikto'' with some of the people involved with ''The Day the Earth Stood Still''. [[Robert Wise]], director of the original, recalled a conversation he had with Edmund North, saying North told him, "...it's just something I kind of cooked up. I thought it sounded good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Robert Wise | date = December 2, 2008 | title = Decoding "Klaatu Barada Nikto": Science Fiction as Metaphor | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1346880/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment | accessdate = July 15, 2010 | time = 0:14:05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billy Gray (actor)|Billy Gray]], who played Bobby Benson in the film, said that "barada nikto must mean... save Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Billy Gray | date = December 2, 2008 | title = Decoding "Klaatu Barada Nikto": Science Fiction as Metaphor | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1346880/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment | accessdate = July 15, 2010 | time = 0:14:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Blaustein, widow of the producer [[Julian Blaustein]], said North had to pass a street called Baroda every day going to work and said, "I think that's how that was born."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Florence Blaustein | date = December 2, 2008 | title = Decoding "Klaatu Barada Nikto": Science Fiction as Metaphor | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1346880/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment | accessdate = July 15, 2010 | time = 0:14:47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian Steven Jay Rubin recalled an interview he had with North when he asked the question, "What is the direct translation of 'Klaatu barada nikto?' And Edmund North said to me, 'There's hope for Earth, if the scientists can be reached.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Steven Jay Rubin | date = December 2, 2008 | title = Decoding "Klaatu Barada Nikto": Science Fiction as Metaphor | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1346880/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment | accessdate = July 15, 2010 | time = 0:14:55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accepting the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998, Director Robert Wise closed his remarks by saying, "...I'd like to say 'Klaatu barada nikto', which, roughly translated tonight, means 'Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Robert Wise | date = 1998 | title = Director Robert Wise Accepts the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXbgrgrN7DA | accessdate = June 24, 2018 | time = 0:04:30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L'Élève Ducobu''''' is a [[comics|comic series]] created by Zidrou (scenario) and Godi (drawing). The series tells the adventures of Ducobu, a comic and eccentric [[dunce]]. The series first appeared in September 1992 in the Belgian comics magazine ''Tremplin''. The first album was published in 1997 by [[Le Lombard]] and from this year have appeared in the French comics magazine ''Le Journal de Mickey''.

==Style==
''L’élève Ducobu'' is an assortment of  [[gag]]s. Most of the story takes place at the Saint-Potache school, but some [[#Comic strip|strips]] deal with the main character's private life and take place at home. Other strips go back into the past of the characters. Each album generally begins with the start of the school year and ends with the summer holidays.

==Characters==
*'''L'élève Ducobu''': the main character of the series; a very inventive dunce and joker, he is very resourceful at finding new ways to copy from his neighbour, to cheat or to defy the teacher's authority. But he always fails and each of his examination papers is rated with a zero. He spends all his time either copying, cheating or reading ''Rik Spoutnik'', his favorite magazine, or in the corner of the classroom with a [[dunce cap]]. He wears a pullover with yellow and black stripes, which refers to the traditional prisoners' uniform.
*'''Léonie Gratin''', brilliant and gifted pupil and Ducobu's classroom neighbour; she continuously gets angry at all Ducobu's attempts to copy, but she sometimes naively feels some loving affection for him. She always gets a 10/10 mark, but occasionally fails owing to Ducobu's mischief, which explains why her overall score is never 10.
*'''Gustave Latouche''', a very strict teacher; he is very demanding of his pupils. He always keeps an eye on Ducobu and foils all his attempts to cheat or copy, and succeeds in avoiding all his traps. He is single and loses his mother in the course of the series.
*'''Néness''', the classroom anatomy [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]]; he stays all the day at the back of the classroom and waits for Ducobu to be sent to the corner. He is a joker and likes commenting on Ducobu's adventures, but he sympathizes with him and is ready to help or defend him.
*'''Rotule''': the skeleton of a small female dog which was abandoned by its masters going in holidays. It was offered by Ducobu to Néness so that he doesn't get bored during the holidays.
*Ducobu's father: a lazy and frivolous civil servant at the Ministry of Employment; he takes care alone of his son, his wife having left him when Ducobu was a baby.
*Léonie's mother, in charge of the perfume section in a [[department store]]. A single mother, she is extremely proud of her daughter and always praises her school results and her hard work. She dislikes the Ducobus and doesn't hesitate to criticize them.
*Saint-Potache's headteacher, liked by Mister Latouche.

==America==
In the US, ''Pingu'' was released on DVD on five single-disc sets from 2003 onwards. Although the original episodes are contained, there are some omissions:
* The original versions are not included in the sets, due to HiT Entertainment lending the remastered versions instead of the old versions.
* Some controversial episodes, most notably "Pingu's Lavatory Story", which was banned everywhere except the UK and Canada{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, are not included in the sets due to their perceived offensive material. 
** However, the frequently banned episode "Pingu Dreams" is present on the Antarctic Antics compilation.
*No episodes from seasons 3 or 4 are on the DVDs, but on the Antarctic Antics US tape, there is one season 3 episode, "Pingu's Long Journey". The episodes from those seasons were eventually released on Digital in America. Antarctic Antics was released on DVD, but is very hard to find on DVD, although it is easier to find in [[Canada]].

The '''Media Development Authority''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''MDA'''; {{zh|s=媒体发展管理局}}) was a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]] of the [[Singapore Government]], under the [[Ministry of Communications and Information]] (MCI).

==History==
MDA was formed on 1 January 2003 by the merger of Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA), the Films and Publications Department (FPD) and the Singapore Film Commission (SFC), in response to a national call to develop a globally competitive media industry in Singapore.  An industry blueprint called Media 21 was also drawn up and eventually endorsed by the 2002 Economic Review Committee (chaired by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong) –  as part of the Creative Industries Development Strategy to propel the growth of Singapore’s creative economy.

On 18 January 2016, [[Ministry of Communications and Information]] (MCI) announced that the '''[[Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore]] (IDA)''' and '''MDA''' will be restructured into two new entities: '''The Infocommunications Media Development Authority (IMDA)''' and the '''Government Technology Organisation (GTO)''', in the second half of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDA, MDA to be restructured to capitalise on converging media and ICT landscape|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ida-mda-to-be/2433768.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preceding statutory boards==

===Singapore Broadcasting Authority===
Prior to the merger, SBA, which was formed on October 1994 under the purview of the previous Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA), was set up to regulate the broadcasting industry in Singapore.

===Films and Publications Department===
FPD was set up as a department under the then MITA to regulate the content of films and publications on 1 January 1998. The Board of Film Censors was a part of the FPD, responsible for classification of films and videos.

===Singapore Film Commission===
Following the footsteps of film promotion in other countries, SFC was established on 1998. Following the release of the recommendations under Media 21, SFC was merged under the MDA in 2003.

==Roles of MDA==
The Media Development Authority is responsible for  promoting and regulating the Singapore media sector. MDA’s function is to grow the media industry by stimulating job creation, seeding and attracting investments, while  setting standards that  lay the foundation for building a cohesive and inclusive society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDA "About" Page|url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/AboutMDA/Pages/OverviewRolesAndOutcomes.aspx|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry Developer==
One of MDA’s key initiatives is to develop industry roadmaps that position Singapore as the nucleus where media content, services and applications are financed, made and traded for the world. Media 21 was the first roadmap established by MDA in 2003 in response to global media convergence. More recently,   the Singapore Media Fusion Plan (SMFP), a national media development blueprint, was launched in 2009  to  s create the best environment in Singapore for media businesses to exploit new opportunities in digital media and move up the value chain, while enhancing the global appeal of Singapore media through international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Media Fusion Plan launched to propel media sector forward|url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/NEWSANDEVENTS/PRESSRELEASE/2009/Pages/16062009a.aspx|work=MDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, MDA also revised its funding schemes. In 2013, it has five main schemes namely Production Assistance, Development Assistance, Marketing Assistance, Talent Assistance and Enterprise Assistance to help support different stages of a project. These schemes are applicable to projects across various sectors such as Film, Animation, Interactive media, Games, Publishing, Broadcast and Music.

==Next-Generation Media Regulator==
Another key responsibility of MDA is to create and enforce regulatory policies that make Singapore an attractive place to encourage investment and innovation in the media sector, leading to more choices for consumers.

Since the 1990s (under the purview of SBA) until now, it see itself leading the charge to address the latest challenges and opportunities faced by the media industry posed by media convergence and a digital media era through convergence regulation. For example, it was the first to articulate Internet policies and establish Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standards in Southeast Asia.

Its regulatory approach gradually shifted towards industry co-regulation and consultation to stimulate industry growth and yet serve the public interest for a maximum number of households in Singapore. Their focus appears to be to design policy frameworks that facilitate industry growth, whilst enabling informed choices and protecting the young from undesirable content.

A key challenge for the regulator is how to ensure its policies keep in-step with community values to bring about community-led content standards, whilst providing an excellent level of customer responsiveness to customers. Recent examples include the introduction of new ratings under their content classification standards (e.g. PG13), and previously SBA’s Class Licence Scheme.

Like regulators in developed countries like Australia and the UK, MDA works with other public agencies and various community groups to raise media literacy standards through public education initiatives to nurture a media savvy and connected society. MDA has initiated programmes that help to cultivate critical media awareness skills and cyber wellness values.

==Criticism==
[[Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore#Restrictions_on_freedom_of_speech_and_assembly|Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly]] are enforced by MDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety &amp; Security: Limitations of Civil Freedoms in Singapore|url=http://www.internations.org/singapore-expats/guide/16087-safety-security/limitations-of-civil-freedoms-in-singapore-16091|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the MDA withheld the licence for [[Benny Lim]]'s play ''Human Lefts'' unless some scenes were edited and all references to the death penalty removed. The play was originally written about the hanging of [[Shanmugam Murugesu]] and was to have been staged one day after the controversial execution of Australian national [[Nguyen Tuong Van]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, a play ''Smegma'' was banned by the MDA which said that "the play portrays Muslims in a negative light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=5 August 2006|url=http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-05T113612Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-262499-1.xml|title=Singapore bans play for negative portrayal of Muslims|agency=Reuters|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811232230/http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-05T113612Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-262499-1.xml|archivedate=11 August 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the MDA announced its new compulsory license scheme for news websites with significant reach that report Singapore news. These sites must put up a performance bond of S$50,000 and are expected to remove content that is in breach of MDA standards within 24 hours, once notified to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Tessa|title=MDA rolls out licence scheme for news websites|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mda-rolls-out-licence-scheme-for-news-websites|accessdate=23 June 2016|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was heavily criticised by more than 20 activists and bloggers who pointed out that the scheme would impact citizens’ ability to “receive diverse news information”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= MDA clarifies online news licensing scheme amid criticism|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/mda-clarifies-online-news-licensing-scheme-amid-criticism-031829941.html|accessdate=23 June 2016|agency=Yahoo Singapore|publisher=Yahoo|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, 45 major arts groups released a paper strongly objecting to MDA's proposed optional scheme to train arts practitioners as "content assessors" to ensure compliance with the authority's classification guidelines. Such practitioners whose groups' "content assessors" mis-classify performances would face a fine of up to $5,000, and may have their licences revoked. The arts groups rejected such "co-regulation" as promoting self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Corrie|title=Art of censorship in Singapore|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/art-of-censorship-in-singapore|accessdate=23 June 2016|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2014, [[Tan Pin Pin]]'s award-winning documentary ''[[To Singapore, With Love]]'' was banned in Singapore, with the MDA claiming that it undermined national security as "the individuals in the film have given distorted and untruthful accounts of how they came to leave Singapore and remain outside Singapore," and that "a number of these self-professed 'exiles' were members of, or had provided support to, the proscribed [[Malayan Communist Party|Communist Party of Malaya]] (CPM)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mokhtar|first1=Faris|title=The Media Development Authority (MDA) says the film is not allowed for all ratings as contents undermine national security.|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tan-pin-pin-s-film-to/1355208.html|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=Channel NewsAsia|date=10 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910201316/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tan-pin-pin-s-film-to/1355208.html|archivedate=10 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a group of 39 artists, including filmmakers [[Anthony Chen]], [[Royston Tan]] and [[Kelvin Tong]], released a joint statement expressing "deep disappointment" and urged the MDA to reverse the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nurul|first1=Azliah Aripin|title=Singapore arts community urges MDA to reconsider ban on Tan Pin Pin film|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-director-tan-pin-pin--disappointed--over-film-ban-120910886.html|accessdate=11 September 2014|agency=Yahoo News Singapore|publisher=Yahoo|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2014, Tan submitted ''To Singapore, With Love'', unchanged, to the MDA's Film Appeals Committee to review the film's ban. In a statement, Tan wrote, "As we approach our 50th birthday, I feel that we as a people should be able to view and weigh for ourselves, through legitimate public screenings in Singapore, differing views about our past, even views that the government disagrees with. I hope that Film Appeals Committee will see the film and review the classification in this light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Pin Pin|title=APPEAL SUBMITTED|url=https://www.facebook.com/tosingaporewithlove/posts/595382417239289|website=Facebook: To Singapore With Love|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2014, Tan's review was denied. In a statement, the chairman of the Film Appeals Committee (FAC) said, "While of commendable artistic standard, the FAC found the film to be a one-sided account with minimal attempts to provide a balanced mix of views beyond those provided by the interviewees featured in the film". Of the 12 FAC members present, nine voted to uphold the classification while the other three voted that the film be given a Restricted 21 (R21) rating instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nur Asyiqin Mohamad Salleh|title=Appeal to reclassify rating of To Singapore, With Love rejected|url=http://stcommunities.straitstimes.com/movies/2014/11/12/appeal-reclassify-rating-singapore-love-rejected|accessdate=12 November 2014|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the MDA objected to 31 photographs in Iranian photojournalist [[Newsha Tavakolian]]'s ''I Know Why the Rebel Sings'' exhibition, as part of the [[Singapore International Festival of the Arts]]'s pre-festival The O.P.E.N. programme, as they featured "female kurdish members from a terrorist-linked organisation, who had committed acts of violence to further their cause, for example suicide bombing." 15 of these photographs made it to the final cut of the exhibition and were disallowed. Festival director [[Ong Keng Sen]] issued a statement condemning MDA's explanation and pointing out that the photographs were already published in the readily accessible ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, both online and off. He also pointed out the photos depicted the kurdish soldiers fighting [[ISIS]], a greater evil. "And so we are living with a new terror where we don’t know, it is out of our control," he said at the exhibition's launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ng|first1=Yi-Sheng|title=Ong Keng Sen on censorship at Newsha Tavakolian's I Know Why the Rebel Sings|url=https://sifa.sg/sifa/blog/Ong-Keng-Sen-on-censorship-at-Newsha-Takavolians-I-Know-Why-the-Rebel-Sings/|website=SIFA|publisher=SIFA|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8598">A '''micro movie''' is a type of [[microcinema]] which refers to a short/micro film of any genre.

Micro movies originated in [[China]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Microfilm?|url=http://www.nottinghamscreenpartnership.com/index.php/events/what-is-microfilm|website=Nottingham Screen Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Mok]] (Hong Kong based singer/actress) and Adam Duke starred in "[[Cadillac (micro movie)|Cadillac]]," which is regarded as the first micro movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wenpeng|first1=Hu|title=Micro-film advertising getting popular|url=http://en.ce.cn/Insight/201201/11/t20120111_22991381.shtml|website=China Economic Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, micro movies became a trend in South Asia. As professional-grade technology has become more accessible, amateurs hoping to enter the film industry have turned to the micro movie format to avoid limitations imposed by television and film studios. The accessibility of production, along with a growing popularity, has led to a wide range of subjects being featured and examined in the micro movie format.

==Characteristics==

==Censorship==
[[Movie censorship]] is the legal process that regulates whether a movie, film, video, or cinema has content that is permissible to undergo broadcast and distribution. While certain movies are permitted to undergo public disbursement and release, other types of movies are limited to private screenings&amp;mdash;in certain cases, movies are prohibited and banned in their entirety. Movie censorship regulation takes length, content, and subject matter into consideration with regard to altering or banning the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://censorship.laws.com/movie-censorship|title=Movie Censorship - Censorship {{!}} Laws.com|website=censorship.laws.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obscene and violent content is avoided in the process of making micro movies due to national [[censorship]] policies.

In [[Hong Kong]], all films are required to undergo the motion picture rating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Division|url=http://www.ofnaa.gov.hk/eng/aboutus/aboutus4b_2.htm|website=Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration|publisher=Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is organized by the Office for Film Newspaper and Article Administration (OFNAA). Movies are rated I, IIA, IIB, or III. Scenes deemed to be unacceptable are censored. The [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television|Chinese State Administration of Press, Publication, Video, Film and Television]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Lilian|title=China Is Decentralizing Movie Censorship. But Will It Make a Difference?|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/03/17/china-is-decentralizing-movie-censorship-but-will-it-make-a-difference/|accessdate=17 March 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; oversees the theatrical release, to ensure that immoral content is not promoted in the movies. The goal of these measures is to protect the audience from receiving extreme and unhealthy messages.

In [[Australia]], The Office of Film and Literature Classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Jackson|title=Censorship and Classification in Australia|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/archive/censorshipebrief|website=Parliament of Australia|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=19 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for classifying films, [[video]] publications, and [[PC games]] according to the National Classification Code and the Classification Guidelines, which are approved by the Commonwealth State and Territory Ministers responsible for censorship.

There is, however, more leniency in censorship online&amp;mdash;especially on [[YouTube]]. That is why most micro movies are accessed through social media websites and online databases. Some countries even block all internet access to YouTube.

==Cinematography==
[[File:Cinematography.jpg|thumbnail]]
Micro movies are created by cinematographers of all skill levels, ranging from a first-time producer to a high-level producer with a top-level cast and crew.

Film techniques used in micro movies are similar to those of traditional movies seen in theaters. For instance, the types of shots and angles are the same, but they typically differ in film length, equipment level, budget, number of cast and crew, and acting skill. There are, however, exceptions to the rule such as the group [http://www.rocketjump.com/ Rocket Jump] or prime-time TV commercials.

==Application==
Micro movies are used for [[advertising]] and entertainment purposes. The short length of micro movies allows them to be promoted and published on platforms such as [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. This makes micro movies free, easy to access, and able to go viral online.

There are both [[commerce|commercial]] and noncommercial needs for micro movies. Commercials are now not only selling a product, but telling a story&amp;mdash; the [http://www.budweiser.com/en/our-ads.html Budweiser] and [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyxbX78CiDDYsVU21omaJw/ Extra Gum] commercials are examples of this. Micro movies have become a new way to promote products and brands. People are also now creating and shooting micro movies for fun. There are several micro movie film festivals and platforms for both amateurs and professionals to tell their stories and be recognized for their work.

A '''paintings conservator''' is an individual responsible for protecting [[cultural heritage]] in the form of painted works of art. These individuals are most often under the employ of [[museums]], [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] centers, or other cultural institutions.  They oversee the physical care of collections, and are trained in chemistry and practical application of techniques for repairing and restoring paintings.

==Responsibilities and duties==

===Collaboration===
A paintings conservator works with a number of museum professionals to ensure painted works of art receive the best quality of care.  This individual may be called upon by a Registrar/Collections Manager (RCM) in the event of an emergency, such as accidental damage.  A paintings conservator may also be called upon to consult with the RCM and an [[exhibition]] design team to ensure a work is stable enough for display, and determine how much exposure to environmental factors, such as humidity or light, it can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Gilmore, J. A. (2010). MRM5: Museum registration methods (5th ed.). Washington, DC: AAM Press, American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive care===
Preventive care is the abating of potential deterioration and damage to a painting through previously designated policies and procedures surrounding the object's storage and handling.

====Emergency preparedness====

Emergency preparedness and an emergency plan are crucial pieces to have in place for a museum.  It informs conservators, RCMs, and all other museum personnel how to respond to disasters that may strike their institution, and therefore its collections.  These plans can be expansive, detailing a number of procedures for different contingencies, such as fire, flooding, and even war.  Protective measures in an emergency plan should include prevention through risk management, preparedness and response training, and recovery arrangements.  An institution should know which staff member's are delegated to a project during a given circumstance, and be able to tell them how they will assess and move forward with the help of an emergency plan.&lt;ref&gt;Dorge, V., &amp; Jones, S. L. (1999). Building an emergency plan: A guide for museums and other cultural institutions. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated pest management (IPM)====
{{Main|Museum integrated pest management}}

Integrated pest management (IPM) is the strategy used by a museum to handle pests such as mold, insects, or mice.  An IPM program may address structural and environmental issues that contribute to the pest problem.  This could include preventing initial entry of pests into the structure through building maintenance, moderating the interior climate, and setting up an insect monitoring system.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. (n.d.). Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Retrieved from https://peabody.harvard.edu/node/275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like an emergency plan, IPM can be time-consuming and require a number of responsibilities from each staff member.  However, if pests do become an issue for a single painting or the entire museum, an IPM system will be helpful to have in place.  Prevention is a key part of IPM, as chemical pesticides and fumigants can also be harmful to collections.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins Arenstein, R., Duncan, N., Elkin, L., Monk, R., &amp; Norris, C. (2008). Bitten by the bug: The Integrated Pest Management Working Group's collaborative approach to providing IPM resources to the museum community. AIC Objects Specialty Group Postprints, 15, 69-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Storage, handling, and loan travel====

Inter-museum loans can put paintings at great risk, simply due to the fact that they are being moved.  The amount of stress a painting can withstand is determined by a number of pre-existing factors, such as canvas and painting technique.  Prior to the loan, a paintings conservator will assess the structure of the work for weaknesses and potential areas at risk.  This helps determine if a piece is suitable for a loan and how it will be packed and transported.  Preparation for a loaned painting generally involves padding the work's frame and ensuring it is properly mounted, determination as to whether it will need a backing board, and what repairs the frame may need prior to transport. The paintings conservator may also be called upon to collaborate with other personnel from the loaning museum to assess the environment of the institution that is borrowing the work.  He or she may also take into consideration the travel route between the loaning and the borrowing institutions.  The transit planner must consider environmental conditions on the route, how often the work will need to be handled, and security.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, M., Mecklenburg, M. F., &amp; Merrill, R. M. (1991). Art in transit: Handbook for packing and transporting paintings. Washington: National Gallery of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examination===
[[File:Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston.jpg|thumb|left|Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston]]
Examination is a series of scientific processes by which a paintings conservator collects information regarding the materials used, the technique of the painter, and what has contributed to the painting's current state.  Examination is a process that has evolved with the field of conservation.  Taking samples of materials in a painting has decreased in favor of less invasive techniques for analysis.  Examination has become a crucial part of the museum, conservation, and art historical worlds, helping to place paintings within a cultural and historical context.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences. (2005). Scientific examination of art: Modern techniques in conservation and analysis. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
{{Main|Art restoration}}

A painting's natural aging process, as well as environmental factors, can require intervention by a paintings conservator to restore the work.  Reasons for restoration may include water damage, tearing, flaking, and a weakened canvas.  The primary goal of a paintings conservator conducting a restoration is to ensure the work is stable.  From there, they may integrate repairs that preserve the artist's original intent.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). What Does It Mean To Have A Painting Restored And How Do I Pick A Conservator? Retrieved from http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/conservation_meaning.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation and uses==

===Imaging methods===

'''Ultraviolet light'''

Ultraviolet light examinations are used to reveal varnishes and their ages, as well as previous treatments to a painting.  Varnishes fluoresce under UV light and dark spots reveal areas of retouching.  Brightness of the painting's glow also helps to reveal the type of varnish used.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. (2000, December). The use Of ultraviolet induced visible-fluorescence In the examination Of museum objects, Part II. Conserve O Gram, 1/10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The paintings conservation laboratory at the [[Lunder Conservation Center]]]]
'''Raking Light'''
{{Main|Raking light}}

Raking light is an oblique-angled light that can record condition problems of a painting, showing the extent of the damage to a particular work.  Raking light also aids in identifying the topography of brush strokes in paintings, sometimes revealing the underlying original intent of an artist.

'''Infrared light'''

The use of infrared lighting can reveal the working methods of an artist, such as initial sketches and perspective lines drawn on a canvas.  This method is effective on works that have a contrasting pale ground.&lt;ref&gt;Williamstown Art Conservation Center. (2008). Technical Imaging of Paintings [Brochure]. Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-radiography'''

X-radiographs of a painting allow conservators to see beneath the work's surface.  The use of this method also helps distinguish between materials that look similar under visible light, but have different x-ray absorption. For example, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] used x-radiography on a painting by [[Jean-Francois Millet]] entitled ''The Wood Sawyers.''  The image below showed a woman representing the French Republic, a submission to a competition that Millet would lose.  Without the means to pay for a new canvas, Millet painted over the existing image.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum. (n.d.). X-radiography of paintings. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/x/x-radiography-of-paintings/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasers===
The use of lasers allows for control and accuracy in the removal of aged or deteriorated layers on painted works, as well as identifying materials and layers within a painting.  In 2012, Duke University scientists developed a laser for melanoma diagnoses.  Through work with the [[National Gallery]] and the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], the scientists have determined that this laser can also be used to identify the chemical signatures of pigments and three-dimensional structures in layers of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Yeager, A. (2012, August 20). Duke Research - Lasers ID ancient artists' intent. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://research.duke.edu/stories/chemists-lasers-could-id-ancient-artists-intent |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821211051/http://research.duke.edu/stories/chemists-lasers-could-id-ancient-artists-intent |archivedate=2012-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Duke University chemist also invented a useful laser for painting conservators that removes layers of old varnish.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, R. (2013, August 9). Art Under the Laser – New "Noninvasive" Conservation and Analysis Treatments. Retrieved from http://artwatchinternational.org/articles/art_under_the_laser&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varnishes===
Varnishes are applied to paintings to enhance the appearance of the image, as well as to protect it over time.  When dry, varnishes are typically transparent and can vary in gloss and durability as its composition changes.  Varnishes may be organic or synthetic.  Since natural varnishes tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). Painting varnishes. Retrieved from http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/painting_varnish.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new varnish.  Varnishes often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally natural resin provided.

==Education and training==
[[File:Бобров Ф.Ю со студентами. 2010 г..jpg|thumb|Paintings conservators at work]]
A paintings conservator will likely have acquired a master's degree, or higher.  There are several graduate programs throughout the United States, and the world, for arts [[conservation and restoration training]].  The education and training of a conservator will vary depending on the institution he or she is employed by, but paintings conservators will have knowledge of chemistry and the physical sciences as related to the deterioration and protection of cultural heritage in painted works.  Practical application of training may be applied in the form of internships or fellowships, depending on the level of education an individual has received.

==Controversies==

Conservation and the practice of restoration are controversial themselves, as they involve permanent changes made to an artist's work.  This is why it is important for a paintings conservator to examine a work closely before making restorative changes.  In doing so, they can often identify original varnishes and layers that contributed to the artist's intent for the appearance of the work.  However, even close examination and careful restoration does not protect a paintings conservator or a work from being the center of controversy.

===Sistine Chapel restoration===
{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}

Restoration of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has been ongoing during the latter part of the twentieth century.  Much of the criticism and controversy surrounding the restoration is that previous attempts to restore the frescoes have done more damage than good.  Critics of modern restoration have suggested a more conservative approach to prevent further deterioration, rather than contribute to its problems through restorative measures.

===''The Last Supper''===

Restoration on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Last Supper (da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' finished in 1999 after two decades of work.  Many believe the work done was clumsy, with some features being unrecognizably bright while others went missing altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Restored `Last Supper' Provokes Critics. (1999, May 28). Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-28/news/9905280144_1_restoration-masterpiece-grazie-church&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santuario de la Misericordia Fresco===
{{main|Ecce Homo (Martínez and Giménez, Borja)}}
In 2012, Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman without conservation training, attempted to restore an ''Ecce Homo'' fresco in a Spanish church.  The fresco had been flaking due to moisture on the walls, and this reportedly upset the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Minder, R. (2012, August 23). Despite Good Intentions, a Fresco in Spain Is Ruined. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/world/europe/botched-restoration-of-ecce-homo-fresco-shocks-spain.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her resulting restorative work left the portrait with what many have described as looking monkeyish, with cartoonish eyes and a smudged mouth.  The restoration attempt came to light after a family member of the original artist proposed a fund for conservation work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9131">'''Prostitution in Estonia''' is legal in itself, but organized prostitution is illegal.  Since [[prostitution]] is a sensitive indicator that develops with changes in the social environment and the state, it is useful to divide the history of this phenomenon from [[Estonia]]'s first independence according to the different historical stages of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prostitution in Estonia |work=EQUAL |date= |url=http://www.tai.ee/failid/Prostitution_in_Estonia._ingl.pdf |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930213904/http://www.tai.ee/failid/Prostitution_in_Estonia._ingl.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, the period of [[Estonian War of Independence|Estonian independence]] 1918-1940, when the prostitution in Estonia was legalized. Secondly, the period of the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] when prostitution was criminalized. Thirdly, since [[Singing Revolution|Estonian new independence]] when prostitution is neither criminalized nor legalized (that is, the selling of and buying of a sexual service is not a crime but prostitution is not considered a profession either).

==Period 1918-1940==

===Legal issues===
On the first of June 1919, so-called morality guarding, or censoring institution in the bigger cities replaced censoring police. Attitudes to the organization of prostitution derived mainly from health considerations. That was not sufficiently successful and in May 1920, obligatory measures to fight prostitution and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STD) were issued. Those regulations linked the activities of the “morality guards” to the activities of police, as it was realized that prostitution and criminality were“closely connected’.
On the 16 of December 1927 the Parliament accepted a new law of “Managing Public Health” which handed the fight against prostitution over to the Health and Social Support Department. The police were obliged to give necessary practical help.

===Statistics===
Because prostitution was legal in 1918-1940, the data from that period is remarkably precise and allows giving an adequate overview of the phenomenon. The number of prostitutes had been relatively stable throughout that period, showing only a slight increase.
For instance, in 1919 and 1920, there were 1187 and 1141 registered prostitutes in Estonian cities, and the number remained the same until the 1930s.
Prostitution mainly spread in the greater cities, [[Tallinn]] and [[Tartu]], but also in [[Narva]] and [[Pärnu]]. The proportion in other cities was very modest. There were 387 permanent prostitutes registered in Tallinn in 1920, and 455 in 1940. In Tartu, the numbers were 53 in 1922 and 156 in 1938.
There were also illegal, unregistered individual prostitutes of whom there is very little and non-systematic data. In the mid-1920s the number of Estonian hidden prostitutes was estimated to be up to 2000-2500. Police measures were predominantly directed to uncovering and registering this contingent, because unlike the registered prostitutes, neither unofficial prostitute nor their clients went through regular medical check-ups.

Prostituting took place mainly in “pleasure flats” where the woman was operating as a “free tenant”. Each of these apartments had approximately 4-9 women. In 1940, there were 47 of such apartments registered. The majority (90%) of Tallinn prostitutes in the beginning of the 1920s were Estonians, 8% were [[Russians]] and the rest other nationalities. Thirty per cent were up to 20 years old, but the largest group was 20–25 years old (about 50%) and 26–30 years old were represented at around 15%. About 30% were born in Tallinn, 60% from elsewhere in Estonia and about 10% from abroad.

==Soviet period==
Along with Estonia's occupation by the [[Soviet Union]], attitudes to prostitution changed drastically. Legalization of prostitution was replaced by total denial and was made criminal. For instance, Tallinn City Moral Censoring Unit and Ambulatory of STDs which had been controlling the prostitutes and their health, was now liquidated on the 16 of November 1940, only a few months after occupation. Prostitutes who were registered at the police were repressed as “socially alien beings” and were listed, along with thousands of other people, to be deported from Estonia in 1941.

During the Soviet period, [[pornography]], prostitution and organizing prostitution were criminalized and belonged to the phenomena called parasitic lifestyle. There were three relevant paragraphs in the Criminal Law: Criminal Code of Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR) (paragraph 200) - preparing or distributing a pornographic item; paragraph 201 - keeping a brothel; paragraph 201-3 - begging, vagrant or the parasitic lifestyle.

[[Pimp]]ing was not considered in the Criminal Law of ESSR. In reality those paragraphs that were related to prostitution were hardly ever used. The reason was absence of prostitution as a mass phenomenon in Soviet Estonia and indifference to it from that part of the government. In Tallinn, only a type of systematically operating prostitutes existed - the so-called “foreign currency prostitutes” who were only serving foreigners. Since the [[KGB]] kept a vigilant eye on foreigners, the activities of those prostitutes were only feasible with the knowledge and control of this structure. There are some reasons to suggest that some prostitutes serving foreigners were used as informants by the KGB.

==Post-Soviet period==
Certain changes started in the mid-1980s when the first signs of private businesses emerged. That also brought along differentiation of incomes. The increase in the relations with foreigners had a great impact on the following processes. Due to the rise in prostitution, a new administrative liability for the activity was introduced in 1987. In 1998, the police registered over 268 females who had been caught performing sexual services for money in hostels and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jury |url=http://www.policy.hu/kalikov/ESTONIA.html |title=Estonia |publisher=Policy.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution is currently legal in [[Estonia]], but [[pimping]] is prohibited.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100557.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2008: Estonia].

==Child prostitution==
An inquiry by police officers in the capital [[Tallinn]] estimated that 27% of the 1,000 sex workers in the city were under 18, and a research study by [[ECPAT]] has estimated a similar proportion within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Monitoring on Child Exploitation |work=[[ECPAT]] |date= |url=http://www.ecpat.net/A4A_2005/PDF/Europe/Global_Monitoring_Report-ESTONIA.pdf |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611224252/http://www.ecpat.net/A4A_2005/PDF/Europe/Global_Monitoring_Report-ESTONIA.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
Estonia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Estonian women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within Estonia and in other European countries. Women are increasingly exposed to trafficking as a result of sham marriages outside of Estonia; the women enter the marriages willingly, but their passports are confiscated and they are forced into prostitution. Stateless residents in Estonia were especially vulnerable to trafficking. Vietnamese nationals subjected sexual exploitation transit Estonia en route to other EU countries.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Estonia 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282652.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Estonia as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

[[File:Radio Monte Carlo.png|thumb]]
'''Radio Monte Carlo''' (RMC) is the name of radio stations owned and managed by several different entities:

*'''[[RMC (France)]]''' is a [[French language|French-speaking]] station, broadcasting in [[France]] and [[Monaco]] owned by [[NextRadioTV]].
*'''Radio Monte Carlo Network''' is an [[Italian language|Italian-speaking]] station, broadcasting in [[Italy]] and [[Monaco]] from both [[Monaco]] and [[Milan]]. Owned by Alberto Hazan who continued to be the owner, while his other radiostations have been sold to [[Mediaset]] with whom Radio Monte Carlo has a partnership. Radio Monte Carlo was founded in 1966 by Noel Cutisson and its enlisted deejays included: Antonio Devia, Awanagana, Ettore Andenna, Gigi Salvadori, Herbert Pagani, Liliana Dell'Acqua, Luisella Berrino, Manuela De Vito, Marco Odino, Mario Raffaele Conti, Max Pagani, Riccardo Heinen, Roberto Arnaldi, Valeria Porrà, and others.

*'''Radio Monte Carlo (Uruguay)''' - Montevideo, Uruguay is a Spanish-speaking station broadcast on 930AM.
*'''Radio Monte Carlo (Georgia)'''

==Perception==

Radio Monte Carlo is considered one of the most popular networks especially in non-[[Europe]]an [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]]-speaking regions for its assumed neutrality. During the [[Iraq War]], it was mentioned by some journalists as a reliable source.{{whom|date=May 2017}}
Radio Monte Carlo was founded by the Nazis in March 1942, ceased transmission in June 1944 and was back on the air with American help as a joint venture with the Principality of [[Monaco]] in August 1944. In 1998, the French government sold its share to a private holding group made up of Sud Radio and la Depeche du Midi.

==Broadcasts in other languages==

Radio Monte Carlo's transmission network includes some high power Longwave and Mediumwave transmitters located at [[Roumoules]] in France. For many years the MW unit has been hired out at nighttime to the [[Middle East Reformed Fellowship]] through [[Trans World Radio]], with programming in various languages including Arabic and English. In 1970, RMC's transmitters were also used by the short lived British commercial album station [[Radio Geronimo]].

==''The World Tomorrow'' broadcast==

During the late 1950s ''[[The World Tomorrow (1934)|The World Tomorrow]]'' radio broadcast of [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] was carried by Radio Monte Carlo in the English, Spanish and Russian languages. Armstrong claimed that while the ''[[Voice of America]]'' was [[radio jamming|jammed]] by the [[Soviet Union]], his Russian-language broadcast was heard loud and clear in [[Moscow]]. The Medium wave transmitter of RMC carries mostly [[Trans World Radio]] programming during evening hours.

[[File:Rupert D'Oyly Carte.jpg|right|upright=1|thumb|Rupert D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Rupert D'Oyly Carte''' (3 November 1876 – 12 September 1948) was an English hotelier, theatre owner and [[impresario]], best known as proprietor of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and [[Savoy Hotel]] from 1913 to 1948.

Son of the impresario and hotelier [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], Rupert inherited the family businesses from his stepmother [[Helen Carte|Helen]].  After serving in [[World War I]], he took steps to revitalise the opera company, which had not appeared in Central London since 1909, hiring new designers and conductors to present fresh productions of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas in seasons in the [[West End theatre|West End]].  The new productions generally retained the original text and music of the operas.  Carte launched international and provincial tours, as well as the London seasons, and he released the first complete recordings of the operas.  He also rebuilt the half-century-old [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1929, opening the house with a season of Gilbert and Sullivan.

As an hotelier, Carte built on his father's legacy, expanding the [[Savoy Hotel]], refreshing the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group, including [[Claridges|Claridge's]] and the [[The Berkeley|Berkeley Hotel]], and introducing cabaret and dance bands that became internationally famous.  He also increased marketing activities, including foreign marketing, of the hotels.

[[P. G. Wodehouse]] based a character in his novels, [[Psmith]], on a [[Winchester College|Wykehamist]] schoolboy whom he identified as Rupert D'Oyly Carte.  At his death, Carte passed the opera company and hotels to his only surviving child, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].  The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.

==Life and career==
[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rupert's father, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]]]

===Early life===
Rupert D'Oyly Carte was born in [[Hampstead]], London, the younger son of the impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and his first wife Blanche (née Prowse), who died in 1885.  Like his brother, Lucas (1872–1907), he was given his father's middle name.  He was educated at [[Winchester College]], noted as among the most intellectually rigorous of English public schools.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Financial Times'', 16 August 2008, p. 1; and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 31 May 2009, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then worked for a firm of accountants before joining his father as an assistant in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html "The D'Oyly Carte Family"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220163843/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html |date=20 February 2005 }} page, at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'' states that Rupert attended [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], but if he did so, he did not graduate, if the above dates, taken from ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'', are correct.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newspaper interview given in the year of his death, Rupert recalled that as a young man he was entrusted, during his father's illness, with helping [[W. S. Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948.  The newspaper report states that this was when he was 22, but the first revival of ''Yeomen'' was in May 1897, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte was only 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a director of the [[Savoy Hotel]] Limited in 1898, joining his father and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]], who had served on the board since the Savoy Hotel was built.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 11 May 1949, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1899 he was assistant managing director.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 June 1899, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and Rupert's stepmother, the former [[Helen Lenoir]], who had married Richard in 1888, assumed full control of most of the family businesses, which she had increasingly controlled during her husband's decline.  Rupert's elder brother, Lucas, a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis, aged 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was educated at [[Winchester College]] and then [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], and was called to the bar in 1897.  He was appointed Private Secretary to [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] in 1899 and died of tuberculosis on 18 January 1907.  See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking over the family businesses===
In 1903, at the age of 27, Rupert took over his late father's role as chairman of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, [[Claridges|Claridge's]], [[The Berkeley|The Berkeley Hotel]], [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]] and the Grand Hotel in Rome.  At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;''The Times'', 21 February 1903, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He immediately issued £300,000 of [[debenture]]s to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the "East Block").&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;  Like his father, Carte was willing to go to great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels.  When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris.  The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous ''maître d'hôtel'', M. Joseph, a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert carte 1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Carte in 1919]]
Between 1906 and 1909, Helen Carte,&lt;ref&gt;Helen had remarried [[Stanley Boulter]], but was generally still known as "Carte" in business.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert's stepmother, staged two repertory seasons at the [[Savoy Theatre]].  Directed by Gilbert and received with much success, they revitalised the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], which had been in decline after Richard D'Oyly Carte's death.&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, when theatre censorship was under discussion in Britain, Carte was strongly in favour of retaining censorship, because it gave managements complete certainty about what they could or could not stage without fear of interference by the police or others.  He joined with other London theatre managers, including [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[George Edwardes]] and [[Arthur Bourchier]] in signing a petition for the retention of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 April 1912, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, together with [[Herbert Sullivan]] and theatre managers including Beerbohm Tree and [[Squire Bancroft]], Carte was an instigator of a memorial to [[W. S. Gilbert]] at Charing Cross.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 June 1912, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, Rupert's stepmother Helen Carte died.  She left all her holdings in the Savoy Hotel group, the Savoy Theatre and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to her stepson.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 May 1913, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalising the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company===
After London seasons in 1906–07 and 1908–09, the opera company did not perform in the [[West End theatre|West End]] again until 1919, although it continued to tour in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The company toured for ten months per year.  Its outer London engagements in these years were in [[Camden Town]], [[Clapham]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Deptford]], [[Fulham]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[Kennington]], New Cross, [[Notting Hill]], [[Peckham]], Richmond, Stratford, Wimbledon and [[Woolwich]].  See Rollins and Witts.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, "Through the years of the [[Great War]] they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere.  They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory."&lt;ref&gt;Walbrook, H. M. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap16.html Chapter 16,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment'', (1920) London: F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, "I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London.  I thought the dresses looked dowdy....  I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a décor attractive to the new generation."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 430; Reprinted in [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html "Rupert D'Oyly Carte's Season ... 1919-20"], at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 1922 memoir, [[Henry Lytton]], having admired Richard D'Oyly Carte's keen eye for stagecraft, added, "That 'eye' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son, Mr. Rupert D'Oyly Carte.  He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance, and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected".&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html Chapter 4,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922), online at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, the company hired [[J. M. Gordon]] as stage manager, and Carte later promoted him to director.  Gordon, under Carte's supervision, preserved the company's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J. M. Gordon] at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1919-20season.jpg|thumb|300px|Souvenir programme cover – 1919-20 season]]
During [[World War I]] Carte served in the [[Royal Navy]],&lt;ref name=centenary&gt;Bettany, Clemence.  ''The D'Oyly Carte Centenary Book'', a souvenir book published by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company during its 1975 centenary season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;/ref&gt; and no renovation work could be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;During the war, Carte served as a [[King's Messenger]].  See Duffey, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/carte.html "The D'Oyly Carte Family",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220163843/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html |date=20 February 2005 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 20 September 2003, accessed 12 November 2009.  Baily states that, during the war, "Carte was on special duties in the Navy: he would be sent off on secret journeys to distant parts of the world, and he would mysteriously reappear in London for a few weeks, and when he did so he would put in a few touches to the preparatory work for the rebirth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company."  Baily, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return, he put his aims into effect.  In an interview in ''[[The Observer]]'' in August 1919 he set out his policy for staging the operas: "They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 August 1919, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, "the plays are all being restaged ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them.  Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days."&lt;ref name=centenary/&gt;

Carte's first London season, at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]], 1919–20, featured ten of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref&gt;Carte's first London season did not include ''[[Ruddigore]]'', ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' and ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which had its first London performances since the original production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html Information about the 1919-20 season] at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 January 2009.  In a last-night speech at the end of the 1924 London season, Carte said that he hoped to revive ''Utopia, Limited'' in 1925.  See ''The Times'' 28 July 1924, p. 10.  The opera was not, however, revived until 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction.  As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the [[J. C. Williamson]] company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy "tradition" was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: "It did not by any means imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression.  All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation....  Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case.  He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 10 April 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had told the press that the original words and music would not be altered, Carte was willing to make changes in certain cases.  In 1919–20, he authorised significant cuts and alterations in both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore''. In 1921 ''[[Cox and Box]]'' was produced in a drastically cut-down version, to allow it to be played as a companion piece with the shorter [[Savoy operas]]. He also authorised changes to Gilbert's text: he wrote to ''The Times'' in 1948, "We found recently in America that much objection was taken by coloured persons to a word used twice in ''The Mikado''."  The word in question was Gilbert's reference to "nigger" (blackface) minstrels, and Carte asked [[A. P. Herbert]] to suggest an acceptable revision.  "He made several alternative suggestions, one of which we adopted in America, and it seems well to go on doing so in the British Empire."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 28 May 1945, p. 8. A similar reference in ''Princess Ida'' was also altered.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D'oyly-carte-the-joy-of-three-generations-1921.jpg|thumb|left|1921 cartoon: D'Oyly Carte audiences]]
Carte commissioned new costumes and scenery throughout his tenure with the company.  For his restagings, Carte hired [[Charles Ricketts]] to redesign ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', the costumes for the latter, created in 1926, being retained by all the company's subsequent designers. Other redesigns were by [[Percy Anderson]], [[George Sheringham]], [[Hugo Rumbold]] and [[Peter Goffin]], a protégé of Carte's daughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].

For London seasons, Carte often engaged guest conductors, first [[Geoffrey Toye]], then [[Malcolm Sargent]], who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions.  So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error.  In a letter to ''The Times'', he noted that "the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new ... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan."&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Rupert D'Oyly, ''The Times'', 22 September 1926, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also hired [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.  [[Isidore Godfrey]] joined the company as assistant musical director in 1925 and became musical director in 1929, remaining in that post until 1968.

The possibilities of the [[Gramaphone record|gramophone]] appealed to Carte.  After World War I, he supervised a series of complete recordings of the scores of the operas on the [[HMV]] label, beginning with ''The Mikado'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan songs had been made as early as the 1890s (Joseph, p. 220), and there were several complete or nearly-complete operas recorded in the early years of the twentieth century, not under D'Oyly Carte auspices.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first nine sets, made between 1918 and 1925, were recorded by the early [[Gramophone record#Acoustic recording|acoustic process]]. At first, guest singers were chosen who were known for their ability to record well on this technology.  Later in this series, more of the regular members of the company were featured.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narracou-doc.htm "The First D'Oyly Carte Recordings",] ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the introduction of [[Gramophone record#"Electrical" recording|electrical recording]] and its greatly improved recording process and sound, a new round of recordings began in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narrelec-cmpl.htm "The D'Oyly Carte Complete Electrical Sets",] ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the electrical series, Carte's own singers were mostly used.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. XI–XII.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also recognised the potential of radio and worked with the [[BBC]] to relay live broadcasts of D'Oyly Carte productions.  A 1926 relay of part of a Savoy Theatre performance of ''The Mikado'' was heard by up to eight million people.  The ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' noted that this was "probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Carte, the company continued to make broadcasts during the interwar years.  In 1932, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Chris.

===Rebuilding the Savoy Theatre and later years===
In 1929 Carte had the 48-year-old Savoy Theatre rebuilt and modernised.  It closed on 3 June 1929 and was gutted and completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by [[Basil Ionides]].  The old house had three tiers; the new one had two.  The seating capacity (which had decreased to 986 from its original 1,292) was restored nearly completely, to 1,200.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 October 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Theatre programme note, September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Gondoliers]],'' designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1929/index.html Information about the 1929-20 season and the new designs,] ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Ernest Newman]] wrote, "I can imagine no gayer or more exhilarating frame for the Gilbert and Sullivan operas than the Savoy as it is now."&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in Baily, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its historical connection with Gilbert and Sullivan, most of Carte's London seasons were staged not at the Savoy but at two larger houses: the Prince's (now the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Shaftesbury]]) Theatre (1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, 1926, 1942 and [[Sadler's Wells]] (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947 and 1948).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 136–72&lt;/ref&gt;   His three Savoy Theatre seasons were in 1929–30, 1932–33, and 1941.  In addition to year-round UK tours, Carte mounted tours of North America in 1927, 1928–29, 1934–35, 1936–37, 1939 and 1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 153–72&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1936 tour an American critic wrote, "If there were only some way of keeping them on this side permanently. I humbly suggest to the [[New Deal]] that it cancel England's war debt in exchange for the D'Oyly Cartians. We should be much the gainer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Philadelphia Public Ledger'', ''quoted'' in Baily, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was deeply affected by the death of his son Michael in 1932, discussed below.  The actor [[Martyn Green]] said, "The heart dropped right out of him.  His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 219, ''quoting'' [[Martyn Green]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing [[Henry Lytton]].&lt;ref name=Wilson128&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of ''The Mikado'' produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures,&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikfilm.htm "The Technicolor ''Mikado'' Film (1939)",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616150713/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikfilm.htm |date=16 June 2006 }} ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' (2001), accessed 20 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but his only new stage production after 1932 was of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' designed in 1939 by [[Peter Goffin]]. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, "I don't care what they say about the production. I should care if they said nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of [[World War II]], the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres.  Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 September 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; but it took some weeks to re-form the company.  The company resumed touring in [[Edinburgh]] on Christmas Day 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  It continued to perform throughout the war, but German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its productions: ''Cox and Box'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'' and ''Ruddigore''.  The old productions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Cox and Box'' were recreated shortly after the war, but the other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory.&lt;ref&gt;''Pinafore'' re-entered the repertory in July 1947, ''Cox and Box'' in the 1947–48 season, ''Ruddigore'' in November 1948, and ''Princess Ida'' in September 1954 (see Rollins and Witts, pp. 171-79 and VII-VIII).  ''The Sorcerer'' was not revived until April 1971 (see ''The Times'', 2 April 1971, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, for the first wartime season, Peter Goffin designed and directed a new production of ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' first seen in January 1940, and his new ''Ruddigore'' debuted in 1948, shortly after Carte's death.  A return of the Company to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful.&lt;ref name=Wilson128/&gt;

===Savoy Hotel group===
From the beginning of his career, Carte maintained the Savoy group in London, disposing in 1919 of the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 July 1896, p. 4; and 20 December 1919, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants.  The [[Savoy Orpheans]] and the [[Savoy Havana Band]] were described by ''The Times'' as "probably the best-known bands in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 29 March 1924, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927 Carte appointed his opera company's general manager, Richard Collet, to run the cabaret at the Savoy, which began in April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1929, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1930s, the Savoy group had not thought it necessary to advertise, but Carte and his manager [[George Reeves-Smith]] changed their approach.  Reeves-Smith told ''The Times'', "We are endeavouring by intensive propaganda work to get more customers; this work is going on in the U.S.A., in Canada, in the Argentine and in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1931, p. 22; and 22 April 1932, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of [[World War II]], Carte added to the Savoy group the bombed-out site near [[Leicester Square]] of Stone's Chop House, the freehold of which he purchased with a view to reopening the restaurant there on the lines of the group's Simpson's-in-the-Strand.  The revived Stone's reopened after Carte's death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 April 1946, p. 9; and 14 October 1963, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1907, Carte married Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the third and youngest daughter of the [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook|2nd Earl of Cranbrook]], with whom he had a daughter, Bridget, and a son, Michael (1911–1932).  Michael was killed at the age of 21 in a motor accident in Switzerland.  In 1925, Carte and his wife had a country house built for them in [[Kingswear]], [[Devon]] named [[Coleton Fishacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/coleton-fishacre "Coleton Fishacre"], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], accessed 5 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, 25 October 2007 feature on the house and gardens.&lt;/ref&gt; After her parents' divorce, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends.  She sold the house after his death, and it is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden Coleton Fishacre House and Garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084145/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden |date=17 December 2009 }}, Nationaltrust.org, accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:01 Coleton Fishacre.JPG|thumb|left|Carte's House at [[Coleton Fishacre]]]]
Carte's private pastimes included gardening, notably at Coleton Fishacre, driving and yachting.  He was an early devotee of the motor car and incurred the displeasure of the courts more than once.  He was fined £3 for driving at 19 miles an hour in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1902, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was subject to criminal prosecution for knocking down and injuring a child when driving at the speed of 24 miles an hour.  He made "every provision for the comfort of the child", who recovered from the accident.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 November 1903, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years after World War I, he was a frequent competitor in yachting races.  From 1919 he raced his yacht "Kali" in the Hamble River class.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Times'', 22 July 1919, p. 5; and 11 August 1919, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he owned and raced a 19-ton cutter, "Content".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 August 1927, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Carte divorced his wife for adultery.  The suit was undefended.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 December 1941, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lady Dorothy moved to the [[Bahamas]] and married St Yves de Verteuil, who had been the co-respondent in the divorce case.  De Verteuil died in 1963, and Lady Dorothy de Verteuil died in February 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 March 1977, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Psmith-1909.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|P. G. Wodehouse's [[Psmith]], said to be modelled on Carte]]
[[P. G. Wodehouse]] based the character [[Psmith]], seen in several of his comic novels, on either Rupert D'Oyly Carte or his brother Lucas.  In the introduction to his novel ''Something Fresh'', Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was "based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man.  He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened to tell me about his monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'."&lt;ref&gt;The Psmith novels include ''[[Mike (novel)|Mike]]'' (1909), ''[[Psmith in the City]]'' (1910), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' (1915) and ''[[Leave it to Psmith]]'' (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the [[Winchester College|Wykehamist]] schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert D'Oyly Carte was "shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.&lt;ref&gt;"Don't ''talk'' so much! I never met a fellow like you for talking!" – Wodehouse, ''Leave it to Psmith'', ''quoted'' in Usborne, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Carte died at the Savoy Hotel, after a brief illness, at the age of 71.  A memorial service was held for him at the [[Savoy Chapel]] on 23 September 1948.&lt;ref&gt;"Our London Correspondence", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 23 September 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were scattered on the headland at [[Coleton Fishacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev.  "An ideal cove", ''The Guardian'', 15 May 1999, p. G7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He left an estate valued at £228,436.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 October 1948, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  At his death, the family businesses passed to his daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte.  The Savoy hotel group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan. [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+%27up+for+sale%27+as+Saudi+owner%27s+billions+dwindle/article.do "Savoy 'up for sale' as Saudi owner's billions dwindle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419060158/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23676788-details/Savoy+'up+for+sale'+as+Saudi+owner's+billions+dwindle/article.do |date=19 April 2009 }}, 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte's hotels have remained among the most prestigious in London, with the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' calling the Savoy "London's most famous hotel" in 2009.&lt;ref name=billions/&gt;  The year after Carte's death, the opera company, which had been the personal possession of Richard and Rupert D'Oyly Carte, became a private company, of which Bridget retained a controlling interest and was chairman and managing director.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 March 1949, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  She inherited a company in strong condition,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–74.&lt;/ref&gt; but the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became unsustainable, and the company closed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html List of 200 amateur G&amp;S performing groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117020238/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html |date=17 November 2010 }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Bernard.

'''Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra, S.A.''' ('''RTVA''') ({{IPA-ca|ˈraði.u j tələβiziˈo ðənˈdorə}},  meaning "'''Radio and Television of Andorra''', [[Public limited company|PLC]]" in [[English language|English]]), is the [[Public broadcasting|public service]] [[television]] and [[radio]] [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]] in the [[Principality of Andorra]]. It operates a television channel, ATV, and a radio station, RNA; both of which broadcast in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

==History==
[[Image:Old rtva logo.png|thumb|left|Former RTVA logo]]
Public service broadcasting in the principality began on 26 October 1989 after the General Council of Andorra decided a national broadcasting organisation should be set up. As a result, the Organisme de Ràdio i Televisió d’Andorra (ORTA) was formed and radio station Ràdio Nacional d'Andorra (RNA) began broadcasting in December 1990. Andorra Televisió (ATV), Andorra's first television channel began in 1995. ORTA was funded by the Andorran government. All programming on both RNA and ATV was produced by independent companies until 1997 when ORTA began producing all of its own programming. ORTA was replaced by the current organisation, Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra S.A. (RTVA), on 13 April 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtva.ad/RTVA/presentacio.html|title=404 La pàgina sol·licitada no s'ha pogut trobar. - Andorra Difusió|first=Andorra Difusió.|last=RTVA.|date=|website=www.rtva.ad|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTVA took full control of both RNA and ATV. RTVA is also funded by the government. Advertising provides additional revenue. Its current director-general is Francesc Robert. RTVA has been an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] since 2002 and took part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] from 2004 to 2009 inclusive.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/news/archives/2002/press_breves_andorra_tv.php|title=EBU.CH :: EBU news - 2002_07_19&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=ebu.ch|accessdate=20 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807214836/http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/news/archives/2002/press_breves_andorra_tv.php|archivedate=7 August 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=67&amp;country=40|title=Andorra - Country profile - Eurovision Song Contest - Belgrade 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in 2012 it was believed to be due to withdraw from the EBU because of financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17799&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcaster has to compete with TV and radio stations from both France and Spain whose transmissions can easily be picked up in the principality.

==Channels==
*[[TVA (Andorra)|ATV]] - The national television channel of Andorra.
*[[TVA2 (Andorra)|ATV2]] - The 2nd national television channel of Andorra.
*[[TVA3 English (Andorra)|ATV3 in English]] -  The 3rd national television channel of Andorra.
*[[Ràdio Nacional d'Andorra|RNA]] - The national radio station of Andorra.

==Programming==
ATV broadcasts a range of programming including sports, music, films and magazine shows as well as the daily children's strand '' Club Piolet''. The flagship news programme ''ATV Noticies'' is produced and broadcast three times a day, with bulletins at 1345, 2100 and prior to closedown. Regular live parliamentary coverage is also broadcast. ATV usually broadcasts between the hours of 0730 and 2345 each day with information pages displayed after closedown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtva.ad/ATV/ATV-Progr.swf|title=404 La pàgina sol·licitada no s'ha pogut trobar. - Andorra Difusió|first=Andorra Difusió.|last=RTVA.|date=|website=www.rtva.ad|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA broadcasts mostly music although news bulletins air on the hour, every hour. The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtva.ad/RNA/RNA-Progr.swf|title=404 La pàgina sol·licitada no s'ha pogut trobar. - Andorra Difusió|first=Andorra Difusió.|last=RTVA.|date=|website=www.rtva.ad|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATV and RNA are streamed online for free on RTVA's website, although the ATV stream is sometimes replaced with a [[test card]] due to [[copyright]] restrictions on some programming.

==Mineternia: the pre-Filmation minicomics==
The first [[minicomic]]s that accompanied the 1981–1983 line of [[Masters of the Universe]] toys presented the earliest version of continuity, and displayed many differences from the more widely known continuity of the later cartoon made by [[Filmation]], and the later minicomics which complemented it. [[He-Man]] was depicted as the scarcely superhuman champion of a tribe of stone-age jungle-dwellers. There was no royal court of Eternia, [[King Randor]], [[Queen Marlena]], or [[He-Man|Prince Adam]] yet.

These very first minicomics, which were actually more like storybooks, with a single image per page footed by prose, stated that Skeletor was originally an inhabitant of another dimension, populated with others of "his kind." During "The Great Wars," an ambiguous concept which is largely ignored in later continuities, a hole was opened in the dimensional wall and Skeletor was thrown from his world into [[Eternia]]. Significantly different from the lonelier and entirely self-serving Skeletor of later depictions, the villain's key motivation in this first story is to reopen the rift between his world and Eternia, thus allowing Skeletor's race to invade and conquer Eternia alongside him. ''This'' was the initially stated reason behind Skeletor's desire to obtain the powers of Castle Grayskull, not merely seeking power for its own sake as is generally the case in later depictions. However, as this first incarnation of the franchise's continuity was particularly short-lived, many questions about this version of Skeletor's origin are left unanswered.

In the 1980s cartoon series, Skeletor is a former pupil of [[Hordak]], leader of the Evil Horde. When Hordak and his Horde invaded [[Eternia]] and stormed the palace, Hordak broke in and kidnapped one of the King and Queen's twin babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://azstarnet.com/entertainment/movies/article_824e5905-7b2a-51c4-98ec-31d523f22db0.html|title= Phil Villarreal's Review: Still a surefire hit with 6-year-olds|accessdate=2009-10-21 |work= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Man-At-Arms]] and the Royal Guard captured Hordak's apprentice, Skeletor, and forced him to divulge the whereabouts of his master, who had retreated to his base of operations, Snake Mountain. When cornered, Hordak opened up a random dimensional portal (later revealed to have led to Etheria) and leaped through with the baby Princess Adora in his possession. Skeletor remained on Eternia, raised an army of powerful minions of his own and took over as ruler of Snake Mountain. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of [[Castle Grayskull]], from which [[He-Man]] draws his powers. If he succeeds, Skeletor would be able to conquer not only Eternia, but the whole universe. At the same time, his other goal is to take revenge on Hordak and overthrow Horde Prime in his bid to conquer the universe.

Skeletor appeared in 71 of the 130 episodes of the 1980s ''He-Man'' cartoon (33 episodes in the first season, 38 in the second). While he was occasionally seen as a bumbling figure whose plans were always foiled by He-Man and his friends, his intentions to conquer Eternia were taken seriously by He-Man.  He-Man regarded Skeletor as his arch-foe, and Skeletor's plans were sometimes ruined through the fault of his minions rather than by his own incompetence.

== Post-Filmation series minicomics ==
In the minicomics that followed the cancellation of the Filmation animated series, which can be seen as following on from the same continuity as the Filmation series, although there are still various contradictions, it is hinted that Skeletor is in fact Keldor, [[King Randor]]'s long lost brother.

This implication occurs specifically in the 1986 minicomic entitled "[[The Search for Keldor]]", a story that involves [[Prince Adam]] and Randor searching for Randor's lost brother Keldor. When Skeletor learns of their quest, he muses that "they must never discover the secret of Keldor", as the truth will lead to his destruction.

In this story King Randor announces that Keldor disappeared years ago. "He thought to master magic; when his experiments went wrong and he was lost in a dimension beyond time!" One of the few elements of Skeletor's back story that remains consistent throughout the various continuities is that he had come to Eternia from another dimension.

It is likely that Randor's statement about Keldor disappearing to another dimension is an attempt to reconcile Skeletor being He-Man's uncle with his Extra-Eternian origins. To find out what happened to Keldor, Randor and the Sorceress attempt to peer through a space-time rift that opens once every year.

Randor announces "I think I see Keldor... Or is it..." Before he can see anything else, Skeletor appears, determined to stop them from finding out any more. Although Skeletor is defeated, he is able to prevent Randor from discovering Keldor's fate as the rift once again closes for another year.

Skeletor's frantic effort to cover up what happened to Keldor, combined with the fact that Keldor vanished to another dimension when attempting to become a master sorcerer, is taken as a heavy implication that the two characters are indeed one and the same. Unfortunately, because the original MOTU toyline came to an end before the story could be resolved, it was never fully disclosed if this was officially intended to be the case.

[[Steven Grant]], the writer-for-hire of the minicomic in question, stated in a he-man.org interview that "As far as I remember, Keldor was Skeletor... But, I don't think that was ever going to be revealed... I seem to remember it as one of those things Mattel came up with out of the blue... Slur Keldor and you end up with Skeletor... His back-story wasn't really worked out. Some sort of evil cosmic energies altered him. I think they were going for a [[Darth Vader]] thing, but it was a tack-on... The main idea was that if they found out Skeletor was Keldor, they'd be able to find out what had changed him and might find some way to reverse it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.he-man.org/resources/archive.php?id=28 |title=&gt; Resources &gt; Archives &gt; Opening the Vault &gt; Steven Grant - writer |publisher=He-Man.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new continuity of the 2002 animated series, Skeletor's original name was definitely Keldor; his appearance as such is shown and his exploits partially depicted. However, it seems unlikely that he is related to Randor in this continuity, as he has Skeletor's blue skin and some other slightly nonhuman features while he was still Keldor. In a he-man.org interview with one of producers of the 2002 series, it is revealed that Keldor is the half-brother of Randor; they have different mothers.

In the Masters of the Universe Classics toy line, further character development was introduced. This line has offered more in depth origins to the Masters of the Universe characters and a collaboration of all origins in attempt to create a new coherent continuity. According to their revised back story, Keldor is Randor's half-brother. Keldor's mother was a member of the Gar race and he was ousted from the royal castle due to his Gar heritage. He roamed Eternia for knowledge, eventually learning the Dark Arts from Hordak. He then sought to unite Eternia by ruling it himself and battle his own half-brother with his army of fellow misfits. After losing the battle and desperate to survive, he turned to his mentor Hordak who merged Keldor with an entity known as the Demo-Man. Together they formed Skeletor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.188412500 |title=Online Store - Keldor Figure |publisher=Mattycollector.com |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Keldor also appears in the DC comics but was cursed by his father and became Skeletor

==''Masters of the Universe'' (1987 film)==
[[File:Skeletor1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Frank Langella as Skeletor in ''Masters of the Universe'']]
Skeletor was the primary villain in the [[Masters of the Universe (film)|1987 live-action film]] portrayed by [[Frank Langella]]. As this was a motion picture, Skeletor was allowed to be far more menacing and less comical. To prepare for the role, Langella had asked his kids questions about the character and watched the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Film: He-Man Seeks Key

|accessdate=2010-03-03|first=Walter|last=Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the movie, Skeletor captures Castle Grayskull and imprisons the Sorceress. Later, he absorbs the power of the Great Eye and transforms into a golden-armored warrior god, but is ultimately defeated by He-Man. Langella's version of Skeletor is clad in more regal attire than is traditionally seen. Rather than dark purple, he wears all black, and his costume is less scant, covering his entire body with a robe and a flowing cape. Langella's performance is highly regarded by fans and critics as being a high point in the film. Langella himself has also mentioned several times that Skeletor has been one of his favorite roles during his entire career.

==''The New Adventures of He-Man'' (1990)==
[[File:Newskeletor.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Skeletor in his "Disks of Doom" form in ''The New Adventures of He-Man'']]
''[[The New Adventures of He-Man|The New Adventures]]'' series sees Skeletor with a new outfit, chest [[armour]], cybernetic implants and a mauve cape. Skeletor fools the Galactic Guardians, [[Hydron (He-Man)|Hydron]] and Flipshot, into thinking he is the force of good they need to save their home planet, Primus, when in fact they came looking for He-Man. Unable to decide who is good and who is evil, Skeletor and He-Man are both transported to the futuristic planet Primus, where Skeletor reveals his true evil nature to the Primans as the Mutants attack. Skeletor and the Mutant leader, [[Flogg]], come to an agreement: Skeletor will help Flogg conquer Primus in return for Flogg's help in destroying He-Man. One of Flogg's terms is that he will remain in charge of the Mutants. Skeletor agrees, and is able to manipulate and control Flogg from behind the scenes, while making himself a force to be reckoned with among Primans and Mutants alike.&lt;ref name="news.toonzone.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/20973/the-new-adventures-of-he-man-volume-1-fighting-mutant-slime-in-a-future-time|title= The New Adventures of He-Man Volume 1": Fighting Mutant Slime in a Future Time|accessdate=2009-10-15 |work= Toon Zone|publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "Sword and Staff", Skeletor finds a powerful crystal on Moon Nordor and absorbs its power, making him more powerful and evil than ever before, and changing his appearance drastically, including a yellow face with red eyes, and different armour and helmet, based on the "Disks of Doom Skeletor" toy. Throughout the series, Skeletor concocts various schemes to destroy He-Man and conquer Primus.&lt;ref name="news.toonzone.net"/&gt;

Although ''The New Adventures'' series follows the continuity of the Filmation cartoon, Skeletor is quite a different character. He possesses a sarcastic sense of humor and often jokes and laughs, taking his own failures much better than in the previous series. He has a genuine relationship with Crita, a female mutant with purple skin. He even dances with her in one episode. He also works well with Flogg, Slush Head and the other Mutants as part of their team as well as having a pet named Gur. Though often displaying a more relaxed attitude, when enraged he simply becomes a maniac and lashes out in anger at anyone around him. He is able to instill fear into Flogg, despite being perfectly willing to take his orders when it suits his own purposes. Overall, the Skeletor in this series is portrayed as a far more competent and threatening character, despite his often comedic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masterscast.com/2007/01/28/masters-cast-episode-25 |title=Masters Cast - Episode 25 |accessdate=2009-10-17 |work=Masters Cast |publisher= |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042650/http://masterscast.com/2007/01/28/masters-cast-episode-25/ |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first toys for the "New Adventures" line, which was Marketed simply as "He-Man", gave a different explanation for how He-Man and Skeletor ended up in the future via a mini-comic packed in with various figures, as well as actually providing a reason for the cybernetics Skeletor employed in the first few episodes of the "New Adventures" TV series. In this mini-comic, Skeletor also learned that He-Man and Prince Adam were the same being, only for Adam to become He-Man permanently. The energy output caused by this final change from prince to warrior was partly the reason for Skeletor's new cybernetic look when the character was forced to take drastic measures to treat wounds that would have otherwise been fatal without treatment.

==''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' (2002)==
[[File:MYPcartoonSkeletorCape.jpg|thumb|left|Skeletor as he appeared in the 2002 MYP animated series]]
In this new version, it is shown that Skeletor was formerly a warlord named Keldor who had trained in the dark arts. Keldor was taught the ways of black magic by summoning [[Hordak]], who was trapped in the dark dimension, Despondos. He gathered a small band of warriors to attack the Hall of Wisdom. They encountered resistance from Captain Randor and his officers; Keldor fought Randor personally, wielding two swords with astounding proficiency, but when Randor disarmed him, Keldor threw a vial of acid at him. Randor deflected it with his shield, and the acid splashed on Keldor's face.

As Kronis called for an retreat, and Evil-Lyn took Keldor to Hordak's sanctuary, where Keldor summoned Hordak to save his life. Keldor agreed to pay whatever price Hordak wished for his own life, and Hordak transformed him, stripping the damaged tissues from his skull and dubbing him ''Skeletor''; Keldor's head had been completely stripped of soft tissues, leaving only a floating skull. When Keldor saw his new appearance, he laughed maniacally about it; the incident perhaps shattering whatever sanity he had left. Hordak can also apparently speak to Skeletor from Despondos through telepathy which also causes Skeletor great pain.

Trapped in the Dark Hemisphere by the Mystic Wall, Skeletor designed a machine that would smash it, but it needed the Corodite Crystal as a power source. When [[Mer-Man]] retrieved it, Skeletor destroyed the Mystic Wall and returned to menacing Eternia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/23430/masters-of-the-universe-2002-the-power-returns-in-style|title= Masters of the Universe 2002": The Power Returns, In Style|accessdate=2009-10-20 |work= Toon Zone |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his previous portrayals, Skeletor is not concerned with Castle Grayskull right away, until a giant fish-monster that had swallowed the remnants of the Corodite Crystal - thus making him hunger for power - heads toward Grayskull. The Eternian warriors, led by Man-At-Arms and He-Man, stop the monster, forcing Skeletor to ponder what could be in that ancient pile of stones worth dying for. At the time, the Heroic Warriors seem ready and willing to let Grayskull fall, and would likely have done so, if not for the urgings of Man-At-Arms, who had been swallowed whole by the monster. Skeletor directly attacks it with his Council of Evil: himself, [[List of Masters of the Universe characters#Count Marzo|Count Marzo]], [[List of Masters of the Universe characters#Evilseed|Evilseed]], the three evil Giants and [[List of Masters of the Universe characters#Webstor|Webstor]]. When [[King Hiss]] and the [[Snake Men (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Men]] are freed from the Void, Hiss imprisons Skeletor, having him devoured by a giant snake, but Skeletor escapes after the Masters defeat Hiss.

Despite owing his life to Hordak, Skeletor destroys Hordak's sanctuary to prevent him from returning. Skeletor did not want to hold up his end of the bargain and free Hordak from Despondos because he wants Eternia for himself. At the end of the Second Season, King Hiss revives Serpos, the Serpent God, who had been transformed into Snake Mountain by the Elders; Skeletor and his minions were inside the mountain at that time. Though Serpos is defeated and restored to its Snake Mountain form. If season three of the series had been produced, it would have seen Skeletor and He-Man dealing with the Horde invasion and the powerful Hordak, who it was said Skeletor would eventually have defeated. This season would have also shown Skeletor's part in the kidnapping of He-Man's twin sister, She-Ra, and sending her to Hordak to be raised. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the show, Skeletor is again portrayed as a bully towards his minions but with an even more malicious edge, using his powerful abilities to threaten his followers or to silence them. He also constantly blames his followers for their defeats at the hands of the Masters, and rules through a policy of fear, which makes him somewhat different compared to [[King Hiss]]. Many episodes end with him either punishing or torturing his minions for their failures. Also like previous versions, he is shown to possess almost no loyalty towards his followers as demonstrated in the last episodes of the first season, where he sends his own Evil Warriors into a trap to get captured just to lull the Masters into a false sense of security. He even goes as far as replacing them with his 'Council of Evil'. He is further shown to be power mad and unwilling to share the spoils of war; as demonstrated when he tells Count Marzo when questioned if they will gain anything from Castle Grayskull, that he will give them a reward if he feels like doing so.

In the beginning of the first season he demonstrates a deep rooted hatred towards [[King Randor]] for his part in destroying his face and making him what he is now; though he also attributes that to Evil-Lyn for saving him. This gradually shifts towards hatred against He-Man for standing in his way constantly. Furthermore, his maniacal laughter can perhaps indicate that he might have become insane by the loss of his face, something that is mentioned in the ''Icons of Evil'' comics when Kronis, who later becomes the villain [[Trap-Jaw]], mentions that Skeletor is no longer the leader he once followed. Finally, despite his evil, Skeletor has been known to grovel when his life is in jeopardy, though this is usually an attempt to get the upper hand before betraying his ''savior'', which is seen on a few occasions to trick He-Man into dropping his guard before attacking and escaping.

As with all the Mike Young Productions series' characters, Skeletor's appearance is based on his figure from the [[Four Horsemen Studios|Four Horsemen]]-designed toyline which the cartoon was produced to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete Series (2002) DVD Review|work= [[IGN]] |date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/103/1035438p1.html |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeletor is the character that received perhaps the least-extensive redesign from his original toy/cartoon version. However, when this new design was then translated into animated form, MYP's artists usually gave him a voluminous cape; something which neither the new toy, nor the original incarnation of the character ever wore. The cape is typically adorned in situations where Skeletor chose to employ powerful magical feats. Skeletor is still commonly seen without his cape in the 2002 series while at rest or in combat situations not requiring extensive use of magic. When a later convention-exclusive figure of Keldor was made using the existing Skeletor body, a removable cloth cape was included. As the figure came with three swappable heads including his Keldor face; his burning, acid-splashed visage; and his final Skeletor head, this figure could thus be configured into a "show-accurate" caped Skeletor.

Another note is that his eyes appear, glowing red, in his sockets whenever he becomes enraged or demonstrates his magic powers. When Hiss was going to turn him to stone he claims his eyes are closed but Evil-Lyn proclaims he has no eyes.

==''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' (2012)==
{{Main|He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2012 DC comic)}}
In the comics published by [[DC Comics]], Skeletor works to prevent Adam from remembering who he really is at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletor is disappointed that Beast Man failed yet discovered that Adam is not without skill. Their attempt to wipe his memory completely failed to erase his instinctive understanding of battle. Skeletor shows Beast Man mercy, but warns that his troublesome nephew must die....if he doesn't stay within the boundaries. When Skeletor sends words to his allies that Adam must be prevented from learning who he really is, the first to take action is Trap Jaw and his riders who ambush Adam in the [[desert]].&lt;ref&gt;''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletor mused at how he had previously worked so hard to capture Adam's sword thinking that it was the source of He-Man's power. Skeletor now knows that the sword is merely a conduit to the powers of Castle Grayskull. His dinner guest is a catatonic Sorceress of Castle Grayskull as he tries to get her to give him the knowledge of accessing the powers of Castle Grayskull. When Adam and Teela are on a ship at sea, Skeletor sends word to Mer-Man to dispose of "Prince" Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletor is getting annoyed at the fact that none of his allies have successfully killed Adam. He can't leave Castle Grayskull to do the job himself or else he won't get back in. Even with all the torture he has caused the Sorceress of the castle, he worries that she is the key to unlocking the castle's power.&lt;ref&gt;''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil-Lyn reports the misplacement of her prisoners Adam and Teela to Skeletor. When she points out that the bird Zoar caused Adam to fall and discover the means of escape, Skeletor realizes that the Sorceress of Grayskull has been undermining him. Angrily, he bursts into her cell and demands to know where in his mind she was hiding. She reveals that she hid in plain sight within a pleasant memory....moments he rarely revisits. Grabbing her by the neck, he explains that he does not need her to get at Grayskull's power and snaps it dropping her limp body to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

At Castle Grayskull, Skeletor has been informed by Beast Man that He-Man will be coming for him now that he has regained his memories, and wants to prepare Castle Grayskull for a siege. Skeletor tells Beast Man to do so if it brings him comfort. He then engages in a conversation with a head that has been advising him throughout the series, and eventually throws it through the window in a fit of rage. At Castle Grayskull, the preparations for the expected attack are complete. Skeletor, Beast Man. and Evil-Lyn overlook the battlefield in front of the castle, and await He-Man's arrival. Skeletor magically removes Evil-Lyn's mouth when she continues to speak even after he has ordered her to be silent.

He-Man tells Teela that he believes Skeletor is dead, then is seen calling himself a liar under his breath. Skeletor is revealed to have survived the fall into the chasm, but his skull is now cracked and broken, with his lower jaw appearing to be absent. Skeletor finds himself faced with the head that he threw out of the castle earlier, and it is revealed that this is some sort of minion that encourages Skeletor to not accept defeat. The final frames reveal that an unknown enemy that wishes Skeletor dead, but is not yet prepared to see it happen, has been manipulating Skeletor throughout the entire saga.&lt;ref&gt;''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Live-action Masters of the Universe film''==
Skeletor is planned to appear in the upcoming live-action ''Masters of the Universe'' adaptation. In the film, Keldor will be a human before becoming a skull-headed demon instead of Gar and be Adam's (and Adora's) older stepbrother instead of his uncle and Randor's older stepson instead of his half-brother, who is the chosen heir to the throne to become Skeletor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thathashtagshow.com/2018/05/masters-of-the-universe/|title=EXCLUSIVE: He-Man: Masters of the Universe Character Breakdowns Revealed|author=Charles Murphy|date=May 1, 2018|work=That Hastag Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Skeletor possesses an array of mystic powers and is an extremely powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] with control over a vast range of dark magical powers, such as the ability to teleport himself and others over vast distances, send [[Telepathy|telepathic]] commands to his minions, grow plants, hypnotism, illusions, reflection, freezing rays, and open gateways between dimensions. He also possesses considerable scientific skill, and is shown to have skill in creating various machines and devices in both the ''Filmation'' and ''New Adventures'' animated series. The 2002 series also shows him as a highly skilled swordsman, wielding dual swords and taking on multiple opponents.

He is usually armed with a magical weapon called the '''Havoc Staff''', a long [[sceptre]] crowned with a ram's skull—sometimes depicted with an embedded [[crystal ball]]. He can discharge bolts of mystic force from the head of the Staff, or use it as a focus for more powerful forms of magic such as the theft of dreams. Skeletor has also displayed the ability to discharge energy from his own body, as is seen in the 1987 film where he casts lightning from his hands and in the original animated series where he projects energy from his fingertips. In the 2002 series, his innate powers seem much more limited; though his abilities, when in conjunction with his Havoc Staff seem nearly unmitigated in scope and highly potent in raw power.

In the early mini-comics, Skeletor sometimes possesses one half of the Power Sword. From this weapon he could also project magical energies. He also performed [[remote viewing]] via crystal ball. He has also shown himself to be a gifted swordsman. As a master of the occult arts, he is also privy to much secret knowledge about the universe.

All versions portray Skeletor as being extremely cunning and intelligent. He is also very strong, although his strength is no match for He-Man's. He has few weaknesses, aside from his inability to control his anger, and on occasion his overconfidence can also be his undoing.

==Animals==
[[File:Panthor.jpg|250px|thumb|Panthor in the Filmation animated series]]
Despite his generally callous attitude towards his henchmen and others, Skeletor displays a certain degree of affinity towards animals. Skeletor's most constant animal companion is Panthor.

Panthor is Skeletor's evil [[felidae|feline]] companion, a giant purple [[Panthera|panther]] who serves as an evil counterpart to [[Battle Cat]]. Panthor is portrayed as Skeletor's pet or [[familiar spirit]], being at the right of his throne. However, unlike He-Man's Battle Cat, Panthor only appears in a handful of stories in the original series. While his role is similarly limited in the 2002 series, he is more prominent in the episodes in which he appears compared to his appearances in the earlier series.

In ''[[He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special]]'', Skeletor also shows some affinity towards Relay, a partly robotic dog who is a part of the Manchines. When shot down by Hordak late into the special, Skeletor is at first ready to leave Relay behind on a snowy mountain top, but decides to carry Relay with him when he can't bear to listen to his whimpering. Although Skeletor appears annoyed by Relay licking his face, he refuses to let Miguel or Alisha carry the creature.

In ''[[The New Adventures of He-Man]]'', Skeletor becomes friends with a small mutant creature named Grr. After intimidating Grr to submission, he pets it and decides he likes it because the creature is apparently as vicious as he.

{{nihongo|'''''Sky High'''''|スカイハイ||also known as ''Skyhigh''}} is a [[supernatural]] [[action film]] from director [[Ryuhei Kitamura]]. It is based on the [[manga]] [[Skyhigh (manga)|of the same title]] by [[Tsutomu Takahashi]] and serves as a [[prequel]] to a Japanese television drama [[Sky High (TV series)|of the same name]], and starring the same actress, [[Yumiko Shaku]].  Although the film is a prequel to the series, the film was made while the series was still in production, sometime between the first and second seasons.  The film had a clear effect on the direction of the second season, as evidenced in the look and style of Mina/Izuko's second season costuming—more similar to the darker, edgier look she sports in the film,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/29/ASBY-2498.jpg Sky High, Season 2]&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the softer, colourful, kimono-like outfit of the first season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/12/00/AMEB-4.jpg Sky High, Season 1 - A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/11/48/AMEB-3.jpg Sky High, Season 1 - B]&lt;/ref&gt;  The film reveals how the somewhat meek Mina became the heroic Izuko, as seen in the series (and the film’s action climax).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JrjOH5mFRgM|Trailer: "Sky High (2003)"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|5Ezpn0uIcIY|Trailer: "Sky High (2003)" (with English Subtitles)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A serial-murderer is on the loose who just so happens to also be removing the hearts of his victims and taking them with him. His victims however, are not merely random humans as thought by the police. They are in fact, the past and present guardians of the gateway of the [[afterlife]].

On the day he is to be married, Detective Kanzaki, who happens to be on the case, discovers that his fiancé Mina has been murdered with her heart also missing. He also learns that the killers are Kudo, a geneticist, and his evil secretary Rei. The two are trying to obtain six hearts from the guardians so that they may call forth a horde of [[demon]]s from the Gate of Rage and have their every desire granted. Only problem is, once they open the gate the entire world will be covered in darkness.

Meanwhile, in the afterlife, Mina encounters Izuko, the Guardian of the Gate. Izuko gives her three options: Mina can choose to ascend to [[heaven]] and be reborn, she can choose to forever walk the earth as a [[ghost]] or she can choose to [[curse]] one of the living to death and as a result be cursed to descend to [[hell]]. Mina has 12 days to make her choice.

== Multiple Genres ==
A big budget feature film prequel to a television series, ''Sky High'' is not an easy film to classify, as it comfortably fits into multiple [[genres]].  It is typically classified in the action or [[martial arts]] category, however it is very much a [[crime thriller]] about a cop (Kanzaki), whose fiancé (Mina) is only the latest victim in a series of macabre serial killings of young women.  He uses his forensic skills as a detective to slowly uncover the identity of the killer—unknowingly aided by the ghost of Mina, who is desperately trying to figure out the identity of her own killer.  The killer is revealed to be a woman (Rei) who is a fallen Guardian, risen from the dead; defeating her will require delving into fantasy and legend.  ''Sky High'' is also a [[romance film|romance]] about love and loss as Mina faces a greater destiny&amp;nbsp;... becoming the new Guardian of the Gate and defending it against evil (the role her character plays in the television series).

==Production==
The film opened in Japanese theaters in late 2003.  Its premiere followed in the footsteps of the popular [[Sky High (TV series)|''Sky High'' television series]], starring the same actress ([[Yumiko Shaku]]) in the lead role of Izuko—or specifically, the "new" Izuko, as the film is considered a [[prequel]] to the [[Sky High (TV series)|TV series]], revealing how Mina Saeki (Shaku) came to replace the previous Guardian and take her position as the Izuko we see in the series.  Although the film makes much greater use of action, martial arts, and big budget special effects than the series is capable, both follow the same continuity.  [[TV-Asahi]], the Japanese television network behind the [[Sky High (TV series)|TV series]] is also the theatrical film's primary production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JrjOH5mFRgM|Trailer: "Sky High (2003)"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie is helmed by popular action director [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], best known for his [[Versus (2000 film)|''Versus'']] series of films, as well as other popular draws such as ''[[Azumi (film)|Azumi]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0398563|Sky High}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0457565|Ryuhei Kitamura}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitamura also directed several episodes of the TV series, and following the film's box office success, [[Sky High (TV series)|''Sky High 2'']] (or Season 2) was quickly put into production by the network for January 2004, utilizing many elements from the film, including its darker, edgier look, and improved sets and effects.

The film's [[screenplay]] was written by [[Isao Kiriyama]], based on the manga ''[[Skyhigh (manga)|Sky High]]'' by [[Tsutomu Takahashi]].

The closing theme for the movie is "Horizon" by [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]] ([[L'Arc-en-Ciel]] and [[Vamps (band)|Vamps]]).

'''''The Great Buck Howard''''' is a 2008 American comedy-drama film directed by [[Sean McGinly]] that stars [[Colin Hanks]] and [[John Malkovich]]. [[Tom Hanks]] also appears as the father of his real-life son's character. The character Buck Howard is inspired by the [[mentalist]] [[Kreskin|The Amazing Kreskin]], whose popularity was at its height in the 1970s. The film premiered at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundance.org/festival/press_industry/releases/pdf/2008_SFF_Announces_Films_In_Competition.pdf |title=2008 Sundance Film Festival Announces Films in Competition |date=November 11, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2007 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625173658/http://www.sundance.org/festival/press_industry/releases/pdf/2008_SFF_Announces_Films_In_Competition.pdf |archivedate=June 25, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first Walden Media film to be distributed by [[Magnolia Pictures]].

==Plot summary==
Troy Gable ([[Colin Hanks]]) defies his father ([[Tom Hanks]]) and leaves [[law school]] to pursue his dream of becoming a writer in Los Angeles. To support himself, he takes a job as a road manager for "The Great" Buck Howard ([[John Malkovich]]), a fading [[Mentalism|mentalist]]. Troy comes to enjoy traveling with Buck to performances in smaller venues such as [[Bakersfield]] and [[Akron]]. In particular, Troy sincerely admires Buck's signature trick: having someone in the audience hide his fee for that night's performance, which he then unfailingly discovers. ([[Kreskin]] is said to have actually performed this feat 6,000 times, only failing to find the money nine times.)&lt;ref&gt;United Airlines in-flight entertainment guide, August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reluctant publicist, Valerie Brennan ([[Emily Blunt]]), is sent to join them in Cincinnati as a replacement for a more senior colleague to promote Buck's still secret attempt to resurrect his career. Valerie is disgusted by Buck's verbal abuse towards her and Troy, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Buck reveals that his comeback will involve putting "hundreds" of people (actually only a few dozen) to sleep and then awakening them as if from the dead. The trick works, but despite a large press turnout, no one is there to record the act, since the news media is called away at the last second to cover a car accident involving [[Jerry Springer]]. Furious, Buck unfairly blames the mishap on Troy and Valerie, and then faints from exhaustion.  In the hospital, Buck and Troy discover that the media absence actually worked in Buck's favor, as rumors reported by the news media exaggerate the scope of Buck's act; as a result, Buck returns to the limelight as a retro-"hip" phenomenon. He appears on television shows such as those of [[Jon Stewart]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Conan O'Brien]], and more. Buck is reunited with his estranged friend, [[George Takei]], who sings "[[What the World Needs Now Is Love|What the World Needs Now]]".

Buck finally gets the call he has been waiting for: To perform once again on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. He previously had performed with [[Johnny Carson]] 61 times during the height of his career, but never since the show has been hosted by [[Jay Leno]]. Buck is bumped by [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], who has too much material and uses up Buck's time. Buck refuses an immediate offer to come back and appear on ''The Tonight Show'' the following week, but agrees to receive an offer to headline a date in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. When the limelight on Buck dims once more after he fails to find his money for the first time ever during his Las Vegas premiere, Troy leaves him and through Valerie's connections, lands a job with a celebrated TV writer ([[Griffin Dunne]]). After some time, Troy sees from an ad in the paper that Buck is doing his show again in Bakersfield. Buck is clearly back where he feels most comfortable, and once again successfully performs his signature trick, leaving Troy to wonder whether Buck doesn't have some mysterious talent after all.

[[Image:Mainzer1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Mainzer lit up at night.]]
'''The Mainzer''' (pronounced MINE-Zer), also known as '''The Mainzer Theater''' or '''The Mainzer-Strand Theater''', is a music venue in [[Merced, California]] once known for its [[indie rock]] scene. It is also recognized by the [[Art Deco Society of California]] for the restoring and remodeling process which took place beginning in 1999.

==History==
The building was constructed in the early 1920s. Around 1931 there was a fire that destroyed a good portion of the interior. The theater has been owned by [[Golden State Theaters]], [[United California Theaters]], and then [[United Artists]]. The building was originally a theater for live stage performances. At the time, it was known as The Strand Theater. After years of declining business, the theater became a second-run house, playing old Hollywood blockbusters at discounted rates, again, with little success. Finally the theater was shut down due to lack of business in the mid 1990s. The building remained untouched for years until an investment group headed by Hanz Mainz and Brenda Farley bought the property and started the renovation process.&lt;ref name="thedim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thedlm.com/waiting-for-the-mainzer/ | title=Waiting for The Mainzer | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | author=Price, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cinematreasures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/4405 | title=Mainzer Cinema II | accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During renovations, the theater was renamed The Mainzer-Strand Theater, with the marquee reading "The Mainzer." The interior of the building was changed by tearing out one of the movie cinemas and adding a large room with a balcony and a stage for all types of events. A small café was installed in the front lobby area. It was the hope of the investors to be able to hold large stage productions, concerts, comedy shows, private receptions, and show independent films in the two remaining cinemas.

In 1999, The Mainzer reopened to a large gala, a few comedy shows, and a few independent films. The attendance was again poor, but this time mainly due to inflated ticket prices for both concerts and films. In 2004, the [[Art Deco Society of California]] gave The Mainzer its "Historic Preservation" award for the recent renovations.&lt;ref name="Art Deco Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artdecosociety.org/preservation/awardswinners.htm | title=Art Deco Society Of California Preservation Awards History (1984 Through 2011) | publisher=Art Deco Society Of California | accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the end was again looking near for The Mainzer. The investors were struggling to make the mortgage payments and [[bankruptcy]] loomed overhead.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Finally, a deal was worked out that kept the doors open. A local Merced artist and musician, [[R.C. Essig]], also known in the music world as [[Radioactive Cauliflower]], leased the building from Brenda Farley. By this time, the theater had almost completely stopped showing movies except on rare occasions and has focused on only holding concerts with a mixture of local and national acts.

[[Image:Mainzer3.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The KISS Tribute band at The Mainzer Stage.]]
In the summer/fall of 2006, Essig fought to keep the place an independent, all-ages music venue, but it was a losing effort. The bank decided not to sell the property to Essig, but to another investment group. So after seven years of battling, the Mainzer Theater has finally shut its doors as an independent music venue. As of this time, it is unknown who purchased the building or what they are planning to do with it.

===Venue history===
Before R.C. Essig took overall control of the theater, he worked for The Mainzer as their main booking agent. Essig was a recognized booking agent for his work on the Merced [[indie rock]] festival, [[The Gathering of Goodness]]. Due to this, Essig was able to book many of the same national acts at The Mainzer whenever they were touring California.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Mainzer has gained recognition as a good venue while in California.

While many people considered The mainzer mainly an [[indie rock]] venue, it also held many shows in all genres of music from [[Punk rock|punk]] to [[Heavy metal music|metal]] to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].

'''''The Pacific''''' is a 2010 American television series produced by [[HBO]], [[Playtone]], and [[DreamWorks]] that premiered in the United States on March 14, 2010.

The series is a [[Sequel#Spiritual successor|companion piece]] to the 2001 miniseries ''[[Band of Brothers (miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' and focuses on the [[United States Marine Corps]]' actions in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] within the wider [[Pacific War]]. Whereas ''Band of Brothers'' followed the men of [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Easy Company]] of the [[506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|506th Parachute Infantry Regiment]] through the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater]], ''The Pacific'' centers on the experiences of three Marines ([[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]], [[Eugene Sledge]], and [[John Basilone]]) who were all in different regiments ([[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st]], [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th]], and [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th]], respectively) of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]].

''The Pacific'' was spearheaded by [[Bruce C. McKenna]] ([[executive producer|co-executive producer]]), one of the main writers on ''Band of Brothers.'' [[Hugh Ambrose]], the son of ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]'' author [[Stephen Ambrose]], served as a project consultant.

''The Pacific'' miniseries features the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]'s battles in the Pacific, such as [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]], [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]], [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]], and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]], as well as Basilone's involvement in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. It is based primarily on the [[memoir]]s of two [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]: ''[[With the Old Breed]]: At Peleliu and Okinawa'' by Eugene Sledge and ''[[Helmet for My Pillow]]'' by Robert Leckie.&lt;ref name="ZeitchikS-V-2007-04-24"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zeitchik|first=Steven |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963752.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title=HBO greenlights Spielberg mini |work=Variety |date=24 April 2007 |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also draws on Sledge's memoir ''[[China Marine (memoir)|China Marine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hbo.com/the-pacific/index.html#/the-pacific/about/index.html | title= About the Series |publisher= HBO | accessdate= 10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Red Blood, Black Sand,'' the memoir of [[Chuck Tatum]], a Marine who fought alongside Basilone on Iwo Jima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.marineswwii.com | title= Red Blood Black Sand |website= MarinesWWII.com | accessdate= 10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatum"&gt;{{cite news | first=Lori |last=Gilbert | title=Stockton man's Iwo Jima experience part of HBO miniseries | url= http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100314/A_NEWS/3140307 | work=The Record |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different cast provides a wider view of the Pacific theatre, allowing the book to include the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|fall of the Philippines]], [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]] and [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]] and expand the narrative to include depictions of life as experienced by prisoners of war, senior officers and the development of naval aviation.

The trailer concluded with "2010" displayed on-screen -alluding to and confirming the series release date. A second trailer was released on the HBO website after which the date "March&amp;nbsp;2010" is displayed, giving a more specific series release date. On January 14, 2010, Comcast added on-demand content from the series, including a scene from ''The Pacific'', interviews with the producers and character profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hd-report.com/2010/01/14/comcast-adds-exclusive-hd-content-from-the-pacific/ |title=Comcast adds exclusive HD content from ‘The Pacific’ | publisher=HD Report |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another trailer was shown in February 2010 during [[Super Bowl XLIV]], depicting several combat scenes.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
''The Pacific'' was very well received by critics, receiving an average score of 87 out of 100 at review aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=29 March 2010 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/pacific?q=the%20pacific |title=The Pacific |publisher=Metacritic }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[James Poniewozik]] named it one of the Top 10 TV Series of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=The Top 10 Everything of 2010 – The Pacific|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2034052_2034024,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=14 December 2011|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the entire miniseries an 8.5 out of 10 'Great' score, saying "Although I don't think ''The Pacific'' overtakes ''Band of Brothers'' in terms of technical execution and overall entertainment value, many of the comparisons will be moot as ''The Pacific'' is a different kind of series with different goals. This series sought to look beyond the combat and it paints a full, vivid picture of the war and the people that fought it through focused, individual stories. That's a tall order for any series to fulfill, and although The Pacific doesn't always come through with shining colors, it does make an admirable effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/19/the-pacific-series-review|title=The Pacific: Series Review|work=[[IGN]]|author=Ramsey Isler|date=May 19, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN also reviewed each individual episode, with Episode 9 receiving a perfect 10 out of 10 score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/tv/the-pacific|title=The Pacific Review|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warrior Xtreme Cagefighting''' ('''WXC''') is the largest [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) [[Promoter (entertainment)|promotion company]] in Michigan that hosts most of the top-ranked fighters in the state and is looking in 2017 to produce events Nationwide. Based in the [[United States]], the WXC has eight weight divisions and enforces the [[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]. Norbert Pasztor serves as the president of the WXC.

Inspired by [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], the first WXC event was held in 2008 in [[Monroe, Michigan]]. Showcasing fighters of different disciplines — including [[Boxing]], [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[Wrestling]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Karate]] and other styles — the WXC sought to provide authentic and most effective [[martial arts|martial art]] in a real fight.

==Rules==
The current rules for the Warrior Xtreme Cagefighting are the rules established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules], New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.

===Rounds===
WXC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or is a fight card's "main event" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-championship "main event" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card), will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Bouts which re either on the preliminary card, or on the main card prior to the main event, last for a maximum of three rounds.  There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.

===Weight divisions===
{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}

The WXC currently uses eight weight classes:

===Cage===

The WXC stages bouts in a six-sided enclosure officially named "The Hexagon".

The WXC cage is a hexagon structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl and a diameter of {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}}, allowing {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} of space from side to side. The fence is {{nowrap|5 ft 6 in}} to {{nowrap|5 ft 8 in}} high. The cage sits atop a platform, raising it from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the six sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other. The mat, painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event.

===Attire===

All competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Shirts, [[Keikogi|gis]] or long pants (including gi pants) are not allowed. Fighters must use approved light-weight open-fingered gloves, that include at least 1" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;/ 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;ounces) that allow fingers to grab. These gloves enable fighters to punch with less risk of an injured or broken hand, while retaining the ability to grab and grapple.  A [[Mouthguard#Sports|mouthguard]] and [[jockstrap]] with [[Jockstrap|protective cup]] are also required and is checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring.

===Match outcome===

*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, or verbally submits. Also a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of serious injury while in a hold.
*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.
*'''[[Knockout#Technical knockout|Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is unable to intelligently defend himself)
**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for the fighter to continue the bout due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)
**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for their own fighter)
*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)

Note: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively).

A fight can also end in a '''technical decision''', '''technical submission''', '''disqualification''', '''forfeit''', '''technical draw''', or '''no contest'''. The latter two outcomes have no winners.

===Judging criteria===
The [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all WXC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or fewer.  Scores of 10–8 are typically awarded for very dominant rounds.

===Fouls===
#[[Headbutt|Butting]] with the head
#[[Eye-gouging|Eye gouging]] of any kind
#Biting
#Hair pulling
#[[Fish-hooking|Fish hooking]]
#[[Groin attack]]s of any kind
#Putting a finger into any orifice or into any cut or laceration on an opponent (see [[Fish-hooking]])
#[[Small joint manipulation]]

When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.

===Match conduct===
*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.
*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.
*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.
*Early WXC events disregarded verbal sparring / "trash-talking" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.

===Fighter salaries===
A WXC fighter generally does not have a salary, Amateur fighters do not get paid. Professional fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight with an additional bonus if they win. Cash bonuses are also typically awarded for "Fight of the Night", "Knockout of the Night", and "Submission of the Night." The size of these bonuses varies by event, but, for less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight.

==Media==

===Music===
*''WXC: Xtreme Beat Downs, Vol. 1'', an album of music featured in and inspired by the WXC.

===DVD===
*Every pay-per-view WXC event has been released onto DVD.

'''World Color Press Inc.''' ("'''Worldcolor'''") (formerly [[Quebecor World]]) was a company which provided high-value and comprehensive [[printing|print]], digital, and related services to businesses worldwide. World Color and its subsidiaries printed various commercial products, including [[comic book]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[brochure]]s, [[direct mail]] and newspaper inserts, and directories, while also providing clients a broad range of pre-press services, such as desktop production and assembly. 

World Color was the first printer to make comic book printing a major part of its business plan, and throughout most of its history was the dominant North American printer of comics and associated publications. During its history, World Color was also at the forefront of many new technologies and printing innovations, including use of web offset presses, "pool shipping," [[rotogravure]] printing, computer technology, digital registration systems, and [[flexography]].&lt;ref&gt;"Forgiving Plate Aids Processing," ''Graphic Arts Monthly'' (Dec. 1993), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Color merged with [[Quebecor Printing]] in 1999; at the time World Color was the largest printer of consumer magazines in the United States and the third largest commercial printer in North America. Worldcolor was acquired by [[Quad/Graphics]] in early 2010.

== History ==

=== World Fair Color Printing ===
World Color Press was founded in 1903 by the owners of the ''St. Louis Star'' under the name '''World's Fair Color Printing'''. The wholly owned subsidiary was created to handle color printing for the upcoming 1904 St. Louis [[World's Fair]], the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]], and was expected to disband  at the World Fair's conclusion. Instead, the company name was shortened to World Color Printing and continued as a commercial printer, focusing on a new business: the color "[[comic strip|funnies]]" section of the Sunday [[newspaper]].

=== Comics ===
World Color's first foray into comics was [[Comic strip syndication|syndicating]] [[George Herriman]]'s ''Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade'' from January 2, 1904, to November 19, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, Don. [http://www.toonopedia.com/ozone.htm "MAJOR OZONE’S FRESH AIR CRUSADE,"] ''Toonpedia''. Accessed Nov. 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, World Color also distributed the Herriman strips ''Grandma's Girl—Likewise Bud Smith'', which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered children's strip, ''Rosy Posy—Mama's Girl''. 

Robert Grable and Roswell Messing, Sr.,&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;Saunders, David. [https://www.pulpartists.com/Herman.html "RAY R. HERMANN,"] Field Guide to Wild American Pulp Artists. Accessed Sept. 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; two ''[[St. Louis Star]]'' senior employees, purchased the company in 1922. As the popularity of the Sunday color comic section increased, the funnies quickly evolved into an American institution, and metropolitan papers increasingly began featuring comic supplements. As the first major printer of color sections, World Color Press was often the first choice for printing these sections, and by the early 1930s, the company had printing contracts with newspapers nationwide.

In the early 1930s, realizing the sales potential of the comics medium, company management attempted to maximize profits by reprinting the funnies in magazine format, thereby creating one of the first prototypes of the [[comic book]]. While the initial comic books were simply collections of previously published editions of the Sunday comic strips, by 1936 they contained original material.

World Color made the most of the idea and quickly emerged as the leading printer in this new field. To keep up with ever-increasing demand, the company began construction of a satellite printing plant in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. Opened in 1948, the Sparta plant was the most technologically advanced plant in the industry devoted solely to the printing of comic magazines. 

Within five years World Color Press became the largest producer of comic magazines in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Ynostroza, Roger, "The Colorful World of World Color Press," ''Graphic Arts Monthly'' (June 1978), pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book sales boomed during [[World War II]] and the postwar period, and throughout this period, World Color was the nation's leading comic book printer. (Comics were the most popular form of newsstand magazine.) 

In 1956, the company installed one of the first web-[[offset press]]es in its Sparta plant. This innovative printing process, in which rolls or "webs" of paper are fed through rubber-blanketed cylinders, producing tens of thousands of impressions an hour, helped lead the industry into the modern era of print technology. By the early 1970s, World Color purchased more equipment and expanded their plants, becoming the largest player in the comic and newsstand special-interest publication market.&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg96.html "Tales From the Database: Evolution of the Direct Market Part II,"] Mile High Comics (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s World Color Press printed most American comic books, including those of the industry giants [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, KC. [http://westfieldcomics.com/blog/interviews-and-columns/kc-column-scaling-mount-baron/ "KC Column: Scaling Mount Baron,"] Westfield Comics (Nov. 16, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
World Color's dominance in the field led to a 1984 lawsuit by Illinois-based [[First Comics]], accusing them of anti-competitive practices.&lt;ref&gt;"First Comics Sues Marvel Comics for Anti-Competitive Activities," ''The Comics Journal'' #89 (May 1984), p. 8: Involves World Color Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was resolved in the spring of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;"First vs. Marvel and World Color," ''The Comics Journal'' #102 (September 1985), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"First Awaits Court Verdict," ''The Comics Journal''  #121 (April 1988), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, DC Comics named World Color Press as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = [[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = World Color Press Fifty Years of Printing Comics| title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics| page = 29| panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversification and growth ===
The development of the web-press in the 1950s enabled World Color to further diversify into the relatively new product lines of web-printed newsstand and special interest magazines. Equally important to the company's growth during the 1950s was its development of the "pool shipping" concept, a distribution method in which publications from different customers going to the same destination were shipped together, reducing freight costs and increasing the timeliness of deliveries. By establishing the first major pool shipping network to newsstands, the company was able to expand its customer base by offering the lowest distribution costs in the industry.

World Color computerized many aspects of its business in the 1960s, providing the company with more efficient production and distribution capabilities, as well as the ability to perform more complicated printing procedures and reproduce more complex data. In 1969, World Color started construction of a web-offset facility in [[Effingham, Illinois]], approximately 120 miles northeast of Sparta. The new plant was designed to produce magazines printed on coated paper with extensive use of [[four-color printing]]. Success in this arena led to a 1971 expansion of the Effingham plant that nearly doubled its original size. The 1971 addition increased the company's ability to produce large-circulation monthly magazines printed on letter-press equipment.

Responding to a need to increase the company's flexibility in scheduling presses, in 1970, the company standardized the make and type of its presses.&lt;ref&gt;"World Color Shortens Cutoff," ''Graphic Arts Monthly'' (May 1986), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; This change was expected to result in paper savings, more consistent quality, and schedule flexibility. Though it was a short-term risk, the strategy paid off with its clients, enabling the company to become a stronger competitor in the four-color, high-quality magazine market.

In 1975, the company expanded its gravure division by constructing a plant between Effingham and Sparta. Further expansions in client-base led to the 1980 construction of another new plant in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]]. By the beginning of the 1980s, the company had emerged as the leader in the printing and distribution of consumer publications, with sales of more than $371 million.&lt;ref name="Estabrook"&gt;Estabrook, Jody, "Market Strategy is Client-Oriented," ''Graphic Arts Monthly'' (May 1990), pp. 126–130.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, World Color added seven state-of-the-art printing facilities, strategically located throughout the United States, strengthening the company's reputation for providing low distribution costs.&lt;ref&gt;Hattrup, Joseph A., "Programmable Controllers in the Magazine Bindery," ''Graphic Arts Monthly'' (June 1985), pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, World Color Press was listed as the fourth largest printer in North America, with sales totaling $544 million.&lt;ref name="Estabrook" /&gt;

By 1993, World Color's core business was magazine printing; contracts with hundreds of leading periodicals, including ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'', accounted for approximately half of the company's 1993 revenues. (The company came to the aid of competitor [[R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons]] in January 1995, printing 300,000 issues of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine for Donnelley after flood waters forced the closing of a Donnelley plant near Los Angeles.)&lt;ref&gt;"To Our Readers," ''People'' (Jan. 23, 1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, World Color expanded its operations into a number of specialty services: catalog printing contracts generated more than a fifth of total revenues in 1993, and represented the company's fastest growing division.

== Business acquisitions and mergers ==
World Color's early dominance in the comics market led the company to diversify, their first move being the 1928 purchase of another St. Louis-based printer, Commercial Color Press, which specialized in printing weekly newspapers and circulars. This diversification helped the company survive the lean years of the [[Great Depression]]. 

In 1968, World Color was purchased by New York-based City Investing, prompting World Color to move its headquarters from St. Louis to New York.

In 1974, as World Color shifted focus to the high-end magazine market, the company purchased Louisville, Kentucky-based Fawcett Printing. This acquisition enabled World Color Press to add the [[rotogravure]] printing process to its repertoire.

In 1984, the investment giant [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.]] bought World Color from City Investing, providing the company with continued financial backing. In 1989, World Color acquired Chicago's Bradley Printing, and in December 1991, they acquired California's third-largest printer, George Rice &amp; Sons.&lt;ref&gt;"World Color to Buy George Rice &amp; Sons," ''Printing Impressions'' (Jan. 1994), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1993, they purchased catalog/[[direct mail]] printer Alden Press.&lt;ref&gt;"Hot Presses," ''Delaney Report'' (Jan. 25, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/business/company-news-kohlberg-unit-to-buy-alden-press.html "Company News: Kohlberg Unit to Buy Alden Press,"] ''New York Times'' (Jan. 19, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; With these acquisitions, in just a few years World Color became a major player in the catalog and commercial publishing arenas.&lt;ref&gt;"KKR's World Color Sets Another Acquisition," ''Buyouts'' (Dec. 6, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

World Color pursued major expansions in 1996 and 1997, purchasing [[Ringier|Ringier America]] and [[Rand McNally]]'s Book Services Group, thereby becoming second in size only to [[RR Donnelley]]. In 1999, the company merged with [[Quebecor Printing]] in a U.S. $2.7 billion deal to create [[Quebecor World|Quebecor World (USA) Inc.]], moving its headquarters to [[Montreal]]. At the time of the merger, World Color operated 17 production, distribution, and sales facilities throughout the United States.

=== Financial struggles ===
Quebecor World entered a difficult period in the early 2000s as the market has gradually shifted focus to [[digital media]]. Quebecor World filed for [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] protection on January 21, 2008, at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In May 2009, [[RR Donnelley]] tendered an unsolicited bid to purchase Quebecor World;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2010/01/26/quebecor-world-quad-graphics-takeover.html "U.S. printer to swallow former Quebecor World,"] CBS News (Jan. 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; this was rejected as the company emerged from creditor protection in July 2009 (having changed its name back to "Worldcolor Press").&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; On July 2, 2010, [[Quad/Graphics]] purchased Worldcolor.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;
