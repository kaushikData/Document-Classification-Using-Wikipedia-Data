      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6859">In [[rugby union]], the '''"99" call''' was a policy of simultaneous retaliation by the [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] during their [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974 tour to South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Dolan |date=15 May 2009 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/jpr-williams-remembers-the-call-of-99-1676796.html |title= JPR Williams remembers the call of 99|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was marred by on-pitch violence, which the match officials did little to control and the relative absence of cameras compared to the modern game made citing and punishment after the fact unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |date=21 April 2009 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/extra/628655-lions-rampant-the-1974-south-africa-tour-and-that-amazing-punch-up |title=Lions rampant - The 1974 South Africa tour and that amazing punch-up |newspaper=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"According to the captain, Willie John McBride, the call was supposed to be '999'- for emergency - but he never had time to shout out the third '9'!"({{cite web| url=http://www.englandrugby.com/mm/Document/General/General/01/30/48/06/museum_britishlionspanels_English.pdf |title=‘A Pride of Lions’ Presented by Genesis Publications|publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] [[World Rugby Museum|Rugby Museum]]|page=7 }}) }}

Lions' captain [[Willie John McBride]] therefore instigated a policy of "one in, all in" - that is, when one Lion retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-2006&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Doyle |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/smalltalk/story/0,,1888496,00.html |title=Small talk: JPR Williams |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] Unlimited |date=6 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120133505/http://sport.guardian.co.uk/smalltalk/story/0%2C%2C1888496%2C00.html |archivedate=20 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, the referee would be unable to identify any single instigator and so would be left with the choice of sending off all or none of the team. In this respect, the "99" call was extremely successful, as no Lions player was sent off during the tour.

According to former [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales international]] and Lion [[John Taylor (rugby union born 1945)|John Taylor]], the 99 call resulted from an incident that occurred during the Lions' [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968 South Africa tour]] that saw [[John O'Shea (rugby player)|John O'Shea]] become the first and to date only Lion to have been sent off during a Lions tour. In 2013, Taylor recalled that during a Lions tour match against [[Falcons (rugby team)|Eastern Transvaal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/205863.html |title='We were charging round getting battered' |first=John |last=Taylor |authorlink=John Taylor (rugby union born 1945) |publisher=ESPN Scrum |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A scuffle broke out amongst the forwards (handbags – no damage) and Tess (O'Shea) was isolated by half a dozen home forwards. When the dust settled the home referee singled him out (the only Lion involved) and dismissed him. . . . Willie John rushed down from the stand to offer protection, dealing peremptorily with one idiot as he tried to attack Tess, and this was the genesis of the infamous '99' call six years later in 1974.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="948">An '''abuse prevention program''' is a social program designed to help [[parent]]s and [[teacher]]s recognize the signs of violence in an [[Child abuse|abused child]] and teaches how to explain abuse protection to them. These programs also help children in establishing [[self-esteem]].

An alternate definition of '''abuse prevention programme''' describes those projects which identify risk indicators such as [[poverty]], poor housing, inadequate educational facilities etc. and aim to reduce the impact of such indicators, either through social reform or through developing parents and children's coping strategies.

'''Benjamin Rush "Ben" Milam''' (October 20, 1788 – December 7, 1835) was an American colonist of [[Mexican Texas]] and a military leader and hero of the [[Texas Revolution]]. A native of what is now [[Kentucky]], Milam fought beside American interests during the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and later joined the [[Texian]]s in their own fight for independence, for which he assumed a leadership role. Persuading the weary Texians not to back down during the [[Siege of Béxar]], Milam was killed in action while leading an assault into the city that eventually resulted in the Mexican Army's surrender. [[Milam County, Texas]] and the town of [[Milam, Texas|Milam]] are named in his honor, as are many other placenames and civic works throughout Texas.

==Early life==
Ben Milam was born in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] on October 20, 1788, when Kentucky was still considered part of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=txcol&gt;[https://baylorarchives.cuadra.com/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?Gsjy6rUBT@IhJBxjSssjFC4RceToNhJnKFAAukDbnSInA4KNDUICHJaA6y.UeikjMgML1SS47k53n1F1qdjxkgdTBnAZ5VGnMfOa2SeF74Y/0001nx.xml  Ben Milam Papers] #3806, The Texas Collection, Baylor University.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth of six children born to Moses Milam and his wife, Elizabeth Pattie Boyd. Raised in the remote western frontier of the early [[United States]], Milam had little formal schooling. As a young man, he enlisted as a private in the 8th Regiment of the Kentucky Militia and eventually was commissioned a lieutenant. He served in the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=tshahandbook&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garver|first1=Lois|title=MILAM, BENJAMIN RUSH|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmi03|website=The Handbook of Texas|publisher=Texas State Historical Society|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years in Texas==
In 1818, after learning of the trading opportunities with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living along the upper [[Red River of the South|Red River]], Milam traveled from Kentucky to [[Spanish Texas]] to trade with the [[Comanche]].&lt;ref name=txcol /&gt;&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; While there, he met [[David G. Burnet]], who at the time was living with the Indians in an attempt to recover from a case of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; In [[New Orleans]] in 1819, Milam met [[José Félix Trespalacios]] and [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]], who intended to lead a [[filibuster (military)|filibustering]] expedition to Texas to help [[Mexico|Mexican]] revolutionaries in their [[Mexican War of Independence|ongoing fight]] for independence from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; Milam decided to join the pair on what became known as the [[Long Expedition]].&lt;ref name=txcol /&gt;&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt;

The expedition captured [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] in the summer of 1819 but fell apart when confronted by a Spanish army. With help from Milam, Long regrouped his forces near [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] the following year. By 1821, Milam had broke with Long's new expedition. While Long marched to [[Presidio La Bahía]], Milam and Trespalacios traveled to [[Veracruz]] and [[Mexico City]]; both parties met a hostile reception and were quickly imprisoned.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; While in prison, Long was mysteriously shot and killed by a guard, and Milam came to believe that the murder had been arranged by Trespalacios.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; This incident drove Milam and some of his friends to plot to kill Trespalacios, and when that plot was discovered, Milam was again imprisoned.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; Milam and his friends were sent to Mexico City, where they were held until the fall of 1822, when [[Joel R. Poinsett]], U.S. Commissioner of Observation to Mexico, secured their freedom. With the exception of Milam, all were returned to the United States on the [[sloop-of-war]] [[USS John Adams (1799)|USS ''John Adams'']].&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt;

By the spring of 1824, Milam had returned to Mexico, which was adopting the new republican form of government established by the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. Trespalacios and Milam reconciled, and Milam was granted Mexican citizenship and commissioned as a [[colonel]] in the [[Mexican Army]].&lt;ref name=txcol /&gt;&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt;

==Texas Revolution==
[[File:Milam meets Texan troops.jpg|thumb|left|Milam joins the [[Texian Army|Texian]] soldiers]]
{{main|Texas Revolution}}
In 1825, Milam and [[Arthur G. Wavell]], an English general in the Mexican Army, became partners in a silver mine operation in [[Nuevo León]].&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; The two also obtained ''[[empresario]]'' grants in Texas. In 1829, Milam sought to organize a new mining company in partnership with David G. Burnet, but their efforts failed due to a lack of funds. Milam and Wavell's empresarial efforts also failed when their contract was canceled by the Mexican government for an insufficient supply of new citizens for their colony in Texas, following [[Law of April 6, 1830|a new law]] passed in 1830.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; In 1835, Milam went to [[Monclova]], the capital of [[Coahuila y Texas]], to urge the new governor, Agustín Viesca, to send a land commissioner to Texas to provide settlers there with land titles. However, before Milam could leave the city, word arrived that Mexican President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] had overthrown the representative federal government and established a dictatorship.&lt;ref name=txcol /&gt; Governor Viesca fled with Milam, but both were captured and imprisoned at [[Monterrey]]. Milam eventually escaped thanks to sympathetic jailers, who also supplied him with a horse.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt;

By chance, Milam encountered a company of [[Texian]] soldiers commanded by George Collinsworth, from whom he learned of the movement for independence in Texas. Milam joined them, helping to [[Battle of Goliad|capture Goliad]] on October 10, 1835.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; He wrote: "I assisted Texas to gain her independence. I have endured heat and cold, hunger and thirst; I have borne losses and suffered persecutions; I have been a tenant of every prison between this and Mexico. But the events of this night have compensated me for all my losses and all my sufferings."

He then joined the main [[Texian Army]] in its attempt to expel all Mexican forces from Texas by capturing [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] in the ongoing [[Siege of Béxar]]. While returning from a scouting mission in the southwest on December 4, 1835, Milam learned that a majority of the army was considering retreating into winter quarters instead of continuing on with the planned attack on San Antonio.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; Commander [[Edward Burleson]] and his council of officers were reluctant to attack, and the next day at 3 PM, Milam went to Burleson's tent to ask permission to call for volunteers to storm the city. Burleson had little choice but to go along with Milam's plan. Milam was convinced that putting off the final assault on San Antonio would be a disaster for the cause of independence.&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; He then made his famous impassioned plea: "Who will go with old Ben Milam into San Antonio?" Three hundred men cheered their support for Milam and volunteered to attack at dawn on December 5.&lt;ref name=txcol /&gt;&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt;

Plans were quickly made for a two-column surprise attack. The volunteers would form at an abandoned mill, Molino Blanco or Zambrano's mill, at 3 AM, while Burleson would hold the rest of the army in reserve. At the same time, Captain James C. Neil would open fire on the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]], the center of the Mexican Army's defensive position, with two cannons to distract the Mexican soldiers. Early on December 5, Colonel Milam and Colonel [[Frank W. Johnson]] each led a column of attackers into the heavily fortified city, where they eventually seized a foothold and entrenched their position overnight.

On December 7, 1835, the Texians renewed the attack and progressed further into the city, capturing another foothold, but Milam was killed while leading the attack. Standing with Johnson and [[Henry Karnes]] near the Veramendi house, Milam had been trying to observe the [[Cathedral of San Fernando|San Fernando church]] tower with a field telescope given to him by [[Stephen F. Austin]] when he was shot in the head by a Mexican rifleman and killed instantly.&lt;ref name=txcol /&gt;&lt;ref name=tshahandbook /&gt; He fell into the arms of [[Samuel Maverick]]. Robert Morris was chosen to take over Milam's command of the first division.

The Mexican Army lost more than 400 killed, deserted, or wounded in the ensuing battle. Texian losses were only 20 to 30 killed. The siege ended on December 9, 1835, when General [[Martín Perfecto de Cos]] sent a subordinate to negotiate a truce with the Texians. Morris gave Cos and his troops six days to leave the Alamo. Burleson provided the Mexican Army with as many supplies as he could spare, and the Mexican wounded were allowed to remain behind to be treated by Texian doctors.

A '''collop''' is a slice of meat, according to one definition in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. In [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]], "collops" came to refer specifically to slices of [[Bacon#United Kingdom and Ireland|bacon]].  [[Shrove Monday]], also known as Collop Monday, was traditionally the last day to cook and eat meat before [[Ash Wednesday]], which was a day of fasting and abstinence from meat, and part of pre-[[Lent]]en activities. A traditional [[breakfast]] dish was collops of bacon topped with a fried [[egg (food)|egg]].&lt;ref name="Brand1849"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brand|first=John|title=Observations on popular antiquities of Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P30IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=22 February 2015|year=1849|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|location=London|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Christ's Hospital]], which was founded before the reign of Elizabeth the First, the word collops was used on the menu to mean stewed minced beef.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Scotch collops are a traditional [[Scotland|Scottish]] dish. It can be created using either thin slices or minced meat of either [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[venison]]. This is combined with [[onion]], [[salt]], [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[suet]], then stewed, baked or roasted with optional flavourings according to the meat used. It is traditionally served garnished with thin toast and mashed potato.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrsbeeton.com/19-chapter19.html#870]&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as a meal in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel, ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]''.

Lamb collops were included on the breakfast menu for first class passengers of the Titanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Class Breakfast Menu R.M.S.

==Etymology==
The derivation is obscure; the OED cites that it may be related to the old Swedish word ''kollops'' (equivalent to the modern: ''kalops),'' but also suggests a German origin (''klops'').&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed 8 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish restaurateur Tore Wretman derives the modern Swedish ''kalops'' from the English ''collops'', which in turn is said to originate from Swedish word ''colhoppe'' (ember-hops, from how the thin sliced strips of dried salted leg of mutton danced on the glowing hot skillet) that was well established in the Swedish language in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Svensk husmanskost'', Tore Wretman 1967; {{ISBN|91-7642-057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''computational learning theory''' (or just '''learning theory''') is a subfield of [[Artificial Intelligence]] devoted to studying the design and analysis of [[machine learning]] algorithms.&lt;ref name="ACL"&gt;http://www.learningtheory.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called [[supervised learning]].  In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way.  For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible.  The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier.  This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm.  The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimise some measure of performance such as minimising the number of mistakes made on new samples.

In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In
computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [[polynomial time]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} There are two kinds of time
complexity results:

* Positive results{{spaced ndash}}Showing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.
* Negative results{{spaced ndash}}Showing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.

Negative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} such as:

* Computational complexity – [[P versus NP problem|P &amp;ne; NP (the P versus NP problem)]];
* [[cryptography|Cryptographic]] – [[One-way function]]s exist.

There are several different approaches to computational learning theory.  These differences are based on making assumptions about the
[[inference]] principles used to generalize from limited data.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  This includes different definitions of [[probability]] (see [[frequency probability]], [[Bayesian probability]]) and different assumptions on the generation of samples.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The different approaches include:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

* [[Exact learning]], proposed by [[Dana Angluin]];
* [[Probably approximately correct learning]] (PAC learning), proposed by [[Leslie Valiant]];
* [[VC theory]], proposed by [[Vladimir Vapnik]] and [[Alexey Chervonenkis]];
* [[Bayesian inference]];
* [[Algorithmic learning theory]], from the work of [[E. Mark Gold]];
* [[Online machine learning]], from the work of Nick Littlestone.

Computational learning theory has led to several practical algorithms.{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} For example, PAC theory inspired [[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|boosting]], VC theory led to [[support vector machine]]s, and Bayesian inference led to [[belief networks]] (by [[Judea Pearl]]).

'''Dan Daniel''' (born '''Wilbur Clarence Daniel'''; May 12, 1914 &amp;ndash; January 23, 1988) was a Member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Virginia]], serving from 1969 until his death from a heart attack in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] in 1988. He previously served as the National Commander of [[American Legion|The American Legion]] from 1956 to 1957.

== Life ==
Born in [[Chatham, Virginia|Chatham]], [[Virginia]], Dan Daniel grew up on a tobacco farm in [[Mecklenburg County, Virginia|Mecklenburg County]]. He was educated in Virginia schools, and was a graduate of Dan River Textile School, [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]], [[Virginia]]. Danville, on the [[Dan River]], was at the time a center for the tobacco and textile industries. The name of the school references the textile industry, and the town is known for the Dan River textile mill, which was founded in 1883 and closed in 2006. From 1939 to 1968, except for a period of service in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]], he was associated with Dan River Mills (present day Dan River, Inc.), the textile industry that operated a mill on the [[Dan River]]. He advanced through the ranks of the textile business to become assistant to the chairman of the board at Dan River Mills. He was elected commander of The American Legion's Department of Virginia in 1951, and National Commander in 1956. He was elected to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] from 1959 to 1968, was President of the Virginia [[Chamber of Commerce]] in 1968, and was a permanent member of the President's People-to-People Committee (now [[People to People International]]). He was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[91st United States Congress]] and to nine succeeding congresses, serving from January 3, 1969, until his death from a heart attack at the [[University of Virginia Health System|University of Virginia Medical Center]] in Charlottesville, on January 23, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/24/obituaries/dan-daniel-virginia-congressman-is-dead-at-73.html |title=Dan Daniel, Virginia Congressman, is Dead at 73 |publisher=New York Times |date=January 24, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in Highland Burial Park in Danville, Virginia.

'''Jeffrey Baldwin''' (20 January 1997 – 30 November 2002) was a Canadian child whose death from [[septic shock]] after years of mistreatment by his grandparents, '''Elva Bottineau''' and '''Norman Kidman''', led to significant changes in policy by children's aid societies in the granting of [[Child custody|custody of children]] to relatives.

== Life ==

Jeffrey was born in the Doctor's Hospital, now part of the [[Toronto Western Hospital]], in [[Toronto]], the son of Yvonne Kidman and Richard Baldwin. On 28 April 1998, he and his older sister were taken by the Catholic Children's Aid Society after allegations of abuse were levelled against their parents.  They were given into the custody of their maternal grandparents, Elva Bottineau and Norman Kidman.

In 2000, a worker with the Catholic Children's Aid Society noticed a bruise under Jeffrey's eye, but this was dismissed as an accident and no action was taken.

According to later court testimony, Jeffrey and his sister were kept in a locked room at night with furnace vents shut, and when released were forced to eat with their hands from a mat on the floor. James Mills, the boyfriend of Jeffrey's aunt who also lived in the house, declared that Jeffrey's grandmother did not love him or his sister and that they were purely a "dollars and cents" matter, as his grandparents received social assistance for their care.

On the evening of 30 November 2002, the grandparents called 911 to report that Jeffrey was no longer breathing.  Upon arrival, emergency workers noticed that his body was "covered in sores, bruises and abrasions".  His weight at death was slightly less than his weight at his first birthday, almost five years earlier.

== Court case ==
On 19 March 2003, the grandparents were arrested and charged with [[Murder (Canadian law)|second-degree murder]] for their role in his death. The court declared they had kept Jeffrey locked in a bedroom, where he lived in his own feces, and left him to drink from a toilet.  The judge was told that the pair used the children as a source of income, collecting government support checks while offering little in return.  On 7 April 2006, they were convicted of second-degree murder by [[David Watt (judge)|Justice David Watt]] in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].  Sentencing was delivered on 9 June 2006.  Bottineau was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment (until 2028) and Kidman 20 years (until 2026), before they respectively become eligible for parole.

== Statue ==
On 22 November 2013, Todd Boyce, a fellow Canadian unrelated to Jeffrey Baldwin, started a $25,000 [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Indiegogo]] over two months to erect a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze statue]] in Greenwood Park, Toronto depicting Jeffrey dressed as [[Superman]], a superhero he loved. $36,015 was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jeffrey-baldwin-memorial|title=Jeffrey Baldwin Memorial|publisher=[[Indiegogo]]|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, [[DC Comics]] denied permission to use the "S" in the [[Superman logo]] on the statue. However, the decision was later reversed and the use of the logo was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/07/09/jeffrey_baldwin_statue_will_get_its_superman_shield.html|title=Jeffrey Baldwin statue will get its Superman shield|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|first=Jacques|last=Gallant|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was unveiled in the park on 18 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jeffrey-baldwin-statue-unveiled-in-greenwood-park-1.2804796|title=Jeffrey Baldwin statue unveiled in Greenwood Park|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brigadier General|Brigadier-General]] '''Donald Robert Agnew,''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CB|CBE|CD|ADC}} (born October 25, 1897– 1968)  was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] general and educator.

==Family==
Agnew was born in Toronto on October 25, 1897 to Major John Agnew and Daisy Edith Stocks. Following the death of Daisy Edith Stocks in 1902, Major John Agnew married Elizabeth Dickenson, of Toronto.
Major John Agnew, 127th Battalion, Canadian Infantry, served overseas in World War I, along with his three sons,  Lt. Donald Agnew, of the Canadian Reserve Artillery, Lt. Ellis Agnew, 351 Brigade R.F.A., and Lt. Ronald Agnew, of the Royal Canadian Navy. While her husband and sons were overseas during the war, Mrs. Elizabeth Agnew moved temporarily to Hamilton, Ont.

==Education==
Agnew was educated at the [[University of Toronto Schools]]. He studied at the [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]], student # 1137 in 1915.

==Career==
He returned to [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]] in Kingston as Commandant and [[Aide-de-Camp|ADC]] to the Governor-General (1947–54). At the time, RMC was the only military college with a four-year course, the course was 15 percent military content. During this period, the New One Hundred Opening Ceremonies were held (20 September 1948). He devised a new system of organization at RMC consisting of a vice-commandant as director of studies, to coordinate the military and academic training at RMC and to represent RMC at the National Conference of Canadian Universities as the equivalent of a vce-principal. The commandant personally commanded the cadet battalion. A staff-adjutant issued the routine orders.

He presided over the New One Hundred Opening Ceremonies at the [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]] on 20 September 1948. He inaugurated the Old Brigade, for alumni celebrating 50 years since they entered one of the Canadian Royal Military Colleges in 1950. He was photographed as Commandant of [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]] when [[Queen Elizabeth II]], who was known as Princess Elizabeth before her accession, and [[Prince Philip]] visited on 12 October 1951.

It is related to, or also known as, '''financial abuse,''' which is the illegal or unauthorized use of a person’s property, money, pension book or other valuables (including changing the person's [[will (law)|will]] to name the abuser as heir), often fraudulently obtaining [[power of attorney]], followed by deprivation of money or other property, or by eviction from own home. Financial abuse applies to both [[elder abuse]] and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnot|first=Edward J.|title=Is Your Parent in Good Hands?: Protecting Your Aging Parent from Financial Abuse and Neglect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOFrtWIKrncC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2004|publisher=Capital Books|isbn=978-1-931868-37-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinction between economic abuse and financial abuse is that economic abuse also includes the control of someone's present or future earning potential by preventing them from obtaining a job or education.

==Role in domestic violence==
Economic abuse in a domestic situation may involve:
* preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, such as restricting their ability to find employment, maintain or advance their careers, and acquire assets
* preventing the victim from obtaining education
* spend victim's money without his or her consent and creating debt, or completely spend victim's savings to limit available resources
* exploiting economic resources of the victim&lt;ref name="Adams (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brewster |first=M. P. |title=Power and Control Dynamics in Pre-stalking and Stalking Situations |journal=Journal of Family Violence |year=2003 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1023/A:1024064214054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders (2004)"/&gt;

In its extreme (and usual) form, this involves putting the [[Victimisation|victim]] on a strict "allowance", withholding money at will and forcing the victim to beg for the money until the abuser gives the victim some money. It is common for the victim to receive less and less money as the abuse continues. This also includes (but is not limited to) preventing the victim from finishing [[education]] or obtaining [[employment]], or intentionally squandering or misusing communal resources.&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Abuse". BSAFE. September 6, 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlling mechanism===
Economic abuse is often used as a [[Abusive power and control|controlling mechanism]] as part of a larger pattern of domestic abuse, which may include [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]]. Physical abuse may include threats or attempts to kill the spouse. By restricting the victim's access to economic resources, the offender has limited recourses to exit the abusive or violent relationship.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel'']. Women's Domestic Abuse Helpline.  Retrieved December 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are ways that abusers may use economic abuse with other forms of domestic violence:
* Using physical force, or threat of violence, to get money.
* Providing money for sexual activity.
* Controlling access to a telephone, vehicle or ability to go shopping; other forms of [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]].
* Threatening to evict the spouse and children from the house without financial support.
* Exploiting the victim's economic disadvantage.
* Destroying or taking resources from the spouse and/or children.
* [[Blaming the victim]] for an inability to manage money; or instigating other forms of economic abuse, such as destruction of property.&lt;ref name=wdachoices/&gt;

[[Victimization]] occurs across all socio-economic levels, and when victims are asked why they stay in abusive relationships, "lack of income" is a common response.&lt;ref name=ncadv&gt;[http://www.ncadv.org/files/EconomicAbuse.pdf ''Economic Abuse.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228000000/http://www.ncadv.org/files/EconomicAbuse.pdf |date=February 28, 2013 }} National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job-related impacts===
There are several ways that abusers may impact a victim's economic resources.  As mentioned earlier, the abuser may prevent the victim from working or make it very difficult to maintain a job.  They may likewise impede their ability to obtain an education.  Frequent phone calls, surprise visits and other harassing activities interfere with the spouse's work performance. In couples in which the spouse is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning of their sexuality ([[LGBTQ]]), the abuser may threaten to "out them" with their employer.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

The [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] in the [[United States]] reports that:
* 25% – 50% of victims of abuse from a partner have lost their job due to domestic violence.
* 35% – 56% of victims of domestic violence are harassed at work by their partners.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

===Impact of lack of economic resources===
By denying the victim access to money, such as forbidding the victim from maintaining a bank account, he or she is totally financially dependent upon the abuser for shelter, food, clothing and other necessities.  In some cases the abuser may withhold those necessities, also including medicine and personal hygiene products. They may also greatly limit their ability to leave the abusive situation by refusing to pay court-ordered spousal or child support.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

Abusers may also use force their spouses to obtain credit and then through negligent activities ruin their credit rating and ability to get credit.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

===Managing economic abuse===
There are several ways to manage economic abuse: ensure one has safe access to important personal and financial records, ensure one's research activities are not traceable and, if you believe you are going to leave the relationship, prepare ahead of time.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Role in elder abuse==
{{main article|Elder financial abuse}}

The elderly are sometimes victims of financial abuse from people within their family:
* Money or property is used without their permission or taken from them
* Their signature is forged for financial transactions
* Coerced or influence to sign over deeds, wills or power of attorney
* Deceived into believing that money is exchanged for the promise of lifelong care&lt;ref name=NCPEA&gt;[http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html ''Financial Abuse.''] National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (NCPEA). 2008. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of "entitlement" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person.  Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or substance abuse.&lt;ref name=NCPEA/&gt;

It is estimated that there may be 5 million elderly citizens of the United States subject to financial abuse each year.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Laws==

===United States===
The Survivors’ Empowerment and Economic Security Act was introduced by the [[110th United States Congress]] to the Senate (S. 1136) and House of Representatives (H.R. 2395) to allow for greater economic freedom for domestic violence victims by providing short-term emergency benefits where needed, guaranteeing employment leave and unemployment compensation, and prohibit insurance restriction or job discrimination to domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

'''Electrooculography''' ('''EOG''') is a technique for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye.  The resulting signal is called the electrooculogram. Primary applications are in [[ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] [[diagnosis]] and in recording [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].  Unlike the [[electroretinography|electroretinogram]], the EOG does not measure response to individual visual stimuli.

To measure eye movement, pairs of electrodes are typically placed either above and below the eye or to the left and right of the eye. If the eye moves from center position toward one of the two electrodes, this electrode "sees" the positive side of the retina and the opposite electrode "sees" the negative side of the retina. Consequently, a potential difference occurs between the electrodes. Assuming that the resting potential is constant, the recorded potential is a measure of the eye's position.

==Principle==
The eye acts as a [[dipole]] in which the anterior pole is positive and the posterior pole is negative.
# Left gaze: the [[cornea]] approaches the electrode near the outer canthus of the left eye, resulting in a negative-trending change in the recorded potential difference.
# Right gaze: the cornea approaches the electrode near the inner [[canthus]] of the left eye, resulting in a positive-trending change in the recorded potential difference.

==Ophthalmological diagnosis==
The EOG is used to assess the function of the [[pigment epithelium]]. During [[Adaptation (eye)|dark adaptation]], resting potential decreases slightly and reaches a minimum ("dark trough") after several minutes. When light is switched on, a substantial increase of the resting potential occurs ("light peak"), which drops off after a few minutes when the retina adapts to the light. The ratio of the voltages (i.e. ''light peak'' divided by ''dark trough'') is known as the ''Arden ratio''. In practice, the measurement is similar to eye movement recordings (see above). The patient is asked to switch eye position repeatedly between two points (alternating looking from center to the left and from center to the right). Since these positions are constant, a change in the recorded potential originates from a change in the resting potential.

==Application in entertainment==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}{{confusing|section|date=November 2011}}}}
Electrooculography was used by [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Jerome Chen (special effects artist)|Jerome Chen]], the visual effects supervisor in the movie ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', to enhance the [[performance capture]] by correctly animating the eye movements of the actors. The result was an improvement over the technique used for the film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]''.

Electrooculography, in addition to other neuromuscular signals, is used as a computer input method by the [[Neural Impulse Actuator]].

'''Carlos Luis Federico de Brandsen'''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes written Brandtzen or Brandzen. The surname is of Dutch origin (and probably Danish before that) and the correct form is Brandsen (Salas 1909, pág. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Paris]], November 28, 1785 &amp;ndash; [[Battle of Ituzaingó]], February 20, 1827)&lt;ref&gt;Salas, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; was a Coronel of [[France|French]] origin who fought in many of the South American wars of independence and for [[Argentina]] in the [[Cisplatine War|War with Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Enrique de Gandía|de Gandía]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

== Napoleonic Wars ==
In 1811 Brandsen joined the army of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian Kingdom]] who fought alongside [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] In the Germany campaign he was injured in three separate battles and gained the rank of captain. After the abdication of Napoleon in 1813 and the dissolution of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian Kingdom]] in 1814, Brandsen returned to France where he fought in the [[Hundred Days]], receiving another injury.

== Liberation of Chile and Peru ==
In 1817 the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended. Brandsen met at that time [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] (who would later become the President of Argentina in 1826) who convinced him to join the fight to liberate the Americas from the [[Spanish Empire]]. He then embarked for [[Buenos Aires]] and on December 19, 1817, the [[United Provinces of South America]] gave him the rank of Captain of the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]]. Brandsen fought in the [[Chilean War of Independence]] under the command of [[José de San Martín|General San Martín]]. He also fought in the [[Bío-Bío River|Bío-Bío]] campaign and the "Expedición Libertadora del Perú".
 
In the battle of Nazca he distinguished himself alongside Major [[Juan Lavalle]]. On November 8, 1820 in [[Chancay]] he fought valiantly with a group of 36 men against a force of around 200; after this battle he was made sergeant major.

When San Martín became Protector of Peru, Brandsen was named leader of the regiment of Hussars of the Peruvian Legion of the Guard, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. San Martin had great affection for Brandsen with whom he maintained frequent correspondence. Brandsen was promoted to colonel on September 17, 1822. He commanded his regiment to a victory in [[Zepita]], and as general commander of the Cavalry of the Vanguard of the Army of Peru he fought at [[Sica-Sica]] and [[Ayo-Ayo]] holding up the hostile pursuit and saving the remainders of the army defeated in those encounters. In 1822 and 1823 he participated actively in the operations against the royal forces.

At the end of 1823 he took the side of President [[José de la Riva Agüero]] in the dispute with [[Antonio José de Sucre]].  De la Riva Agüero was promoted to brigadier general, but with the dissolution of the army that followed him. Brandsen was put in prison and then [[Simón Bolívar]] gave the order for his exile. This order was later rescinded but Brandsen and his wife had already embarked to Chile.

== War with Brazil ==
[[File:Brandsen en Ituzaingo.JPG|thumb|Death of Brandsen at the [[Battle of Ituzaingó]].]]
At the beginning of March 1825 he embarked with his family on a ship called "Livonia" destined for Chile. After a brief stay in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] he returned to the [[Río de la Plata]] where the government made him the leader of the 1st Cavalry Regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel. On February 20, 1827 in the [[Battle of Ituzaingó]] his regiment was faced to the Brazilian infantry occupying a fortified position protected by a very deep ditch. General [[Carlos María de Alvear]], ordered him to attack head-on, but Brandsen told him that success was impossible in those conditions. Alvear did not accept his prudent arguments and he charged at the head of his troops, dying heroically.  The attack failed, but the battle was won because other colonels such as Tomás de Iriarte, Miguel Estanislao Soler and José María Paz, amended the errors of Alvear. Brandsen was posthumously promoted to colonel; his remains rest in the [[Cementerio de la Recoleta]], in Buenos Aires, in front of  the mausoleum of General Alvear.

== Legacy ==
The city of [[Brandsen]] and the administrative district [[Brandsen Partido]] are named in his honour, there is also a tank regiment named after him and numerous streets in Argentina bear his name.

== Notes ==
In 2011, the book "Charles Louis Frederic de Brandsen: Su Biografía", written by teacher Pablo Martin Agüero, was published and presented in Brandsen, Buenos Aires. The book was awarded by the "Honorable Concejo Deliberante" of that town and was supported by the "Junta de Estudios Históricos del Partido de Brandsen" and by Doctor Tomás Santa Coloma, one of Colonel Brandsen´s great-great-great grandsons. In 2012, Agüero uploaded a digital version of the book entitled "Historia de Carlos Luis Federico de Brandsen - Pablo Martin Aguero" and an
English version entitled "Charles Louis Frederic de Brandsen - His Biography" on the web site Scribd. In 2013, Agüero uploaded the Spanish digital version of the book on the web site SlideShare.

[[File:Cristofano dell'altissimo, ferrante gonzaga, ante 1568.JPG|thumbnail|Ferrante Gonzaga]]
'''Ferrante I Gonzaga''' (also '''Ferdinando I Gonzaga'''; 28 January 1507 – 15 November 1557) was an Italian [[condottiero]], a member of the [[House of Gonzaga]] and the founder of the branch of the Gonzaga of [[Guastalla]].

==Biography==
[[File:Guastalla-monumento Ferrante I Gonzaga2.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The Triumph of Ferrante Gonzaga over Envy by [[Leone Leoni]], [[Guastalla]], Italy.]]
He was born in [[Mantua]], the third son of [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] and [[Isabella d'Este]]. At the age of sixteen he was sent to the court of Spain as a page to the future emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], to whom Ferrante remained faithful for his whole life. In 1527 he took part in the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] and attended Charles' triumphant coronation at Bologna in 1530: at the death of [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon|Charles of Bourbon]] (1527) he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Imperial army in Italy. He became a Knight in the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in 1531.

He defended [[Naples]] from the assault of the French troops under [[Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec]], and obtained the surrender of the [[Republic of Florence]]. For this feat [[Pope Clement VII]], a member of the [[Medici]] who had been ousted from that city, named him papal governor of [[Benevento]]. Again for Charles V, he fought against the Turks at [[Tunis]] in 1535 and [[Algiers]] in 1543 with a contingent of 3,000 cavalry. He served Charles as [[Viceroy]] of Sicily (1535–1546), and [[Forte Gonzaga]] was named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castel Gonzaga|url=http://www.comune.messina.it/turismo/itinerari-turistici/fortificazioni/castel-gonzaga.aspx|website=Comune di Messina|accessdate=18 August 2015|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied the Emperor to Germany in 1543 and fought the resolute campaign that enforced the [[Treaty of Crépy]]. He then served as [[Governor of the Duchy of Milan]] (1546–1554), in which role he fought in the [[War of Parma]].

In 1529 Ferrante married [[Isabella di Capua]], who brought him the [[fiefdom]]s of [[Molfetta]] and [[Giovinazzo]]. In 1539 he bought the countship of [[Guastalla]], on the left bank of the [[Po River|Po]] for 22,280 golden [[scudi]] from Countess [[Ludovica Torelli]]; it was in part a strategic purchase, for Guastalla lies near Ferrara, which Charles wished to take from the [[House of Este|Este]].

Ferrante's villa near Milan, La Gualtiera, is now known as La Simonetta. Ferrante rebuilt it in the 1550s, commissioning the services of the Tuscan architect [[Domenico Giuntallodi]] of Prato.&lt;ref&gt;E. Heydenreich and W. Lotz, ''Architecture in Italy, 1400–1600'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1974:292-93;&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrante was a patron and protector of the sculptor and medallist [[Leone Leoni]], who executed a bronze medal for him about 1555, with a reverse that depicts Hercules with upraised club besting the Nemean Lion and the legend &lt;small&gt;TV NE CEDE MALIS&lt;/small&gt;, "You do not yield to evil",&lt;ref&gt;[http://freenet-homepage.de/seeCoins/KarlV/Ital-Z_E.htm#07c Illustration]&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to his acquittal after indictment for misappropriation of funds and corruption. His son Cesare commissioned from Leone a more public monument from Leone, a bronze ''Triumph of Ferrante Gonzaga over Envy,'' (1564), which stands in Piazza Roma, Guastalla.&lt;ref&gt;A commemorative Italian postage stamp issued on the five-hundredth anniversary of his birth show a detail of Leone Leoni's sculpture.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the Gonzaga, Ferrante was a patron of tapestry-makers: a series ''Fructus Belli'' ("the Fruits of War") was woven for him, and a lighter series of ''Putti''.&lt;ref&gt;The tapestry commissions of Ferrante and his brothers is set against the broader background of their patronage of the arts in Clifford M. Brown, Guy Delmarcel and Robert S. Nelson, ''Tapestries for the Courts of Federico II, Ercole, and Ferrante Gonzaga 1522–63'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Brussels]] from a fall from a horse and battle fatigue received at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]]. He was buried in the sacristy of the [[Milan Cathedral]].

Ferrante was succeeded in Guastalla by his son [[Cesare I Gonzaga|Cesare]].

He was the ambassador to [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spanish Chronicle]], xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children ==
Ferrante and Isabella had 11 children:
* Anna (1531), died young;
* [[Cesare I Gonzaga|Cesare]] (1533–1575), count of Guastalla, married Camilla Borromeo, sister of [[Charles Borromeo]];
* Ippolita (1535–1563), married in 1549 with Fabrizio Colonna, hereditary prince of Paliano, and in 1554 with Antonio Carafa, duke of Mondragone; 
* [[Francesco Gonzaga (1538-1566)|Francesco]] (1538–1566), cardinal;
* Andrea (1539–1586), 1st marquis of Specchia and Alessano; 
* [[Giovanni Vincenzo Gonzaga|Gian Vincenzo]] (1540–1591), cardinal;
* Ercole (1545–1549); 
* Ottavio (1543–1583), Lord of Cercemaggiore;
* Filippo, died young;
* Geronima,died young;
* Maria, died young.

==Priory of Sion hoax==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2015}}
In [[conspiracy theories]], Ferrante has been alleged to be the fourteenth [[Priory of Sion#Alleged Grand Masters|Grand Master of the Priory of Sion]], according to the Grand Masters version found in [[Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau]].

'''Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada''' ('''FINTRAC''') gathers, analyzes, assesses, and discloses [[financial intelligence]].  Originally created in July 2000 to counter suspected [[money laundering]], FINTRAC's mandate was expanded in December 2001 to provide the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) with information on [[terrorist financing]] that threaten the security of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fintrac.gc.ca/fintrac-canafe/1_e.asp|title=FINTRAC - Who We Are|accessdate=2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FINTRAC was established under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, which was amended in December, 2001 to become the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA). FINTRAC's mandate was further amended in 2006 under Bill C-25&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/39-1/C-25/?page=4|title=Bill C-25 (Historical) {{!}} openparliament.ca|website=openparliament.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enhance the client identification, record-keeping and reporting measures, established a registration regime for money services businesses and foreign exchange dealers, and created new offences for not registering.

The Director of FINTRAC reports to the Minister of Finance.

FINTRAC receives information from regulated entities on:

* Suspicious transactions

In 2009, FINTRAC estimated that  the amount of money laundered on an annual basis is somewhere between $5 and  $15 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-005-x/2011001/article/11454-eng.htm#a1|title=Money laundering in Canada, 2009|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Suspicious transactions are financial transactions that there are reasonable grounds to suspect are related to the commission of a money laundering offence. Since June 12, 2002, suspicious transactions also include financial transactions that there are reasonable grounds to suspect are related to the commission of a terrorist activity financing offence. Suspicious transactions must be reported by financial entities (banks and financial dealers),  money services businesses, life insurance companies and agents, certain government agencies that take deposits (such as Canada Post), accountants or accounting firms,  real estate agents and brokers, and casinos.

FINTRAC publishes Annual results, Quarterly updates, performance reports, and notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/about-apropos/corp-publications-eng.asp|title=Corporate reports|last=Canada|first=Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of|website=www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foot roasting''' is a method of [[torture]] used since ancient times. The torture takes ingenious advantage of the extreme sensitivity of the sole of the foot to heat&lt;ref&gt;Schlee, G., ''et al.'', Foot sole skin temperature affects plantar foot sensitivity, ''Clinical Neurophysiology'' 120(8), August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Romans]] immobilized the prisoner and pressed red-hot iron plates to the soles of his feet. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] bound the prisoner face-upward to the rack with his bare feet secured in a [[stocks]]. The soles of the feet were basted with [[lard]] or oil and slowly barbecued over a [[brazier]] of burning coals. A screen could be interposed between the feet and the coals to modulate the exposure, while a [[bellows]] controlled the intensity of the flame. Variants included placing slivers of hot coals between the toes, or suspending the prisoner head-downward and placing hot coals directly on the soles. The destruction of the Order of the [[Knights Templars]] is credited to these tortures, which were of sufficient cruelty literally to drive their sufferers insane&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, John J.  ''Dungeon, Fire and Sword: The Knights Templars in the Crusades'', Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Foot roasting remains a popular technique of torture to this day.  During the Cold War, KGB torturers made use of metal [[clothes irons]] heated red-hot and applied directly to the naked soles or explored the delicate webbing between the prisoner's toes using either a [[soldering iron]] or an electric wood-burning pencil&lt;ref&gt;John Barron, ''KGB'' , New York: Bantam, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Knights Templar ==
Foot roasting was one of the principal tortures used to extract supposed confessions of [[heresy]] and other accusations made against the [[Knights Templar]] after their arrest in October 1307. It is recorded that one Templar's feet were so savagely tortured that—as he was being carried back to his cell—various pieces of charred bone fell from his feet to the floor. Prisoners could also be suspended head-downwards from stocks, with hot coals placed directly on the soles of the feet&amp;mdash;held in place by gravity&amp;mdash;while thin slivers of burning embers were slid between pairs of adjacent toes.

== Brittany ==
In [[Brittany]], an enhanced interrogation chair was used&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Abbott, ''Rack, Rope, and Red-Hot Pincers'', London: Trafalgar Square Publishing, 1993, pp. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; that immobilized the feet and provided a movable tray of coals that could be cranked up and down, eventually making physical contact with the soles of the feet.

== Star kicking ==
A form of torture called "star kicking" supposedly began with [[Countess Elizabeth Bathory]], who would place oiled bits of paper or string between the prisoner's toes and light the material on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly L. Craft, ''Infamous Lady: The True Story of Countess Erzsebet Bathory'', North Charleston, SC: CreateSpace Independent Publishing, 2002, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Francesc de Paula Castelló Aleu''' (19 April 1914 – 29 September 1936) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] killed during the [[Spanish Civil War]] on false accusations of [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-francesc-de-paula-castello-aleu/|title=Blessed Francesc de Paula Castelló Aleu|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=29 September 2016|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castelló was noted for his devout and outgoing nature in addition for his activism in Christian movements such as the [[Catholic Action]]; he had friends from these movements and in one met his fiancée though his death broke their soon-to-be union.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clairval.com/lettres/en/2004/12/01/2011204.htm|title=Spiritual Newsletter|date=1 December 2004|publisher=Abbey of Saint-Joseph de Clairval|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92246|title=Blessed Francesc de Paula Castelló Aleu|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a [[chemist]] for a time prior to conscription into the armed services on the eve of the civil war.

His beatification was confirmed after [[Pope John Paul II]] – who beatified him on 11 March 2001 – acknowledged the fact that Castelló had been killed "in odium fidei" (in hatred of the faith). He was beatified as part of the cause of [[233 Spanish Martyrs|232 others]].&lt;ref name=SJ&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.newsaints.faithweb.com/biographies/Castello.pdf|title=Francesc de Paula Castelló Aleu|date=|publisher=Hagiography Circle|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Francesc de Paula Castelló Aleu was born in [[Alicante]] on 19 April 1914 as the last of three children to José Castelló and Teresa Aleu (1887 – 10 March 1929). His father died not long after his birth in June from [[pulmonary congestion]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; His two elder sisters in order were Teresa and María. He was [[baptized]] in April at the church of Santa María d'Alacant.&lt;ref name=SJ/&gt; His paternal aunt was María Castelló and his uncle (and godfather) was Josep Claverol.

His now-widowed mother decided to relocate to [[Lleida]] in July 1914 to assume a teaching position and then in September 1922 to [[Juneda]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He was noted for his passion and spirited nature but also could be stubborn.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Castelló made his [[First Communion]] on 4 May 1924. He drew strength from the [[Eucharist]] to fight against his sometimes difficult temper and aged thirteen experienced a prolonged [[spiritual crisis]] that most did not notice.&lt;ref name=SJ/&gt;

The [[Marists]] oversaw his education from 1923 in Lleida before he studied under the [[Jesuits]] at the Chemical Institute in [[Barcelona]]. During his time at college in [[Oviedo]] he began to foster political ideas and was known to collaborate with the Jesuits from time to time.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; His mother died on 10 March 1929 and he and his two sisters consecrated themselves to the [[Mother of God]]. He had learned of the news of his mother's illness while at school and rushed home to be at her bedside. His mother did not recognize her children and she died just hours later. From 1931 onwards he became a member of the Federation of Young Christians of Catalonia as well as [[Catholic Action]].&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Castelló worked during his period as a [[chemist]] in Lleida.

On 14 April 1930 - just before turning sixteen - he received his high school diploma with distinction and in November 1930 first met the Jesuit priest Román Galán who became a close friend. The latter oversaw Castelló undertaking the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] from 24 to 29 March 1932.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Castelló also promoted the messages of the Parochial Cooperators of Christ the King that the Jesuit Francis de Paul Vallet began around that time. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in chemistry on 6 February 1934 and he began working as an engineer in a chemical fertilization company. On 16 February 1936 it was election day and he was at home since he had not reached the legal voting age; the current climate gave reason for people (including his sister) to be anxious but he was rather idle and had said he would go out the next day to get people to enlist for the Spiritual Exercises.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; On 30 May 1936 he became engaged to María Pelegri (1911 – 17 June 1976); their relationship was chaste.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; For the engagement he gifted her with a golden scapular medal.

Misfortune reared itself just after the engagement when he was [[Conscription|drafted]] on 1 July 1936 into the armed services in Lleida just before the [[Spanish Civil War]] which put the planned wedding on hold for the unforeseeable future.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; But on the night of 20–21 July 1936 he was imprisoned after the commander of the fort he was in awoke him and accused him of being a [[fascist]]. He was beaten with a [[riding crop]] and locked up in a former chapel with some 20 other prisoners. But he was in good spirits and was encouraging all others not to lose hope or faith.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; At night he would talk on the meaning of the Christian faith and its importance in everyday life.

In his imprisonment he requested testimonies in his favor from former coworkers but those men were fearful and refused to send testimonies. He was hurt from this but forgave them and hoped for their courage would be renewed. His cousin also suggested that he sign a document hiding his religious beliefs and his renouncement of his place in Christian movements. He refused this as well despite his cousin attempting several more times to persuade him.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

On 12 September 1936 he was relocated to the provincial prison and he went from cell to cell to encourage recreation among other prisoners as well as the recitation of [[rosaries]]; on 23 September he was subjected to severe interrogation and on the morning of 29 September made a confession to a priest while later waving farewell to his fellow inmates. He did this for he was taken to the town hall to a so-called 'people's court' where the prosecutor asked for the death sentence. He was given the chance to defend himself but said he was proud to be a Christian and he would be glad to die for [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; The conclusion of the trial saw the verdict given to him – the death sentence – and all those convicted prisoners were led to an underground passage to a dungeon. He entered it and encouraged the others: "Come on lads ... each of us must prepare ourselves and recommend his soul to [[God]]". He addressed a letter first to his sisters and aunt and then to his fiancée to bid them farewell; he also sent a letter to Father Galán.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

On 29 September 1936 he was taken to a truck in the evening alongside six other prisoners and he began to sing but the militiamen with the prisoners slapped him to quiet him down to which Castelló said that he forgave him. He was led to the execution spot along a darkened path and he said he forgave those who were to kill him. His hands were clasped and his head was raised upwards as the order was given to which he shouted: "Long live Christ the King!"&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SJ/&gt; He died at 11:30pm. His heart continued to beat for mere moments after the shooting and his head leaned to the right as he crumpled to the ground. His fiancée - as per his request in his last letter to her - married and bore children and later died on 17 June 1976.

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened in Lleida in an informative process tasked with the collection of documentation in relation to his life and this process spanned from 2 February 1959 until its closure just over a decade later on 16 May 1971; the formal introduction to the cause came under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 22 July 1986 and he became titled as a [[Servant of God]]. The [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] later validated the informative phase in [[Rome]] on 18 November 1991 and received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation in 1992 for assessment. Theological advisors approved the cause on 10 November 2000 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 12 December 2000. John Paul II approved – on 18 December 2000 – that Castelló had been killed "in odium fidei" (in hatred of the faith) and thus approved the beatification.

John Paul II beatified him in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 11 March 2011 as part of the cause of [[233 Spanish Martyrs|232 others]].

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is Dr. Silvia Mónica Correale.

'''Frank Andrew Lovejoy Jr.''' (March 28, 1912 – October 2, 1962) was an American actor in radio, film, and television. He is perhaps best remembered for appearing in the film noir ''[[The Hitch-Hiker (1953 film)|The Hitch-Hiker]]'' and for starring in the radio drama ''[[Night Beat (radio program)|Night Beat]]''.

==Films==
[[File:Frank Lovejoy 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Lovejoy in 1958]]
In films of the 1940s and 1950s, Lovejoy mostly played supporting roles. Appearing in movies such as ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) with [[Joan Crawford]], and ''[[The Hitch-Hiker (1953 film)|The Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1953) directed by [[Ida Lupino]], Lovejoy was effective playing the movie's [[everyman]] in extraordinary situations. He was in several war movies, notably [[Stanley Kramer]]'s ''[[Home of the Brave (1949 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' (1949), ''[[Breakthrough (1950 film)|Breakthrough]]'' (1950), [[Joseph H. Lewis]]'s ''[[Retreat, Hell!]]'' (1952) which portrayed the [[United States]] Marine Corps' retreat from the [[Chosin Reservoir]] (Changjin Reservoir) during the [[Korean War]] and as a Marine sergeant again in ''[[Beachhead (film)|Beachhead]]'' (1954), and [[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]] (1955) with [[James Stewart]]. In 1951, he had the title role in ''[[I Was a Communist for the FBI]]'' with co-stars [[Ron Hagerthy]], [[Paul Picerni]], and [[Philip Carey]].

==Television==
Lovejoy starred in two short-run TV series, ''[[Man Against Crime]]'' and ''[[Meet McGraw]]''. Episodes of these two series have never been released commercially on DVD or VHS and never aired as reruns. ''Meet McGraw'' episodes were screened at the [[Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Lovejoy's final television performances include the episode "County General" (March 18, 1962) on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series|series]] ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' with [[Marilyn Maxwell]] in the role of Grace Sherwood. That same season, he appeared on the ABC [[crime drama]] ''[[Target: The Corruptors!]]'' about the efforts of a [[New York City]] reporter to expose [[organized crime]].

==Personal life==
Lovejoy was first married to Frances Williams (1901–59), but divorced in the late 1930s. In 1940, Lovejoy married actress [[Joan Banks]] (1918–1998), with whom he had a son and a daughter.

On October 2, 1962, Frank Lovejoy died of a heart attack in his sleep at his residence in New York City. His wife, Joan Banks, called for medical help after she was unable to wake him. The couple had been appearing in a New Jersey production of the [[Gore Vidal]] play ''[[The Best Man (play)|The Best Man]]''.

The terms '''genital modification''' and '''genital mutilation''' can refer to permanent or temporary changes to [[human sex organs]]. Some forms of genital alteration are performed on adults with their informed consent at their own behest, usually for aesthetic reasons or to enhance stimulation. However, other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations in different cultural contexts and by different groups of people.

== Reasons ==
=== Body modification ===
{{main|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. [[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s. This procedure has taken root in Western [[body modification]] culture, the [[modern primitive]]s. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.

|8=Left image alt text
|9=Right image alt text}}
[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing [[sexual pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neluis T., Armstrong M. L., Young C., Roberts A. E., Hogan L., Rinard K. | year = 2014 | title = Prevalence and implications of genital tattoos: A site not forgotten | url = | journal = British Journal of Medical Practitioners | volume = 7 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="expressmilwaukee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html |title=Penises, Piercings and Pleasure |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina. Similar to tattooing, [[scarification|genital scarification]] is primarily done for aesthetic reasons by adding cosmetic scars to the skin. The genital decoration by scars is an ancient tradition in many cultures, both for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Angulo J. C., García-Díez M., Martínez M. | year = 2011 | title = Phallic decoration in paleolithic art: genital scarification, piercing and tattoos | url = | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 186 | issue = 6| pages = 2498–2503 | doi=10.1016/j.juro.2011.07.077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hanabira]]-style (Jap. for [[petal]]) is a special form of scarification originating in Japan, it involves the decoration of the [[mons pubis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stylight.de/Magazine/Lifestyle/Scarification/ Schnittiger Trend? Scarification statt Tattoo] - Stylight&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erdbeerlounge.de/beauty/schoene-haut/tattoos-piercings/cutting-tattoos-ziernarben-statt-tinte/ Cutting Tattoos: Ziernarben statt Tinte] - Erdbeerlounge&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through the [[Testosterone (medication)|application or injection of testosterone]]. [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

===Voluntary sex reassignment===
{{main|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] or [[intersex]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] in order to modify their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cuypere G. |author2=T'Sjoen G. |author3=Beerten R. |author4=Selvaggi G. |author5=Sutter P. |author6=Hoebeke P. |author7=Monstrey S. |author8=Vansteenwegen A. |author9=Rubens R. |year=2005 | title = Sexual and physical health after sex reassignment surgery |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 679–690 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5 | pmid=16362252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]] and [[vaginoplasty]] (creation of a vagina) for [[trans women]] and [[mastectomy]] (breast removal), [[metoidioplasty]] (elongation of the clitoris), and [[phalloplasty]] (creation of a penis) for [[trans men]]. Trans women may also benefit from [[hair removal]] and [[facial feminization surgery]], while some trans men may have [[liposuction]] to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

[[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]], a [[third gender]] found in the [[Indian subcontinent]], may opt to undergo [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Serena |last=Nanda |title=Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India |year=1999 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |place=Belmont, CA |edition=2nd |isbn=9780534509033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involuntary sex assignment===
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of their genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George. P Chrousos, MD, FAAP, MACP, MACE, FRCP, Merrily P M Poth, MD, Stephen Kemp, MD, PhD [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/923178-overview#a0199 Microphallus: Epidemiology] [[Medscape]], Updated August 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intersex Society of North America]] objects to [[elective surgery|elective surgeries]] performed on people without their [[informed consent]] on grounds that such surgeries subject patients to unnecessary harm and risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/surgery|title=What's ISNA's position on surgery?|work=Intersex Society of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to [[genital injury]]. There have been at least seven cases of healthy male infants being reassigned as female due to [[circumcision]] damaging their penises beyond repair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gearhart JP, Rock JA | year = 1989 | title = Total ablation of the penis after circumcision with electrocautery: a method of management and long-term followup | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5347(17)38893-6 | journal = J Urol | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 799–801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Family Is Awarded $850,000 For Circumcision Accident" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published November 2, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Seabrook. $22.8 million in botched circumcision.

In India, [[Andhra Pradesh]] a 75 year old surgeon working at the kurnool government hospital in kadappa named as naganna was arrested by the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|CB-CID]] for conducting forced sex change surgeries on kidnapped victims for nearly a decade by using a nationwide network of [[hijras]], [[transgenders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End of the line for sex-change doctor {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-end-of-the-line-for-sex-change-doctor-1246202|work=dna|date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CB-CID instructs probe into begging rackets - Times of India|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chennai/CB-CID-instructs-probe-into-begging-rackets/articleshow/4376912.cms|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBCID to seek custody of Kadapa doctor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/CBCID-to-seek-custody-of-Kadapa-doctor/article16611389.ece|work=The Hindu|date=8 April 2009|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As treatment===
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo [[vaginectomy]] or [[vulvectomy]] (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo [[penectomy]] or [[orchiectomy]] (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].

During [[childbirth]], an [[episiotomy]] (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge. Advocates of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth.

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]]. It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.

The world's first penis reduction surgery was performed in 2015, on a 17-year-old boy who had an [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|American football]]-shaped penis as a result of recurrent [[priapism]].&lt;ref name="penisreduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2015/02/18/penis-reduction-surgery-grow-up/#7c6365c42fce|title=Penis Reduction Surgery Is No Laughing Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-inflicted===
{{main|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.

{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersex]] persons. It is practised in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, parts of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.&lt;ref name=125million&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&amp;nbsp;22: "More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM/C is concentrated.&lt;p&gt;

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments.

===Hymenorrhaphy===
[[Hymenorrhaphy]] refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

[[Labia stretching]] is the act of elongating the ''[[labia minora]]'' through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).&lt;ref name=Rwanda&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php], "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement&gt;[http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm], "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is a familial [[cultural practice]] in Rwanda,&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt; common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf], "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[body modification]] practice elsewhere.&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt; It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt;

===Labiaplasty and vaginoplasty===
[[File:Nach der Entfernung der inneren Schamlippen 1.jpg|thumb|Vulva with ''labia minora'' surgically removed]]

[[Cosmetic surgery]] of female genitalia, known as ''elective genitoplasty'', has become pejoratively known as ''″designer vagina″''. In May 2007, an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei|author2=Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = [[British Medical Journal]]| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

Some women undergo [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]] procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal or societal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Green Fiona | year = 2005 | title = From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting | url = | journal = Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 153–187 | doi=10.1080/14616660500200223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Essen B, Johnsdotter S | year = 2004 | title = Female Genital Mutilation in the West: Traditional Circumcision versus Genital Cosmetic Surgery | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 611–613 | doi=10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Braun Virginia | year = 2005 | title = In search of (better) sexual pleasure: female genital 'cosmetic' surgery | url = | journal = Sexualities | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 407–424 | doi=10.1177/1363460705056625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a "good looking vagina" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Simone Weil. "Designer Vaginas." Women's Voices, Feminist Visions. Ed. Susan Shaw and Janet Lee. New York: McGraw Hill (2012): 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vagina more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in labia- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rodrigues Sara | year = 2012 | title = From Vaginal Exception to Exceptional Vagina: The Biopolitics of Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery | doi = 10.1177/1363460712454073 | journal = Sexualities | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 778–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clitoral hood reduction ===
[[File:Clitoral hood reduction in adult caucasian female.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Clitoral hood reduction]]]]
[[Clitoral hood reduction]] is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[clitoral glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her [[vulva]]. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

==Males==
{{category see also|Male genital modification}}

===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the [[testicles]]. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. In the 21st century, castration has been reported among slave boys in South Asia. In addition the Czech Republic performs surgical castration on some male sex offenders. It should not be confused with [[chemical castration]].

===Hemi-castration===
The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as ''unilateral castration'') is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.&lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Ford and Beech refer to an initiation right which includes this --&gt;

===Circumcision===
{{Main|Circumcision|Circumcision controversies|Forced circumcision}}
[[File:Adult circumcision before and after.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Penis before and after circumcision]]
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Male [[Prevalence of circumcision|circumcision prevalence]] (not [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]]) by country according to the [[World Health Organization]]'s 2007 review of the global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety, and acceptability of circumcision.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf| title = Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability| accessdate = 2009-03-04| year = 2007| publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Circumcision]] is the surgical removal of part or all of the [[foreskin]] from the penis. It is usually performed for [[religious male circumcision|religious]], cultural or medical reasons and leaves some or all of the glans permanently exposed. [[Jews]] and many [[Americans]] typically have their infants circumcised during the [[neonatal]] period, while [[Filipinos]], most Muslims and African tribes such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] circumcise in teenage years or childhood as an initiation into adulthood.

In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe [[phimosis]] or recurrent [[balanitis]]. Advocacy is often centered on [[preventive medicine]], while opposition is often centered on [[human rights]] (particularly the [[bodily integrity]] of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Svoboda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Svoboda|first=J.

The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that one-third of the world's men are circumcised;the majority of circumcised male population is located in [[Muslim countries]] and in the [[United States]], although there are various explanations for why the infant circumcision rate in the US is different from comparable countries.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/&gt;  

In 2012 the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated that health benefits of non-therapeutic circumcision aren't great enough to recommend it for every newborn, and that the benefits outweigh the risks, so that the procedure may be done for families who choose it.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blank |first1=Susan |last2=Brady |first2=Michael |last3=Buerk |first3=Ellen |last4=Waldemar |first4=Carlo |last5=Diekema |first5=Douglas |last6=Freedman |first6=Andrew |last7=Maxwell |first7=Lynne |last8=Wegner |first8=Steven |date=31 August 2012 |title=Circumcision Policy Statement |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/585..info |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages= |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1989 |issn=1098-4275 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
[[File:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582 BCE – 485 BCE), showing [[kynodesme|''kynodesmē'']]]]
Infibulation literally means to close with a clasp or a pin. The word is used to include [[Surgical suture|suturing]] of the foreskin over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]].

Infibulation is seen in rock art in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rock Art Research in Southern Africa 2000–2004|author=Jean-Loïc Le Quellec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The hunter and his art: A survey of rock art in Southern Africa|author=Jalmar and Ione Rudner|publisher=C. Struick|location=Cape Town|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Greek infibulation consisted of piercing the foreskin and applying a gold, silver or bronze ring (''annulus''), a metal clasp (''fibula'') or pin. This was done for aesthetic reasons. The Greeks also used a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a [[kynodesme]].&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine|The Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2018-02-06| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}} Hodges draws a strong distinction between the kynodesme and infibulation "Tethering the ''akroposthion'' with the ''kynodesme'' is frequently confused with preputial infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so created for the insertion of a metal clasp (fibula) in order to fasten the prepuce shut."&lt;/ref&gt; Infibulation in Romano-Greek culture is attested as early as Aulus Cornelius Celcus (25 BC-50 AD) and as late as [[Oribasisus]] (325-405 AD).&lt;ref name=" Schultheiss"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D. Schultheiss |author2=J.J. Mattelaer |author3=F.M. Hodges |date=2003|title=Preputial infibulation: from ancient medicine to modern genital piercing|journal=BJU International|volume=92|issue=7|pages=758–763|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04490.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Victorian era, both in the UK and in the United States, routine infibulation was second only to circumcision in the "war on masturbation" and was used in orphanages and mental institutions, supported by leading physicians.&lt;ref name="Schultheiss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Darby"&gt;The masturbation taboo and the rise of routine male circumcision: A review of the historiography RRJL Darby - Journal of Social History, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Emasculation===
{{Main|Emasculation}}

Also known as ''total castration'' or ''nullification'', [[emasculation]] is the combination of castration and penectomy.

Due to the high risk of death from bleeding and infection, it was often considered a punishment equivalent to a [[death sentence]]. It was part of the eunuch-making of the [[Chinese court]], and it was widespread in the [[Arab slave trade]]. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Murray Gordon|title=Slavery in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC|date=1989|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-941533-30-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nullo (body modification)|Nullification]] or "nullo" is the term used by the modern body modification community.

In modern day [[South Asia]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearling===
[[File:Ampallang.jpg|thumb|[[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]]]]
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy|Penis removal}}
[[File:partial penectomy.jpg|thumb|left|Male genital area after partial [[penectomy]]]]
Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of [[human penis|penis]]. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with [[castration]], or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.

In the [[ulwaluko]] circumcision ceremony, which is performed by spear, accidental penectomy is a serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;Rijken, D.J. (2014). [http://www.ulwaluko.co.za/Problems.html Description of the problems accompanying the ritual of Ulwaluko]. Ulwaluko.co.za. Retrieved 2014-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penis removal]] for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In some circumstances it may be possible to reattach the penis.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[Urinary meatus|meatus]] towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy|title=Meatotomy - BME Encyclopedia|website=wiki.bme.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===
{{Main|Dorsal slit}}

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly: 
{{Block quote|A few examples of [[Old Kingdom]] [...] statuary present some adult males — usually priests, functionaries, or low-status workers98—as having undergone a vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although no flesh has been removed.&lt;ref name="Hodges"/&gt;}}

It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to [[circumcision]] when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

V. | editor4-last = Spier | editor4-first = F.  | publisher = Uchitel Publishing | pages = 274–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

'''Hulda Jane Stumpf''' (10 January 1867 – 3 January 1930) was an American Christian missionary who was murdered in her home near the [[Africa Inland Mission]] station in [[Kijabe]], [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], where she worked as a secretary and administrator.&lt;ref&gt;For date of birth and middle name, Marvin J. Newell, ''A Martyr's Grace'', Moody Publishers, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iAXxccjMkMEC&amp;pg=PA104 103–104]; for death, [http://kimwondo.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/100_0529.jpg image of Stumpf's headstone], accessed 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stumpf may have been killed because of the mission's opposition to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM, also known as female circumcision). Kenya's main ethnic group, the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], regarded FGM as an important rite of passage, and there had been protests against the missionary churches in Kenya because they opposed it. The period is known within Kenyan historiography as the [[Female circumcision controversy (Kenya, 1929–32)|female circumcision controversy]].

Stumpf is reported to have taken a firm stand against FGM in the Kijabe Girls' Home, which she helped to run. Some apparently unusual injuries on her body suggested to the governor of Kenya at the time that, before or after smothering her, her killer(s) had genitally mutilated her, although a court concluded that there was no evidence she had been killed because of her opposition to FGM.

[[File:Letter from Hulda Stumpf, 24 October 1906.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|Stumpf's letter of 24 October 1906 to the [[Africa Inland Mission]]]]

Stumpf was born in Big Run, Pennsylvania,&lt;!--which one?; reply: don't know, which is why it isn't linked, will try to find out--&gt; to J. R. Stumpf and his wife, and was raised in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], one of four children. Her father owned Indiana's first [[Five and dime store|five-and-dime store]], located on the 700 block of Philadelphia Street. He was one of the first local people to own a [[steam car]]&amp;nbsp;– in 1906 only six cars were registered in the town&amp;nbsp;– and in July 1901 began using it to make deliveries to his customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/14569319/ Hulda Stumpf, former resident, said murdered"], ''The Indiana Gazette'', 7 January 1930; John F. Busovicki, ''Indiana County'', Arcadia Publishing, 2003, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stumpf attended business school, then New York Music School for two years. After college she worked as a clerk and stenographer, then taught shorthand at [[Indiana Business College]].&lt;ref&gt;Newell 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iAXxccjMkMEC&amp;pg=PA104 104].&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1906 she applied for a position as a missionary with the Africa Inland Mission (AIM), describing herself in her first letter as "forty years of age&amp;nbsp;... and not very rugged looking," but in good health.&lt;ref&gt;Hulda Stumpf, [http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/bulletin/bu0311a.htm Letter to G.K. Sample], 26 October 1906, courtesy of Wheaton College.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote on the application form that she wanted to work in Africa because of an "earnest desire, believing the time to be short, when He shall appear, and the need in foreign fields seems to be great."&lt;ref&gt;Dana Lee Robert, ''American Women in Mission: A Social History of Their Thought and Practice'', Mercer University Press, 1996, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1906 she told the AIM that she was trying to move away from [[denominationalism]]: "There is only one form of church government, as I understand the term, and that is based upon the scriptures, and the scriptures alone, leaving out man's notion as to how a church should be governed."&lt;ref&gt;Robert 1996, 212, n.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt; From May 1907 she studied for two months at the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in Chicago in preparation for her missionary work. Her college file described her as "direct, businesslike, and kind."&lt;ref&gt;Newell 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iAXxccjMkMEC&amp;pg=PA105 105].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival===

Stumpf sailed from New York in November 1907 on the [[USS Huron (ID-1408)|SS Friedrich der Große]], arriving in Gibraltar on 12 November, and in Naples on 15 November.&lt;ref name=Gazette30Nov1907&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/indiana-evening-gazette/1907-11-30 "India Party was in Naples Nov 15"], ''Indiana Evening Gazette'', 30 November 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; In December she arrived in Kijabe, Kenya, where she was assigned to work as a secretary for the head of the Africa Inland Mission. She wrote in a letter to the ''Indiana Gazette'', dated 20 December 1907:

&lt;div style="background-color:none;margin-right:10em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify"&gt;
Since I am anxious that you should all know something about my trip and the condition of the country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.&amp;nbsp;... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.

The clothing consists of a goat skin thrown carelessly over the shoulder, and a great deal of tin and brass jewelry; rings on the ankles, toes, neck and ears, also bands or strings of beads around the head and waist.&amp;nbsp;... The chief timber just near us is wild olive and cedar.&amp;nbsp;... The roses and geraniums grow like trees almost and bloom continually. Ferns of all kinds grow wild. All the way from Mombasa to Kijabe, a distance of 1575 miles, we saw banana, coconut and mangoe trees&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/13710465/ "Hilda Stumps tells of life in Africa"], ''The Indiana Gazette'', 5 February 1908, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Kijabe Girls' Home===
[[File:Hulda Stumpf, Africa Inland Mission conference.jpg|thumb|left|Stumpf ''(front left)'' with other students from the [[Moody Bible Institute]], Kijabe, 1917]] 
Stumpf remained in Africa for most of the rest of her life, helping to run the Kijabe mission and writing articles for its monthly magazine, ''Inland Africa''. She lived for many years in the two-room cottage in which she died, 300 yards from the mission building.&lt;ref&gt;Newell 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iAXxccjMkMEC&amp;pg=PA105 105–106].&lt;/ref&gt; Her last visit to the United States was in 1925. By the time of her death the Africa Inland Mission had 45 mission stations in East Africa, 225 missionaries and 1,000 African teachers.&lt;ref name=NYT6Jan1930&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C1FF93F5F177A93C4A9178AD85F448385F9 "Woman Missionary Murdered in Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 6 January 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Dana Lee Robert, Stumpf—irascible and hard of hearing, at least toward the end of her life—was a typical missionary woman, viewed by African society as having little status because she was an unmarried woman, and viewed the same way within the mission because of her relatively junior role. Robert describes her as "[m]arginalized both missiologically and physically." Nevertheless, Robert argues, as an agent of Western culture Stumpf represented a significant "challenge to daily life" in Africa.&lt;ref name=Robert1996p230&gt;Robert 1996, 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her duties was to help administer the Kijabe Girls' Home and Training School, where girls were taught literacy and agricultural skills, mathematics, sewing and Bible lessons. The school was known locally as ''Ishai'' because it had an iron roof, unlike others with grass roofs; ''ishai'' meant iron sheet and also place of shelter.&lt;ref name=OldAfrica&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YUc_AQAAIAAJ ''Old Africa''], issue 18, 2008, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of several girls' homes and schools run by the Africa Inland Mission.&lt;ref name=Robert1996p230/&gt;

The relationship between the missionaries and the Kikuyu members of the AIM's congregation was not one of equals. James Karanja cites a letter Stumpf wrote in June 1916, asking that only plain dresses be sent from the United States for the Kikuyu girls, without "tucks, ruffles, piping, etc." Apparently the previous year dresses had been received by another mission that were regarded as too good for the Kikuyu, and they had been given to missionaries' children instead. The concern, Stumpf wrote (possibly relaying objections, rather than expressing her own), was that the Kikuyu would be "dressed better than white children."&lt;ref&gt;James Karanja, ''The Missionary Movement in Colonial Kenya: The Foundation of Africa Inland Church'', Göttingen: Cuvillier Verlag, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA53 53].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KIKUYU GIRLS POUNDING GRAIN.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=photograph|[[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] women in 1911]]
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM) was regarded by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], Kenya's main ethnic group, as an important rite of passage between childhood and adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janice Boddy]], ''Civilizing Women: British Crusades in Colonial Sudan'', Princeton University Press, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA243 243].&lt;/ref&gt; The procedures include removal of the clitoris ([[clitoridectomy]]), removal of the inner labia (excision), and removal of all the external genitalia and the suturing of the wound ([[Female genital mutilation#Type III|infibulation]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kikuyu practised excision and sometimes infibulation, calling it ''irua'' for female and [[male circumcision]].&lt;ref&gt;Boddy 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA243 243]; for infibulation, 235, 359, n.&amp;nbsp;54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn M. Thomas, "'Ngaitana (I will circumcise myself)': Lessons from Colonial Campaigns to Ban Excision in Meru, Kenya" in Bettina Shell-Duncan and Ylva Hernlund (eds.), ''Female "Circumcision" in Africa: Culture Controversy and Change'', Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA132 132].&lt;/ref&gt; A memorandum by the Church of Scotland Mission described it, in or around 1929:

&lt;div style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify"&gt;
Female circumcision, as it exists among the Kikuyu, is an operation which varies in severity, some sections of the tribe practising a more drastic form than others. It involves the removal of not only the Clitoris, but also the labia minora and half the labia majora, together with the surrounding tissue, resulting in the permanent mutilation affecting the woman's natural functions of maturation, menstruation, and parturition, with disastrous results not only to the birth rate, but also to the physique and vitality of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Karanja 2009, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Girls' home at Kijabe, Kenya, c. 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Kijabe Girls' Home, c.&amp;nbsp;1914. The missionary in the photograph may be Hulda Stumpf.]]
The medical issues apart, the missionaries objected to the sexual nature of the ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Karanja 2009, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Kikuyu, the ceremonies and procedure were a vital ethnic ritual. Unexcised women (''irugu'') were viewed as unmarriageable outcasts.&lt;ref name=Strayer1978p136&gt;Robert Strayer and Jocelyn Murray, "The CMS and Female Circumcision," in Robert Strayer (ed.), ''The Making of Missionary Communities in East Africa'', SUNY Press, 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9kpLvKnZCR8C&amp;pg=PA136 136].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' of London reported in February 1930: "The young girls represent an economic asset to the parents and, in the eyes of the tribe, their value is completely lost unless the rites are performed. In fact, the older Kikuyu believe that no woman may bear children unless the ceremonies have been observed."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 February 1930, cited in Boddy 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA241 241].&lt;/ref&gt; There were rumours among the Kikuyu that the British wanted to stop ''irua'' so that they could marry the unexcised girls and acquire Kenyan land.&lt;ref&gt;Boddy 2007, 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Inland Mission began campaigning against FGM in 1914, and in 1916 the Church of Scotland Mission said it would excommunicate African Christians who practised it.&lt;ref name=Hyam1990p192/&gt; The [[National Council of Churches of Kenya|Kenya Missionary Council]] was the first organization known to call it mutilation; [[Marion Stevenson|Marion Scott Stevenson]], a [[Church of Scotland]] missionary, coined the term "sexual mutilation of women" for the practice in 1929, and the Missionary Council followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Karanja 2009, 93, n.&amp;nbsp;631.&lt;/ref&gt; That year African teachers working in CSM and AIM schools were asked to sign an oath renouncing both FGM and membership of the [[Kikuyu Central Association]], the representative body of the Kikuyu people.&lt;ref name=Hyam1990p192&gt;Ronald Hyam, ''Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience'', Manchester University Press, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DVS8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA192 192].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Fiedler, ''Christianity and African Culture'', Brill, 1996, 5, including n.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Jocelyn Murray, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1594780 "The Church Missionary Society and the "Female Circumcision" Issue in Kenya 1929-1932"], ''Journal of Religion in Africa'', 8(2), 1976 (92–104), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the African congregations chose to leave rather than swear the oath.&lt;ref&gt;John Lonsdale, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1581872 "Kikuyu Christianities"], ''Journal of Religion in Africa'', 29(2), May 1999 (206–229), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Hyam writes that the issue split the Kikuyu Christian community into ''kirore'' (abolitionists) and ''karinga'' (traditionalists).&lt;ref&gt;Hyam 1990, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stumpf took "one of the firmest stands" against FGM at the Kijabe Girls' School, according to Dana Lee Robert.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1996, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1927 Stumpf described what happened to one teacher who had had FGM performed on his daughter:

&lt;div style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify"&gt;
About three years ago Muchai along with many others was prohibited from teaching and was excommunicated forever, the sentence read, unless he was willing to confess his wrong and swear allegiance to the white man and his rulings. The confession was sorrow for allowing his daughter to be circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Hulda Stumpf in a letter to H. Campbell, May 1927, cited in Karanja 2009, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

On 30 September 1929 Stumpf wrote in her diary: "Crisis in native church over female circumcision," and on 2 November, referring to the oath the AIM had asked teachers to swear: "The past week was spent largely in prayer. Nearly all teachers refused to sign the petition re circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YUc_AQAAIAAJ ''Old Africa''], issue 18, 2008, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December that year four men were arrested outside the Kijabe mission's church for singing from the ''Muthirigu'', a series of protest dance-songs that thousands of Kikuyu began performing outside mission homes and schools.&lt;ref&gt;For the arrests, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YUc_AQAAIAAJ ''Old Africa''], issue 18, 2008, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For background, Lynn M.

Stumpf's body was discovered in her home on the morning of 3 January 1930 by Kakoi, a man who worked for her.&lt;ref name=OldAfrica/&gt; She was buried nearby two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Newell 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iAXxccjMkMEC&amp;pg=PA108 108].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C1FF93F5F177A93C4A9178AD85F448385F9 "Woman missionary murdered in Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 6 January 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789075,00.html "Religion: Hulda Stump"], ''Time'' magazine, 13 January 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; Another missionary, Helen Virginia Blakeslee, an [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopath]], wrote in 1956 that she had examined Stumpf's body shortly after the death, and that there were no circumcision-style wounds:

&lt;div style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify"&gt;
Hulda Stumpf lay across the bed with a mattress doubled over her face. I was the second person to enter the room after the tragedy, and I made a careful examination of her poor body. She had been brutally treated but was not, as the story was circulated, the victim of a bungling attempt at circumcision. That finally she had been strangled was evident by the large black and blue patches on her throat and neck. She was safe on the other side, but had had a rough passage.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Virginia Blakeslee, ''Beyond the Kikuyu Curtain'', Moody Press, 1956, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Blakeslee wrote that the death shook the local community and that the Kikuyu elders were horrified by it. African soldiers stood guard outside the mission and the girls were moved out of the school to live with other missionaries.{{efn|Helen Virginia Blakeslee, ''Beyond the Kikuyu Curtain'' (1956): "The countryside was shaken as the news got around. Government officials came and went. Investigations dragged on throughout the following months with no apparent results. The old Kikuyu tribal elders were shocked and horrified that such a crime should be committed in their midst. African soldiers were sent to guard the station day and night. The girls and I were ordered to leave the school. Temporary quarters were found for us on the side of the ravine with other missionaries, where we would be less exposed to danger. The powers of darkness, unable to endure the presence of the light in their dark domain, had wreaked their vengeance upon us, and for the moment seemed to have the upper hand. Would they be able to drive out the light and envelope Kikuyuland in complete darkness once more?"&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee 1956, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Inquest==
The inquest, opened on 20 January 1930, concluded that Stumpf had died during the night of 2–3 January and recorded asphyxiation as the cause of death. Medical evidence presented at the inquest showed that there were peculiar injuries to Stumpf's body. [[Edward Grigg, 1st Baron Altrincham|Edward Grigg]], the governor of Kenya, [[Telegraphy|telegraphed]] the British [[Colonial Office]] on the first day of the inquest to tell them: "Medical evidence shows that Miss Stumpf was circumcised in brutal manner and died under the operation. It is clear that circumcision song and dance is being used to work those participating into a dangerous fanaticism."&lt;ref&gt;Boddy 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA241 241].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' reported in February 1930:

&lt;div style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 3px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify"&gt;
The medical evidence discounted any theory of rape but inclined to the view that certain unusual wounds were due to the deliberate mutilation such as might have been caused by the use of a knife employed by native [sic] in the form of tribal operation.

The significance of this lies in the fact that for many months past certain missions have been making a stand against this tribal ceremony with the result that there have been conflicts with natives, many of whom are most hostile, while agitators have been attempting to make political capital out of the situation.&lt;ref name=Times18Feb1930&gt;"Murdered Missionary in Kenya," ''The Times'', 18 February 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A verdict was delivered of wilful murder by person or persons unknown, though a member of the [[Kamba people|Mkamba]] ethnic group had already been arrested.&lt;ref name=Times18Feb1930/&gt; According to the Africa Inland Mission, the British government had for the previous ten years fingerprinted all black Africans employed in the area by white people.&lt;ref name=NYT6Jan1930/&gt; The man's fingerprints had been found on a clock and lamp in Stumpf's home. He was acquitted by the Supreme Court in Nairobi on 26 November 1930. The court found that there was an innocent explanation for the presence of the fingerprints—he might have entered the house after the murder, but before the police arrived—and concluded that there was no evidence that Stumpf had been killed over her opposition to FGM.{{efn|''The Times'' (27 November 1930): "It was recalled that the crime was committed at the time of the great native unrest on account of the opposition of the mission to the Kikuyu circumcision ceremony, and it was suggested that it was a reprisal, but the Court found that there was no evidence to support this view. The most direct evidence against the accused was the discovery of his fingerprints on a clock and lamp in Miss Stumpf's room, but in view of the opportunities that the native had of entering the house before the arrival of the police the Judge gave him the benefit of a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref name=Times27Nov1930&gt;"Murder of a Missionary in Kenya," ''The Times'', 27 November 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Human Potential Movement''' ('''HPM''') arose out of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] [[social environment|milieu]] of the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/us/18leonard1.html?_r=0 |title = George Leonard, Voice of '60s Counterculture, Dies at 86 |last1 = Martin |first1 = Douglas |date = January 18, 2010 |publisher = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate = 2014-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed around the concept of cultivating extraordinary potential that its advocates believe to lie largely untapped in all people. The movement took as its premise the belief that through the development of "human potential", humans can experience an exceptional quality of [[personal life|life]] filled with [[happiness]], [[creativity]], and [[Personal fulfillment|fulfillment]].  As a corollary, those who begin to unleash this assumed potential often find themselves directing their actions within society towards assisting others to release their [[Potentiality and actuality|potential]].  Adherents believe that the net effect of individuals cultivating their potential will bring about positive [[social change]] at large.

==Roots==
The emergence of HPM is linked to [[humanistic psychology]]. The movement is strongly influenced by [[Abraham Maslow]]'s theory of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs#Self-actualization|self-actualization]] as the supreme expression of a human's life.

In the middle of the 1960s, [[George Leonard]] did research across the United States on the subject of human potential for the magazine ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]''. In his research, he interviewed 37 psychiatrists, brain researchers, and philosophers on the subject of human potential. He found that "Not one of them said we were using more than 10% of our capacity"&lt;ref name="Wayne2005"&gt;{{cite book |title = Quantum Integral Medicine: Towards a New Science of Healing and Human Potential |first = Michael |last = Wayne |publisher = iThink Books |year = 2005 |page = 22 |isbn = 978-0976679707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — which should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the [[ten percent of the brain myth]], as it refers to general human potential rather than neurological activity.

During the course of this research, Leonard met Michael Murphy, the founder of the nascent [[Esalen Institute]] that at the time was running educational programs for adults on the topic of "human potentialities". Leonard and Murphy became close friends and together put forth the idea that there should be a human potential movement.&lt;ref name="Wayne2005"/&gt;

==Social influence==
HPM was regarded by some as being related to [[Psychedelia|psychedelic culture]] such as [[hippie]]s and [[Summer of Love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-21/news/mn-8912_1_san-francisco-establishment |title = 20 Years After Hippie Invasion : The Summer of Love That Left Its Imprint on S.F. |first = Mark A. |last = Stein |date = June 21, 1987 |publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had not been defined what was "human potentialities", but LGAT ([[large-group awareness training]]) such as [[Lifespring]] and "[[Erhard Seminars Training|est]]" taught self-awareness and consciousness expansion under HPM.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/cultmain.htm |title = The Cult Controversy: Spiritual Quest or Mind Control? |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = April 26, 1997 |website = ''Archives of WashingtonPost.com.'' |accessdate = February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They themselves came to be called not only "[[New Age]]" but also "[[List of new religious movements|new religion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of New Age Religions |first = James R. |last = Lewis |year = 2004 |publisher = [[Prometheus Books]] |page = 187 |isbn = 1591020409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of HPM was also used in [[multi-level marketing]] through [[Mind Dynamics]], precursor to LGAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=957&amp;Itemid=12 |title = Mind Dynamics (precursor to LGAT) |website = Cult Awareness and Information Centre. |accessdate = February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Elizabeth Puttick writes in the ''Encyclopedia of New Religions'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The human potential movement (HPM) originated in the 1960s as a counter-cultural rebellion against mainstream psychology and organised religion. It is not in itself a religion, new or otherwise, but a psychological philosophy and framework, including a set of values that have made it one of the most significant and influential forces in modern Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last = Puttick |first = Elizabeth |editor-last = Hugh |editor-first = Christopher |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of New Religions |title = Human Potential Movement |year = 2004 |publisher = Lion |location = Oxford |isbn = 9780745950730 |pages = 399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Authors and essayists==
[[Abraham Maslow]] published his concept of a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]] in a paper in 1943. He argued that as people's basic survival needs are met, so their desire to grow in mental and emotional dimensions increases. He also coined the term 'metamotivation' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Dick Price]] founded the [[Esalen Institute]] in 1962, primarily as a center for the study and development of human potential, and some people continue to regard Esalen as the geographical center of the movement {{As of|2007|alt=today}}.

In 1964, [[Virginia Satir]] became Esalen's first Director of Training, which required her to oversee the Human Potential Development Program. At the time, Satir was well established as an author, trainer and consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Woolf |first = Linda |title = Women's Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society |publisher = Webster University |accessdate = November 28, 2012 |url = http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/satir2.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, Satir actively encouraged therapists to shift their focus to relationship education to help clients discover "more joy, more reality, more connectedness, more accomplishment and more opportunities for people to grow."&lt;ref name="satir"&gt;{{cite web |last = Eisenberg |first = Seth |title = Revolutions of a Lifetime at Home and Abroad |work = Fatherhood Channel |date = February 21, 2011 |url = http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/02/21/revolutions-of-a-lifetime-at-home-and-abroad-084/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aldous Huxley]] gave lectures on the "Human Potential" at Esalen in the early 1960s. His writings and lectures on the mystical dimensions of psychedelics and on what he called "the perennial philosophy" were foundational. Moreover, his call for an institution that could teach the 'nonverbal humanities' and the development of the 'human potentialities' functioned as the working mission statement of early Esalen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kripal |first = Jeffrey |title = Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Lasch]] notes the impact of the human potential movement via the [[psychotherapy|therapeutic sector]]: "The new therapies spawned by the human potential movement, according to Peter Marin, teach that "the individual will is all powerful and totally determines one's fate"; thus they intensify the "isolation of the self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Christopher |last = Lasch |title = The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations |location = New York |publisher = Norton |year = 1979 |page = 9 |isbn = 0393011771 }} Quoting {{cite news |first = Peter |last = Marin |title = The New Narcissism |magazine = [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |date = October 1975 |page = 48 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Leonard]], a magazine writer and editor who conducted research for an article on human potential, became an important early influence on Esalen. Leonard claims that he coined the phrase "Human Potential Movement" during a brainstorming session with Michael Murphy, and popularized it in his 1972 book ''The Transformation: A Guide to the Inevitable Changes in Mankind''. Leonard worked closely with the Esalen Institute afterwards, and in 2005 served as its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transformation: A Guide to the Inevitable Changes in Humankind |last = Leonard |first = George |publisher = Tarcher |year = 1972 |isbn = 978-0-87477-169-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Potential in Europe==
Human Potential concepts found in Europe a growing interest thanks to training courses aimed at managers, graduate students, and unemployed, mainly funded by the [[European Union]] in public development courses in the 80's and 90's.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D., Ertl, H. (Eds.) (2003), Implementing European Union Education and Training Policy. A Comparative Study of Issues in Four Member States. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; In these courses, modules such as communication skills, marketing, leadership and others in the "soft skills" area were embedded in the programs, and enabled the familiarization of most of the Human Potential concepts. A key role was played by "EU Strategic objective 3, 4, and 5" that explicitly included transversal key competences such learning to learn, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, and cultural awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training, 2009/C 119/02&lt;/ref&gt;

These training programs, lasting as much as 900 to 1200 hours{{efn|For context, 1200 hours translates to 150 days of full time training at 8 hours per day}} aimed at enhancing creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship, and contained at all levels of education and training Human Potential concepts. One of the core concepts, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs, became popular in Europe in the 80s mainly as a support to understanding consumer's needs, and only after its use as key marketing concept. Philip Kotler's book "Marketing Management" was particularly influential in the 80's in popularizing several human potential concepts that were "embedded" in the book&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, Philip (1984), Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning, and Control.  Published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., first edition 1984. {{ISBN|9780135579275}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered in the working and management community.

Specifically targeted books on Human Potential have emerged in Europe and can be found in the works of specific authors. For the "Anglo" cultural area, the work of [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]&lt;!-- also a noted writer on leadership and coaching --&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, John (1992), Coaching for Performance: Growing Human Potential and Purpose: The Principles and Practice of Coaching and Leadership, Brealey Publishing (first edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
contains a harsh critique to mainstream approaches to human potential as a fast cures for self-improvement: "Contrary to the appealing claims of [[The One Minute Manager]], there are no quick fixes in business".&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, John (2010), Coaching for Performance: Growing Human Potential and Purpose: The Principles and Practice of Coaching and Leadership, Brealey Publishing (fourth edition), Introduction, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

For the "Latin" cultural area, an early approach to Human Potential can be found in the work of [[Maria Montessori]]. Montessori's theory and philosophy of education were influenced by the work of [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin]], [[Friedrich Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], and her model emphasized autonomous learning, sensory exploration and training children in physical activities, empowering their senses and thoughts by exposure to sights, smells, and tactile experiences, and later, problem solving.

{{Unsourced|biography|date=May 2014}}

'''Herman "Hyman" Amberg''' (c. 1902 – November 3, 1926) was a New York mobster who, with his brothers [[Joseph Amberg|Joseph]] and [[Louis Amberg|Louis]], formed one of the prominent criminal gangs during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].

Often acting as an enforcer, he was arrested for the murder of a local jeweler in 1926. While awaiting trial in the [[Tombs Prison|Tombs]], he and another prisoner attempted to escape after acquiring guns on November 3, 1926. However, they made it only as far as the prison wall before being trapped by prison guards. Rather than surrender to prison authorities, Amberg and the other prisoner committed suicide. He is buried in [[Montefiore Cemetery]].

'''Isabella d'Este''' (3 October 1635 &amp;ndash; 21 August 1666) was [[List of Parmese consorts|Duchess of Parma]], and second wife of Duke [[Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio II Farnese]]. She was the paternal grandmother of [[Elisabetta Farnese]].

==Princess of Modena==

Isabella was a daughter of the [[Duke of Modena]] [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Francesco I d'Este]] and [[Maria Caterina Farnese]], daughter of [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]]. She was the sister of two Dukes of Modena, [[Alfonso IV d'Este, Duke of Modena|Alfonso IV d'Este]] (1634–1662) and [[Rinaldo d'Este, Duke of Modena|Rinaldo]] (1655–1737). At the death of her mother, her father married again twice.

==Duchess of Parma==

After the death of his first wife [[Marguerite Yolande of Savoy]], Ranuccio II married in 1663 his cousin Isabella. But the couple only met on 18 February 1664, when Isabella arrived in Parma. For this occasion, a grandiose celebration and musical spectacles were organised. The couples had three children all of which would survive childhood. Only the latter [[Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma|Odoardo]], would have issue; he was the father of [[Elisabeth Farnese]], queen of Spain and ancestor of most modern royalty. 

But the birth of her son proved fatal to Isabella, who died of complications nine days later on 21 August, at [[Colorno]]. She was the paternal grandmother of [[Elisabeth Farnese]], Queen of Spain. She was buried at the [[Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata]] in the city of Parma on the 23 August. Her husband remarried in October 1668 to her sister [[Maria d'Este]]. By her he had a further seven children as well as the last two [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] [[Dukes of Parma]].

==Issue==

*[[Margherita Maria Farnese]] (24 November 1664 – 17 June 1718), married 1692 [[Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena]].
*Teresa Farnese (1665–1702), benedictine nun in Sant’ Alessandro Monastery of Parma.
*[[Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma]] (12 August 1666 – 1693), heir to the Duchy of Parma und Piacenza, but who died before his father. He married [[Countess Palatine Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg]], and was the father of [[Isabelle Farnese]], future Queen of Spain.

She was sunk off of [[Palau]] by [[USS Conklin (DE-439)|USS ''Conklin'']] on 19 November 1944.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-37.htm|title=Imperial Submarines|website=www.combinedfleet.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Boyd, Carl &amp; Yoshida, Akikiko (2002). ''The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II''. Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press. {{ISBN|1-55750-015-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
''I-37'' was built in accordance with the specifications of the B1 class submarines. ''I-37'' was 108.7 meters (356&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in) long, had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of 9.3 meters (30&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in) and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of 5.1 meters (16&amp;nbsp;ft 9 in). She could dive to 100 meters (330 feet.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She was armed with six internal bow 53.3&amp;nbsp;cm (21.0&amp;nbsp;in) [[torpedo tube]]s and carried a total of 17 [[torpedo]]es. ''I-37'' was also armed with a single [[14 cm/40 11th Year Type naval gun|{{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}}/40]] [[deck gun]] and two mounts for [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Service history ==
The submarine that would become ''I-37'' was laid down at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] Navy Yard as Submarine No. 150 on 7 December 1940. She was launched on 22 October 1941 as ''I-49''. On 10 March 1943 she was commissioned in Kure and renumbered ''I-37''.

Originally attached to the [[Kure Naval District]], she was transferred to [[Penang Island|Penang]] in June 1943 for patrols in the [[Indian Ocean in World War II|Indian Ocean]]. There she began raiding allied shipping. She sank the British armed tanker ''San Ernesto'' on 16 June, the [[liberty ship]] [[USS Henry Knox|USS ''Henry Knox'']] on 19 June, the Greek merchant''' '''''Faneromeni'' on 23 October, and the Norwegian tanker ''Scotia'' on 27 November.

''I-37'' was at some point attached to the Japanese Eighth Fleet.

On 19 November 1944 ''I-37'' was pursued and destroyed in a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] attack by the [[destroyer]] USS ''Conklin''. She was presumed lost on 6 December 1944 and was stricken from the navy list on 10 March 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|In Russian: ''Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin'' (Иосиф Виссарионович Сталин).}} (born '''Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili''';{{efn|name=stalinsname}} 18 December 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] revolutionary and politician of [[Georgian people|Georgian]] ethnicity. He ruled the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 until his death in 1953, holding the titles of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1952 and the nation's [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] from 1941 to 1953. Initially presiding over an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[one-party state|one-party]] system that [[plurality voting|governed by plurality]], he became the ''de facto'' [[dictator]] of the Soviet Union by the 1930s. Ideologically committed to the [[Leninism|Leninist]] interpretation of [[Marxism]], Stalin helped to formalise these ideas as [[Marxism–Leninism]], while his own policies became known as [[Stalinism]].

&lt;!--Early life, revolutionary activity and rise to power--&gt;
Born to a poor family in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), Stalin joined the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', and raised funds for [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] and created a one-party state under Lenin's new Communist Party, Stalin joined its governing [[Politburo]]. Serving in the [[Russian Civil War]] before overseeing [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|the Soviet Union's establishment]] in 1922, Stalin [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|assumed leadership over the country]] following Lenin's 1924 death. During Stalin's rule, "[[Socialism in One Country]]" became a central tenet of the party's dogma, and Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]] was replaced with a centralized [[command economy]]. Under the [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan system]], the country underwent [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|agricultural collectivisation]] and rapid industrialization but experienced significant disruptions in food production that contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|famine of 1932–33]]. To eradicate accused "[[enemies of the working class]]", Stalin instituted the "[[Great Purge]]", in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939.

&lt;!--Governance in the latter part of the 1930s through to his death--&gt;
Stalin's government promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the [[Communist International]] and supported [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] movements throughout Europe during the 1930s, particularly in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1939, it signed a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], resulting in the soviet [[invasion of Poland]] on September 17th. Germany ended the pact by [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]] in 1941. Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet [[Red Army]] repelled the German incursion and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in 1945, ending [[World War II]] in Europe. The Soviets [[Occupation of the Baltic states|annexed the Baltic states]] and helped establish [[Communist state|Soviet-aligned governments]] throughout Central and Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged from the war as the two world [[superpower]]s. Tensions arose between the Soviet-backed [[Eastern Bloc]] and U.S.-backed [[Western Bloc]] which became known as the [[Cold War]]. Stalin led his country through its post-war reconstruction, during which it [[Soviet atomic bomb project|developed a nuclear weapon]] in 1949. In these years, the country experienced [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|another major famine]] and an [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-semitic]] campaign peaking in the [[Doctors' plot]]. Stalin died in 1953 and was eventually succeeded by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|denounced his predecessor]] and initiated a [[de-Stalinisation]] process throughout Soviet society.

&lt;!--Reception and legacy--&gt;
Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive [[Stalin's cult of personality|personality cult]] within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, for whom Stalin was a champion of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] and the working class. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, [[ethnic cleansing]], hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines which caused the deaths of millions.

===Childhood to young adulthood: 1878–1899===
Stalin was born in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 December}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's year and date of birth, Ioseb Jughashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]: 6 December) 1878. This birth date is maintained in his School Leaving Certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, a police arrest record from 18 April 1902 which gave his age as 23 years, and all other surviving pre-Revolution documents. As late as 1921, Stalin himself listed his birthday as 18 December 1878 in a curriculum vitae in his own handwriting. After coming to power in 1922, Stalin gave his birth date as 21 December 1879 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style date]] 9 December 1879). That became the day his birthday was celebrated in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=23}} }} He was the son of [[Besarion Jughashvili]] and [[Keke Geladze|Ekaterine Geladze]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=5|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=14|4a1=Montefiore|4y=2007|4p=19|5a1=Khlevniuk|5y=2015|5p=11}} who had married in May 1872,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=19|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=16}} and had lost two sons in infancy prior to Stalin's birth.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=16|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=22|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=17|5a1=Khlevniuk|5y=2015|5p=11}} They were ethnically [[Georgians|Georgian]] and Stalin grew up speaking the [[Georgian language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=11}} Gori was then part of the [[Russian Empire]], and was home to a population of 20,000, the majority of whom were Georgian but with Armenian, Russian, and Jewish minorities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=15}} Stalin was [[baptism|baptised]] on 29 December.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=16}} He was nicknamed "Soso", a diminutive of "Ioseb".{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=11|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=16|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=23|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=17}}

[[File:The Orthodox Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|left|In 1894 Stalin began his studies at the Tiflis Spiritual Seminary (pictured here in the 1870s)]]

After the [[Russian legislative election, 1912|October 1912 Duma elections]] resulted in six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks being elected, Stalin wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions, for which he was criticised by Lenin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=256}} In late 1912, he twice crossed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to visit Lenin in [[Kraków]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=52|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=87–88|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3pp=256–259|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=133}} eventually bowing to Lenin's opposition to reunification with the Mensheviks.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=263}} In January 1913 Stalin travelled to [[Vienna]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=54|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=89|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=263}} there focusing on the 'national question' of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Russian Empire's national and ethnic minorities.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=89|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2pp=264–265}} Lenin wanted to attract these groups to the Bolshevik cause by offering them the right of secession from the Russian state, but at the same time hoped they would remain part of a future Bolshevik-governed Russia.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=266}} Stalin's finished article was titled ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'';{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=53|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=85|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=266|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=133}} Lenin was very happy with it.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=267}} According to Montefiore, this was "Stalin's most famous work".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=266}} The article was published under the pseudonym of "K.

In December 1918, Stalin was sent to [[Perm]] to lead an inquiry into how [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s White forces had been able to decimate Red troops based there.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=83–84|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=172|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=314}} He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=172}} before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=85|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=172}} When the Red Third Regiment defected, he ordered the public execution of captured defectors.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=172}} In September he was returned to the Southern Front.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=172}} During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, and a willingness to take on responsibility in conflict situations.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=173}} At the same time, he disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=173, 174}} In November 1919, the government awarded him the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his wartime service.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=86|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=45|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=331}}

The Bolsheviks had won the civil war by late 1919.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=175}} Sovnarkom turned its attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, to this end forming the [[Communist International]] in March 1919; Stalin attended its inaugural ceremony.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=91|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=175}} Although Stalin did not share Lenin's belief that Europe's proletariat were on the verge of revolution, he acknowledged that as long as it stood alone, Soviet Russia remained vulnerable.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=176}} In December 1918, he drew up decrees recognising Marxist-governed Soviet republics in [[Commune of the Working People of Estonia|Estonia]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–19)|Lithuania]], and [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvia]];{{sfn|Service|2004|p=199}} during the civil war these Marxist governments were overthrown and the Baltic countries became fully independent of Russia, an act Stalin regarded as illegitimate.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=203, 190}} In February 1920, he was appointed to head the [[Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate]];{{sfn|Service|2004|p=174}} that same month he was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=178}}

Following [[Soviet westward offensive of 1918–19|earlier clashes]] between Polish and Russian troops, the [[Polish–Soviet War]] broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine and taking [[Kiev]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=176|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2pp=352–354}} Stalin was moved to Ukraine, on the Southwest Front.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=178|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=357|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=59}} The Red Army forced the Polish troops back into Poland.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=176–177}} Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russians against [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s Polish government.

===Lenin's final years: 1921–1923===
[[File:Lenin and stalin crop.jpg|right|thumb|Stalin (right) confers with an ailing Lenin at Gorky in September 1922]]

The Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|in February 1921 it invaded]] the Menshevik-governed [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]],{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|pp=396–397}} while in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]] to reassert Russian state control.{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=388}} As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each national and ethnic group should have the right to self-expression,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=202}} facilitated through "[[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republics]]" within the Russian state in which they could oversee various regional affairs.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=199–200|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=371}} In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to [[bourgeois nationalism]], while others accused him of remaining too Russocentric by seeking to retain these nations within the Russian state.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=202}}

Stalin's native Caucasus posed a particular problem due to its highly multi-ethnic mix.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=200}} Stalin opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani autonomous republics, arguing that these would likely oppress ethnic minorities within their respective territories; instead he called for a [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=194–196|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=400}} The [[Communist Party of Georgia (Soviet Union)|Georgian Communist Party]] opposed the idea, resulting in the [[Georgian Affair]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=194–195|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2pp=479–481}} In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the southern Caucasus, there calling on Georgian Communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which marginalised the [[Abkhazians|Abkhazian]], [[Ossetian people|Ossetian]], and [[Adjarians|Adjarian]] minorities in Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=203–205|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=400}} On this trip, Stalin met with his son Yakov, and brought him back to Moscow;{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=127|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=232}} Nadya had given birth to another of Stalin's sons, [[Vasily Stalin|Vasily]], in March 1921.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=127|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=232}}

After the civil war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia, largely in opposition to Sovnarkom's food requisitioning project; as an antidote, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms: the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP).{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=89|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=187|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=344|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=64}} There was also internal turmoil in the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for the abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this and Stalin helped rally opposition to Trotsky's position.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=186}} Stalin also agreed to supervise the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Central Committee Secretariat.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=188}} At the [[11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|11th Party Congress]] in 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the party's new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]. Although concerns were expressed that adopting this new post on top of his others would overstretch his workload and give him too much power, Stalin was appointed to the position.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=96|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=78–70|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3pp=189–190|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=411}} For Lenin, it was advantageous to have a key ally in this crucial post.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=190}}

{{Quote box |width=25em |align=left |quote=Stalin is too crude, and this defect which is entirely acceptable in our milieu and in relationships among us as communists, becomes unacceptable in the position of General Secretary.

In May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralysed.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=97|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=53|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=191}} Residing at his [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki dacha]], Lenin's main connection to Sovnarkom was through Stalin, who was a regular visitor.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=191–192|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=413}} Lenin twice asked Stalin to procure poison so that he could commit suicide, but Stalin never did so.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=192|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=414|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=68}} Despite this comradeship, Lenin disliked what he referred to as Stalin's "Asiatic" manner, and told his sister [[Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova|Maria]] that Stalin was "not intelligent".{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=102|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=191–192|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=528}} Lenin and Stalin argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that the Soviet state should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but Stalin supported [[Grigori Sokolnikov]]'s view that doing so was impractical at that stage.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=98|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=193|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=483|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=69–70}} Another disagreement came over the Georgian Affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee's desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over Stalin's idea of a Transcaucasian one.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=95|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=195|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=71–72}}

They also disagreed on the nature of the Soviet state. Lenin called for the country to be renamed the "Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia", reflecting his desire for expansion across the two continents. Stalin believed this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians, instead arguing that ethnic minorities would be content as "autonomous republics" within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=71|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=194|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3pp=475–476|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=68–69}} Lenin accused Stalin of "Great Russian chauvinism"; Stalin accused Lenin of "national liberalism".{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=98–99|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=195|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=477, 478|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=69}} A compromise was reached, in which the country would be renamed the "[[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]" (USSR).{{sfn|Service|2004|p=195}} The USSR's formation was ratified in December 1922; although officially a federal system, all major decisions were taken by the governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in Moscow.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=74|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=206|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=485}} 

Their differences also became personal; Lenin was particularly angered when Stalin was rude to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=99–100, 103|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=72–74|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3pp=210–211|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=70–71}} In the final years of his life, Krupskaya provided governing figures with [[Lenin's Testament]], a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin. These criticized Stalin's rude manners and excessive power, suggesting that Stalin should be removed from the position of General Secretary.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=100–101|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=53, 79–82|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3pp=208–209|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=71}} Some historians have questioned whether Lenin ever produced these, suggesting instead that they may have been written by Krupskaya, who had personal differences with Stalin;{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=501}} Stalin, however, never publicly voiced concerns about their authenticity.{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=528}}

Stalin was now the party's supreme leader,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=276}} although was not the [[head of government]], a task he entrusted to key ally [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=277–278}} Other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, [[Lazar Kaganovich]], and [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]],{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=277, 280|2a1=Conquest|2y=2008|2pp=12–13}} with Stalin ensuring his allies ran the various state institutions.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=278}} According to Montefiore, at this point "Stalin was the leader of the oligarchs but he was far from a dictator".{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=39}} His growing influence was reflected in the naming of various locations after him; in June 1924 the Ukrainian mining town of [[Yuzovka]] became Stalino,{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=130}} and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad on the order of [[Mikhail Kalinin]] and [[Avel Enukidze]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=130|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=160|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=689}}

In 1926, Stalin published ''On Questions of Leninism''.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=244}} Here, he introduced the concept of "[[Socialism in One Country]]", which he presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective. It nevertheless clashed with established Bolshevik views that socialism could not be established in one country but could only be achieved globally through the process of [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=244}} In 1927, there was some argument in the party over Soviet policy regarding China. Stalin had called for the [[Communist Party of China]], led by [[Mao Zedong]], to ally itself with [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) nationalists, viewing a Communist-Kuomintang alliance as the best bulwark against Japanese imperial expansionism. Instead, the KMT repressed the Communists and a [[Chinese civil war|civil war broke out]] between the two sides.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=392|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2pp=626–631|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=89–90}}

The Soviet Union lagged behind the industrial development of Western countries,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=256}} and there had been a shortfall of grain; 1927 produced only 70% of grain produced in 1926.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=254}} Stalin's government feared attack from Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Romania.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=172–173|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=256|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3pp=638–639}} Many Communists, including in [[Komsomol]], [[OGPU]], and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and its market-oriented approach;{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=144, 146|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=258}} they had concerns about those who profited from the policy: affluent peasants known as "[[kulak]]s" and the small business owners or "[[Nepmen]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=256|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=571}} At this point, Stalin turned against the NEP, putting him on a course to the "left" even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=253|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=101}}

In early 1928 Stalin travelled to [[Novosibirsk]], where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding their grain and ordered that the kulaks be arrested and their grain confiscated, with Stalin bringing much of the area's grain back to Moscow with him in February.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=147–148|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=257–258|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3pp=661, 668–669, 679–684|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=102–103}} At his command, grain procurement squads surfaced across Western Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between these squads and the peasantry.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=258|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=103}} Stalin announced that both kulaks and the "middle peasants" must be coerced into releasing their harvest.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=258}} Bukharin and several other Central Committee members were angry that they had not been consulted about this measure, which they deemed rash.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=258|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=105}} In January 1930, the Politburo approved the liquidation of the kulak class; accused kulaks were rounded up and exiled to other parts of the country or to concentration camps.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=267}} Large numbers died during the journey.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=160|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=166}} By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected by the de-kulakisation policy.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=267}} According to Stalin biographer [[Dmitri Volkogonov]], de-kulakisation was "the first mass terror applied by Stalin in his own country".{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=167}}

In 1929, the Politburo announced the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|mass collectivisation of agriculture]],{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=265–266|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=110–111}} establishing both ''[[kolkhozy]]'' collective farms and ''[[sovkhoz]]'' state farms.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=234}} Stalin barred kulaks from joining these collectives.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=266|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=112}} Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face the fate of the kulaks; others joined amid intimidation and violence from party loyalists.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=113}}
By 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=271}} Many of the collectivised peasants resented the loss of their private farmland,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=270}} and productivity slumped.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=270|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=116}} Famine broke out in many areas,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=272|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=116}} with the Politburo frequently ordering the distribution of emergency food relief to these regions.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=272}} Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation broke out in Ukraine, northern Caucasus, southern Russia, and central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were repressed by the Red Army.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=270|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=113–114}} Stalin responded to the uprisings with [[Dizzy with Success|an article]] insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=160|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=114}} Although he and Stalin had been close for many years,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=174}} Bukharin expressed concerns about these policies; he regarded them as a return to Lenin's old "[[war communism]]" policy and believed that it would fail. By mid-1928 he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=172|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=260|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3p=708}} In November 1929 Stalin removed him from the Politburo.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=158|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=266|3a1=Conquest|3y=2008|3p=18}}

Officially, the Soviet Union had replaced the irrationality and wastefulness of a [[market economy]] with a [[planned economy]] organised along a long-term, precise, and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ''ad hoc'' commandments issued from the centre, often to make short-term targets.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=227, 229}} In 1928, the [[first five-year plan]] was launched, its main focus on boosting heavy industry;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=259}} it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=274}} The USSR underwent a massive economic transformation.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=265}} New mines were opened, new cities like [[Magnitogorsk]] constructed, and work on the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] begun.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=265}} Millions of peasants moved to the cities, although urban house building could not keep up with the demand.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=265}} Large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=118}} Many of the major construction projects, including the White Sea-Baltic Canal and the [[Moscow Metro]], were constructed largely through forced labour.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|pp=186, 190}} The last elements of workers' control over industry were removed, with factory managers increasing their authority and receiving privileges and perks;{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=231–233}} Stalin defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx's argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=241–242}} To promote the intensification of labour, a series of medals and awards as well as the [[Stakhanovite movement]] were introduced.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=231}} Stalin's message was that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling amid the [[Wall Street crash]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=269}} His speeches and articles reflected his [[utopianism|utopian]] vision of the Soviet Union rising to unparalleled heights of human development, creating a "[[New Soviet man|new Soviet person]]". {{sfn|Service|2004|p=300}}

====Cultural and foreign policy====
In 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=152–153|2a1=Sandle|2y=1999|2p=214|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=107–108}} He warned of a "danger from the right", including in the Communist Party itself.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=108}} The first major [[show trial]] in the USSR was the [[Shakhty Trial]] of 1928, in which several middle-class "industrial specialists" were convicted of sabotage.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=152–155|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=259|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3pp=687, 702–704, 709|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=107}} From 1929 to 1930, further show trials were held to intimidate opposition:{{sfn|Service|2004|p=268}} these included the [[Industrial Party Trial]], [[1931 Menshevik Trial|Menshevik Trial]], and [[Metro-Vickers Affair|Metro-Vickers Trial]].{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=155}} Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=324}} he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state hierarchy and made the Russian language compulsory throughout schools and offices, albeit to be used in tandem with local languages in areas with non-Russian majorities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=326}} Nationalist sentiment among ethnic minorities was suppressed.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=301}} Conservative social policies were promoted to enhance social discipline and boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units and motherhood, the [[LGBT history in Russia#Soviet Union|re-criminalisation of homosexuality]], restrictions placed on abortion and divorce, and the abolition of the ''[[Zhenotdel]]'' women's department.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=244, 246}}

[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph taken of the 1931 demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow in order to make way for the [[Palace of the Soviets]]]]

Stalin desired a "cultural revolution",{{sfn|Service|2004|p=299}} entailing both the creation of a culture for the "masses" and the wider dissemination of previously elite culture.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=304}} He oversaw the proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as the advancement of literacy and numeracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1pp=111, 127|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=308}} "[[Socialist realism]]" was promoted throughout the arts,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=246|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=85}} while Stalin personally wooed prominent writers, namely [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], and [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]].{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=302–303}} He also expressed patronage for scientists whose research fitted within his preconceived interpretation of Marxism; he for instance endorsed the research of agrobiologist [[Trofim Lysenko]] despite the fact that it was rejected by the majority of Lysenko's scientific peers as [[pseudo-science|pseudo-scientific]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=211, 276–277|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=307}} The government's anti-religious campaign was re-intensified,{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=157}} with increased funding given to the [[League of Militant Atheists]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=301}} Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Buddhist clergy faced persecution.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=268}} Many religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow's [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], destroyed in 1931 to make way for the (never completed) [[Palace of the Soviets]].{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=191}} Religion retained an influence over much of the population; in the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 census]], 57% of respondents identified as religious.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=325}}

Throughout the 1920s and beyond, Stalin placed a high priority on foreign policy.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=379}} He personally met with a range of Western visitors, including [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], both of whom were impressed with him.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|pp=183–184}} Through the Communist International, Stalin's government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere in the world;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=282}} initially, Stalin left the running of the organisation largely to Bukharin.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=261}} At its 6th Congress in July 1928, Stalin informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came not from the right but from non-Marxist socialists and [[social democracy|social democrats]], whom he called "[[social fascism|social fascists]]";{{sfnm|1a1=McDermott|1y=1995|1pp=410–411|2a1=Conquest|2y=1991|2p=176|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3pp=261, 383|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=720}} Stalin recognised that in many countries, the social democrats were the Marxist-Leninists' main rivals for working-class support.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=173}} This preoccupation with opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin, who regarded the growth of [[fascism]] and the [[far right]] across Europe as a far greater threat.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=261}} After Bukharin's departure, Stalin placed the Communist International under the administration of [[Dmitry Manuilsky]] and [[Osip Piatnitsky]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=282}}

Stalin faced problems in his family life. In 1929, his son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide; his failure earned Stalin's contempt.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=289|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=595}} His relationship with Nadya was also strained amid their arguments and her mental health problems.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=289}} In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which Stalin flirted with other women, Nadya shot herself.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=169|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=90|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3pp=291–292}}
Publicly, the cause of death was given as [[appendicitis]]; Stalin also concealed the real cause of death from his children.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1pp=94, 95|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=292, 294}} Stalin's friends noted that he underwent a significant change following her suicide, becoming emotionally harder.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=297}}

===Major crises: 1932–1939===

====Famine====

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|Starved peasants on streets of [[Kharkiv]] in 1933]]

Within the Soviet Union, there was widespread civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=316}} Social unrest, previously restricted largely to the countryside, was increasingly evident in urban areas, prompting Stalin to ease on some of his economic policies in 1932.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=310}} In May 1932, he introduced a system of kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade their surplus produce.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=310|2a1=Davies|2a2=Wheatcroft|2y=2006|2p=627}} At the same time, penal sanctions became more severe; at Stalin's instigation, in August 1932 a decree was introduced meaning that the theft of even a handful of grain could be a capital offense.{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1a2=Wheatcroft|1y=2006|1p=628}} The second five-year plan had its production quotas reduced from that of the first, with the main emphasis now being on improving living conditions.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=310}} It therefore emphasised the expansion of housing space and the production of consumer goods.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=310}} Like its predecessor, this Plan was repeatedly amended to meet changing situations; there was for instance an increasing emphasis placed on armament production after [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] in 1933.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=318}}

The Soviet Union experienced a [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932–33]];{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=312|2a1=Conquest|2y=2008|2pp=19–20|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=117}} between five and seven million people died.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=117}} Worst affected were Ukraine and the North Caucuses, although the famine also impacted Kazakhstan and several Russian provinces.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=119}} Historians have long debated whether Stalin's government had intended the famine to occur or not;{{sfn|Ellman|2005|p=823}} there are no known documents in which Stalin or his government explicitly called for starvation to be used against the population.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellman|1y=2005|1p=824|2a1=Davies|2a2=Wheatcroft|2y=2006|2pp=628, 631}} The 1931 and 1932 harvests had been poor ones due to weather conditions,{{sfnm|1a1=Ellman|1y=2005|1pp=823–824|2a1=Davies|2a2=Wheatcroft|2y=2006|2p=626|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=117}} and had followed several years in which lower productivity had resulted in a gradual decline in output.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=117}} Government policies—including the focus on rapid industrialisation, the socialisation of livestock, and the emphasis on sown areas over [[crop rotation]]—exacerbated the problem;{{sfn|Ellman|2005|p=834}} the state had also failed to build reserve grain stocks for such an emergency.{{sfn|Davies|Wheatcroft|2006|p=626}} Stalin blamed the famine on hostile elements and wreckers within the peasantry;{{sfnm|1a1=Ellman|1y=2005|1p=824|2a1=Davies|2a2=Wheatcroft|2y=2006|2pp=627–628|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=120}} his government provided small amounts of food to famine-struck rural areas, although this was wholly insufficient to deal with the levels of starvation.{{sfn|Davies|Wheatcroft|2006|p=627}} In keeping with their ideology, the Communists believed that food supplies should be prioritised for the urban workforce;{{sfnm|1a1=Ellman|1y=2005|1p=833|2a1=Kuromiya|2y=2008|2p=665}} for Stalin, the fate of Soviet industrialisation was far more important than the lives of the peasantry.{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1a2=Wheatcroft|1y=2006|1p=628|2a1=Ellman|2y=2007|2p=664}} Grain exports, which were a major means of Soviet payment for machinery, declined heavily.{{sfn|Davies|Wheatcroft|2006|p=627}} Stalin would not acknowledge that his policies had contributed to the famine,{{sfn|Davies|Wheatcroft|2006|p=628}} the existence of which was denied to foreign observers.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=164|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=724}}

====Ideological and foreign affairs====
In 1935–36, Stalin oversaw a new constitution; its dramatic liberal features were designed as propaganda weapons, for all power rested in the hands of Stalin and his Politburo.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=319}} He declared that "socialism, which is the first phase of communism, has basically been achieved in this country".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=319}} In 1938, ''[[The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)]]'', colloquially known as the ''Short Course'', was released;{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=212|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=552–443|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=361}} Conquest later referred to it as the "central text of Stalinism".{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=212}} A number of authorised Stalin biographies were also published,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=361}} although Stalin generally wanted to be portrayed as the embodiment of the Communist Party rather than have his life story explored.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=362}} During the later 1930s, Stalin placed "a few limits on the worship of his own greatness".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=362}} By 1938, Stalin's inner circle had gained a degree of stability, containing the personalities who would remain there until Stalin's death.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=216}}

Seeking improved international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union secured membership of the [[League of Nations]], of which it had previously been excluded.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=386}} Stalin initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter came to power in Germany.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=217}} Stalin admired Hitler, particularly his manoeuvres to remove rivals within the [[Nazi Party]] in the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=176|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=116|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=340}} Stalin nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] of Western Europe;{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=218|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=123, 135}} in May 1935, the Soviets signed a [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|treaty of mutual assistance]] with France and Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=135}} At the Communist International's [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern|7th Congress]], held in July–August 1935, the Soviet government encouraged Marxist-Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a [[popular front]] against fascism.{{sfnm|1a1=Haslam|1y=1979|1pp=682–683|2a1=Conquest|2y=1991|2p=218|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=385|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=135}} In turn, the anti-communist governments of Germany, [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] of 1936.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=392|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=154}} 

When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July 1936, the Soviets sent 648 aircraft and 407 tanks to the left-wing [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]]; these were accompanied by 3000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the [[International Brigades]] set up by the Communist International.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=219|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=387}} Stalin took a strong personal involvement in the Spanish situation.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=154}} Germany and Italy backed the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]], which was ultimately victorious in March 1939.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=387, 389}} With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]] the following August.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=156}} Stalin aided the Chinese as the KMT and the Communists had suspended their civil war and formed the desired [[Second United Front|United Front]].{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=392}}

====The Great Terror====

Stalin often gave conflicting signals regarding state repression.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=126}} In May 1933, he released from prison many convicted of minor offenses, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=125}} In September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments; that same month he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=126}} This mixed approach began to change in December 1934, after prominent party member [[Sergey Kirov]] was murdered.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=179|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2pp=126–127|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=314|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=128–129}} After the murder, Stalin became increasingly concerned by the threat of assassination, improved his personal security, and rarely went out in public.{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=327}} State repression intensified after Kirov's death;{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=128, 137}} Stalin instigated this, reflecting his prioritisation of security above other considerations.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=347}} Stalin issued a decree establishing [[NKVD troika]]s which could mete out rulings without involving the courts.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=315}} In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counter-revolutionaries from urban areas;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=318}} in early 1935, over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=318}} In 1936, [[Nikolai Yezhov]] became head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=139}}

Stalin orchestrated the arrest of many former opponents in the Communist Party [[Central Committee elected by the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|as well as sitting members of the Central Committee]]: denounced as Western-backed mercenaries, many were imprisoned or exiled internally.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=314–317}} The first [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]] took place in August 1936; Kamenev and Zinoviev were among those accused of plotting assassinations, found guilty in a show trial, and executed.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1pp=139, 154–155, 164–172, 175–176|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=320|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=139}} The second Moscow Show Trial took place in January 1937,{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=139–140}} and the third in March 1938, in which Bukharin and Rykov were accused of involvement in the alleged Trotskyite-Zinovievite terrorist plot and sentenced to death.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1pp=192–193|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=346|3a1=Conquest|3y=2008|3p=24|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=140}} By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from the Politburo, which was controlled entirely by Stalin.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=176–177}}
There were mass expulsions from the party,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=349}} with Stalin commanding foreign communist parties to also purge anti-Stalinist elements.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=391}}

During the 1930s and 1940s, NKVD groups assassinated defectors and opponents abroad;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=394}} in August 1940, [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|Trotsky was assassinated]] in Mexico, eliminating the last of Stalin's opponents among the former Party leadership.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=230|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=394|3a1=Overy|3y=2004|3p=338|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=174}} In May, this was followed by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1p=201|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=349|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=140}} These purges replaced most of the party's old guard with younger officials who did not remember a time before Stalin's leadership and who were regarded as more personally loyal to him.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=137–138, 147}} Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with Stalin to avoid becoming the victim of the purge.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=140}} Such functionaries often carried out a greater number of arrests and executions than their quotas set by Stalin's central government.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=204}}

Repressions further intensified in December 1936 and remained at a high level until November 1938, a period known as the [[Great Purge]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=347}} By the latter part of 1937, the purges had moved beyond the party and were affecting the wider population.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=141, 150}} In July 1937, the Politburo ordered a purge of "anti-Soviet elements" in society, targeting anti-Stalin Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex-White Army soldiers, and common criminals.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=350|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=150–151}} That month, Stalin and Yezhov signed [[NKVD Order No. 00447|Order No. 00447]], listing 268,950 people for arrest, of whom 75,950 were executed.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1pp=203–204|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=350–351|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=150}} He also initiated "national operations", the [[ethnic cleansing]] of non-Soviet ethnic groups—among them Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese—through internal or external exile.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1p=204|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=351, 390|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=151}} During these years, approximately 1.6 million people were arrested,{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=151}} 700,000 were shot, and an unknown number died under NKVD torture.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=151}}

Stalin initiated all key decisions during the Terror, personally directing many of its operations and taking an interest in their implementation.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=151, 159}} His motives in doing so have been much debated by historians.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=151}} His personal writings from the period were — according to Khlevniuk — "unusually convoluted and incoherent", filled with claims about enemies encircling him.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=152}} He was particularly concerned at the success that right-wing forces had in overthrowing the leftist Spanish government,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=347–248|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=125, 156–157}} fearing a domestic [[fifth column]] in the event of future war with Japan and Germany.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=153, 156–157}} The Great Terror ended when Yezhov was removed as the head of the NKVD, to be replaced by [[Lavrentiy Beria]],{{sfn|Service|2004|p=367}} a man totally devoted to Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=245}} Yezhov was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=209|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=369|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=160}} The Terror damaged the Soviet Union's reputation abroad, particularly among sympathetic leftists.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=162}} As it wound down, Stalin sought to deflect responsibility from himself,{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=157}} blaming its "excesses" and "violations of law" on Yezhov.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=159}}

==World War II==
{{Main|Soviet Union in World War II}}

===Pact with Germany: 1939–1941===
As a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin expected an inevitable conflict between competing capitalist powers; after [[Nazi Germany]] [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] and then [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|part of Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, Stalin recognised this war was looming. He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and Britain would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=220–221|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=380–381}} Militarily, the Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts|clashing with the expansionist Japanese]] in the latter part of the 1930s.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=392–393|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=163, 168–169}} Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=185–186}} Between 1940 and 1941 he also purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war broke out.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|pp=232–233, 236}}

As Britain and France seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, Stalin saw a better deal with the Germans.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=399–400}} In May 1939, Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between the two powers.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=220|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=166}} Stalin saw this as an opportunity both for territorial expansion and temporary peace with Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=220|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=168, 169}} In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Germany, negotiated by Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=221|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=57–78|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=399|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=166}} A week later, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]], sparking the UK and France to declare war on it.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=222|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=57–78|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=169}} On 17 September, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|the Red Army entered eastern Poland]], officially to restore order amid the collapse of the Polish state.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=222|2a1=Roberts|2y=2006|2p=43}} On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of their newly conquered territories; Germany gained the linguistically Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province while the Soviets gained Lithuania.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=223|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=402–403|3a1=Wettig|3y=2008|3p=20}} A [[German–Soviet Frontier Treaty]] was signed shortly after, in Stalin's presence.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=224}} The two states [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–41)|continued trading]], undermining the [[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)|British blockade of Germany]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=224|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=405}}

The Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Finland, but the Finnish government refused. The [[Winter War|Soviets invaded Finland]] in November 1939, yet despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=228|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=403|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=172–173}} International opinion backed Finland, with the Soviets being expelled from the League of Nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=279|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=173}} Embarrassed by their inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an [[Moscow Peace Treaty|interim peace treaty]], in which they received territorial concessions from Finland.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=403|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=173}} In June 1940, the Red Army entered the Baltic states, which were forcibly [[Occupation of the Baltic states|merged into the Soviet Union]] in August;{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=227|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=404–405|3a1=Wettig|3y=2008|3pp=20–21|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=173}} they also invaded and annexed [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and northern Bukovina]], parts of Romania.{{sfnm|1a1=Brackman|1y=2001|1p=341|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=173}} The Soviets sought to forestall dissent in these new East European territories with mass repressions.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=170}} One of the most noted instances was the [[Katyn massacre]] of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=229|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=170}}

The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took Stalin by surprise.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=229|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=405}} He increasingly focused on appeasement with the Germans to delay any conflict with them.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=229|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=406}} After the [[Tripartite Pact]] was signed by [[Axis Powers]] Germany, Japan and Italy, in October 1940, Stalin proposed that [[German–Soviet Axis talks|the USSR also join the Axis alliance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=231|2a1=Brackman|2y=2001|2pp=341, 343|3a1=Roberts|3y=2006|3p=58}} To demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, in April 1941 the Soviets signed [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact|a neutrality pact]] with Japan.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=233|2a1=Roberts|2y=2006|2p=63}} Although ''de facto'' head of government for a decade and a half, Stalin concluded that relations with Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that he needed to deal with the problem as ''de jure'' head of government as well: on 6 May, Stalin replaced Molotov as [[Premier of the Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=234|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=180}}

The Soviets allied with the United Kingdom and United States;{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=211}} although the US joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=423}} Responding to the invasion, the Soviets intensified their industrial enterprises in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on production for the military.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=421}} They achieved high levels of industrial productivity, outstripping that of Germany.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=422}} During the war, Stalin was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church, allowing it to resume some of its activities and meeting with [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Patriarch Sergius]] in September 1943.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=442–443|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=242–243}} He also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] to disperse their work more widely.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=441}} [[The Internationale]] was dropped as the country's [[national anthem]], to be replaced with [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union|a more patriotic song]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=442}} The government increasingly promoted [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] sentiment,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=446}} while encouraging increased criticism of [[cosmopolitanism]], particularly the idea of "rootless cosmopolitanism", an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=446–447}} Comintern was dissolved in 1943,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=260|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=444}} and Stalin encouraged foreign Marxist–Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism to broaden their domestic appeal.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=446}}

In April 1942 Stalin overrode Stavka by ordering the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held [[Kharkov]] in eastern Ukraine. This attack proved unsuccessful.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=254|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=424|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=221–222}} That year, Hitler shifted his primary goal from a overall victory on the Eastern Front, to the goal of securing the oil fields southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|pp=117–8}} While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, Stalin considered this to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=124}} In June 1942, the German Army began a [[Case Blue|major offensive]] in [[Southern Russia]], threatening Stalingrad; Stalin ordered the Red Army to hold the city at all costs.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=425}} This resulted in the protracted [[Battle of Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=426}} In December 1942 he placed [[Konstantin Rokossovski]] in charge of holding the city.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=427}} In February 1943, the German troops attacking Stalingrad surrendered.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=428|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=225}} The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war;{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=225}} in commemoration, Stalin declared himself [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=429|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=226}}

By November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the important [[Operation Blau|German strategic southern campaign]] and, although there were 2.5&amp;nbsp;million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=155}} Germany [[Battle of Kursk|attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk]], which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=255|2a1=Roberts|2y=2006|2p=156|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=227}} By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941 to 1942.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=159}} Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from German invasion and air attack.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=163}}

In Allied countries, Stalin was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=452}} In 1941, the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] performed a concert to celebrate his birthday,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=466}} and in 1942, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him "[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=452}} When Stalin learned that people in Western countries affectionately called him "Uncle Joe" he was initially offended, regarding it as undignified.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=317|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=466}} There remained mutual suspicions between Stalin, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], and U.S. President [[Franklin D.

In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt [[Tehran Conference|in Tehran]], a location of Stalin's choosing.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=262|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=460|3a1=Roberts|3y=2006|3p=180|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=229–230}} There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war dismantling of the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=462}} At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=463}} Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin's demand that the German city of [[Königsberg]] be declared Soviet territory.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=463}} Stalin was impatient for the UK and US to open up a [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] to take the pressure off of the East; they eventually did so in mid-1944.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=244, 251|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=461, 469|3a1=Roberts|3y=2006|3p=185|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=223, 229}} Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, which Churchill opposed.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|pp=186–7}} Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=464–465|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=244}}

In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany,{{sfn|Roberts|2006|pp=194–5}} including [[Operation Bagration]], a massive offensive in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] against the German Army Group Centre.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=469|2a1=Roberts|2y=2006|2pp=199–201}} In 1944 the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states, which were then re-annexed into the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=492}} As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and [[Crimea]], various ethnic groups living in the region—the [[Kalmyks]], [[Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingushi]], [[Karachai]], [[Balkars]], and [[Crimean Tatars]]—were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of [[collective responsibility]] as a basis, Stalin's government abolished their autonomous republics and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their populations to Central Asia and Siberia.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=258|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=492|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=232–233}} Over one million people were deported as a result of the policy.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=233}}

In February 1945, the three leaders met at the [[Yalta Conference]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=264|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=465|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=244}} Roosevelt and Churchill conceded to Stalin's demand that Germany pay the Soviet Union 20 billion dollars in reparations, and that his country be permitted to annex [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kurile Islands]] in exchange for entering the war against Japan.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=465–466}} An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=465–466|2a1=Roberts|2y=2006|2pp=241–244}} Privately, Stalin sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=471|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=245}} The Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], with Stalin believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with his aspirations to dominate Poland through a future Marxist government.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=471–472|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=244}} Although concealing his desires from the other Allied leaders, Stalin placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin first, believing that this would enable him to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. Churchill was concerned that this was the case, and unsuccessfully tried to convince the U.S. that the Western Allies should pursue the same goal.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=473}}

In April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler committed suicide]], and Germany surrendered.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=474|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=247}} Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=479–480}} As the Red Army had conquered German territory, they discovered the [[extermination camp]]s that the Nazi administration had run.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=473}} Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=265|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=473|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=234}} Stalin refused to punish the offenders.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=473}} After receiving a complaint about this from Yugoslav communist [[Milovan Djilas]], Stalin asked how after experiencing the traumas of war a soldier could "react normally?

With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=474}} Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's strategic position in Asia.{{sfnm|Glantz|1983|p=xvii}} On 8 August, in between the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the Soviet army [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria]] and defeated the [[Kwantung Army]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=476|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=248–249}} These events led to the [[Japanese surrender]] and the war's end.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=268|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=248}} Soviet forces continued to expand until they occupied all their territorial concessions, but the U.S. rebuffed Stalin's desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied [[occupation of Japan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=267|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=249}}

Stalin attended the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July–August 1945, alongside his new British and U.S. counterparts, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] and President [[Harry Truman]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=267|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=475}} At the conference, Stalin repeated previous promises to Churchill that he would refrain from a "Sovietization" of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|pp=274–5}} Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers.{{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=90–1}} He also pushed for "[[war booty]]", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations.{{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=90–1}} Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin itself—located within the Soviet area—also subdivided thusly.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=506}}

==Post-war era==

===Post-war reconstruction and famine: 1945–1947===
After the war, Stalin was—according to Service—at the "apex of his career".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=481}} Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=484}} His armies controlled [[Central and Eastern Europe]] up to the [[River Elbe]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=481}}
In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of [[Generalissimus of the Soviet Union|Generalissimus]],{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=493|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=247}} and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=480–481}} At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as "the outstanding nation" and "leading force" within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed the Russians over other Soviet nationalities.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=479}} In 1946, the state published Stalin's ''Collected Works''.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=541}} In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which eulogised him to a greater extent than its predecessor.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=543–544}} He was quoted in ''Pravda'' on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=548}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R78376, Budapest, II. Weltfestspiele, Festumzug, Komsomolzen.jpg|thumb|left|Banner of Stalin in Budapest in 1949]]
Despite his strengthened international position, Stalin was cautious about internal dissent and desire for change among the population.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=485|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=262}} He was also concerned about his returning armies, who had been exposed to a wide range of consumer goods in Germany, much of which they had looted and brought back with them. In this he recalled the 1825 [[Decembrist Revolt]] by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=485}} He ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through "filtration" camps as they arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if they were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=493|2a1=Roberts|2y=2006|2p=202}} In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programs were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=492}} The Gulag system of labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three percent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8 million in "special settlements" in isolated areas and another 2.5 million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=268}}

The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=482}} It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=482–483}} The NKVD recorded that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed]], with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=482|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=261}} In the war's aftermath, some of Stalin's associates suggested modifications to government policy.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=500}} Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. Stalin allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=496}} Academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom than they had prior to 1941.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=497}} Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic regeneration, in December 1947 Stalin's government devalued the ruble and abolished the ration-book system.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=497|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=274–278}} Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but reinstalled in 1950.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=289}}

Stalin's health was deteriorating, and heart problems forced a two-month vacation in the latter part of 1945.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=269|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=491}}
He grew increasingly concerned that senior political and military figures might try to oust him; he prevented any of them from becoming powerful enough to rival him and had their apartments bugged with listening devices.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=526|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=268}} He demoted Molotov,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=531–532|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=272–273}} and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=534}} In 1949, he brought [[Nikita Khrushchev]] from Ukraine to Moscow, appointing him a Central Committee secretary and the head of the city's party branch.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=303}} In the [[Leningrad Affair]], the city's leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=534–535|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=282}}

In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities,{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=300–301}} and the USSR experienced a major [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|famine from 1946 to 1947]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=498|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=261}} Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, it was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the state's decision to build up stocks and export food internationally rather than distributing it to famine hit areas.{{sfn|Ellman|2000|pp=611, 618–620}} Current estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellman|1y=2000|1p=622|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=261}} While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=299}} Much of this was constructed by prison labour.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=299}}

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S. and USSR as the dominant world powers.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=502–503}} Tensions among these former Allies grew,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=484}} resulting in the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=503}} Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S. governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=487}} He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an [[atom bomb]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=481}} Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, saying in 1949 that "atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cold War: A New History|last=Gaddis|first=John L.|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0143038276|location=New York|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=508}} In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside [[Semipalatinsk]] in Kazakhstan.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=508|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=293}} Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=297}}

The US began pushing its interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=502}} It launched the [[Marshall Plan]] in June 1947, with which it sought to undermine Soviet hegemony in eastern Europe. The US also offered financial assistance as part of the Marshall Plan on the condition that they opened their markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=504|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=267}}
The Allies demanded that Stalin withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran, which he did in April 1947.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=504}}
Stalin also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya—recently liberated from Italian occupation—to become a Soviet protectorate.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=494}} He sent Molotov as his representative to [[San Francisco]] to take part in negotiations to form the [[United Nations]], insisting that the Soviets have a place on the [[Security Council]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=503}} In April 1949, the Western powers established the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=507|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=281}} Within Western countries, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the "most evil dictator alive" and compared to Hitler.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=551}}

In 1948, Stalin edited and rewrote sections of ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', published as a series of ''Pravda'' articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with Germany, it focused on blaming Western powers for the war.{{sfn|Roberts|2002|pp=96–98}} He erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the war was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=264}} In 1949, celebrations took place to mark Stalin's seventieth birthday (albeit not the correct year) at which Stalin attended an event in the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] alongside Marxist–Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=296|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=548–549|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=290}}

====The Eastern Bloc====
[[File:EasternBloc BasicMembersOnly.svg|thumb|The [[Eastern Bloc]] until 1989]]

After the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=492}} Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments across Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=494}} In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=517}}
He was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=483}} He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=484}} Aware that these countries had been pushed toward socialism through invasion rather than by proletarian revolution, Stalin referred to them not as "dictatorships of the proletariat" but as "people's democracies", suggesting that in these countries there was a pro-socialist alliance combining the proletariat, peasantry, and lower middle-class.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=518}}

Churchill observed that an "[[Iron Curtain]]" had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=279|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=503}} In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders was held in [[Szklarska Poręba]], Poland, from which was formed [[Cominform]] to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=286|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=506|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=267}} Stalin did not personally attend the meeting, sending Zhdanov in his place.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=506}} Various East European communists also visited Stalin in Moscow.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=511}} There, he offered advice on their ideas; for instance he cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=511}} Stalin had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] due to the latter's continued calls for Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing [[Greek Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=286–287|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=515}} In March 1948, Stalin launched an anti-Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist–Leninist doctrine.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=515}} At the second Cominform conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Tito's government, accusing them of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=516}} Stalin ordered several assassination attempts on Tito's life and contemplated invading Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=287}}

Stalin suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=507}} When the US and UK remained opposed to this, Stalin sought to force their hand by [[Berlin Blockade|blockading Berlin]] in June 1948.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=280|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=507|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=281}} He gambled that the others would not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Stalin relented and ended the blockade.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=507|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=281}} In September 1949 the Western powers transformed Western Germany into an independent [[Federal Republic of Germany]]; in response the Soviets formed East Germany into the [[German Democratic Republic]] in October.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=507}} In accordance with their earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=476}} In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], and [[electoral fraud|vote rigging]] was used to ensure that it secured office.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=515}} The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged, with the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] taking control.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=515}} In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=512, 513}} Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=513}} Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=516}} It was aimed for economic [[autarky]] within the Eastern Bloc.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=516}}

====East Asia and Israel====
In October 1949, Mao took power in China.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=301|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=509|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=286}} With this accomplished, Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=509}} Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=553}} In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin. Initially Stalin refused to repeal the [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance|Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945]], which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance|a new treaty between the two countries]].{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=509|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=287–291}} Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance from China; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=552|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=287}}

[[File:Chinese stamp in 1950.jpg|thumb|left|Stalin and Mao Zedong depicted on a Chinese postage stamp from 1950]]
At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the [[Division of Korea|38th parallel]], setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western government in the south.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=552|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=294}} North Korean leader [[Kim Il-Sung]] visited Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south and although Stalin was initially reluctant to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=302|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=553|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3pp=294–295}} The [[Korean People's Army|North Korean Army]] launched the [[Korean War]] by invading the south in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing [[Seoul]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=554}} Both Stalin and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=554}} The U.S. went to the UN Security Council—which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government—and secured military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=554|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=295–296}} Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., convincing the Chinese to aid the North.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=555–556|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=296}}

The Soviet Union was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948. When the Israeli ambassador [[Golda Meir]] arrived in the USSR, Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet her.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=291}} He was further angered by Israel's [[Israel–United States relations|growing alliance with the U.S.]]{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=285}} After Stalin fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=518}} In November 1948, he abolished the JAC,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=291|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=577|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=284}} and show trials took place for some of its members.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=567|2a1=Brackman|2y=2001|2pp=384–5}} The Soviet press engaged in attacks on [[Zionism]], Jewish culture, and "rootless cosmopolitanism",{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=291|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=308–309}} with growing levels of anti-Semitism being expressed across Soviet society.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=576–577}} Stalin's increasing tolerance of anti-Semitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that anti-Semitism had proved a useful mobilising tool for Hitler and that he could do the same;{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=290}} he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a "counter-revolutionary" nation whose members were loyal to the U.S.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=286}} There were rumours, although they have never been substantiated, that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the [[Jewish Autonomous Region]] in [[Birobidzhan]], eastern Siberia.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=577|2a1=Overy|2y=2004|2p=565|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=309}}

===Final years: 1950–1953===

In his later years, Stalin was in poor health.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=571}} He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months vacationing at his Abkhazian dacha.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=572|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=195}} Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=571}} In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the [[Doctors' Plot]]; the majority of the accused were Jewish.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=309|2a1=Etinger|2y=1995|2p=104|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=576|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=307}} He instructed the arrested doctors to be tortured to ensure confession.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=309|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=307–308}} In November, the [[Slánský trial]] took place in Czechoslovakia as 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert Eastern Bloc governments.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=308|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=307}} That same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=308}} In 1951, he initiated the [[Mingrelian affair]], a purge of the Georgian branch of the Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=304–305}}

From 1946 until his death, Stalin only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=560}} The amount of written material that he produced also declined.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=560}} In 1950, Stalin issued the article "[[Marxism and Problems of Linguistics]]", which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=564–565}}
In 1952, Stalin's last book, ''[[Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR]]'', was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country for after his death.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=307|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2pp=566–567}} In October 1952, Stalin gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=578}} There, he emphasised what he regarded as leadership qualities necessary in the future and highlighted the weaknesses of various potential successors, particularly Molotov and Mikoyan.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=579|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=306}} In 1952, he also eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version which he called the Presidium.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=305–306}}

On 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his [[Kuntsevo Dacha|Volynskoe dacha]].{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=311|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=571–572|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3pp=582–584|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4pp=142, 191}} He had suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=312}} He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=311–312|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=572|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=142}} He was hand-fed using a spoon, given various medicines and injections, and [[Hirudo medicinalis#Medicinal use|leeches were applied to him]].{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=312}} Svetlana and Vasily were called to the dacha on 2 March; the latter was drunk and angrily shouted at the doctors, resulting in him being sent home.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=312|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=250}} Stalin died on 5 March 1953.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=313|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=574|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=586|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=313}} According to Svetlana, it had been "a difficult and terrible death".{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=313|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2pp=313–314}} An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral haemorrhage and that he also suffered from severe damage to his cerebral arteries due to [[atherosclerosis]].{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=189}} It is possible that Stalin was murdered.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=587}} Beria has been suspected of murder, although no firm evidence has ever appeared.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=312}}

Stalin's death was announced on 6 March.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=588}} The body was embalmed,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=588|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=314}} and then placed on display in Moscow's House of Unions for three days.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=317}} Crowds were such that a [[Stampede#Human stampedes and crushes|crush]] killed around 100 people.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=588|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=317}} The funeral involved the body being laid to rest in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Red Square on 9 March; hundreds of thousands attended.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=576|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=589|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=318}} That month featured a surge in arrests for "anti-Soviet agitation" as those celebrating Stalin's death came to police attention.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=319}} The Chinese government instituted a period of official mourning for Stalin's death.{{sfn|Li|2009|p=75}}

Stalin left no anointed successor nor a framework within which a transfer of power could take place.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=310}} The Central Committee met on the day of his death, with Malenkov, Beria, and Khruschev emerging as the party's key figures.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=586–587}} The system of [[collective leadership]] was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member attaining autocratic domination again.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=312}} The collective leadership included the following eight senior members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] listed according to the order of precedence presented formally on 5 March 1953: [[Georgy Malenkov]], [[Lavrentiy Beria]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Nikolai Bulganin]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]] and [[Anastas Mikoyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NoIajCLpLigC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=order+of+precedence++1953+++Mikoyan++Vorosilov++Kaganovich#v=onepage&amp;q=order%20of%20precedence%20%201953%20%20%20Mikoyan%20%20Vorosilov%20%20Kaganovich&amp;f=false|title=Flawed Succession: Russia's Power Transfer Crises|editor-first=Uri|editor-last=Ra'anan|location=Oxford|publisher=Lexington Books|page=20|year=2006|isbn=9780739114032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=591}} Economic reform scaled back the mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=315}} The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S.,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=593}} pursuing a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=316}} The doctors who had been imprisoned were released and the anti-Semitic purges ceased.{{sfnm|1a1=Etinger|1y=1995|1pp=120–121|2a1=Conquest|2y=1991|2p=314|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=314}} A mass amnesty for those imprisoned for non-political crimes was issued, halving the country's inmate population, while the state security and Gulag systems were reformed, with torture being banned in April 1953.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=315}}

Stalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of fifteen,{{sfn|Rieber|2005|p=32}} and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=9}} according to Kotkin, Stalin held "zealous Marxist convictions",{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=xi}} while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a "quasi-religious" value for Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=336}} Although he never became a [[Georgian nationalism|Georgian nationalist]],{{sfn|Rieber|2005|p=43}} during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=67}} The historian Alfred J. Rieber noted that he had been raised in "a society where rebellion was deeply rooted in folklore and popular rituals".{{sfn|Rieber|2005|p=43}} Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that "there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter".{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=136|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=205|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=47}} Volkogonov believed that Stalin's Marxism was shaped by his "dogmatic turn of mind", suggesting that this had been instilled in the Soviet leader during his education in religious institutions.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=7}} According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's "few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=9}} Some of these derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=9}} Stalin would often turn to ideology ''post hoc'' to justify his decisions.{{sfn|McDermott|2006|p=7}} Stalin referred to himself as a ''praktik'', meaning that he was more of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=92|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=462}}

As a Marxist, Stalin believed in an inevitable [[Class struggle|class war]] between the world's proletariat and [[bourgeoise]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=93}} He believed that the working classes would prove successful in this struggle and would establish a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]],{{sfn|Service|2004|p=93}} regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=216}} He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes,{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=93–94}} and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=214|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=8}} The new state would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the wastefulness of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=94}} According to Sandle, Stalin was "committed to the creation of a society that was industrialized, collectivized, centrally planned and technologically advanced."{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=211}}

Stalin adhered to the [[Leninism|Leninist]] variant of Marxism.{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|pp=10, 699}} In his book, ''Foundations of Leninism'', he stated that "Leninism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution".{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=545}} He claimed to be a loyal Leninist,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=92}} although was—according to Service—"not a blindly obedient Leninist".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=94}} Stalin respected Lenin, but not uncritically,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=211}} and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=94}} During the period of his revolutionary activity, Stalin regarded some of Lenin's views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoiled émigré, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=95|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=211}} After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences. Whereas Lenin believed that all countries across Europe and Asia would readily unite as a single state following proletariat revolution, Stalin argued that national pride would prevent this, and that different socialist states would have to be formed; in his view, a country like Germany would not readily submit to being part of a Russian-dominated federal state.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=179–180}} Stalin biographer [[Oleg Khlevniuk]] nevertheless believed that the pair developed a "strong bond" over the years,{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=67}} while Kotkin suggested that Stalin's friendship with Lenin was "the single most important relationship in Stalin's life".{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=531}} After Lenin's death, Stalin relied heavily on Lenin's writings—far more so than those of Marx and Engels—to guide him in the affairs of state.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=93–94}} Stalin adopted the Leninist view on the need for a revolutionary [[vanguardism|vanguard]] who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=93}} Leading this vanguard, he believed that the Soviet peoples needed a strong, central figure—akin to a Tsar—whom they could rally around.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=333|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=586}} In his words, "the people need a Tsar, whom they can worship and for whom they can live and work".{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=158}} He read about, and admired, two Tsars in particular: [[Ivan the Terrible]] and [[Peter the Great]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=256|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=333|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=94}} In the personality cult constructed around him, he was known as the ''[[vozhd]]'', an equivalent to the Italian ''[[duce]]'' and German ''[[fuhrer]]''.{{sfn|Kotkin|2017|p=7}}

[[File:Grutas Stalin.jpg|thumb|left|A statue of Stalin in [[Grūtas Park]]; it originally stood in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]]]
[[Stalinism]] was a development of Leninism,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=352}} and while Stalin avoided using the term "Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism", he allowed others to do so.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=357}} Following Lenin's death, Stalin contributed to the theoretical debates within the Communist Party, namely by developing the idea of "[[Socialism in One Country]]". This concept was intricately linked to factional struggles within the party, particularly against Trotsky.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=208–209}} He first developed the idea in December 1924 and elaborated upon in his writings of 1925–26.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=209}} Stalin's doctrine held that socialism could be completed in Russia but that its final victory there could not be guaranteed because of the threat from capitalist intervention. For this reason, he retained the Leninist view that world revolution was still a necessity to ensure the ultimate victory of socialism.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=209}} Although retaining the Marxist belief that the state would wither away as socialism transformed into pure communism, he believed that the Soviet state would remain until the final defeat of international capitalism.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=261}} This concept synthesised Marxist and Leninist ideas with nationalist ideals,{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=211}} and served to discredit Trotsky—who promoted the idea of "[[permanent revolution]]"—by presenting the latter as a defeatist with little faith in Russian workers' abilities to construct socialism.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=210}}

Stalin viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=98}} Ultimately he believed that all nations would merge into a single, global human community,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=98}} and regarded all nations as inherently equal.{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=552}} Stalin argued that the Jews possessed a "national character" but were not a "nation" and were thus unassimilable. He argued that Jewish nationalism, particularly [[Zionism]], was hostile to socialism.{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=565}} In his work, he stated that "the right of secession" should be offered to the ethnic-minorities of the Russian Empire, but that they should not be encouraged to take that option.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=99}} He was of the view that if they became fully autonomous, then they would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of their community; as an example he cited the largely illiterate [[Tatar]]s, whom he claimed would end up dominated by their [[mullah]]s.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=99}} Khlevniuk therefore argued that Stalin reconciled Marxism with imperialism.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=8}}
According to Service, Stalin's Marxism was imbued with a great deal of Russian nationalism.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=9}} According to Montefiore, Stalin's embrace of the Russian nation was pragmatic, as the Russians were the core of the population of the USSR; it was not a rejection of his Georgian origins.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|pp=310, 579}} Stalin's push for Soviet westward expansion into eastern Europe resulted in accusations of [[Russian imperialism]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}}

Ethnically Georgian,{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=1}} Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=97}} and only learned Russian when aged eight or nine.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=97}} He remained proud of his Georgian identity,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|pp=66–67}} and throughout his life retained a Georgian accent when speaking Russian.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=2|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=42|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=97}} According to Montefiore, Stalin was profoundly Georgian in his lifestyle and personality;{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=579}} Service noted that Stalin "would never be Russian", could not credibly pass as one, and never tried to pretend he was.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=85}} Stalin's colleagues described him as "Asiatic", and he told a Japanese journalist that "I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian".{{sfn|Rieber|2005|p=18}} Montefiore was of the view that "after 1917, he became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship."{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=268}}

Stalin had a soft voice,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=183|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=5|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2017|3p=5}} and when speaking Russian did so slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=1}} In private he used coarse language, although avoided doing so in public.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=37}} Described as a poor orator,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=149|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=49|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=334|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=52}} according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was "simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics".{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|pp=xx–xxi}} He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=329}} His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=21|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=97}} Throughout his life, he used various nicknames and pseudonyms, including "Koba", "Soselo", and "Ivanov",{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=395}} adopting "Stalin" in 1912; it was based on the Russian word for "steel" and has often been translated as "Man of Steel".{{sfn|Himmer|1986|p=269}}

As Soviet leader, Stalin typically awoke around 11{{nbsp}}am,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=60}} with lunch being served between 3 and 5{{nbsp}}pm and dinner no earlier than 9{{nbsp}}pm;{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1p=60|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=525}} he then worked late into the evening.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=525}} He often dined with other Politburo members and their families.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|pp=35, 60}} As leader, he rarely left Moscow unless to go to one of his dachas;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=331}} he disliked travel,{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=102, 227}} and refused to travel by plane.{{sfnm|1a1=Khlevniuk|1y=2015|1p=195|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2017|2p=3}} His choice of favoured holiday house changed over the years,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=64}} although he holidayed in southern parts of the USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and again from 1945 to 1951.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=191}} Along with other senior figures, he had a dacha at Zubalova, 35km outside Moscow,{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1pp=57–58|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=594}} although ceased using it after Nadya's 1932 suicide.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=102}} After 1932, he favoured holidays in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, [[Nestor Lakoba]].{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1pp=66–67|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=296}} In 1934, his new [[Kuntsevo Dacha]] was built; 9km from the Kremlin, it became his primary residence.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=215|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=103|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=295}} In 1935 he began using a new dacha provided for him by Lakoba at [[Novy Afon]];{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=178}} in 1936, he had the Kholodnaya Rechka dacha built on the Abkhazian coast, designed by [[Miron Merzhanov]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=572}}

[[File:Stalin birthday2.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese Marxists celebrate Stalin's seventieth birthday in 1949]]

Trotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=xvi|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=xxiii|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=4|4a1=Montefiore|4y=2007|4p=xxiv}} This gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union during his lifetime but was misleading.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=xxiv}} According to Montefiore, "it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that Stalin was always exceptional, even from childhood".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=xxiv}} Stalin had a complex mind,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=343}} great self-control,{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=8|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=337}} and an excellent memory.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1pp=193, 274|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=63|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=115|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=425|5a1=Khlevniuk|5y=2015|5p=148}} He was a hard worker,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=42|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=353|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3pp=424, 465, 597}} and displayed a keen desire to learn;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=115}} when in power, he scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=4–5}} According to Volkogonov, "Stalin's private life and working life were one and the same"; he did not take days off from political activities.{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=145}}

Stalin could play different roles to different audiences,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=317|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=xxvi|3a1=McDermott|3y=2006|3p=13}} and was adept at deception, often deceiving others as to his true motives and aims.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=xvi|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=McDermott|3y=2006|3p=13}} Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow [[Lazar Kaganovich]]'s description of there being "several Stalins" as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality.{{sfn|McDermott|2006|pp=12–13}} He was a good organiser,{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1p=42|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=424}} with a strategic mind,{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=424}} and judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=342}} He acknowledged that he could be rude and insulting,{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=120|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=648}} although rarely raised his voice in anger;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=337}} as his health deteriorated in later life he became increasingly unpredictable and bad tempered.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=145}} Despite his tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming;{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=2003|1p=92|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2pp=49–50|3a1=Kotkin|3y=2014|3pp=117, 465|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2017|4p=5}} when relaxed, he cracked jokes and mimicked others.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=115}} Montefiore suggested that this charm was "the foundation of Stalin's power in the Party".{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=41}} 

Stalin was ruthless,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=338|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=53}} temperamentally cruel,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=318|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=7}} and had a propensity for violence high even among the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=337}} He lacked compassion,{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=4|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=7}} something Volkogonov suggested might have been accentuated by his many years in prison and exile,{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=8}} although he was capable of acts of kindness to strangers, even amid the Great Terror.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=334}} He was capable of self-righteous indignation,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=258|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=285}} and was resentful,{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=4, 344}} vindictive,{{sfnm|1a1=Kotkin|1y=2014|1p=597|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2017|2p=6}} and vengeful, holding onto grievances against others for many years.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1pp=10, 344|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2017|2p=5}} By the 1920s, he was also suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing that people were plotting against him and that there were vast international conspiracies behind acts of dissent.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=336|2a1=Kotkin|2y=2014|2p=736}} He never attended torture sessions or executions,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=175}} although Service thought Stalin "derived deep satisfaction" from degrading and humiliating people and keeping even close associates in a state of "unrelieved fear".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}} Montefiore thought Stalin's brutality marked him out as a "natural extremist";{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=42}} Service suggested he had a paranoid or sociopathic personality disorder.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=343}} Other historians linked his brutality not to any personality trait, but to his unwavering commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and the international Marxist-Leninist cause.{{sfn|McDermott|2006|p=12}}

Stalin publicly condemned anti-Semitism,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=319, 637}} although [[Stalin and antisemitism|was repeatedly accused of it]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=55}} People who knew him, such as Khrushchev, suggested he long harbored negative sentiments toward Jews,{{sfnm|1a1=Etinger|1y=1995|1p=103|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=165}} and anti-Semitic trends in his policies were further fueled by Stalin's struggle against Trotsky.{{sfnm|1a1=Etinger|1y=1995|1p=103|2a1=Rappaport|2y=1999|2p=297}} After Stalin's death, Khrushchev claimed that Stalin encouraged him to incite anti-Semitism in Ukraine, allegedly telling him that "the good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews."{{sfnm|1a1=Pinkus|1y=1984|1pp=107–108|2a1=Brackman|2y=2001|2p=390}} In 1946, Stalin allegedly said privately that "every Jew is a potential spy."{{sfn|Brent|Naumov|2004|p=184}} Conquest stated that although Stalin had Jewish associates, he promoted anti-Semitism.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=8}} Service cautioned that there was "no irrefutable evidence" of anti-Semitism in Stalin's published work, although his private statements and public actions were "undeniably reminiscent of crude antagonism towards Jews";{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=567–568}} he added that throughout Stalin's lifetime, the Georgian "would be the friend, associate or leader of countless individual Jews".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=77}} According to Beria, Stalin had affairs with several Jewish women.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=237}}

===Relationships and family===
[[File:Joseph_Stalin_with_daughter_Svetlana,_1935.jpg|thumb|right|Stalin carrying his daughter, Svetlana]]

Friendship was important to Stalin,{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2007|1p=49|2a1=Fitzpatrick|2y=2015|2p=65}} and he used it to gain and maintain power.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=49}} Kotkin observed that Stalin "generally gravitated to people like himself: parvenu intelligentsia of humble background".{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=9}} He gave nicknames to his favourites, for instance referring to Yezhov as "my blackberry".{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=151}} Stalin was sociable and enjoyed a joke.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=112}} According to Montefiore, Stalin's friendships "meandered between love, admiration, and venomous jealousy".{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=135}} While head of the Soviet Union he remained in contact with many of his old friends in Georgia, sending them letters and gifts of money.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=522|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=135|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=368}}

Stalin was attracted to women and there are no reports of any homosexual tendencies;{{sfn|McCauley|2003|p=90}} according to Montefiore, in his early life Stalin "rarely seems to have been without a girlfriend".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=73}} He was sexually promiscuous, although rarely talked about his sex life.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=209}} Montefiore noted that Stalin's favoured types were "young, malleable teenagers or buxom peasant women",{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=209}} who would be supportive and unchallenging toward him.{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=80|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=209}} According to Service, Stalin "regarded women as a resource for sexual gratification and domestic comfort".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=80}} Stalin married twice and had several offspring.{{sfn|McCauley|2003|p=90}} He married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. According to Montefiore, theirs was "a true love match";{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=5}} Volkogonov suggested that she was "probably the one human being he had really loved".{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=4}} They had a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed Stalin.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=149|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=64|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=167|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=25}} Yakov had a daughter, Galina, before fighting for the Red Army in the Second World War. He was captured by the German Army and then committed suicide.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1pp=150–151|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=364}}

Stalin's second wife was [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva-Stalina|Nadezhda Alliluyeva]]; theirs was not an easy relationship, and they often rowed.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=5}} They had two biological children—a son, [[Vasily Dzhugashvili|Vasily]], and a daughter, [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]—and adopted another son, [[Artyom Sergeyev (general)|Artyom Sergeev]], in 1921.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=9}} During his marriage to Nadezhda, Stalin had affairs with many other women, most of whom were fellow revolutionaries or their wives.{{sfnm|1a1=Montefiore|1y=2003|1p=13|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=255}} Nadezdha suspected that this was the case,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=12}} and committed suicide in 1932.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=154|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2003|2p=16|3a1=Khlevniuk|3y=2015|3p=255}} Stalin regarded Vasily as spoiled and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin's son, Vasily nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=257, 259–260}} Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood,{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=215|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=153|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2003|3pp=9, 227|4a1=Khlevniuk|4y=2015|4p=256}} and was also very fond of Artyom.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=9}} In later life, he disapproved of Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on his relationship with her.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=260|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=521}} After the Second World War he made little time for his children and his family played a decreasingly important role in his life.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|pp=250, 259}} After Stalin's death, Svetlana changed her surname from Stalin to Allilueva,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=593}} and defected to the U.S.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=260}}

After Nadezdha's death, Stalin became increasingly close to his sister-in-law Zhenya Alliluyeva;{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|pp=142–144}} Montefiore believed that they were probably lovers.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=144}} There are unproven rumours that from 1934 onward he had a relationship with his housekeeper Valentina Istomina.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=521}} Stalin had at least two illegitimate children,{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=365}} although he never recognised these as being his.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=252}} One of these, Constantin Kuzakova, later taught philosophy at the [[Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute]], but never met his father.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|pp=365–366}} The other, Alexander, was the son of Lidia Pereprygia; he was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman and the Soviet authorities made him swear never to reveal that Stalin was his biological father.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=366}}

The historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin, "perhaps[…] determined the course of the twentieth century" more than anyone other individual.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=xi}} Biographers like Service and Volkogonov have considered him an outstanding and exceptional politician;{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=108|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=5}} Montefiore labelled Stalin as "that rare combination: both 'intellectual' and killer", a man who was "the ultimate politician" and "the most elusive and fascinating of the twentieth-century titans".{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=xxii}} According to historian Kevin McDermott, interpretations of Stalin range from "the sycophantic and adulatory to the vitriolic and condemnatory".{{sfn|McDermott|2006|p=1}} For most Westerners and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer;{{sfn|McDermott|2006|p=1}} for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder.{{sfn|McDermott|2006|p=1}}

Stalin strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=3}} Service suggested that without him the country might have collapsed long before 1991.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=3}} In under three decades, Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a major industrial world power,{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=546|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=3}} one which could "claim impressive achievements" in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education, and Soviet pride.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=602}} Under his rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition, and medical care;&lt;ref name = "upwards"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wheatcroft|first1=Stephen|date=1999 |title=The Great Leap Upwards: Anthropometric Data and Indicators of Crises and Secular Change in Soviet Welfare Levels, 1880–1960|url= |journal=[[Slavic Review]]|volume=58 |issue= 1|pages=27–60|doi=10.2307/2672986|access-date=22 September 2018|jstor=2672986}}&lt;/ref&gt; mortality rates declined.{{sfn|Ellman|2002|p=1164}} Although millions of Soviet citizens despised him, support for Stalin was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=602}}

Stalin's Soviet Union has been characterised as an [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=602|2a1=Khlevniuk|2y=2015|2p=190}} with Stalin its [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] leader.{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=732}} Various biographers have described him as a [[dictator]],{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=2003|1p=8|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=52|3a1=Montefiore|3y=2007|3p=9|4a1=Kotkin|4y=2014|4p=xii|5a1=Khlevniuk|5y=2015|5p=12}} an [[autocracy|autocrat]],{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=194|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2p=31|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=370}} or accused him of practicing [[Caesarism]].{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=77}} Montefiore argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party [[oligarchy]], in 1934 the Soviet government transformed from this oligarchy into a personal dictatorship,{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=124}} with Stalin only becoming "absolute dictator" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=215}} According to Kotkin, Stalin "built a personal dictatorship within the Bolshevik dictatorship".{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=4}} In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere he came to be portrayed as an "[[Despotism|Oriental despot]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=xvii|2a1=McDermott|2y=2006|2p=5}} The biographer [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] characterised him as "one of the most powerful figures in [[History of the world|human history]]",{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=xviii}} while McDermott stated that Stalin had "concentrated unprecedented political authority in his hands",{{sfn|McDermott|2006|p=2}} and Service noted that by the late 1930s, Stalin "had come closer to personal despotism than almost any monarch in history".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=370}} According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research shows that the motivation behind the purges was not Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an over-exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we’ve misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|publisher= |access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:May Day in London.jpg|thumb|left|A contingent from the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist)]] carrying a banner of Stalin at a May Day march through London in 2008.]]

McDermott nevertheless cautioned against "over-simplistic stereotypes"—promoted in the fiction of writers like [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Vasily Grossman]], and [[Anatoly Rybakov]]—that portrayed Stalin as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life through repression and totalitarianism.{{sfn|McDermott|2006|pp=5–6}} Service similarly warned of the portrayal of Stalin as an "unimpeded despot", noting that "powerful though he was, his powers were not limitless", and his rule depended on his willingness to conserve the Soviet structure he had inherited.{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=8, 9}} Kotkin observed that Stalin's ability to remain in power relied on him having a majority in the Politburo at all times.{{sfn|Kotkin|2014|p=596}} Khlevniuk noted that at various points, particularly when Stalin was old and frail, there were "periodic manifestations" in which the party oligarchy threatened his autocratic control.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=145}} Stalin denied to foreign visitors that he was a dictator, stating that those who labelled him such did not understand the Soviet governance structure.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=182}}

A vast literature devoted to Stalin has been produced.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=ix}} During Stalin's lifetime, his approved biographies were largely [[hagiographic]] in content.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=4}} Stalin ensured that these works gave very little attention to his early life, particularly because he did not wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=13}} Since his death many more biographies have been written,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=6}} although until the 1980s  these relied largely on the same sources of information.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=6}} Under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s Soviet administration various previously classified files on Stalin's life were made available to historians,{{sfn|Service|2004|p=6}} at which point Stalin became "one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda" in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=xiii}} After the dissolution of the Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about Stalin coming to light,{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=xxi}} and producing a flood of new research.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=ix}}

Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin's authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=5}} The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]], or a totally unique mode of production.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=265–266}} Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that Stalin's actions damaged "the enormous appeal of socialism generated by the October Revolution".{{sfn|Volkogonov|1991|p=173}}

===Death toll and allegations of genocide===
{{main|Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin}}

With a high number of excess deaths occurring under his rule, Stalin has been labeled "one of the most notorious figures in history".{{sfn|Service|2004|p=3}} These deaths occurred as a result of  collectivisation, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attribute to the regime.{{sfn|Ellman|2002|p=1163-1164}}

Official records reveal 799,455 documented executions in the Soviet Union between 1921 and 1953; 681,692 of these were carried out between 1937 and 1938, the years of the Great Purge.{{sfn|Getty|Rittersporn|Zemskov|1993|p=1022}} However, according to [[Michael Ellman]], the best modern estimate for the number of repression deaths during the Great Purge is 950,000–1.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention, or soon after their release.{{sfn|Ellman|2002|p=1162-1163}} In addition, while archival data shows that 1,053,829 perished in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953,{{sfn|Getty|Rittersporn|Zemskov|1993|p=1024}} the current historical consensus is that of the 18 million people who passed through the Gulag system from 1930 to 1953, between 1.5 and 1.7 million died as a result of their incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healey|first1=Dan|authorlink=Dan Healey|date=1 June 2018|title=GOLFO ALEXOPOULOS.

He notes that the estimate is far lower than the estimates of 20 million or above which were made before access to the archives.

This interpretation has been rejected by more recent historical studies.{{sfn|Tauger|2001|p=1}} These have articulated the view that—while Stalin's policies contributed significantly to the high mortality rate—there is no evidence that Stalin or the Soviet government consciously engineered the famine.{{sfnm|1a1=Davies|1a2=Wheatcroft|1y=2004|1pp=xiv, 441|2a1=Davies|2a2=Wheatcroft|2y=2006|2p=628}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Ghodsee| first1 = Kristen R.| volume = 4| issue = 2| page = 124| title = A Tale of "Two Totalitarianisms": The Crisis of Capitalism and the Historical Memory of Communism| journal = History of the Present| date = 2014| url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf| jstor = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115| doi = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115| author-link = Kristen R.

Michael Ellman argues that mass deaths from famines are not a "uniquely Stalinist evil", and compares the behavior of the Stalinist regime vis-à-vis the Holodomor to that of the British empire (towards Ireland and India) and even the [[G8]] in contemporary times, saying that he is sympathetic to the idea that the latter "are guilty of mass manslaughter or mass deaths from criminal negligence because of their not taking obvious measures to reduce mass deaths." He argues that a possible defense of Stalin and his associates is that "their behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."{{sfn|Ellman|2002|p=1172}}

===In the Soviet Union and its successor states===
[[File:Exponáty v Muzeu.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Joseph Stalin Museum, Gori|Joseph Stalin Museum]] in Gori, Georgia]]

Shortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of [[de-Stalinization]]. Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult,{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=314}} which was subsequently criticised in ''Pravda''.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=592}}  In 1956, Khruschev gave his "Secret Speech", titled "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]", to a closed session of the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party's 20th Congress]]. There, [[Khrushchev Thaw|Khrushchev denounced Stalin]] for both his mass repression and his personality cult.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=314|2a1=Volkogonov|2y=1991|2pp=577–579|3a1=Service|3y=2004|3p=594}} He repeated these denunciations at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Party Congress]] in October 1962.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=594}} In October 1961, Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] next to the [[Kremlin wall]]s, the location marked only by a simple bust.{{sfnm|1a1=Volkogonov|1y=1991|1p=576|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=594}} Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=595}}

Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation process in Soviet society ended when he was replaced as leader by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Conquest|1y=1991|1p=315|2a1=Service|2y=2004|2p=595}} In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of Stalin's legacy, but on both occasions were defeated by critics within the Soviet and international Marxist-Leninist movement.{{sfn|Conquest|1991|p=315}} Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=596}} After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first President of the new Russian Federation, [[Boris Yeltsin]], continued Gorbachev's denunciation of Stalin but added to it a denunciation of Lenin.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=596}} His successor, [[Vladimir Putin]], did not seek to rehabilitate Stalin but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under Stalin's leadership rather than the Stalinist repressions;{{sfn|Service|2004|pp=596–597}} however, in October 2017 Putin opened the [[Wall of Grief]] memorial in Moscow, noting that the "terrible past" would neither be "justified by anything" nor "erased from the national memory".&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite website |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41809659 |title=Wall of Grief: Putin opens first Soviet victims memorial |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605175715/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41809659 |archivedate=5 January 2018 |date=5 June 2018 |website=BBC News |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid the social and economic turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed Stalin as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=598}} He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II]],{{sfn|Service|2004|p=7}} and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right.{{sfn|Service|2004|p=599}} In the 2008 ''[[Name of Russia (Russia TV)|Name of Russia]]'' television show, Stalin was voted as the third most notable personality in Russian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Parfitt, Tom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/stalin-name-of-russia |title=Greatest Russian poll |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=29 December 2008 |accessdate=25 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905093339/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/29/stalin-name-of-russia |archive-date=5 September 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 poll revealed that Stalin's popularity reached a 16-year high among the Russian population, with 46% expressing a favourable view of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Taylor|first= Adam|date= 15 February 2017|title= Positive views of Stalin among Russians reach 16-year high, poll shows|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/15/positive-views-of-stalin-among-russians-reach-16-year-high-poll-shows/|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date= 30 April 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170320040114/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/15/positive-views-of-stalin-among-russians-reach-16-year-high-poll-shows/|archive-date= 20 March 2017|dead-url= no|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there was a growth in pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, much relying upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=x}} In this literature, Stalin's repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat "enemies of the people" or the result of lower-level officials acting without Stalin's knowledge.{{sfn|Khlevniuk|2015|p=x}} 

The only part of the former Soviet Union where admiration for Stalin has remained consistently widespread is [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{sfn|Service|2004|p=597}} Many Georgians resent criticism of Stalin, the most famous figure from their nation's modern history;{{sfn|Service|2004|p=7}} a 2013 survey by [[Tbilisi State University|Tbilisi University]] found 45% of Georgians expressing "a positive attitude" to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21656615 |title=Georgia divided over Stalin 'local hero' status in Gori |website=BBC News |date=5 March 2013 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719183921/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21656615 |archive-date=19 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some positive sentiment can also be found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.

'''Lacunar stroke''' or '''lacunar infarct''' ('''LACI''') is the most common type of ischaemic [[stroke]], and results from the [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of small penetrating [[artery|arteries]] that provide blood to the brain's deep structures. Patients who present with symptoms of a lacunar stroke, but who have not yet had diagnostic imaging performed, may be described as suffering from '''lacunar stroke syndrome''' ('''LACS''').

Much of the current knowledge of lacunar strokes comes from [[C. Miller Fisher]]'s [[cadaver]] dissections of post-mortem stroke patients. He observed "lacunae" (empty spaces) in the deep brain structures after occlusion of 200–800&amp;nbsp;μm penetrating arteries and connected them with five classic [[syndrome]]s. These syndromes are still noted today, though lacunar infarcts are diagnosed based on clinical judgment and [[radiology|radiologic]] imaging.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Each of the five classical lacunar syndromes has a relatively distinct symptom complex. Symptoms may occur suddenly, progressively, or in a fluctuating (e.g., the capsular warning syndrome) manner. Occasionally, cortical infarcts and [[intracranial hemorrhage]]s can mimic lacunar infarcts, but true cortical signs (aphasia, visuospatial neglect, gaze deviation, and visual field defects) are always absent in lacunar strokes. The classic syndromes are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name
! Location of infarct
! Presentation
|-
| '''Pure motor stroke/hemiparesis''' (most common lacunar syndrome: 33–50%)
| [[posterior limb]] of the [[internal capsule]], [[basilar part of pons]], corona radiata
| It is marked by [[hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] that typically affects the face, arm, or leg of the side of the body opposite the location of the infarct. [[Dysarthria]], [[dysphagia]], and transient sensory symptoms may also be present.
|-
| '''Ataxic hemiparesis''' (second most frequent lacunar syndrome)
| [[posterior limb]] of the [[internal capsule]], [[basilar part of pons]], and [[corona radiata]], red nucleus, lentiform nucleus, SCA infarcts, ACA infarcts
| It displays a combination of cerebellar and motor symptoms, including weakness and clumsiness, on the ipsilateral side of the body.&lt;ref name="EMedicine Lacunar Syndrome"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1163029|Lacunar Syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually affects the leg more than it does the arm; hence, it is known also as homolateral ataxia and crural paresis. The onset of symptoms is often over hours or days.
|-
| '''[[Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome|Dysarthria/clumsy hand]]''' (sometimes considered a variant of ataxic hemiparesis, but usually still is classified as a separate lacunar syndrome)
| [[basilar part of pons]], anterior limb or genu of internal capsule, corona radiata, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebral peduncle
| The main symptoms are dysarthria and clumsiness (i.e., weakness) of the hand, which often are most prominent when the patient is writing.
|-
| '''Pure sensory stroke''' 
| contralateral [[thalamus]] ([[Ventral posterolateral nucleus|VPL]]), internal capsule, corona radiata, midbrain
| Marked by numbness (loss of sensation) on one side of the body; can later develop tingling, pain, burning, or another unpleasant sensation on one side of the body.
|-
| '''Mixed sensorimotor stroke''' 
| [[thalamus]] and adjacent posterior [[internal capsule]], lateral pons
| This lacunar syndrome involves hemiparesis or hemiplegia (weakness) with sensory impairment on the same side
|}

==Silent lacunar infarction==
A '''silent lacunar infarction''' (SLI) is one type of [[silent stroke]] which usually shows no identifiable outward symptoms, and is thus termed "silent." Because stroke is a clinical diagnosis (that is, it is defined by clinical symptoms), there is debate about whether SLI are considered to be strokes, even though the pathophysiology is presumably the same.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Individuals who suffer a SLI are often completely unaware they have suffered a stroke. This type of stroke often causes lesions in the surrounding brain tissue that are visibly detected via neuroimaging techniques such as [[MRI]] and [[computerized axial tomography]] (CT scan). Silent strokes, including silent lacunar infarctions, have been shown to be much more common than previously thought, with an estimated prevalence rate of eleven million per year in the United States. Approximately 10% of these silent strokes are silent lacunar infarctions. While dubbed "silent" due to the immediate lack of classic stroke symptoms, SLIs can cause damage to the surrounding brain tissue ([[lesion]]s) and can affect various aspects of a persons mood, personality, and [[Cognitive functions|cognitive functioning]]. A SLI or any type of silent stroke places an individual at greater risk for future major stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.01.022 |pmid=17316693 |title=Neuropsychological abnormalities associated with lacunar infarction |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |volume=257 |issue=1–2 |pages=160–5 |year=2007 |last1=Grau-Olivares |first1=Marta |last2=Arboix |first2=Adrià |last3=Bartrés-Faz |first3=David |last4=Junqué |first4=Carme }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9740116 |url=http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=55&amp;page=1217 |year=1998 |author1=Longstreth Jr |first1=W.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Arteries beneath brain Gray closer.jpg|thumb|Small arteries beneath brain.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Lacunes are caused by occlusion of a single [[deep penetrating artery]] that arises directly from  the constituents of the [[Circle of Willis]], [[cerebellar arteries]], and [[basilar artery]]. The corresponding lesions occur in the deep nuclei of the brain (37% [[putamen]], 14% [[thalamus]], and 10% [[caudate nucleus|caudate]]) as well as the [[pons]] (16%) or the posterior limb of the [[internal capsule]] (10%). They occur less commonly in the deep cerebral white matter, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the [[cerebellum]].

The two proposed mechanisms are '''microatheroma''' and '''[[lipohyalinosis]]'''. At the beginning, [[lipohyalinosis]] was thought to be the main small vessel pathology, but [[microatheroma]] now is thought to be the most common mechanism of arterial [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] (or [[stenosis]]). Occasionally, [[atheroma]] in the parent artery blocks the [[Body orifice|orifice]] of the penetrating artery (luminal atheroma), or atheroma involves the origin of the penetrating artery (junctional atheroma). Alternatively, [[hypoperfusion]] is believed to be the mechanism when there is stenosis of the penetrating artery. When no evidence of small vessel disease is found on histologic examination, an embolic cause is assumed, either artery-to-artery [[embolism]] or cardioembolism. In one recent series, 25% of patients with clinical radiologically defined lacunes had a potential cardiac cause for their strokes.

Advanced age, chronic [[hypertension]], [[smoking]] and [[diabetes mellitus]] are risk factors. It is unclear whether there is an association with alcohol consumption, elevated cholesterol, or history of prior stroke. Lacunar strokes may result from [[carotid artery]] pathology or microemboli from the heart as in [[atrial fibrillation]]. Patients often recover well, but if there is enough white matter disease from lacunar pathology, one can see a subcortical dementia such as [[Binswanger disease]].

==Treatment and prognosis==
Typically, [[tissue plasminogen activator]] may be administered within three to four-and-a-half hours of stroke onset if the patient is without contraindications (i.e. a [[bleeding diathesis]] such as recent major surgery or cancer with brain metastases). High dose [[aspirin]] can be given within 48 hours. For long term prevention of recurrence, medical regimens are typically aimed towards correcting the underlying risk factors for lacunar infarcts such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking. Anticoagulants such as [[heparin]] and [[warfarin]] have shown no benefit over aspirin with regards to five year survival.&lt;ref name="EMedicine Lacunar Syndrome"/&gt;

Patients who suffer lacunar strokes have a greater chance of surviving beyond thirty days (96%) than those with other types of stroke (85%), and better survival beyond a year (87% versus 65-70%). Between 70% and 80% are functionally independent at 1 year, compared with fewer than 50% otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.STR.18.3.545 |pmid=3590244 |title=The natural history of lacunar infarction: The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project |journal=Stroke |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=545–51 |year=1987 |last1=Bamford |first1=J. |last2=Sandercock |first2=P. |last3=Jones |first3=L. |last4=Warlow |first4=C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.510933 |pmid=18436869 |title=Trends in Incidence, Risk Factors, and Survival in Symptomatic Lacunar Stroke in Dijon, France, from 1989 to 2006: A Population-Based Study |journal=Stroke |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=1945–51 |year=2008 |last1=Bejot |first1=Y. |last2=Catteau |first2=A. |last3=Caillier |first3=M. |last4=Rouaud |first4=O. |last5=Durier |first5=J. |last6=Marie |first6=C. |last7=Di Carlo |first7=A. |last8=Osseby |first8=G.-V. |last9=Moreau |first9=T. |last10=Giroud |first10=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Occupational therapy]] and [[physical therapy]] interventions are used in the rehabilitation of lacunar stroke. A physiotherapy program will improve joint [[range of motion]] of the [[Paresis|paretic limb]] using [[Range of motion|passive range of motion exercises]]. When increases in activity are tolerated, and stability improvements are made, patients will progress from rolling to side-lying, to standing (with progressions to [[Prone position|prone]], [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]], bridging, long-sitting and kneeling for example) and learn to transfer safely (from their bed to a chair or from a wheel chair to a car for example). Assistance and [[Walking|ambulation]] aids are used as required as the patient begins walking and lessened as function increases. Furthermore, [[Splint (medicine)|splints]] and [[Orthotics|braces]] can be used to support limbs and joints to prevent or treat complications such as [[contracture]]s and [[spasticity]].&lt;ref name="EMedicine Lacunar Stroke"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|322992|Lacunar Stroke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rehabilitation healthcare team should also educate the patient and their family on common stroke symptoms and how to manage an onset of stroke. Continuing follow-up with a physician is essential so that the physician may monitor medication dosage and risk factors.&lt;ref name="EMedicine Lacunar Stroke"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that lacunar infarcts account for 25% of all [[ischemic stroke]]s, with an annual incidence of approximately 15 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000210457.89798.0e |pmid=16682663 |title=A population-based study of the incidence and prognosis of lacunar stroke |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1335–8 |year=2006 |last1=Sacco |first1=S. |last2=Marini |first2=C. |last3=Totaro |first3=R. |last4=Russo |first4=T. |last5=Cerone |first5=D. |last6=Carolei |first6=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be more frequent in men and in people of African, Mexican, and Hong Kong Chinese descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clineuro.2008.03.013 |pmid=18456396 |title=A case-controlled study of cognitive progression in Chinese lacunar stroke patients |journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery |volume=110 |issue=7 |pages=649–56 |year=2008 |last1=Mok |first1=Vincent C. |last2=Wong |first2=Adrian |last3=Lam |first3=Wynnie W. |last4=Baum |first4=Lawrence W. |last5=Ng |first5=Ho Keung |last6=Wong |first6=Lawrence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Percy Belgrave Lucas''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|sep=,|CBE|DSO1|DFC}} (2 September 1915 – 20 March 1998), commonly known as '''Laddie Lucas''', was a [[Royal Air Force]] officer, left-handed golfer, author and [[Member of Parliament]] (MP).

==Early life and family==
Lucas was born on 2 September 1915 in the old clubhouse at Prince's [[Sandwich Bay, Kent]], the son of [[Percy Montagu Lucas]], co-founder of [[Prince's Golf Club, Sandwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princesgolfclub.co.uk/heritage-origins.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803000433/http://www.princesgolfclub.co.uk/heritage-origins.php |archivedate=3 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father died when he was aged 11. A company of Highlanders based nearby often inquired about "the wee laddie" when he was a baby, resulting in his nickname.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

Lucas was educated at [[Stowe School]], and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], where he read Economics. While at Cambridge, he captained the golf team, was the top amateur in the [[1935 Open Championship]] and was considered the finest left-handed player in the world at the age of 19.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Wing Cdr Laddie Lucas |author=Max Arthur |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=3 October 1988 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-wing-cdr-laddie-lucas-1154133.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Lucas married Jill Addison, the sister of Thelma Bader, wife of fellow flying ace [[Douglas Bader]], of whom he wrote a best-selling biography. The couple had five grandchildren.

==Early career==
After graduating from Cambridge, Lucas was interviewed by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] for a post on the ''[[Sunday Express]]''. He impressed Beaverbrook sufficiently that the publisher took him to supper that night and later hired him as a sports writer.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; He remained with the ''Sunday Express'' until the outbreak of war, when he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF).

==Royal Air Force==
Lucas joined the RAF in June 1940 and went to Canada to undertake flying training at the [[Flying Training School]] as part of the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]]. On completion of his training, he was assigned to [[No. 66 Squadron RAF|No. 66 Squadron]] in August 1941, based in [[Cornwall]], where he flew a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] on convoy patrols. He sought a transfer to Burma for more action but ended up at Malta instead, arriving there in February 1942. During the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Battle of Malta]], he commanded [[No. 249 Squadron RAF|No. 249 Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vernon|first1=Caroline|title=Our Name Wasn't Written|date=2011|publisher=Stringybark Publishing|location=Canberra, Australia|isbn=9780987092212|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1942, Lucas was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35638|date=17 July 1942 |page=3195|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The citation read:
{{quote|Acting Squadron Leader Percy Belgrave LUCAS (100626), Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, No. 249 Squadron&lt;br/&gt;
In July, 1942, Squadron Leader Lucas displayed great courage in an engagement against 3 bombers escorted by 14 fighters. He unhesitatingly led his squadron through the enemy's fighter escort and, diving down, they destroyed all 3 bombers, 2 of them falling in flames.  Squadron Leader Lucas has destroyed 3 hostile aircraft and damaged 7 others.}}

In the autumn of 1942, Lucas was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], but gave it up to his friend Michael Strutt, who was already acquainted with the duke. Two weeks later, on 25 August 1942, both were killed in an air crash when the [[Short Sunderland|Short Sunderland flying boat]] in which Strutt was also a passenger crashed into a hillside near [[Dunbeath]], Caithness, in bad weather. This tragedy troubled Lucas.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

In 1943, he took command of [[No. 616 Squadron RAF|No. 616 Squadron]]; later, he commanded the Spitfire wing at [[RAF Coltishall]]. After an imposed rest period on ground duties, "flying a desk", in December 1944 Lucas asked to be given charge of an operational squadron again. After re-training on the two-crew [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stormbirds.com/schwalbe/testimonies/lucas.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas took over command of [[No. 613 Squadron RAF|No. 613 Squadron (City of Manchester) Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wing Commander Laddie Lucas CBE DSO DFC (deceased)|url=http://www.military-art.com/mall/profiles.php?SigID=187|website=Military Print Company|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; equipped with Mosquitos and based at [[Cambrai-Épinoy]] in the [[Ardennes]]. He immediately resumed his practice of "leading from the front", which gained the respect of the highly experienced squadron air crews. The squadron was involved in low-level tactical support missions and strikes. Between 1944 and 1945, he served with [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force]] in North-West Europe.

Lucas was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) in January 1944.  The citation read:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36329|date=11 January 1944 |page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Acting Wing Commander Percy Belgrave LUCAS, DFC (100626), Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve&lt;br/&gt;
Within the past few months this officer has led his fighter squadron a large number of varied sorties including escorts to bomber formations which have attacked enemy shipping with much success. In all these operations, 13 enemy air-craft [sic] have been destroyed and several others damaged.  Much of the success can be attributed to this officer's great skill and gallant leadership.  He has rendered most valuable service.}}

He was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSO in October 1945 for making numerous attacks on enemy communications, often in appalling weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37291|date=28 September 1945 |page=4857|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his commission in 1945.

==Postwar career==
After the war, he was encouraged to fight the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and stood for [[Fulham West (UK Parliament constituency)|Fulham West]], where he lost to the sitting Member of Parliament (MP), [[Edith Summerskill]], one of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s most prominent [[women in government]] following their landslide. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]], he was elected as Conservative MP for [[Brentford and Chiswick (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentford and Chiswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Bcommons5.htm |title=The House of Commons Constituencies Beginning with "B": Brentford &amp; Chiswick (Middlesex)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He held the seat at the next two elections, but retired at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]].

He wrote a popular column for the ''Sunday Express'', and authored several books on golf and airmen around the world, as well as an idiosyncratic but much-admired history of the Second World War [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]].

Lucas played in the 1947 and 1949 Great Britain &amp; Ireland [[Walker Cup]] team, being the captain in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18650968.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he was an administrator on the [[Sports Council]].  Although an amateur, he was influential in the founding of the professional tour in Europe in the early 1970s.  At the time of his death, he was serving as a vice-president of both the [[Golf Foundation]] and the [[Association of Golf Writers]].

He was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1981.

In April 1984, [[Eamonn Andrews]] surprised Lucas for ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''.

Lucas died at home in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] on 20 March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=55127|date=14 May 1998 |page=5463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
There is a commemorative plaque at [[Prince's Golf Club, Sandwich]] by the 3rd tee on the Himalayas course which marks the spot where Lucas used his local knowledge of the course to make an emergency landing after his [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] was crippled over northern France during the war.  A golf tournament for boys and girls aged 8–13 years, the "Laddie Lucas Spoon", is held annually at Prince's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Laddie Lucas Spoon - Princes|url=http://www.golfsocietygb.com/juniors/princes-junior-masters|website=The Golf Society of Great Britain|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Martian Rose'' is an installation which carries the romantic and destructive idea of giving a rose to [[Mars]]. Using a planetary simulation chamber the exhibited rose has been exposed to Martian Environment for 6 hours. Mars is a cold place with plummeting temperatures from −60&amp;nbsp;°C down to −130&amp;nbsp;°C, the atmospheric pressure is only a hundredths of earth's, much lower than on [[Mount Everest]], the prevalent gas is carbon dioxide and UV light penetrates an unshielded atmosphere. The experiment took place on 27 March 2007 at the Mars Simulation Laboratory ([[University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]) where two (miniature) red roses were subjected to proxy Martian parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c-lab.co.uk/default.aspx?id=9&amp;projectid=53 |title=The Martian Rose |publisher=c-lab |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deaths from drugs.png|thumb|right|Notable deaths from acute drug use include [[Judy Garland]], [[Peaches Geldof]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Ike Turner]]|alt=Photomontage of nine celebrities. Refer to caption.]]

[[Drug overdose]] and [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] are significant causes of accidental death, and can also be used as a form of [[suicide]]. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from [[combined drug intoxication]] (CDI) due to [[poly drug use]]. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and [[Synergy#Biological sciences|drug synergy]]. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on [[opiate]]s is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coffin |first=Phillip O. |last2=Galea |first2=Sandro |date=May 22, 2003 |title=Opiates, cocaine and alcohol combinations in accidental drug overdose deaths in New York City, 1990–98 |journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=739–746}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/721771/mixed-drug-toxicity-vs-overdose-cory-monteiths-cause-of-death/ |title='Mixed drug toxicity' vs 'overdose': Cory Monteith's cause of death |last=Judd |first=Amy |date=July 16, 2013 |work=[[Global News Morning (Canadian TV series)|Global News Morning]] |access-date=March 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170330130851/http://globalnews.ca/news/721771/mixed-drug-toxicity-vs-overdose-cory-monteiths-cause-of-death/ |archivedate=March 30, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while [[marijuana]] does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal [[traffic collision]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Calabria |first=Bianca |date=2010 |title=Does cannabis use increase the risk of death?

Drug use and overdoses increased significantly in the 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while [[opium]] and [[coca]] had been used for centuries, their [[active ingredient]]s, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively.&lt;ref name=Court2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Courtwright|first1=David T.|title=Forces of habit drugs and the making of the modern world|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-674-02990-3|pages=36–37|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHqV3elHYvMC&amp;pg=PA36|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091541/https://books.google.com/books?id=GHqV3elHYvMC&amp;pg=PA36|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ueber das Erythroxylin, dargestellt aus den Blättern des in Südamerika cultivirten Strauches Erythroxylon Coca|author = Gaedcke, F.|journal = Archiv der Pharmazie|volume = 132|issue = 2|pages = 141–150|year = 1855|doi = 10.1002/ardp.18551320208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the [[Western world]], resulting in widespread misuse and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/drug-that-spans-the-ages-the-history-of-cocaine-6107930.html |title=Drug that spans the ages: The history of cocaine |date=March 2, 2006 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=May 25, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170525060701/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/drug-that-spans-the-ages-the-history-of-cocaine-6107930.html |archivedate=May 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/heroin-addictions-fraught-history/284001/ |title=Heroin Addiction's Fraught History |last=Jenkins |first=P.

This alphabetical list contains 599 notable people whose deaths can be reliably sourced to be the result of drug overdose or acute drug intoxication. Where sources indicate drug overdose or intoxication was only suspected to be the cause of death, this will be specified in the 'notes' column. Where sources are able to indicate, deaths are specified as 'suicide', 'accidental', 'undetermined', or otherwise in the 'cause' column. Where sources do not explicitly state intent, they will be listed in this column as 'unknown'. Deaths from accidents or misadventure caused by drug overdoses or intoxication are also included on this list. Deaths from long-term effects of drugs, such as tobacco-related cancers and [[cirrhosis]] from alcohol, are not included, nor are deaths from [[lethal injection]] or [[euthanasia]].

'''Mercury-Atlas 8''' ('''MA-8''') was the fifth [[United States]] [[manned space mission]], part of [[NASA]]'s [[Mercury program]]. Astronaut [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra Jr.]], orbited the Earth six times in the '''''Sigma 7''''' spacecraft on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly on technical evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. manned orbital flight yet achieved in the [[Space Race]], though well behind the several-day record set by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Vostok 3]] earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft's durability ahead of the one-day [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] mission that followed in 1963.

Planning began for the third U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight to build on the previous three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas booster]]. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's [[pressure suit]] were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery [[aircraft carrier|carrier]], and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.

The scientific results of the mission were mixed. The astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a [[microgravity|low-gravity environment]]. Observation of the Earth's surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted compared with that of earlier missions, as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than expected. This confirmed the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft and allowed NASA to plan with confidence for a day-long flight, [[Mercury-Atlas 9|MA-9]], which had been an early goal of the Mercury program.

==Background==
{{main|Project Mercury|Space Race}}

By 1962, both the United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a widespread perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been [[suborbital]] and had lasted only a few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, [[Vostok 2]], had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered [[SM-65D Atlas|Atlas booster]], the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce the gap between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA announced the first two orbital missions at the end of November 1961, shortly after the [[Mercury-Atlas 5]] (MA-5) test flight, which had [[Enos (chimpanzee)|carried a chimpanzee]] and twice orbited the Earth. [[Mercury-Atlas 6|MA-6]] was planned as the first orbital flight, with [[John Glenn]] as the primary crew and [[Scott Carpenter]] as his backup. The follow-up mission, [[Mercury-Atlas 7|MA-7]] was to be crewed by [[Deke Slayton]], with [[Wally Schirra]] as his backup.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1962, the first draft planning began for MA-8, the third orbital mission, with a goal of "six or seven" orbits, as an intermediate step towards a day-long 18-orbit flight.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to move to six orbits rather than seven was driven by the mission rules on contingency recovery operations; a seventh orbit would have required significant additional recovery forces to be able to reach the capsule anywhere on its trajectory within eighteen hours. The six-orbit profile had other effects on the recovery plans; the optimum recovery point was moved to the Pacific Ocean, rather than the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 1962, NASA announced that Slayton was medically unfit and would be replaced by [[Scott Carpenter]] as the prime crew for the MA-7 mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to replace him with Carpenter, rather than his official backup Schirra, was justified by the large amount of training Carpenter had managed while preparing for the long-delayed MA-6 mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the MA-6 and MA-7 missions, both of three orbits, pressure began to mount to fly an extended mission. On June 27, 1962, NASA first announced its plan for the upcoming MA-8 mission, which would last for "as many as six" orbits. Schirra was named as the prime crew for MA-8, with [[Gordon Cooper]] as his backup, repeating the backup-one fly-one pattern set by the previous two missions.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern would be repeated for [[Mercury-Atlas 9|MA-9]], flown by Cooper, and the planned but cancelled [[Mercury-Atlas 10|MA-10]], which would have been flown by Cooper's backup, [[Alan Shepard]].

The Soviet Union had not flown any further flights by the time MA-7 landed, putting both sides of the Space Race even at two orbital flights each. While the Soviets had flown for longer, the Mercury program was gaining momentum, with a six-orbit mission currently planned and press speculation about a one-day mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 459–460&lt;/ref&gt; However, in mid-August, the Soviet Union launched two orbital missions, [[Vostok 3]] and [[Vostok 4]], within a day of each other. The two craft were in intersecting orbits, but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous; they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively, just under four and three days, landing within a few minutes of each other on August 15. This was far ahead of anything currently planned for Mercury, and NASA quickly considered the prospect of modifying a capsule to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability, using technology being developed for the [[Gemini program]]. However, after examining the time and safety implications of this proposal, it was decided to abandon the idea and continue with the planned six-orbit mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 461–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission objectives===
[[File:Schirra and Kraft discussing MA-8 flight plan.jpg|thumb|left|221px|Schirra discussing the flight plan with flight director Chris Kraft.|alt=Two men seated at a desk, both reading from a large book the younger man is holding]]
The original MA-8 flight plan was issued on July 27; although it was revised slightly in August and September, it remained broadly unchanged until launch. This was an improvement on the situation with MA-7, which had had frequent and extensive alterations, making it difficult for the pilot to train efficiently. The aim was for the flight to be an engineering-oriented mission, focusing on the operation of the spacecraft rather than on scientific experimentation, to help pave the way for a future long-duration mission.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; Schirra chose the name ''Sigma 7'' for the capsule in reflection of this focus. using the mathematical symbol for [[summation]] as appropriate for an "engineering evaluation", and the "7" to refer to the [[Mercury Seven|seven Mercury astronauts]].&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 470–71&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission objectives involved evaluating the performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw and pitch]] manoeuvres to determine how easy it was to control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', pp. 42–5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury 8 in Hanger - GPN-2000-001441.jpg|thumb|right|''Sigma 7'' in its hangar|alt=Men in overalls clustered around the base of an upright conical spacecraft, which is two or three times taller than them, inside a large room]]
Four non-engineering scientific experiments were planned, two requiring the active involvement of the astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over [[Woomera, Australia]], and for a [[xenon arc lamp]] while passing over [[Durban, South Africa]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a [[Hasselblad#Hasselblad cameras in space|70mm Hasselblad camera]] as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken through a set of colored filters provided by the [[U. S. Weather Bureau]]. The latter were intended to help calibrate the [[spectral reflectivity]] of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future [[weather satellites]].&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental [[ablative heat shield|ablative materials]] attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft modifications===

The spacecraft and booster were almost identical to those used on the two preceding Mercury orbital flights. The spacecraft had heating blankets removed from the [[retrorocket]] motors, to save weight, and a [[SOFAR bomb]] was added. This would be ejected at the time the main parachute was deployed, and would help recovery crews find the spacecraft after it landed.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A number of modifications were made to the [[reaction control system]],&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the communications equipment was upgraded.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlas booster (Vehicle 113D) had been modified since the previous flight, and now included baffled [[fuel injectors]] and a new [[hypergolic]] fuel igniter instead of the original [[pyrotechnic]] igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. There were considerable delays getting the vehicle ready for flight. It was supposed to be shipped to Cape Canaveral in July, but after failing the factory composite test at Convair, the planned delivery of the Atlas was delayed a month.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission preparation==

The capsule built for the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been delivered to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] on January 16, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlas LV-3B]] booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; After the delayed arrival of the booster at the Cape, the Air Force then revealed that two recent static firings of MA-3 engines had suffered turbopump failures, and that the explosion of Atlas 11F one second after liftoff in April had been traced to a malfunction of the sustainer turbopump. All of these failures had occurred while the sustainer HS valve was moving to the open position and while running untested hardware modifications. The Air Force recommended that NASA conduct a static firing test of 113D just to be on the safe side. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. In the meantime, a fuel leak caused by a faulty weld in a piece of plumbing caused further delays. The static firing test was carried out on September 8&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, pp. 171–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns had been raised that the radiation belt produced in orbit by the recent [[Operation Dominic]] nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that it was safe to fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 [[röntgens]], the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 170. To put this in context, an unprotected dose of 500 röntgens over a few hours would be easily fatal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schirra began training for the mission in early July, logging 29&amp;nbsp;hours in simulators as well as 31&amp;nbsp;hours in the spacecraft itself. This included multiple systems tests and three simulated flights, culminating in a six-and-a-half-hour simulated flight on September 29, with the spacecraft and booster fully stacked on the pad.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the training period included a visit from President [[John F. Kennedy]] on September 11.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was reported as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1. The major concern with the weather was a major [[Hurricane Daisy (1962)|tropical storm in the Atlantic]], though there were also worries over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which could pose a problem for recovery operations. On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
Schirra was awakened at 1:40 am ET on the morning of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a [[bluefish]] he had [[spearfishing|speared]] the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 471–2&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the [[Canary Islands]] tracking station to repair a radar set.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system.&lt;ref name=ocean473&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's [[vernier thrusters]]. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three and a half minutes into the flight, [[Deke Slayton]], the [[capsule communicator]], cut in to ask Schirra "Are you a turtle today?" Schirra, unfazed, announced that he was switching to the on-board voice recorder (rather than the broadcast radio circuit) to leave his answer; the mission communications transcript noted this as "[correct answer recorded]".&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Ancient Order of Turtles|turtle club]]" was a recurrent joke among the astronaut corps; on being challenged with this question, the correct response was "you bet your sweet ass I am", with a failure to give the password being punishable by buying a round of drinks. Schirra noted later that he "wasn't ready for all the world to hear it", and chose to use the on-board recorder to avoid saying the answer over the air.&lt;ref&gt;''Schirra's Space'', pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Atlas was flying on a slightly lofted trajectory, the booster engines cut off 2&amp;nbsp;seconds earlier than planned, but the sustainer engine burned for about 10&amp;nbsp;seconds longer than intended, giving an extra {{convert|15|ft/s|m/s}} of velocity and putting the spacecraft in a slightly higher orbit than planned.&lt;ref name=ocean473/&gt; Initial analysis of the trajectory confirmed that the capsule could remain in a stable orbit for at least seven orbits, ensuring there would be no need for an early de-orbit.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orbital activities==
After separating from the Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, and was able to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves.&lt;ref name=ocean473/&gt; He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 474. Schirra noted after his flight that a rendezvous in orbit would certainly be possible, given sufficient fuel and precise positioning information; he would later go on to fly the [[Gemini 6A]] mission, the first successful close rendezvous of two spacecraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing over the eastern coast of Africa, he began to feel overheated; this problem was also apparent to the ground controllers, who were having a debate with the flight surgeon over whether it was safe to continue or if the mission should be ended after the first orbit. The flight director, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.|Christopher Kraft]], followed the surgeon's advice to see if the problem would settle, and gave the go for a second orbit.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; Schirra eventually stabilized the problem over time, slowly dialing the suit's control knob to a high cooling setting;&lt;ref name=ocean475&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; he compared the heat to that of "mowing a lawn in Texas".&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Australia, Schirra watched for a flare launched from the ground, but it was occluded by clouds; he was, however, able to see lightning and the lit outline of [[Brisbane]]. Through the night pass over the Pacific, he tested the capsule's on-board periscope, though he found it difficult to use and quickly covered it up as soon as the sun rose. Crossing over Mexico, he reported that he was in "chimp configuration", with the capsule running entirely on automatic without any input from the pilot, and as he began his second orbit began testing a [[yaw, pitch, and roll|yaw]] maneuver using the Earth through the main window as a reference, rather than via the much-maligned periscope.&lt;ref name=ocean475/&gt;

[[File:MA-8 view of cumulus clouds.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cumulus clouds]] photographed from orbit|alt=]]

On the second orbit, he confirmed the existence of Glenn's "fireflies", the shower of small bright particles first reported on [[Mercury-Atlas 6|MA-6]], and during the night section practiced yaw manoeuvres using first the Moon and then known stars as reference points. The second proved difficult to work with, as the small windows of the Mercury capsule gave a very limited field of view, making it hard to identify constellations. Travelling across the Pacific, he again fell back into automatic flight, chatting with [[Gus Grissom]] at the Hawaiian tracking station about the qualities of the manual control system.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 476–7&lt;/ref&gt;

As he began the third orbit, Schirra disconnected the spacecraft's [[gyroscopes]], turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by [[weightlessness]], and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fourth orbit, drifting in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the [[Echo 1]] satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to [[John Glenn]] in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States on radio and television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 479–80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MA-8 view over South America.jpg|thumb|right|View over South America on the sixth orbit|alt=The edge of Earth, heavily overexposed, in the lower half of the image, with black space above. In between them, a blue haze layer from the atmosphere. There is a lens flare in one corner.]]

By the fifth orbit, Schirra had begun to relax, commenting that it was the first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small [[bungee cord]] exercise device for "a little bit of stretching", before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near [[Durban]], in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of [[Port Elizabeth]]. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 480–1&lt;/ref&gt; Passing over [[Quito, Ecuador]], towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made some comments on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery "Buenos Dias, y'all!"&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Schirra later noted that he was "furious" at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.&lt;ref&gt;''Schirra's Space, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth orbit was dominated by preparations for re-entry, though Schirra was able to take a last set of photographs of South America and try another set of spatial-orientation tests. He armed the [[retrorocket]]s passing over the western Pacific, and fired the first one at 8:52 [[mission elapsed time]]. The automatic control system held the capsule "steady as a rock" during this period, though after the retrorockets had stopped firing Schirra noted that the system had burned almost a quarter of its fuel in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 481–82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reentry and recovery==

[[File:MA-8 landing under parachute.jpg|thumb|right|Parachute landing|alt=A conical black spacecraft falling towards the surface of the ocean under a single white parachute, seen from some distance away. Very little detail can be seen.]]

A small boat, with a group of men in it is just behind the spacecraft.]]

As the spacecraft continued towards [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] after the de-orbit burn, Schirra used the high-power thrusters to put the capsule in the correct orientation, noting that the attitude control felt "sloppy". He then enabled the rate stabilization control system, an automatic control method which used up fuel at a very high rate, to maintain control during re-entry; this was a specific engineering request, and it dismayed Schirra to see the fuel he had husbanded for six orbits be used so quickly.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 482&lt;/ref&gt;

The local recovery group in the prime target area, in the central Pacific, consisted of an aircraft carrier, {{USS|Kearsarge|CV-33|6}}, in the center of the landing area, with three destroyers strung out along the orbital path. Four search aircraft were also assigned to the area, and three recovery helicopters were based aboard ''Kearsarge''.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kearsarge'' picked up the capsule on radar while still {{convert|200|mi|km}} from landing; {{convert|90|mi|km}} further up the landing path, the destroyer {{USS|Renshaw|DD-499|6}} reported a sonic boom as it passed overhead. At {{convert|40000|ft|m}}, Schirra deployed the [[drogue parachute]], and then the [[main parachute]] at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}. The landing was surprisingly precise, {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} from the target point and {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} from ''Kearsarge'', and Schirra joked that he was on course for the recovery carrier's "number three elevator". The capsule hit the water, submerged, and bobbed to the surface again, righting itself after about 30&amp;nbsp;seconds. Three [[pararescue]] swimmers were dropped by one of the helicopters to help him climb out, but Schirra radioed that he would prefer to be towed to the carrier, and a [[whaleboat]] from ''Kearsarge'' was sent with a line.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 482–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty minutes after landing, ''Sigma 7'' was hoisted aboard ''Kearsarge''; five minutes later, Schirra blew the explosive hatch and climbed out to a waiting crowd.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot [[Gus Grissom]]'s hatch expulsion accident during the ''[[Liberty Bell 7]]'' mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; the fact that he had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.
Schirra remained aboard for three days of medical tests and debriefing before disembarking, while the spacecraft was offloaded at [[Midway Island]] and transferred to an aircraft for further transport.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to Cape Canaveral for analysis, with the long-term intention of putting it on permanent display.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The spent Atlas booster re-entered the atmosphere on October 4, the day after the launch, and burned up.&lt;ref&gt;p. 31, {{cite web|url=http://satlist.nl/RAE/RAE1962.doc|title=Royal Aeronautical Establishment satellite tables, 1962|year=2007|first=L.J.C.|last=Barhorst|accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-flight==
The post-flight analysis reported no major malfunctions—the only troublesome anomaly being the suit temperature controls— and all the engineering objectives of the mission were deemed successfully completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The fuel-conservation measures were found to have worked particularly well, with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed; despite the technical changes, the official report gave full credit for this to the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of weightlessness, and noted that Schirra had received no significant radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the radiation-sensitive plates confirmed that there had been a very low radioactive flux inside the spacecraft,&lt;ref&gt;Boynton, pp. 74–75. Further analysis was presented by Hermann J. Schaeffer in ''Proton dosimetry with nuclear emulsions on mercury missions MA-8 and MA-9'' at the twelfth Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and the six ablative materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Boynton, pp. 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientifically, the light-observation experiments were unsuccessful, as both target locations were covered by thick cloud cover. However, Schirra was able to view lightning near Woomera, and noted the lights of a city a few hundred miles from Durban.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;!-- Vague figure is as given in the source; it doesn't really seem appropriate to convert into km, since we'd still be saying "a few hundred" --&gt; The filtered photography for the Weather Bureau worked as planned, with 15&amp;nbsp;photographs taken; the conventional color photography was less successful, with several of the 14&amp;nbsp;photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Boynton, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, were perfectly clear. Postflight medical examination of Schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of [[orthostatic hypotension]] caused by sitting inside the cramped capsule for hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Schirra's post-flight report noted the "fireflies" seen on the previous two missions, and emphasized the remarkable visual effect of the thick band of the atmosphere visible around the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unimpressed with the view of Earth from space; the amount of detail he could make out compared well with that from high-flying aircraft, and he told debriefers that it was "nothing new" compared to flight at {{convert|50000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he concluded that ''Sigma 7'' was on "the top of the list" of aircraft he had flown, displacing the [[F8F Bearcat]], a naval piston-engined fighter,&lt;ref&gt;''Results of the third U.S. manned orbital space flight'', p. 55. The Bearcat was the first fighter Schirra had flown after training, and he remembered it as "not a plane you climb into; rather, you strap it on". (''Schirra's Space'', p. 24)&lt;/ref&gt; while the mission itself had been "textbook".&lt;ref&gt;''First US manned six-pass orbital mission'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Schirra gave a public lecture at [[Rice University]] after returning to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Schirra's Space'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets.&lt;ref name="This New Ocean, p. 486"&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. [[Robert Kennedy]], Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, the same way he had sounded out [[John Glenn]] a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA.&lt;ref&gt;''Schirra's Space'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 [[Gemini 6A]] mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first [[Apollo program|Apollo]] mission, [[Apollo 7]], in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/schirra.htm|title=Walter M. Schirra Jr. |last=Gray|first=Tara|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2010-02-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103040415/https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/schirra.htm|archivedate=2004-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of MA-8 made the preparation for MA-9 "considerably easier",&lt;ref name="This New Ocean, p. 486"/&gt; though it did cause some observers to suggest the program should be ended abruptly in order to conclude on a clear note of success, rather than risking another—potentially catastrophic—flight.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 486–7&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not a view shared by the NASA planners, who had been pressing for a one-day Mercury mission since mid-1961, when it first began to seem technically feasible.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare the spacecraft for a long-duration mission involved trimming as much on-board weight as possible to offset the additional consumables required. The changes made to the capsule hardware on MA-8 were now used to justify the removal of {{convert|12|lb|kg}} of control equipment and {{convert|5|lb|kg}} of radio equipment, as well as the {{convert|76|lb|kg}} periscope which Schirra had found so unhelpful. In total, there were 183 alterations listed between the capsules for the MA-8 and MA-9 missions.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was to be equipped with several cameras, building on Schirra's photographic work, though weight and power limitations did restrict the amount of scientific experiments that could be scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', pp. 491–492&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships''' ('''NextSTEP''') is a [[NASA]] program using a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar space—the space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon.&lt;ref name="NASA_NextSTEP_page"&gt;{{cite web |title=Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) |url=https://www.nasa.gov/nextstep |website=NextSTEP |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program overview ==
NextSTEP is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar space—the space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon.&lt;ref name="NASA_NextSTEP_page"/&gt;

NASA issued the original NextSTEP Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to U.S. industry in late 2014, and issued the second NextSTEP BAA in April 2016.&lt;ref name="NASA_NextSTEP_page"/&gt;

An important part of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the commercial space industry to help the agency achieve its strategic goals and objectives for expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunities in space. A key component of the NextSTEP partnership model is that it provides an opportunity for NASA and industry to partner to develop capabilities that meet NASA human space exploration objectives while also supporting industry commercialization plans.&lt;ref name="NASA_NextSTEP_page"/&gt;

NASA hopes to incorporate modules and parts developed in the NextSTEP project into the follow on [[Deep Space Gateway]] and [[Deep Space Transport]] projects.&lt;ref name="Gateway_20170328"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kathryn Hambleton |title=Deep Space Gateway to Open Opportunities for Distant Destinations |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/deep-space-gateway-to-open-opportunities-for-distant-destinations |website=www.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=March 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phases ==

=== NextSTEP (first selection) ===
In April 2015 the first NextSTEP selection by NASA selected 12 Partnerships to advance concept studies and technology development projects in the areas of advanced propulsion, habitation and small satellites.&lt;ref name="Space20150402"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mike Wall |title=NASA Funds 12 Deep-Space Exploration Technologies |url=http://www.space.com/28999-nasa-deep-space-tech-grants.html |accessdate=August 14, 2016 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Announces New Partnerships with U.S. Industry for Key Deep-Space Capabilities |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-announces-new-partnerships-with-us-industry-for-key-deep-space-capabilities |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected advanced electric propulsion projects developed propulsion technology systems in the 50- to 300-kilowatt range to meet the needs of a variety of deep space mission concepts. The three NextSTEP advanced propulsion projects, $400,000 to $3.5 million per year per award, were limited to a three-year performance period focused on ground testing efforts. The selected companies were:&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;
* [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]] of [[Webster, Texas]]
* [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] of [[Redmond, Washington]]
* MSNW of [[Redmond, Washington]]&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;

These selections were intended to augment the Orion capsule with the development of capabilities to initially sustain a crew of four for up to 60 days in cis-lunar space with the ability to scale up to transit habitation capabilities for future Mars missions. The selected projects addressed concepts and, in some cases, provide advancement in technologies related to habitation and operations, or environmental control and life support capabilities of a habitation system. The seven NextSTEP habitat projects had initial performance periods of up to 12 months, at a value of $400,000 to $1 million for the study and development efforts, with the potential for follow-on phases to be defined during the initial phase. The selected companies were:&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;
* [[Bigelow Aerospace]] LLC of North Las Vegas, Nevada
* [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] of Pasadena, Texas
* [[Dynetics]] Inc. of Huntsville, Alabama
* [[Hamilton Sundstrand |Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International]] of Windsor Locks, Connecticut
* [[Lockheed Martin |Lockheed Martin Space Systems]] Company of Denver, Colorado
* [[Orbital ATK]] of Dulles, Virginia
* Orbital Technologies Corporation of Madison, Wisconsin&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;

The [[CubeSat]] projects selected in the award were expected to fly as secondary payload missions on the first flight of the [[Space Launch System]], Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1). CubeSat selections addressed NASA's strategic knowledge gaps reducing risk, increasing effectiveness, and improving the design of robotic and human space exploration.&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;

The two NextSTEP CubeSat projects had fixed-price contracts with technical and payment milestones and total values for the entire development and operations of $1.4 to $7.9 million per award. The selected companies were:&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;
* [[Lockheed Martin |Lockheed Martin Space Systems]] Company of Denver, Colorado
* [[Morehead State University]] of Morehead, Kentucky&lt;ref name="Space20150402"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;

NextSTEP activities were executed through fixed-price contracts with milestone payments, combined with corporate-resource contributions. The selected partner provided overall study and technology development efforts, benefiting NASA and future commercial endeavors.&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 15-054"/&gt;

=== NextSTEP-2 ===
[[File:Concept image of the interior of a deep space habitat.png|thumb|The galley in a space station]]
Starting in September 2016 six companies were given approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes or conduct concept studies for a [[Deep Space Habitat]]. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as humans move beyond Earth, especially in the context of the [[Exploration of Mars#NASA|Journey to Mars]]. 
The selected companies were:&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 16-084"/&gt;
* [[Bigelow Aerospace]] of Las Vegas
* [[Boeing]] of Pasadena, Texas
* [[Lockheed Martin]] of Denver
* [[Orbital ATK]] of Dulles, Virginia
* [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado
* [[NanoRacks]] of Webster, Texas&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 16-084"/&gt;

In August 2016 NASA estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, would be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Partners were required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort.&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 16-084"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Selects Six Companies to Develop Prototypes, Concepts for Deep Space Habitats |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-six-companies-to-develop-prototypes-concepts-for-deep-space-habitats |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 NASA issued several sets of announcements, contracts and Space Act Agreements (SAA).&lt;ref name="NASA_ISRU_20171207"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA_Fablab_award"/&gt;

In the first NASA issued a broad agency announcement (BAA) requesting "proposals for trade studies and design, fabrication, and testing of critical components and subsystems for acquisition and processing of extraterrestrial resources into water, oxygen, and fuel."&lt;ref name="NASA_ISRU_20171207"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doug Messier |title=NASA Seeks Industry Partnerships on In-situ Resource |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2017/12/07/partnerships/#more-63253 |accessdate=December 7, 2017 |work=Parabolic Arc |date=December 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA expects to issue multiple fixed price contracts for small amounts in phased approaches for up to 5 years. Cost sharing and/or investment matching will be required.&lt;ref name="FBO_Appendix_D_2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Solicitation Number: NNH16ZCQ001K-ISRU |title=NextSTEP-2 BAA Appendix D: In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Technology |url=https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=34eb0ba219ff3a8d97c9c4b2c9302bf1&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1 |website=Federal Business Opportunities |publisher=NASA |accessdate=December 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second a total of $10.2 million was awarded over 18 months for development of prototype equipment for use in its FabLab. The machines will perform space based on-demand fabrication.  The proposals for development of a first-generation, in-space, multi-material fabrication laboratory (FabLab) for space missions were solicited in May 2017 under Appendix B of the NextSTEP-2 Broad Agency Announcement.&lt;ref name="Fablab_Concepts"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Erin Mahoney |title=NASA Seeks 'FabLab' Concepts for In-Space Manufacturing |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-seeks-fablab-concepts-for-in-space-manufacturing |website=nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=December 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 3 award winners were:&lt;ref name="NASA_Fablab_award"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cheryl Warner |title=NASA Selects Three Companies to Develop 'FabLab' Prototypes |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-three-companies-to-develop-fablab-prototypes |website=nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=December 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interlog]] Corporation of Anaheim, California
* [[Techshot]] Inc. of Greeneville, Indiana
* [[Tethers Unlimited]] Inc. of Bothell&lt;ref name="NASA_Fablab_award"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SCN_plants"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doug Messier |title=Sierra Nevada Contract Continued on Advanced Plant Growth for NASA |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2018/02/02/sierra-nevada-contract-continued-advanced-plant-growth-nasa/#more-63847 |accessdate=February 3, 2018 |work=Parabolic Arc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) was granted a contract modification permitting the development of advanced bio-based life support and food production systems at SNC's Madison, Wisconsin offices. The aim is to produce plant-based modules that can recycle drinking water from waste water streams, regenerate oxygen from carbon dioxide, produce fresh food for astronauts, and support radiation protection of the crew while on deep exploration missions, such as missions to Mars.

=== Deep Space Transport ===
This project is to develop a manned Solar Electric Propulsion vehicle able to fly to Mars orbit. It is a follow on project using some of the hardware, software and systems developed by NextSTEP. It is currently in the initial planning stage.&lt;ref name="NASA_March_2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gateway_20170328"/&gt;

== Progress ==
As of August 2016, the first phase of NextSTEP had been completed and negotiations with the companies for NextSTEP-2 agreements were started.&lt;ref name="NASA_PR 16-084"/&gt; As of March 2017 the proposed development of the Deep Space Transport vehicle has been announced.

In August 2017 the [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]] reported completing its Year 2 milestones for the [[VASIMR]] electric plasma rocket engine. NASA gave approval for Ad Astra to proceed with Year 3 after reviewing completion of a 10-hour cumulative test of the 200SS™ rocket at 100&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name="Ad_Astra_20170809"&gt;{{cite web |title=PRESS RELEASE Ad Astra Rocket Company successfully completes all NASA NextStep Contract Milestones for year two, receives NASA approval to proceed with year three, 08/09/17 |url=http://adastrarocket.com/pressReleases/AdAstraRelease080917-final.pdf |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Andreas Thiel''' ({{IPAc-en|t|iː|l}}; born October 11, 1967) is an American&lt;!-- Per MOS:BLPLEAD, "previous nationalities or the country of birth should not be mentioned in the lead unless they are relevant to the subject's notability." --&gt; entrepreneur, venture capitalist, philanthropist, political activist, and author. He is a co-founder of [[PayPal]], [[Palantir Technologies]] and [[Founders Fund]]. He was ranked No. 4 on the [[Midas List|''Forbes'' Midas List]] of 2014, with a net worth of $2.2 billion, and No. 315 on the [[Forbes 400|''Forbes'' 400]] in 2017, with a net worth of $2.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Midas List 2014: The Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emii45hfff/peter-thiel-2/|author=Staff writer(s)|website=Forbes|date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Thiel profile|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/peter-thiel/?list=forbes-400|website=Forbes|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel was born in [[Frankfurt]], and holds German citizenship. He moved with his family to the United States as an infant, and spent a portion of his upbringing in Africa before returning to the United States. He studied philosophy at [[Stanford University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1989. He then went on to the [[Stanford Law School]], and received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1992. After graduation, he worked as a [[judicial clerk]] for Judge [[James Larry Edmondson]], a [[security (finance)|securities]] lawyer for [[Sullivan &amp; Cromwell]], a speechwriter for former-[[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]] and as a [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] trader at [[Credit Suisse]] prior to founding Thiel Capital in 1996. He co-founded [[PayPal]] in 1999, serving as [[chief executive officer]] until its sale to [[eBay]] in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

After the sale of PayPal, he founded [[Clarium Capital]], a [[global macro]] [[hedge fund]]. He launched [[Palantir Technologies]], a [[big data]] analysis company, in 2004 and continues to serve as its chairman as of 2018. His [[Founders Fund]], a [[venture capital]] firm, was launched in 2005 along with PayPal partners [[Ken Howery]] and [[Luke Nosek]]. Earlier, Thiel became [[Facebook]]'s first outside investor when he acquired a 10.2% stake for $500,000 in August 2004. He sold the majority of his shares in Facebook for over $1 billion in 2012, but remains on the board of directors. He also co-founded [[Valar Ventures]] in 2010 and operates as its chairman, co-founded Mithril Capital, of which he is investment committee chair, in 2012, and served as a partner at [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] from 2015 to 2017.&lt;ref name=PayPalMafia&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11106473/The-PayPal-Mafia-Who-are-they-and-where-are-Silicon-Valleys-richest-group-of-men-now.html|title = The PayPal Mafia: Who are they and where are Silicon Valley's richest group of men now?|publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate = 2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8537d776-664f-11e3-aa10-00144feabdc0|title=Lunch with the FT: Peter Thiel|first=Richard|last=Waters|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c2dcf2be-a850-11e6-8898-79a99e2a4de6|title=Tech elite discovers it may need Peter Thiel|first=Leslie|last=Hook|website=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Thiel Foundation]], Thiel governs the grant-making bodies [[Breakout Labs]] and [[Thiel Fellowship]], and funds nonprofit research into [[artificial intelligence]], [[life extension]] and [[seasteading]]. A co-founder of ''[[The Stanford Review]]'', he is a [[Libertarian conservatism|conservative libertarian]] who is critical of high government spending, high debt levels, and foreign wars. He has donated to numerous political figures. In 2016, Thiel revealed that he had funded [[Hulk Hogan]] in the ''[[Bollea v. Gawker]]'' lawsuit, which ultimately led to the bankruptcy of [[Gawker]].

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Peter Andreas Thiel was born in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], [[West Germany]] on October 11, 1967 to Susanne and Klaus  Friedrich Thiel.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dea, Meghan. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=246 "Peter Thiel."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/Peter-Thiel-release-1-February-2017/$file/Peter-Thiel-release-1-February-2017.pdf|title=Peter Thiel's application for New Zealand citizenship|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs|page=65|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family migrated to the [[United States]] when Peter was age one and lived in [[Cleveland]], where Klaus worked as a [[chemical engineer]]. Klaus then worked for various mining companies, which caused an itinerant upbringing for Thiel and his younger brother, Patrick Michael Thiel.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-03/peter-thiel-21st-century-free-radical|first=Romesh|last=Ratnesar|title=Peter Thiel: 21st Century Free Radical|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=February 3, 2011|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thiel|first1=Peter|title=Peter Thiel, technology entrepreneur and investor.

Before settling in [[Foster City, California]] in 1977, the Thiels had lived in [[South Africa]] and [[South West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]), and Peter had to change elementary schools seven times. One of Peter's elementary schools, a strict establishment in [[Swakopmund]], required students to wear uniforms and utilized [[corporal punishment]], such as striking students' hands with a ruler for mistakes. This experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in Thiel's support for [[individualism]] and [[libertarianism]] as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Packer|2013|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704696304575537882643165738|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|title=Technology=Salvation|last=Jenkins, Jr.|first=Holman W.|date=October 9, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel played ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', was an avid reader of [[science fiction]], with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]] among his favorite authors, and a fan of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s works, stating as an adult that he had read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' over ten times during his childhood.&lt;ref name=Brown2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Mick|title=Peter Thiel: the billionaire tech entrepreneur on a mission to cheat death|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/11098971/Peter-Thiel-the-billionaire-tech-entrepreneur-on-a-mission-to-cheat-death.html|accessdate=October 16, 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since founded 6 firms ([[Palantir Technologies]], [[Valar Ventures]], Mithril Capital, Lembas LLC, Rivendell LLC and Arda Capital) whose names originate from Tolkien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38315682|title=Who is Peter Thiel and why is he advising Donald Trump?|agency=BBC News|date=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Thiel excelled in [[mathematics]], and scored first in a California-wide mathematics competition while attending middle school in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]].&lt;ref name=contrarian/&gt; At the [[San Mateo High School]], he read [[Ayn Rand]], admired the [[optimism]] and [[anti-communism]] of then-President [[Ronald Reagan]], and was [[valedictorian]] of his graduating class in 1985.&lt;ref name=contrarian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7news.com/technology/only-on-abc7-billionaire-weighs-in-on-silicon-valleys-future/320291/|first=Ama|last=Daetz|title=Billionaire weighs in on Silicon Valley's future|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=September 22, 2014|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from San Mateo High School, Thiel went on to study [[philosophy]] at [[Stanford University]]. During Thiel's time at Stanford, debates on [[identity politics]] and [[political correctness]] were ongoing at the university. A "[[Western Culture]]" program, which was criticized by ''[[The Rainbow Agenda]]'' because of a perceived over-representation of the achievements made by European men, was replaced with a "Culture, Ideas and Values" course, which instead pushed diversity and [[multiculturalism]]. This replacement provoked controversy on the campus, and led to Thiel founding ''[[The Stanford Review]]'', a paper for [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] viewpoints, in 1987, through the funding of [[Irving Kristol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Packer|2013|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel served as ''The Stanford Review's'' first [[editor-in-chief]] and remained in that post until he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1989, at which point his friend [[David O. Sacks]] became the new editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mohammad|last=Bahareth|title=Kings of the Internet: What You Don't Know About Them?|publisher=iUniverse|date=2012|isbn=978-1469798424|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiel then continued on to the [[Stanford Law School]] and acquired his [[Juris Doctor|Doctor of Jurisprudence]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Paypal,-Inc-Jan-2002-S-1/A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2504/91205702003491/filing-main.htm |title=Paypal, Inc, Form S-1/A, Filing Date Jan 31, 2002 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Stanford, Thiel met [[René Girard]], whose [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|mimetic theory]] influenced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-on-rene-girards-influence-2014-11|first=Richard|last=Feloni|title=Peter Thiel explains how an esoteric philosophy book shaped his worldview|website=[[Business Insider]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon [[mimesis]], and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: "The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we get better at the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or [[Transcendentalism|transcendent]], or truly meaningful in our world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-advice-to-younger-self-2015-2|first=Drake|last=Baer|title=Here's the advice billionaire investor Peter Thiel wishes he could've given his younger self|website=[[Business Insider]]|date=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536|first=Peter|last=Thiel|title=Competition Is for Losers|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduating Stanford Law School, Thiel clerked for Judge [[James Larry Edmondson]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/15/trump-thiel-supreme-court/|title=Rumor About Trump's Supreme Court Pick Causes a Stir But Appears Untrue|first=Jeff John|last=Roberts|website=Fortune|date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his clerkship with Judge Edmondson, Thiel worked as a [[Security (finance)|securities]] lawyer for [[Sullivan &amp; Cromwell]] in New York. After seven months and three days, he left the law firm citing a lack of transcendental value in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stanfordlawyer.law.stanford.edu/2011/05/q-a-legal-matters-with-peter-thiel-%E2%80%9992-ba-%E2%80%9989-bs-%E2%80%9989-and-mark-a-lemley-ba-%E2%80%9988/|title=Articles Archive - Stanford Law School|author=Stanford Law School|publisher=|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took a job as a [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] trader in currency options at [[Credit Suisse]], working there from 1993 on while also operating as a speechwriter for former-[[United States Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]], before again feeling as though his work lacked meaningful value and returning to California in 1996.&lt;ref name="BW01"&gt;Hibbard, Justin, [https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2004-11-07/big-bucks-from-bubble-fears "Big Bucks From Bubble Fears"], ''Business Week'', November 8, 2004. Retrieved 2015-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], Thiel noticed that the development of the [[internet]] and [[personal computer]] had already altered the economic landscape and the [[dot-com boom]] was well underway. With financial support from friends and family, he was able to raise $1 million toward the establishment of Thiel Capital Management and embark on his venture capital career. Early on, he experienced a setback after investing $100,000 in his friend [[Luke Nosek]]'s unsuccessful web-based calendar project. However, his luck changed when [[Max Levchin]], a friend of Nosek's, introduced him to his [[cryptography]]-related company idea, which later became their first venture called [[Confinity]] in 1998.

===PayPal===
{{further|PayPal#Early history}}
With Confinity, Thiel realized they could develop software to solve a gap in making online payments. Although the use of [[credit card]]s and expanding [[Cash machine|automated teller machine]] networks provided consumers with more available payment options, not all merchants could gain the necessary hardware to accept credit cards. Thus, consumers were often left with little choice and instead had to pay with exact cash or personal checks. Thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet in the hopes of ensuring more consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices, and in 1999 Confinity launched [[PayPal]].

PayPal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money, and according to [[Eric M. Jackson]]'s account in his book ''[[The PayPal Wars]]'', Thiel viewed PayPal's mission as liberating people throughout the world from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to [[inflation]]. Jackson recalls an inspirational speech by Thiel in 1999:

{{quote|We're definitely onto something big. The need PayPal answers is monumental. Everyone in the world needs money – to get paid, to trade, to live. Paper money is an ancient technology and an inconvenient means of payment. You can run out of it. It wears out. It can get lost or stolen. In the twenty-first century, people need a form of money that's more convenient and secure, something that can be accessed from anywhere with a PDA or an Internet connection. Of course, what we're calling 'convenient' for American users will be revolutionary for the developing world. Many of these countries' governments play fast and loose with their currencies. They use inflation and sometimes wholesale currency devaluations, like we saw in Russia and several Southeast Asian countries last year [referring to the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 Russian]] and [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]], to take wealth away from their citizens. Most of the ordinary people there never have an opportunity to open an offshore account or to get their hands on more than a few bills of a stable currency like U.S. dollars. Eventually PayPal will be able to change this. In the future, when we make our service available outside the U.S. and as Internet penetration continues to expand to all economic tiers of people, PayPal will give citizens worldwide more direct control over their currencies than they ever had before. It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means because if they try the people will switch to dollars or Pounds or Yen, in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric M.|last=Jackson|title=[[The PayPal Wars]]|date=2004|page=Kindle Locations 321–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When PayPal launched at a successful press conference in 1999, representatives from [[Nokia]] and [[Deutsche Bank]] sent $3 million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their [[PalmPilot]]s. PayPal then continued to grow through mergers with [[Elon Musk]]'s financial services company, X.com, and with [[Pixo]], a company specializing in mobile commerce, in 2000. These mergers allowed PayPal to expand into the wireless phone market, and transformed it into a safer and more user-friendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information.

PayPal [[Initial public offering|went public]] on February 15, 2002 and was sold to [[eBay]] for $1.5 billion in October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBay picks up PayPal for $1.5 billion by Margaret Kane&amp;#124;CNET News.com|accessdate=2008-01-24|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1017-941964.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZJ3x0dGI?url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1017-941964.html?hhTest=1|archivedate=July 14, 2008|quote=On Monday, eBay said it is acquiring online payments company PayPal in a deal valued at $1.5 billion.|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiel remained CEO of the company until the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-who-is-peter-thiel-20180215-story.html|title=Peter Thiel's resume includes PayPal, Facebook and supporting Trump.

===Clarium Capital===
{{further|Clarium Capital}}
Following PayPal's sale to eBay in 2002, Thiel devoted $10 million of his proceeds to establish [[Clarium Capital Management]], a [[global macro]] [[hedge fund]] focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies, interest rates, commodities, and equities. Thiel stated that "the big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium—the [[Idée fixe (psychology)|idée fixe]]—was the [[Hubbert peak theory|peak-oil theory]], which was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2014/09/04/peter-thiels-contrarian-strategy/|title=Peter Thiel disagrees with you|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Clarium Capital reflected a return of 65.6% as Thiel successfully bet that the [[United States dollar]] would weaken.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-facebook-trump-biography-2018-2#when-paypal-was-sold-in-2002-thiels-stake-was-worth-about-55-million-which-he-used-to-launch-a-hedge-fund-clarium-capital-by-the-time-he-was-37-clarium-was-managing-270-million-8|title=The life and rise of billionaire investor Peter Thiel, Trump’s biggest Silicon Valley supporter — who might be moving to Los Angeles|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Thiel spoke of the [[dot-com bubble]] having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector, and specified [[General Electric]] and [[Walmart]] as vulnerable. In 2005, Clarium saw a 57.1% return&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113961793285971352|title=A Second Payday for PayPal Founder|last=Savitz|first=Eric J.|date=2006-02-13|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Thiel predicted that the dollar would rally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This success saw Clarium honored as global macro hedge fund of the year by ''[[MARHedge]]'' and ''[[Absolute Return + Alpha]].''{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

However, Clarium faltered in 2006 with a 7.8% loss. During this time, the firm sought to profit in the long-term from its petrodollar analysis, which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies and the unsustainable bubble growing in the U.S. housing market. Clarium's [[assets under management]] indeed, after achieving a 40.3% return in 2007, grew to over $7 billion by 2008, but plummeted as financial markets collapsed near the start of 2009. By 2011, after missing out on the economic rebound, many key investors pulled out, causing Clarium's assets to be valued at $350 million, over half of which was Thiel's own money.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web|title=No Death, No Taxes: The libertarian futurism of a Silicon Valley billionaire.|accessdate=2011-12-07|first=George|last=Packer|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/28/111128fa_fact_packer?currentpage=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palantir===
{{further|Palantir Technologies}}
In May 2003, Thiel incorporated Palantir Technologies, a [[big data]] [[data analysis|analysis]] company named after the [[Palantír|Tolkien artifact]], and continues to serve as its chairman as of 2018. Thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that "the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism." He also stated that, after the [[September 11 attacks]], the debate in the United States was "will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy?" and saw Palantir as being able to provide [[data mining]] services to government intelligence agencies which were maximally unintrusive and traceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/palantir-the-vanguard-of-cyberterror-security-11222011.html |title=Palantir, the War on Terror's Secret Weapon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/2/|title=How A 'Deviant' Philosopher Built Palantir, A CIA-Funded Data-Mining Juggernaut|author=Andy Greenberg|work=Forbes|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Palantir's only backers were the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[venture capital]] arm [[In-Q-Tel]], but the company steadily grew and in 2015 was valued at $20 billion, with Thiel being the company's largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/12/11/palantir-aiming-to-raise-400-million-in-new-round/#17d326062a06|first=Ryan|last=Mac|title=Palantir Aiming To Raise $400 Million In New Round|website=Forbes|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/23/palantir-has-raised-880-million-at-a-20-billion-valuation/|title=Palantir Has Raised $880 Million At A $20 Billion Valuation|first=Sarah|last=Buhr|website=[[TechCrunch]]|date=December 23, 2015|accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook===
{{further|Facebook#Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change}}
In August 2004, Thiel made a $500,000 [[Angel investor|angel investment]] in [[Facebook]] for a 10.2% stake in the company and joined Facebook's board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook, and put the valuation of the company at $4.9 million.&lt;ref name="G01"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/25/facebook-value-flotation "Shareholder trading values Facebook at more than $33bn" The Guardian – August 25, 2010:] This reference does not confirm Thiel's percentage stake, implied to be 5.2% i.e. 33 divided by 1.7. The 5.2% is also independently asserted in the Facebook section of this Wikipedia article, but without citation. The imputed valuation of Facebook has, also, moved up to $50bn in an early-2011 transaction with [[Goldman Sachs]] (Craig, Susanne and [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]], [https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/goldman-invests-in-facebook-at-50-billion-valuation/ "Goldman Offering Clients a Chance to Invest in Facebook"], ''The New York Times'' Dealbook, January 2, 2011.) A 5.2% share of $50 billion would be worth $2.58 billion. For its part, by March 2010, Forbes had actually reduced its estimate of Thiel's net worth to $1.2 billion ([https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Peter-Thiel_J5T8.html #828 on list of world's billionaires]), though the higher Facebook valuation makes this even more undervalued. Footnote expanded 2011-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life After Facebook |first=Brian |last=Caulfield |first2=Nicole |last2=Perlroth |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0214/features-peter-thiel-social-media-life-after-facebook_3.html |work=[[Forbes]] |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a board member, Thiel was not actively involved in Facebook's day-to-day running. However, he did provide help with timing the various rounds of funding and Zuckerberg credited Thiel with helping him time Facebook's 2007 Series D to close before the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, David (2010-06-08). The Facebook Effect (p. 246). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Facebook Effect]]'', [[David Kirkpatrick (author)|David Kirkpatrick]] outlines how Thiel came to make this investment: [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who at the time had assumed the title of "President" of Facebook, was seeking investors for Facebook. Parker approached [[Reid Hoffman]], the CEO of work-based social network [[LinkedIn]]. Hoffman liked Facebook but declined to be the lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest with his duties as LinkedIn CEO. Thus, Hoffman directed Parker to Thiel, whom he knew from their [[PayPal]] days. Thiel met Parker and [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the Harvard student who had founded Facebook. Thiel and Zuckerberg got along well and Thiel agreed to lead Facebook's [[Venture round|seed round]] with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. The investment was originally in the form of a [[convertible note]], to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway.&lt;ref name=kirkpatrick-thiel&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Kirkpatrick|date=2010|title=The Facebook Effect|pp=87–8|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiel said of his investment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.&lt;ref name=kirkpatrick-thiel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2010, Thiel, while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer Internet sector, argued that relative to other Internet companies, Facebook (which then had a secondary market valuation of $30 billion) was comparatively undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20100928/peter-thiel-why-facebook-is-like-ford-motors-in-the-1920s/|title = Peter Thiel: Why Facebook Is Like Ford Motors In The 1920s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook's [[initial public offering]] was in May 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion ($38 a share), at which time Thiel sold 16.8 million shares for $638 million.&lt;ref name=betabeat&gt;Tiku, Nitasha.

Betabeat. Retrieved on 2013-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock out period, Thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share, or $395.8 million, for a total of more than $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-thiel-idUSBRE87J0UQ20120820 |title=Facebook director Thiel sold 20 million shares after lock-up |publisher=Reuters |author=Alexei Oreskovic |date=August 19, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his seat on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/48730344 |title=Investor Peter Thiel Sells Facebook Shares |date=August 20, 2012 |author=Julia Boorstin |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he sold a little under 1 million of his shares for around $100 million.

===Founders Fund===
{{further|Founders Fund}}
In 2005, Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund. Other partners in the fund include [[Sean Parker]], [[Ken Howery]], and [[Luke Nosek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249705|title=What Types of Companies Is Peter Thiel's Founders Fund Actually Investing In?|last=Siu|first=Eric|date=2015-08-25|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Facebook, Thiel has made early-stage investments in numerous startups (personally or through his venture capital fund), including [[Booktrack]], [[Slide.com|Slide]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Friendster]], [[Rapleaf]], [[Geni.com]], [[Yammer]], [[Yelp Inc.]], [[Powerset (company)|Powerset]], [[Practice Fusion]], [[MetaMed]], [[Vator]], [[Palantir Technologies]], [[IronPort]], [[Votizen]], [[Asana (web application)|Asana]], [[Big Think]], Caplinked, [[Quora]], [[Nanotronics Imaging]], [[Rypple]], [[TransferWise]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], and Block.one (the publisher of the [[EOS.IO]] [[blockchain]] protocol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Block.one Closes Strategic Investment Round Led by Peter Thiel and Bitmain|url=https://block.one/news/block-one-closes-strategic-investment-round-led-by-peter-thiel-and-bitmain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=November 2018}} Slide, LinkedIn, Yelp,  Geni.com, and [[Yammer]] were founded by Thiel's former colleagues at PayPal: Slide by [[Max Levchin]], Linkedin by [[Reid Hoffman]], Yelp by [[Jeremy Stoppelman]], and Geni.com and Yammer by [[David O.

''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reports that PayPal alumni have founded or invested in dozens of startups with an aggregate value of around $30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2007/11/13/paypal-mafia/|title=The PayPal Mafia|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2017 Founders Fund bought $15–20 million worth of [[bitcoin]]. In January 2018 the venture capital firm told investors that due to the cryptocurrency's surge the holdings were worth hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/02/bitcoin-rises-after-report-says-early-facebook-investor-peter-thiel-is-buying-massive-amounts.html|title =Bitcoin rises after report says early Facebook investor Peter Thiel is buying massive amounts|first =Evelyn|last= Cheng|publisher =CNBC|date =2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked "What is the biggest achievement that you haven't achieved yet?" by the moderator of a discussion panel at the Venture Alpha West 2014 conference, Thiel said he wants to make progress on anti-aging research.&lt;ref name=Reilly2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Richard Byrne|title=Billionaire Peter Thiel embarks on anti-aging crusade|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/08/billionaire-peter-thiel-may-want-to-live-forever/|accessdate=October 22, 2014|work=Venture Beat|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiel also said that he is registered to be [[cryopreservation|cryonically preserved]], meaning that he would be subject to low-temperature preservation in case of his legal death in hopes that he might be successfully revived by future medical technology, and is signed up with the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Brown2014/&gt;

====Seasteading====
On April 15, 2008, Thiel pledged $500,000 to the newly-created nonprofit [[Seasteading Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/dealbook/seasteading-floating-cities.html Floating Cities, No Longer Science Fiction, Begin to Take Shape] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Patri Friedman]], whose mission is "to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems."&lt;ref name=tsi20080415&gt;{{cite web |title = Introducing The Seasteading Institute |accessdate = 2008-04-16 |url = http://seasteading.org/stay-in-touch/press-releases/introducing-the-seasteading-institute |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5aLaQdMrS?url=http://seasteading.org/stay-in-touch/press-releases/introducing-the-seasteading-institute |archivedate = August 25, 2008 |deadurl = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160920-how-utopia-shaped-the-world|title =How Utopia shaped the world|publisher =BBC News|first =Tom|last =Hodgkinson|date =October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At one of the institute's conferences, he described [[seasteading]] as "one of the few technological frontiers that has the promise to create a new space for human freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/floating-island-project-pushes-on-without-peter-thiel-s-support Floating Island Project Pushes On, Without Peter Thiel’s Support] Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thiel Fellowship===
On September 29, 2010, Thiel created the [[Thiel Fellowship]], which annually awards $100,000 to 20 people under the age of 20 in order to spur them to drop out of college and create their own ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://20under20.org |title=The Thiel Fellowship |publisher=20 Under 20 |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Peter Thiel Launches Fellowship Program| accessdate = 2010-09-30| url = http://www.silicontap.com/peter_thiel_launches_fellowship_program/s-0031372.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-headline-available-1387303362|title =Why a Nonprofit Backs Dropping Out of School|first =Lora|last =Kolodny|website =The Wall Street Journal|date =December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thiel, for many young people, college is the path to take when they have no idea what to do with their lives:

{{quote|I feel I was personally very guilty of this; you don't know what to do with your life, so you get a college degree; you don't know what you're going to do with your college degree, so you get a graduate degree. In my case it was law school, which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do. I don't have any big regrets, but if I had to do it over I would try to think more about the future than I did at the time... You cannot get out of student debt even if you personally go bankrupt, it's a form of almost like indentured servitude, it's attached to your physical person for the rest of your life.&lt;ref name=Brown2014/&gt;}}

===Breakout Labs===
In November 2011, the Thiel Foundation announced the creation of [[Breakout Labs]], a grant-making program intended to "to fill the funding gap that exists for innovative research outside the confines of an academic institution, large corporation, or government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.breakoutlabs.org/about-us.html |title=Breakout Labs about page |publisher=Breakoutlabs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114103546/http://www.breakoutlabs.org/about-us.html |archivedate=November 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=naturebl&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/04/paypal-co-founders-breakout-labs-issues-first-grants.html PayPal co-founder’s Breakout Labs issues first grants] Nature&lt;/ref&gt; It offers grants of up to $350,000 to science-focused startups, "with no strings attached".&lt;ref name=forbesbl&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2013/04/17/peter-thiels-breakout-labs-turns-more-science-projects-into-businesses/#44b6c1f21d2f Peter Thiel's Breakout Labs Turns More Science Projects Into Businesses] Forbes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunchbl&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/breakout-ventures-spun-out-of-peter-thiels-breakout-labs-has-closed-its-debut-fund-with-60m/ Breakout Ventures, spun out of  Peter Thiel’s Breakout Labs, has closed its debut fund with $60M] TechCrunch&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, Breakout Labs announced its first set of grantees.&lt;ref name=naturebl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.breakoutlabs.org/news-events/news-event-item/article/breakout-labs-announces-first-grantees.html| title = Breakout Labs press release on first batch of grantees| accessdate = 2012-06-08| date = 2012-04-17| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616114659/https://www.breakoutlabs.org/news-events/news-event-item/article/breakout-labs-announces-first-grantees.html| archivedate = June 16, 2012| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 12 startups received funding, for a total of $4.5 million in grants.&lt;ref name=forbesbl/&gt; One of the first ventures to receive funding from Breakout Labs was [[3Scan]], a [[Automated tissue image analysis|tissue imaging]] platform.&lt;ref name=techcrunchbl/&gt;

==Gawker lawsuit==
{{Main|Bollea v. Gawker}}
In May 2016, Thiel confirmed in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he had paid $10 million in legal expenses to finance several lawsuits brought by others, including a lawsuit by Terry Bollea ("[[Hulk Hogan]]") against [[Gawker Media]] for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and infringement of personality rights after [[Gawker]] made public sections of a sex tape involving Bollea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/tech-billionaire-thiel-backing-wrestler-hogans-gawker-lawsuit-040625660.html |title=Tech billionaire Thiel helps Hulk Hogan |last1=McBride |first1=Sarah|last2=Somerville |first2=Heather |date=May 25, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury awarded Bollea $140 million, and Gawker announced it was permanently shutting its doors due to the lawsuit in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/peter-thiel-just-got-wish-gawker-shutting/|title=Peter Thiel Just Got His Wish: Gawker Is Shutting Down|author=Davey Alba|date=August 18, 2016|work=Wired|accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thiel referred to his financial support of Bollea's case as one of the "greater philanthropic things that I've done."&lt;ref name="Gawker"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html Peter Thiel, Tech Billionaire, Reveals Secret War With Gawker] By Andrew Ross Sorkin, The New York Times, May 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel said he was motivated to sue Gawker after they published a 2007 article publicly [[outing]] him, headlined "Peter Thiel is totally gay, people". Thiel stated that Gawker articles about others, including his friends, had "ruined people's lives for no reason," and said, "It's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence."&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt; In response to criticism that his funding of lawsuits against Gawker could restrict the [[freedom of the press]], Thiel cited his donations to the Committee to Protect Journalists and stated, "I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations. I think much more highly of journalists than that. It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker."&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt;

On August 15, 2016, Thiel published an opinion piece in ''The New York Times'' in which he argued that his defense of online privacy went beyond Gawker.&lt;ref name="nytimesopedonlineprivacyaugust15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thiel|first1=Peter|title=Peter Thiel: The Online Privacy Debate Won't End With Gawker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/opinion/peter-thiel-the-online-privacy-debate-wont-end-with-gawker.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 16, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted his support for the [[Intimate Privacy Protection Act]], and said that athletes and business executives have the right to stay in the closet as long as they want to.&lt;ref name="nytimesopedonlineprivacyaugust15"/&gt;

==New Zealand citizenship==
Thiel is a German citizen by birth and an American citizen by naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2017/01/25/peter-thiel-obtained-new-zealand-citizenship-possibly-because-of-exceptional-circumstances/#637cda313bd9 Peter Thiel Obtained New Zealand Citizenship Possibly Because Of 'Exceptional Circumstances'] ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt; He became a New Zealand citizen in 2011, though this was not made public until 2017.&lt;ref name="nz2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tech billionaire Peter Thiel a New Zealand citizen since 2011 |date=January 25, 2017 |first=Matt |last=Nippert |publisher=NZ Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11788688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nzh21&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11790034|title=Revealed: How Peter Thiel got New Zealand citizenship|first=Matt Nippert, Francis|last=Cook|date=February 1, 2017|publisher=|via=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, he purchased a 193-hectare estate near [[Wanaka]], which fit the classification of "sensitive land" and required foreign buyers to obtain permission from New Zealand's [[Overseas Investment Office]].

==Personal life==
Thiel married his long-time partner Matt Danzeisen in October 2017, in [[Vienna]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.axios.com/peter-thiel-got-married-over-the-weekend-1513306233-29abae6d-fa70-4939-b15e-0d0042986700.html|title =Peter Thiel got married over the weekend|website =Axios|first1 =Dan|last1 =Primack|first2 =Mike|last2 =Allen|date =October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danzeisen works as a portfolio manager at Thiel Capital.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite news|url=http://expressdigest.com/billionaire-peter-thiel-gets-married-to-matt-danzeisen/|title=Billionaire Peter Thiel gets married to Matt Danzeisen|publisher=Express Digest|date=18 October 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Thiel is a self-described [[Christianity|Christian]] and a promoter of [[René Girard]]'s [[Christian anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sean|last=Salai|url=http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/faith-technology-qa-peter-thiel|title=Faith &amp; Technology: Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel|website=''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]''|date=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] household but, as of 2011, describes his religious beliefs as "somewhat heterodox", and stated: "I believe [[Christianity]] is true but I don't sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that."&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

During his time at Stanford University, Thiel attended a lecture given by René Girard. Girard, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], explained the role of sacrifice and the scapegoat mechanism in resolving social conflict, which appealed to Thiel as it offered a basis for his Christian faith without the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalism]] of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Paul |first=Elie|title=America's Problem: Mimetic Desire|url=http://everythingthatrises.com/post/67695583821/americas-problem-mimetic-desire|newspaper=Everything That Rises|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on democracy===
Writing in ''Cato Unbound,'' the organ of the [[Cato Institute]], a libertarian think-tank, Thiel wrote, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;…I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible… The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of "[[democratic capitalism|capitalist democracy]]" into an oxymoron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian | title=The Education of a Libertarian | publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | date=April 13, 2009 | accessdate=April 26, 2014 | first=Peter| last=Thiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Media appearances===
Thiel is an occasional commentator on [[CNBC]], having appeared on both ''[[Closing Bell]]'' with [[Kelly Evans]], and ''[[Squawk Box]]'' with [[Becky Quick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=955505429&amp;play=1|title=News Headlines|publisher=Cnbc.com|date=2009-02-26|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been interviewed twice by [[Charlie Rose]] on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/926|title=Peter Thiel|publisher=Charlie Rose|accessdate=2010-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012044655/http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/926|archivedate=October 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also contributed articles to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[First Things]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', and ''[[Policy Review]]'', a journal formerly published by the [[Hoover Institution]], on whose board he sits.

In ''[[The Social Network]]'', Thiel was portrayed by [[Wallace Langham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/257531/back-future-peter-thiel-interview|title=Back to the Future with Peter Thiel|first=Matthew|last=Shaffer|website=National Review|date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the film as "wrong on many levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/19/peter-thiel-saverin/|title=Peter Thiel: Facebook Co-Founder Eduardo Saverin Did A Poor Job, Got Rich Anyway|first=Robin|last=Wauters|publisher=TechCrunch|date=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel was the inspiration for the Peter Gregory character on HBO's ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.businessinsider.com/a-guide-to-hbos-silicon-valley-jokes-2014-4#ixzz30OLeYqJ8 |title=A Guide To The Best Inside Jokes On HBO's Hit Comedy 'Silicon Valley'|author= Julie Bort|publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date = April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiel said of Gregory, "I liked him...

[[Jonas Lüscher]] stated in an interview with ''[[Basellandschaftliche Zeitung]]'' that he based the character Tobias Erkner in his novel ''Kraft'' ("Force") on Thiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basellandschaftlichezeitung.ch/leben/leben/trend-autor-jonas-luescher-die-reichen-werden-unsterblich-und-der-grosse-rest-ueberfluessig-131231659|title=Trend-Autor Jonas Lüscher: "Die Reichen werden unsterblich und der grosse Rest überflüssig"|first=Raffael|last=Schuppisser|website=Basellandschaftliche Zeitung|language=German|date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honors===
Thiel received a co-producer credit for ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'', a 2005 feature film based on [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]]'s 1994 [[Thank You for Smoking (novel)|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB119889558568757053 |title=VC's New Math: Does Less = More?|author=Rebecca Buckman |date=December 29, 2007|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thiel won the Herman Lay Award for Entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Association of Private Enterprise Education|accessdate=2008-01-24|url=http://www.apee.org/award-lay.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5aLaFTFDk?url=http://www.apee.org/award-lay.html|archivedate=August 25, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2009, Thiel was awarded an honorary degree from [[Universidad Francisco Marroquin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees |title=Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501185429/https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees |archivedate=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Students For Liberty]], an organization dedicated to spreading [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals on college campuses, awarded Thiel its "Alumnus of the Year" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsforliberty.org/upcoming-events/peter-thiel-at-isflc12-you-are-the-entrepreneur-of-your-life/|title=Peter Thiel at #ISFLC12: "You are the Entrepreneur of Your Life"|date=2012-02-27|accessdate=2012-06-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603161754/http://studentsforliberty.org/upcoming-events/peter-thiel-at-isflc12-you-are-the-entrepreneur-of-your-life/|archivedate=June 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published books==
===''The Diversity Myth''===
In 1995, the [[Independent Institute]] published ''The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford'', which Thiel co-authored along with [[David O. Sacks]], and with a foreword by the late [[Emory University]] historian [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=38|title=The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus|work=The Independent Institute|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is critical of political correctness and multiculturalism in higher education and the consequent dilution of academic rigor. Thiel and Sacks' writings drew criticism from then-Stanford Provost (and later President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]) [[Condoleezza Rice]], with Rice joining then-Stanford President [[Gerhard Casper]] in describing Thiel and Sacks' view of Stanford as "a cartoon, not a description of our freshman curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Stanford-President-Condemns-Opinion-Piece-3022703.php|title=Stanford President Condemns Opinion Piece / Former students ridiculed school in Wall Street Journal|author1=Bill Workman|author2= Chronicle Peninsula Bureau|date=October 11, 1995|work=SFGate|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their commentary as "demagoguery, pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/cover/1995_Nov_29.4COVER29.html|title=Taking aim at Stanford|publisher=|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Thiel apologized for two statements he made in the book: 1) "The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising 'awareness'" and 2) "But since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might 'realize' that she had been 'raped' the next day or even many days later." He stated: "More than two decades ago, I co-wrote a book with several insensitive, crudely argued statements. As I've said before, I wish I'd never written those things. I'm sorry for it. Rape in all forms is a crime. I regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Bort, Julie (October 25, 2016) [http://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-and-david-sacks-apologize-rape-comments-book-2016-10?r=UK&amp;IR=T "VC Peter Thiel and Zenefits CEO David Sacks apologize for writing a book that downplayed rape."] The Guardian. (Retrieved 10-25-2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Zero to One''===
In Spring 2012, Thiel taught CS 183: Startup at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2012/06/07/ten-lessons-from-peter-thiels-class-on-startups/ |title = Ten Lessons from Peter Thiel's Class On Startups |work=Forbes |first=Ryan |last=Mac |date=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes for the course, taken by student Blake Masters, led to a book titled ''[[Zero to One]]'' by Thiel and Masters, which was released in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerotoonebook.com|title = Zero to One|accessdate = September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup|title = Notes Essays – Peter Thiel’s CS183: Startup – Stanford, Spring 2012|last = Masters|first = Blake|accessdate = September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/peter-thiel-tweets/|title=Peter Thiel Tweets|first=Sarah|last=Buhr|publisher=TechCrunch|date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derek Thompson, writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', stated ''Zero to One'' "might be the best business book I've read". He described it as a "self-help book for entrepreneurs, bursting with bromides" but also as a "lucid and profound articulation of capitalism and success in the 21st century economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/peter-thiel-zero-to-one-review/380738|title=Peter Thiel's Zero to One Might Be the Best Business Book I've Read|first=Derek|last=Thompson|website=The Atlantic|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Signs of death}}
'''Post-mortem interval''' (PMI) is the time that has elapsed since a person has [[death|died]]. If the time in question is not known, a number of medical/scientific techniques are used to determine it. This also can refer to the stage of decomposition of the body.

==Types of change after death==
Many types of changes to a body occur after death. Some of those that can be used to determine the [[wiktionary:post mortem|post mortem]] interval are:&lt;ref name=Bautista&gt;''[http://frank.mtsu.edu/~scientia/Volume%202/Bautista.pdf Survey of Biological Factors Affecting the Determination of the Postmortem Interval]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''. Bautista, Richard. Spring 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tibbett&gt;''[http://www.iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/1172.pdf Blood, guts, gore and soil: decomposition processes in graves and forensic taphonomic applications]''. Tibbett, Mark. 2010 19th World Congress of Soil Science, Soil Solutions for a Changing World.&lt;/ref&gt;

* State of decomposition - [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] (process of self digestion) and [[putrefaction]] (process caused by bacteria found within the body).&lt;ref name=Bautista/&gt;{{rp|16}}

==Traditional decomposition stages==
A person who judges the time of death by the means of decomposition can refer to a simple five-stage process:
* Stage 1: Initial Decay - Bacteria located mainly in the lower intestine begin decomposition, giving a greenish color to the lower abdomen.&lt;ref name=Bautista/&gt;{{rp|17}}
* Stage 2: Putrefaction - Bacteria grow throughout the body, releasing gases, including [[cadaverine]], which in turn bloat the body and cause unpleasant odor.
* Stage 3: Black Putrefaction - This stage brings further discoloration to the body. The gases from bacterial decay begin to escape, causing strong odor.
* Stage 4: Butyric Fermentation - The internal organs liquefy and the body begins to dry out.
* Stage 5: Mummification - This is the slowest of the five stages. In a hot, dry climate the body may dehydrate, inhibiting bacterial decay; the skin dries to a dark leathery appearance.&lt;ref name=Bautista/&gt;{{rp|17}}

[[File:Protoplasts Petunia sp.jpg|thumb|right|Protoplasts of cells from a petunia's leaf]]
[[Image:Physcomitrella protoplasts.jpg|thumb|Protoplasts of the moss ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'']]

'''Protoplast''', from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρωτόπλαστος}} (''prōtóplastos'', "first-formed"), is a [[biology|biological]] term proposed by [[Johannes von Hanstein|Hanstein]] in 1880 to refer to the entire cell, excluding the cell wall,&lt;ref&gt;Hanstein, J. 1880. ''[https://archive.org/details/DasProtoplasma Das Protoplasma]''. Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, L. W. (1921). ''[https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp Introduction To Cytology]''. New York: McGraw Hill, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but currently has several definitions:
* a [[plant]], [[bacterium|bacterial]] or [[fungus|fungal]] cell that had its [[cell wall]] completely or partially removed using either mechanical or enzymatic means. A further differentiation can be made for bacteria:
** protoplasts: have their cell wall entirely removed and are derived from gram + ([[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]])
** [[spheroplast]]s: have their cell wall only partially removed and are gram − ([[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]])
* more generally, a unit of biology which is composed of a cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and the surrounding [[protoplasm]]ic materials.

==Enzymes for the preparation of protoplasts==
Cell walls are made of a variety of [[polysaccharide]]s.  Protoplasts can be made by degrading cell walls with a mixture of the appropriate polysaccharide-degrading [[enzyme]]s:
{|  class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="2"
!Type of cell
!Enzyme
|-
| [[Plant cell]]s
|[[Cellulase]], [[pectinase]], [[xylanase]]
|-
| [[Gram-positive]] bacteria 
| [[Lysozyme]] (+[[EDTA]])
|-
| [[Fungus|Fungal]] cells
| [[Chitinase]]
|}
During and subsequent to digestion of the cell wall, the protoplast becomes very sensitive to [[osmosis|osmotic]] stress.  This means cell wall digestion and protoplast storage must be done in an [[Tonicity#Isotonicity|isotonic solution]] to prevent rupture of the [[plasma membrane]].

==Uses for protoplasts==
[[File:Protoplast fusion.jpg|thumb|right|Fused protoplast (on left), containing both chloroplasts (from a leaf cell) as well as a  coloured vacuole (from a petal).]] 
Protoplasts can be used to study [[biological membrane|membrane]] biology, including the uptake of [[macromolecule]]s and  [[virus]]es . These are also used in [[somaclonal variation]].

Protoplasts are widely used for [[DNA]] [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (for making [[genetically modified organism]]s), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davey MR, Anthony P, Power JB, Lowe KC |title=Plant protoplasts: status and biotechnological perspectives |journal=Biotechnol. Adv. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=131–71 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15694124 |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2004.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of plant cells, protoplasts may be regenerated into whole plants first by growing into a group of plant cells that develops into a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] and then by regeneration of shoots ([[caulogenesis]]) from the callus using [[plant tissue culture]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12033-007-0031-3 |author=Thorpe TA |title=History of plant tissue culture |journal=Mol. Biotechnol. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=169–80 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17914178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of protoplasts into callus and regeneration of shoots requires the proper balance of plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium that must be customized for each species of plant. Unlike protoplasts from [[vascular plant]]s, protoplasts from [[moss]]es, such as ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', do not need [[phytohormone]]s for regeneration, nor do they form a callus during [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]]. Instead, they regenerate directly into the filamentous [[protonema]], mimicking a germinating moss spore.&lt;ref&gt;S.C. Bhatla, Justine Kiessling, [[Ralf Reski]] (2002): [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m747f7xfu9dxyprw/?p=2747894a7a9849a09e60b0e49f51afdc&amp;pi=3Observation of polarity induction by cytochemical localization of phenylalkylamine-binding receptors in regenerating protoplasts of the moss Physcomitrella patens]. Protoplasma 219, 99–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protoplasts may also be used for [[plant breeding]], using a technique called [[protoplast fusion]].  Protoplasts from different species are induced to fuse by using an [[electric field]] or a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hain and A.P. Czernilofsky et al. (1985). "Uptake, integration, expression and genetic transmission of a selectable chimaeric gene by plant protoplasts". ''Mol Gen Genet'' 199:161–168.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique may be used to generate [[somatic hybrid]]s in tissue culture.

Additionally, protoplasts of plants expressing fluorescent proteins in certain cells may be used for Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), where only cells fluorescing a selected wavelength are retained. Among other things, this technique is used to isolate specific cell types (e.g., [[guard cells]] from leaves, [[pericycle]] cells from roots) for further investigations, such as transcriptomics.

'''Robert Bauer''' (1950 – 8 September 2014) was a German [[mycologist]], specialising in rust  ([[Uredinales]]) and smut ([[Ustilaginomycetes]]) fungi.

Bauer studied Biology at the [[University of Tübingen]] during the 1970s, and a particular interest in plants and fungi led to completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] there in 1983 with a doctoral dissertation entitled ''{{lang|de|Experimentell-ontogenetische und karyologische Untersuchungen an Uredinales}}'' (''Experimental-ontogenetic and karyological studies on Uredinales''). He went on to become chair of "Systematic Botany and Mycology" (now "Evolutionary Ecology of Plants") in the "Institute of Evolution and Ecology" at Tübingen.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |first=Franz |last=Oberwinkler |authorlink=Franz Oberwinkler |title=Obituary |url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uploads/media/Bauer_Nachruf_Fakulta%CC%88t-14_9_14.pdf |language=German |date=15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became adept in the use of [[electron microscope]]s and the prerequisite specialised cutting and preparation techniques at a time when ultrastructural study of fungi was still in its infancy. He became known for detailed work on mycoparasitic fungi and the [[Smut (fungus)|smut fungi]] in particular. He was able to use ultrastructural evidence to postulate [[Phylogenetics|phylogenies]] in this group before molecular techniques were developed. Subsequent molecular studies aligned with his hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Bauer produced over 100 publications during his career, during which time he was also strongly involved in teaching, the [[Botanischer Garten der Universität Tübingen|university's botanic garden]] and overseeing specialist internships in electronmicroscopy.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Bauer died, aged 64, on 8 September 2014 in [[Neckartailfingen]], [[Stuttgart (region)|Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Calmly and respectfully think about your actions, and honor and fame will await you."]]

'''Human self-reflection''' is the capacity of [[human]]s to exercise [[introspection]] and the willingness to learn more about their fundamental nature, purpose and [[essence]]. The earliest historical records demonstrate the great interest which humanity has had in itself.

Human self-reflection is related to the [[philosophy]] of consciousness, the topic of [[awareness]], [[consciousness]] in general and the [[philosophy of mind]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==

===Prehistoric times===
Prehistoric notions about the status of humanity may be guessed by the etymology of ancient words for man. [[Latin]] ''homo'' ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*dʰǵʰm̥mō'') means "of the earth, earthling", probably in opposition to "celestial" beings. [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἂνθρωπος}} ([[mycenaean language|mycenaean]] ''*anthropos'') means "low-eyed", again probably contrasting with a divine perspective.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Ancient Orient===
From the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd-millennium]] [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], belief in the eternal afterlife of the human [[Egyptian soul|ka]] is documented. From the earliest times, man made out a claim of dominance of humanity alongside radical [[pessimism]] because of the frailty and brevity of human [[life]] (in the [[Hebrew Bible]], for example, dominion of man is promised in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:28, but the author of [[Ecclesiastes]] bewails the vanity of all human effort).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Classical antiquity===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Diogenes of Sinope]] --&gt;
[[Protagoras]] made the famous claim that ''"Man is the measure of all things; of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not"''. [[Socrates]] advocated for all humans to "[[know thyself]]", and gave the (doubtlessly tongue-in-cheek) definition of humans as "featherless bipeds" ([[Plato]], ''Politicus''). More serious is [[Aristotle]]'s description of man as the "communal animal" (ζῶον πολιτικόν), i.e., emphasizing society-building as a central trait of human nature, and [[rational animal|"thought bearer animal"]] ({{lang|grc|ζῶον λόγον ἔχον}}, ''animal rationale''),{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} a term that also inspired the species' taxonomy, ''Homo sapiens''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Middle Ages===
The dominant world-view of medieval Europe, as directed by the [[Catholic Church]], was that human existence is essentially good and created in "original grace", but because of concupiscence, is marred  by [[sin]], and that its aim should be to focus on the beatific vision after [[death]]. The 13th century pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] wrote about the essential misery of earthly existence in his ''"On the misery of the human condition"'' &amp;ndash; a view that was disputed by, for example, [[Giannozzo Manetti]] in his treatise ''"On human dignity."''{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Renaissance===
{{see also|Renaissance humanism}}
A famous quote of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]] (II, ii, 115-117), expressing the contrast of human physical beauty, intellectual faculty, and ephemeral nature:
:''What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?''

[[René Descartes]] famously and succinctly proposed: ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René; ''[[Principles of Philosophy|Principia Philosophiae]]'' (1644), Part 1, article 7:"''Ac proinde hæc cognitio, ego cogito, ergo sum, est omnium prima &amp; certissima, quæ cuilibet ordine philosophanti occurrat.''"&lt;/ref&gt;  (French: "''Je pense donc je suis''"; English: "''I think, therefore I am''").

===Modern era===
The [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was driven by a renewed conviction, that, in the words of [[Immanuel Kant]], ''"Man is distinguished above all animals by his self-consciousness, by which he is a 'rational animal'."'' In the 19th century,  [[Karl Marx]] defined man as "labouring animal" (''animal laborans'') in conscious opposition to this tradition. In the early 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] dealt a serious blow to [[positivism]] by postulating that human behaviour is to a large part controlled by the [[unconscious mind]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Comparison to other species ==
Various attempts have been made to identify a single behavioural characteristic that distinguishes humans from all other animals. Many [[anthropologist]]s think that readily observable characteristics ([[tool]]-making and [[language]]) are based on less easily observable [[mental process]]es that might be unique among humans: the ability to think [[symbol]]ically, in the abstract or [[logic]]ally, although several species have demonstrated some abilities in these areas. Nor is it clear at what point exactly in human evolution these traits became prevalent. They may not be restricted to the species ''Homo sapiens'', as the extinct species of the genus ''Homo'' (e.g. ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'') are believed to also have been adept tool makers and may also have had linguistic skills.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In learning environments reflection is an important part of the loop to go through in order to maximise the utility of having experiences. Rather than moving on to the next 'task' we can review the process and outcome of the task and – with the benefit of a little distance (lapsed time) we can reconsider what the value of  experience might be for us and for the context of which it was a part. {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In [[human sexuality]], a '''sex life''' is a sector of a person's day-to-day existence which may involve [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or represent the absence of sexual activity. {{cn-span|In general parlance, the term can have many sub-meanings and social layers, but generally includes the following:|date=September 2018}}

* {{cn-span|The individual is able to, on an either regular or semi-regular basis, enter into voluntarily agreed and consensual situations involving partnered sexual activity, i.e. an activity other than ''solo'' [[masturbation]]. This would inherently mean there is at least one other person per situation, with or without sexual activity, and regardless of whether or not these situations are sexually [[monogamous]]; i.e., a "sex life" can be had just as easily with a long-term sexual partner as it can with multiple partners in rapid succession over a lifetime. The idea of a 'regularly or semi-regularly' sex life varies, but categorizing an individual who is [[incel|involuntarily celibate]] (as opposed to [[sexual abstinence|voluntary abstinence]]) as having a sex life may be inaccurate.|date=September 2018}}
* {{cn-span|Presuming the above is true by default, the individual who has a sex life is then able to explore and deepen his or her existing sexual skills and also, when s/he desires it, is able to have the opportunity to learn new ones and to "grow" as a sexual being.|date=September 2018}}
* {{cn-span|The individual is able, because of these factors, to have an "area" of his or her overall "life" that involves sex in a way that is somewhat similar to how athletes have an "area" of their lives that involves sports or how musicians have an "area" of their lives that involves music. A person with a secure and constantly developing sex life is inherently able to regard their sexuality as an active part of themselves, and although a secure sex life does not necessarily mean that the person will always feel self-confident or [[sexually attractive]], consistent access to sex and the ability to deepen and broaden one's sexual skills provides a certain psychological assurance of sex appeal that people who do not have a "sex life" tend not to have.|date=September 2018}}

Several sources say that in humans, any frequency of [[sexual intercourse]] might range from zero to 15 or 20 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 Sexual health: An interview with a [[Mayo Clinic]] specialist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206023204/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |date=2005-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Varcarolis | first = E.M.| authorlink =| coauthors = | title = Foundations of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing | publisher =W.B.

According to the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], average frequency of sexual intercourse in US is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#frequency | title = Frequently asked questions to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction (Kinsey Institute) | accessdate = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''skull cup''' is a drinking vessel or eating bowl made from an inverted human [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]] that has been cut away from the rest of the [[skull]].  The use of a [[human skull]] as a drinking [[cup]] in ritual use or as a trophy is reported in numerous sources throughout history and among various peoples, and among Western cultures is most often associated with the historically nomadic cultures of the [[Eurasia]]n [[steppe]].

According to Herodotus' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]], [[Scythians]] killed their enemies and made their skulls into drinking cups.  The oldest record in the Chinese annals of the skull-cup tradition dates from the last years of the [[Spring and Autumn period]], when the victors of the [[Battle of Jinyang]] in 453 BC made the skull of their enemy into a winecup.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian [[s:zh:史記/卷086|vol.86]]: 趙襄子最怨智伯，漆其頭以為飲器。&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' recorded the practice among the ancient [[Xiongnu]] of present-day [[Mongolia]]. [[Laoshang Chanyu|Laoshang]] (or Jizhu), son of the Xiongnu chieftain [[Modu Chanyu]], killed the king of the [[Yuezhi]] around 162 BC, and in accordance with their tradition, "made a drinking cup out of his skull".&lt;ref&gt;[[Shiji]] 123.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the biography of the envoy [[Zhang Qian]] in ''[[Book of Han|Han shu]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Han shu'', 94B, p.&amp;nbsp;3a; Yu Yingshi, ''Trade and Expansion in Han China'', 1967:218.&lt;/ref&gt; the drinking cup made from the skull of the Yuezhi king was later used when the Xiongnu concluded a treaty with two Han ambassadors during the reign of Emperor Yuan (49-33 BC). To seal the convention, the Chinese ambassadors drank blood from the skull cup with the Xiongnu chiefs.

In 1510, Shah [[Ismail I]] defeated and slew [[Muhammad Shaybani]] in battle, founder of the [[Shaybanid Empire]] in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]. The Shah had his enemy's body dismembered and the parts were sent to various areas of the empire for display, while his skull was coated in gold and made into a jewelled drinking goblet.

In [[Japan]], the famed warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]] led a number of campaigns against the Azai and Asakura clans beginning in 1570. Following his victories at the [[siege]]s of [[Siege of Odani Castle|Odani]] and [[Siege of Ichijōdani Castle|Ichijōdani Castle]]s in 1573, he took the skulls of [[Azai Nagamasa]], his father [[Azai Hisamasa|Hisamasa]], and [[Asakura Yoshikage]] and had them prepared for display and for use as ''[[sake]]'' cups (''[[sake set|o-choko]]'').&lt;ref name=west143&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weston |first= Mark|title= Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women|publisher= Kodansha International|place= NYC |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike skull cups of other cultures, which might resemble a bowl or a [[chalice]] in the finished form, the Japanese artisans excised a shallow, saucer-shaped portion from the top of the each skull, then [[lacquer]]ed the skulls, covered them in [[gold leaf]], and each cup was set in the aperture from which it had been cut, [[wikt: concave|concave]] side up. Nobunaga then presented the three skulls to his vassals and drank ''sake'' from the cups, in order to demonstrate the fate of those who would oppose or betray him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuwata |first= Tadachika | script-title=ja:信長公記 | year= 1997 | publisher= Shinjinbutsu| location= Tokyo |language= Japanese |trans-title=[[Shinchō kōki]] (Chronicle of Nobunaga) |isbn= 4-404-02493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three skulls were probably lost when [[Azuchi Castle]] was destroyed in 1582.

In India and Tibet the skull cup is known as a ''[[Kapala]]'', and is used in [[Buddhist]] [[tantra|tantric]] and [[Hindu]] [[tantra|tantric]] rituals. The skull does not belong to an enemy, and indeed the identity of the skull's original owner is not considered significant, as ritual purity in death has divested the human soul from its corporeal form. Hindu deities such as [[Kali]] are sometimes depicted holding a ''kapala'' full of human blood. Many carved and elaborately mounted ''kapalas'' survive, mostly in Tibet.

[[File:Krum1.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian Khan Krum the Fearsome feasts with his nobles as a servant (right) brings the skull of Nikephoros I, fashioned into a drinking cup, full of wine.]]
The [[Scythia]]ns are reported by [[Herodotus]] (ca.484 – ca.425 BC) and later [[Strabo]] (63/64 BC&amp;nbsp;– ca.24 AD) to have drunk from the skulls of their enemies. 

[[Edouard Chavannes]] quotes [[Livy]] to illustrate the ceremonial use of skull cups by the [[Boii]], a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe in Europe in 216 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Chavannes |first= Edouard |title= Mémoires historiques |volume= 5 |pages= 185–186 |url= http://classiques.uqac.ca/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul the Deacon]]'s ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'', when the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]] defeated the [[Gepids]], hereditary enemies of his people, in 567 AD, he then slew their new king Cunimund, fashioned a drinking-cup from his skull, and took his daughter Rosamund as a wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924027767593  |title=''History of the Langobards'' |author= [[Paul the Deacon]]|year= 1907 | publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press| location= [[Philadelphia]] |accessdate= |others=translator: [[William Dudley Foulke]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krum]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] was said by [[Theophanes the Confessor]], [[Joannes Zonaras]], Mannases Chronicle, and others, to have made a jeweled cup from the skull of the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Nicephorus I]] (811 AD) after killing him in the [[Battle of Pliska]].

The [[Russian Primary Chronicle]] reports that the skull of [[Svyatoslav I]] of [[Kiev]] was made into a chalice by the [[Pecheneg]] [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] in 972 AD. He likely intended this as a compliment to Sviatoslav; sources report that Kurya and his wife drank from the skull and prayed for a son as brave as the deceased Rus warlord.

According to [[George Akropolites]] the skull of [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] was made into a drinking cup by the Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] (c.  1205).

According to legend, after the Pirate [[Blackbeard]] was killed and beheaded in 1718, his skull was made into a drinking cup.

In 19th century [[England]], the poet [[Lord Byron]] used a skull his gardener had found at [[Newstead Abbey]] as a drinking vessel. "There had been found by the gardener, in digging,  a skull that had probably belonged to some jolly monk or friar of the Abbey, about the time it was demonasteried. Observing it to be of giant size, and in a perfect state of preservation, a strange fancy seized me of having it set and mounted as a drinking cup. I accordingly sent it to town, and it returned with a very high polish and of a mottled colour like tortoiseshell".  Byron even wrote a darkly witty drinking poem as if inscribed upon it,  “Lines Inscribed upon a Cup Formed from a Skull”.&lt;ref&gt;Newstead, 1808&lt;/ref&gt; The cup, filled with [[claret]], was passed around "in imitation of the [[Goths]] of old", among the Order of the Skull that Byron founded at Newstead, "whilst many a grim joke was cut at its expense", Byron recalled to Thomas Medwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Thomas |first= Medwin| title= Conversations of Lord Byron: noted during a residence with his lordship |year= 1824 |page= 70f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shyama Prasad Mukherjee''' (6 July 1901&amp;nbsp;– 23 June 1953) was an Indian politician, barrister and academician, who served as [[Minister for Industry and Supply]] in Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s cabinet. After falling out with Nehru {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, Mukherjee quit the [[Indian National Congress]] and founded the right wing nationalist political party [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a predecessor to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1951.

He was also the president of [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]] from 1943 to 1946. Mukherjee was strongly opposed to [[Article 370]]{{efn|Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that gives autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/article-370-issue-omar-abdullah-jammu-and-kashmir-jawaharlal-nehru/1/364053.html |title=Article 370: 10 facts that you need to know : Highlights, News – India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} seeing as a threat to unity of the country and fought against it inside and outside the parliament with one of the goals of Bharatiya Jana Sangh being abrogation of the article. He died in 1953 due to [[heart attack]]. Since [[BJP]] is the successor party of Bhartiya Jana Sangh, Mookerjee is regarded as the founder of BJP too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjp.org/about-the-party/history?u=founder|title=History|website=www.bjp.org|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and academic career==
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was born in a [[Bengali Hindu]] family on 6 July 1901 in Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]).{{sfn|Chaturvedi|2010|p=25}}{{sfn|MK Singh|2009|p=240}} His father was [[Ashutosh Mukherjee]], a judge of the [[High Court of Calcutta]], Bengal, who was also [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Calcutta]].{{sfn|Dash|1968|p=566}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=1972 |title=

He enrolled in [[Bhowanipore|Bhawanipur]]'s Mitra Institution in 1906 and his behaviour in school was later described favourably by his teachers. In 1914, he passed his [[matriculation]] examination and was admitted into [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]].{{sfn|Roy|2014|p=22}}{{sfn|Trilochan Singh|1952|p=91}} He stood seventeenth in the Inter Arts Examination in 1916{{sfn|Calcutta Gazette 7 July 1916, part 1c, page 639}}and graduated in English, securing the first position in first [[List of Kolkata Presidencians#Politics|class in 1921]].{{sfn|MK Singh|2009|p=240}} He was married to Sudha Devi on 16 April 1922.{{sfn|Chander|2000|p=75}} Mukherjee also completed an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Bengali, being graded as [[Academic grading in India|first class]] in 1923{{sfn|KV Singh|2005|p=275}} and also became a fellow of the Senate{{clarify|reason=Senate of what?|date=October 2017}} in 1923.{{sfn|Mukhopadhyay|1993|p=vii}} He completed his [[Bachelor of Laws|B.L.]] in 1924.{{sfn|MK Singh|2009|p=240}}

He enrolled as an advocate in [[Calcutta High Court]] in 1924, the same year in which his father had died.{{sfn|Bakshi|1991|p=1}} Subsequently, he left for England in 1926 to study at [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was [[call to the bar|called]] to the [[English Bar]] in the same year.{{sfn|Das|2000|p=22}} In 1934, at the age of 33, he became the youngest Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta; he held the office until 1938.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=328}} During his term as Vice-Chancellor, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] delivered the University Convocation Address in Bengali for the first time, and the Indian vernacular was introduced as a subject for the highest examination.{{sfn|Sen|1970|p=225}}{{sfn|Aich|1995|p=27}}{{clarify|reason=so what?|date=October 2017}} Mukherjee received the [[D.Litt]] from Calcutta University on 26 November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caluniv.ac.in/convocation/hony_degrees.html|title=Recipients of Hony.

==Political career before independence==
Mukherjee started his political career in 1929, when he entered the [[Bengal Legislative Council]] as an [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) candidate representing Calcutta University.{{sfn|Lal|2008|p=315}} However, he resigned the next year when the INC decided to boycott the legislature. Subsequently,{{when|date=October 2017}} he contested the election as an independent candidate and was elected in the same year.{{sfn|Bakshi|1991|p=4}} In [[Indian provincial elections, 1937|1937]], he was elected as an independent candidate in the elections which brought the [[Krishak Praja Party]]-[[All India Muslim League]] coalition to power.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Harun-or-Rashid|2003|p=214}}{{sfn|Mukherjee|2015|p=60}}

He served as the Finance Minister of Bengal Province in 1941–42 under [[A.K. Fazlul Haq]]'s Progressive Coalition government which was formed on 12 December 1941 after the resignations of Muslim League ministers of the government. During his tenure, his statements against the government were censored and his movements were restricted. He was also prevented from visiting the [[Midnapore district]] in 1942 when severe floods caused a heavy loss of life and property. He resigned on 20 November 1942 accusing the British government of trying to hold on to India under any cost and criticised its repressive policies against the [[Quit India Movement]].{{efn|The Quit India Movement or the India August Movement, was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All-India Congress Committee by  Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942, during [[World War II]], demanding an end to [[British Raj|British Rule of India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/1942-quit-india-movement&lt;/ref&gt;}} After resigning, he mobilised support and organised relief with the help of [[Mahabodhi Society]], [[Ramakrishna Mission]] and Marwari Relief Society.&lt;ref name="Censorship"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDqsCQAAQBAJ |title=Censorship: A World Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|date=2001|page=1623}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|p=407}}{{sfn|Vishwanathan Sharma|2011|p=56}} In [[Indian provincial elections, 1946|1946]], he was again elected as an independent candidate from the Calcutta University.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|p=393}} He was elected as a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] in the same year.{{sfn|Urmila Sharma|SK Sharma|2001|p=381}}

===Leader of the Hindu Mahasabha===
Mukherjee joined the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] in Bengal in 1939{{sfn|Urmila Sharma|SK Sharma|2001|p=381}} and became its [[acting president]] that same year.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He was appointed as the [[Working President|working president]] of the organisation in 1940.{{sfn|Trilochan Singh|1952|p=91}} In February 1941, Mukherjee told a Hindu rally that if Muslims wanted to live in Pakistan they should "pack their bag and baggage and leave India&amp;nbsp;...  [to] wherever they like".&lt;ref name=Test&gt;Legislative Council Proceedings [BLCP], 1941, Vol. LIX, No. 6, p 216&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as the President of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha in 1943.{{sfn|Urmila Sharma|SK Sharma|2001|p=381}} He remained in this position till 1946, with Laxman Bhopatkar becoming the new President in the same year.{{sfn|Sarkar|Bhattacharya|2008|p=386}}{{sfn|Christenson|1991|p=160}}

Mukherjee demanded the partition of Bengal in 1946 to prevent the inclusion of its Hindu-majority areas in a Muslim-dominated [[East Pakistan]].{{sfn|MK Singh|2009|p=240}} A meeting held by the Mahasabha on 15 April 1947 in [[Tarakeswar]] authorised him to take steps for ensuring partition of Bengal. In May 1947, he wrote a letter to [[Lord Mountbatten]] telling him that Bengal must be partitioned even if India was not.{{sfn|Amrik Singh|2000|p=219}} He also opposed a failed bid for a [[United Bengal|united but independent Bengal]] made in 1947 by [[Sarat Bose]], the brother of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], and [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], a [[Bengali Muslims|Bengali Muslim]] politician.{{sfn|Begum|1994|p=175}}{{sfn|Chatterji|2002|p=264}} His views were strongly affected by the [[Noakhali genocide]] in [[East Bengal]], where mobs belonging to the Muslim League massacred Hindus.{{sfn|Sinha|Dasgupta|2011|pp=278–280}}

===Opposition to Quit India Movement===
Following the Hindu Mahasabha's official decision to boycott the [[Quit India movement]]{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=103–}} and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]'s decision of non-participation in the movement,{{sfn|Chandra|2008|pp=140–}}{{sfn|Andersen|Damle|1987|p=44}}{{sfn|Bandopadhyaya|2004|pp=422–}}{{sfn|Golwalkar|1974|p=}}{{sfn|Puniyani|2005|pp=134–}}{{sfn|Islam|2006a|pp=187–}}{{citekill|date=October 2017}} Mukherjee wrote a letter to [[John Herbert (Conservative politician)|Sir John Herbert]], [[List of governors of Bengal#Governors, 1912–47|Governor of Bengal]] as to how they should respond to "Quit India" movement. In this letter, dated 26 July 1942 he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me now refer to the situation that may be created in the province as a result of any widespread movement launched by the Congress. Anybody, who during the war, plans to stir up mass feeling, resulting internal disturbances or insecurity, must be resisted by any Government that may function for the time being{{sfn|Mookherjee|2000|p=179}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mukherjee in this letter reiterated that the Fazlul Haq-led Bengal Government, along with its alliance partner Hindu Mahasabha would make every possible effort to defeat the [[Quit India Movement]] in the province of Bengal and made a concrete proposal in regard to this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question is how to combat this movement (Quit India) in Bengal? The administration of the province should be carried on in such a manner that in spite of the best efforts of the Congress, this movement will fail to take root in the province. It should be possible for us, especially responsible Ministers, to be able to tell the public that the freedom for which the Congress has started the movement, already belongs to the representatives of the people. In some spheres it might be limited during the emergency. Indians have to trust the British, not for the sake for Britain, not for any advantage that the British might gain, but for the maintenance of the defense and freedom of the province itself. You, as Governor, will function as the constitutional head of the province and will be guided entirely on the advice of your Minister.{{sfn|Noorani|2000|pp=56–57}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Indian historian [[R.C. Majumdar]] noted this fact and states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shyam Prasad ended the letter with a discussion of the mass movement organised by the Congress. He expressed the apprehension that the movement would create internal disorder and will endanger internal security during the war by exciting popular feeling and he opined that any government in power has to suppress it, but that according to him could not be done only by persecution&amp;nbsp;... In that letter he mentioned item-wise the steps to be taken for dealing with the situation&amp;nbsp;...{{sfn|Majumdar|1978|p=179}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Mukherjee's resignation speech, however, he characterised the policies of the British government towards the movement as "repressive".{{sfn|Hashmi|1994|p=221}}&lt;ref name="Censorship"/&gt;

Santhanam]], [[Satya Narayan Sinha]] and B. V. Keskar.]]
Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] inducted Mukherjee into the Interim Central Government as a [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Minister for Industry and Supply]] on 15 August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Council of Ministers, 1947–2004: names and portfolios of the members of the Union Council of Ministers, from 15 August 1947 to 25 May 2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|date=2004|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukherjee began to have differences with Mahasabha after the [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi]], in which the organisation was blamed by [[Sardar Patel]] for creating the atmosphere that led to the killing. Mukherjee suggested the organisation suspend its political activities. Shortly after it did, in December 1948, he left. One of his reasons was the rejection of his proposal to allow non-Hindus to become members.{{sfn|Urmila Sharma|SK Sharma|2001|p=381}}{{sfn|Kedar Nath Kumar|1990|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Islam|2006b|p=227}}Mukherjee resigned along with [[Kshitish Chandra Neogy|K.C. Neogy]] from the Cabinet on 8 April 1950 over a disagreement about the [[Liaquat–Nehru Pact|1950 Delhi Pact]] with Pakistani Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]].

Mukherjee was firmly against their joint pact to establish minority commissions and guarantee minority rights in both countries as he thought it left Hindus in East Bengal to the mercy of Pakistan. While addressing a rally in Calcutta on 21 May, he stated that an exchange of population and property at governmental level on regional basis between East Bengal and [[States and union territories of India|the states]] of [[Tripura]], [[Assam]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Bihar]] was the only option in the current situation.{{sfn|Kedar Nath Kumar|1990|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Das|2000|p=143}}{{sfn|Roy|2007|p=227}}

After consultation with [[M. S. Golwalkar]] of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), Mukherjee founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh on 21 October 1951 in Delhi,&lt;ref name=ht0902&gt;{{citation |title=Shyama Prasad Mukherjee |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/shyama-prasad-mukherjee/story-J6ST2hkuXUhOAXI3eZJDVK.html |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=9 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming its first president. In the 1952 elections, the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]] (BJS) won three seats in the [[Parliament of India]], including Mukherjee's. He had formed the National Democratic Party within the Parliament. It consisted of 32 [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|members]] of the Lok Sabha and 10 [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|members]] of the [[Rajya Sabha]]; however, it was not recognised by the speaker as an opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/919608/Bharatiya-Jana-Sangh |title=Bharatiya Jana Sangh (Indian political organization) – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJS was created with the objective of [[nation-building]] and "nationalising" all non-Hindus by "inculcating [[Bharatiya]] Culture" in them. The party was ideologically close to the RSS and widely considered the proponent of [[Hindu nationalism]].{{sfn|Dossani|Rowen|2005|p=191}}

==Opinion on special status of Jammu and Kashmir==
Mukherjee was strongly opposed to [[Article 370]], seeing it as a threat to national unity. He fought against it inside and outside the parliament with one of the goals of Bharatiya Jana Sangh being its abrogation. He raised his voice strongly against the provision in his Lok Sabha speech on 26 June 1952.&lt;ref name=ht0902/&gt; He termed the arrangements under the article as [[Balkanization]] of India and the three-nation theory of [[Sheikh Abdullah]].{{sfn|Ram|1983|p=115}}{{sfn|Kedar Nath Kumar|1990|pp=78–79}} The state was granted its own flag along with a prime minister whose permission was required for anyone to enter the state. In opposition to this, Mukherjee once said ''"Ek desh mein do Vidhan, do Pradhan aur Do Nishan nahi chalenge"'' (A single country can't have two [[Constitution of India|constitutions]], two [[Prime Minister of India|prime ministers]], and two [[National Emblem of India|national emblems]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/a-tribute-to-mookerjee/
|title=A tribute to Mookerjee|publisher=Daily Excelsior|date=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bharatiya Jana Sangh along with Hindu Mahasabha and [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] launched a massive Satyagraha to get the provisions removed.{{sfn|Ram|1983|p=115}}{{sfn|Yoga Raj Sharma|2003|p=152}} In his letter to Nehru dated 3 February 1953, he wrote that the issue of accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India should not be allowed to hang fire.&lt;ref name=ht0902/&gt;{{clarify|reason=do we mean "delayed"?|date=October 2017}}

Mukherjee went to visit Kashmir in 1953 and observed a hunger strike to protest the law that prohibited Indian citizens from settling within the state and mandating that they carry ID cards.{{sfn|MK Singh|2009|p=240}} Mukherjee wanted to go to Jammu and Kashmir but, because of the prevailing permit system, he was not given permission. He was arrested on 11 May at [[Lakhenpur]] while crossing the border into Kashmir illegally.{{sfn|Chander|2000|p=234}}{{sfn|Kadian|2000|p=120}} Although the ID card rule was revoked owing to his efforts, he died as a detainee on 23 June 1953 under mysterious circumstances.{{sfn|Bakshi|1991|p=274}}&lt;ref name=ht0902/&gt;

==Personal life==
Shyama Prasad had three brothers who were: Rama Prasad who was born in 1896, Uma Prasad who was born in 1902 and Rama Prasad Mukherjee who was born in 1906. Rama Prasad became a judge in [[High Court of Calcutta]] while Uma became famed as a trekker and a travel writer. He also had three sisters who were: Kamala who was born in 1895, Amala who was born in 1905 and Ramala in 1908.{{sfn|Roy|2014|p=11}} He was married to Sudha Devi for 11 years and had five children – the last one, a four-month-old son, died from [[diphtheria]]. His wife died of [[double pneumonia]] shortly afterwards in 1933 or 1934.{{sfn|Roy|2014|p=34}}{{sfn|Basu|1995|p=16}}{{sfn|Baxter|1969|p=63}} Shyama Prasad refused to remarry after her death.{{sfn|Raj Kumar|2014|p=173}} He had two sons, Anutosh and Debatosh, and two daughters, Sabita and Arati.{{sfn|Das|2000|p=20}} His grandniece [[Kamala Sinha]] served as the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Minister of State for External affairs]] in the [[I. K. Gujral ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/former-mos-for-external-affairs-kamala-sinha-passes-away-115010100744_1.html | title = Former MoS for External Affairs Kamala Sinha passes away | first = Rita |last=Basu | publisher = [[Business Standard]] | date = 1 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shyama Prasad was also affiliated with the Buddhist [[Mahabodhi Society]]. In 1942, he succeeded Dr. M.N. Mukherjee to become the president of the organisation. The relics of [[Gautam Buddha]]'s two disciples [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana]], discovered in the Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]] by Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] in 1851 and kept at the [[British Museum]], were brought back to India by [[HMIS Tir]]. A ceremony attended by politicians and leaders of many foreign countries was held on the next day at [[Maidan (Kolkata)|Calcutta Maidan]]. They were handed over by Nehru to Mukherjee, who later took these relics to [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[French Indochina|Vietnam]]. Upon his return to India, he placed the relics inside the Sanchi Stupa in November 1952.{{sfn|Vishwanathan Sharma|2011|p=56}}{{sfn|Ahir|1991|p=135}}{{sfn|Narendra Kr Singh|1996|pp=1405–1407}}

==Death==
Mukherjee was arrested upon entering Kashmir on 11 May 1953.{{sfn|Bhave|1995|p=49}} He and two of his arrested companions were first taken to Central Jail of [[Srinagar]]. Later they were transferred to a [[cottage]] outside the city. Mukherjee's condition started deteriorating and he started feeling pain in the back and high temperature on the night between 19 and 20 June. He was diagnosed with dry [[pleurisy]] from which he had also suffered in 1937 and 1944. The doctor Ali Mohammad prescribed him a [[streptomycin]] injection and powders, however Mukherjee informed him that his family physician had told him that streptomycin did not suit his system. The doctor however told him that new information about the drug had come to light and assured him that he would be fine. On 22 June, he felt pain in the heart region, started perspiring and started feeling like he was fainting. He was later shifted to a hospital and provisionally diagnosed with a [[heart attack]]. He died a day later under mysterious circumstances.{{sfn|Smith|2015|p=87}}{{sfn|Bakshi|1991|pp=278–306}}{{sfn|Chander|2000|pp=22, 23, 33, 39–42, 117}} The state government declared that he had died on 23 June at 3:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. due to a heart attack.{{sfn|Chakrabarty|Roy|1974|p=227}}{{sfn|Chander|2000|p=118}}{{sfn|Das|2000|p=212}}

His death in custody raised wide suspicion across the country and demands for an independent enquiry were raised, including earnest requests from his mother, Jogamaya Devi, to Nehru. The prime minister declared that he had asked a number of persons who were privy to the facts and, according to him, there was no mystery behind Mukherjee's death. Devi did not accept Nehru's reply and requested an impartial enquiry. Nehru, however, ignored the letter and no enquiry commission was set up. Mukherjee's death therefore remains a matter of some controversy.&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2009/mar/27guest-column-tarun-vijay-on-dynasty-and-the-varun-effect.htm|title=Family legacy and the Varun effect|work=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one nurse, Rajdulari Tiku, was present by his side in the hospital. According to her, when Mukherjee started crying in agony for a doctor, she fetched Dr. Jagannath Zutshi. The doctor found him in a grave condition and called Dr. Ali. Mukherjee's condition kept deteriorating and he died at 2:25&amp;nbsp;a.m.{{sfn|Chander|2000|p=67}}{{sfn|Bakshi|1991|pp=332, 333}}{{clarify|reason=we say 0340 above|date=October 2017}}

S.C. Das claims that Mukherjee was murdered.{{sfn|Das|2000|p=211}} [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] claimed in 2004 that the arrest of Mukherjee in Jammu and Kashmir was a "Nehru conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-07-07/india/27144866_1_nehru-j-k-conspiracy |title=Nehru conspiracy led to Syama Prasad's death: Atal |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 July 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Reynolds''' (27 January 1818 – 25 February 1875) was the fifth [[Premier of South Australia]], serving from 9 May 1860 to 8 October 1861.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;

Reynolds was born in England in 1818, and on leaving school had experience in the [[grocery]] business. He came to [[South Australia]] in 1840 as an early colonist at the invitation of his brother, who had a [[draper]]'s shop at [[Adelaide]]. The brother had died by the time Thomas Reynolds arrived and he soon opened a grocer's shop, was successful for a time, but like many others fell into financial difficulties when the [[gold rush]] began.

Reynolds became an [[alderman]] in the [[Adelaide City Council]] in 1854, succeeding [[William Paxton (Australian businessman)|William Paxton]], but a few months afterwards resigned to enter the unicameral [[South Australian Legislative Council]]. In 1857 he was elected for [[electoral district of Sturt (South Australia)|Sturt]] in the first [[South Australian House of Assembly]], a seat he held until 12 March 1860.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; From September 1857 to June 1858 he was commissioner of public works in the [[Richard Hanson (Australian politician)|Hanson]] ministry.  On 13 March 1860, Reynolds changed seats to [[Electoral district of City of Adelaide|City of Adelaide]] and on 9 May 1860 he became Premier and [[Treasurer of South Australia]].&lt;ref name=parl&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://www2.parliament.sa.gov.au/formermembers/Detail.aspx?pid=4232
 |title=Hon Thomas Reynolds
 |publisher=Parliament of South Australia
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds resigned as premier and treasurer on 8 October 1861.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; He was treasurer in the second [[George Waterhouse (politician)|Waterhouse]] ministry from 17 October 1861 to 19 February 1862, and in the second [[Francis Dutton|Dutton]] ministry from March to September 1865.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; He held the same position in the fourth and fifth [[Henry Ayers|Ayers]] ministries from May 1867 to September 1868 and from October to November 1868. He was commissioner of crown lands in the seventh Ayers ministry from March 1872 to July 1873.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; Reynolds represented [[Electoral district of East Adelaide|East Adelaide]] from 5 November 1864 to 27 March 1870 and [[Electoral district of Encounter Bay|Encounter Bay]] from 14 December 1871 to 2 February 1872 and 29 February 1872 to 28 August 1873.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;

Some years earlier his interest in the [[Northern Territory]] had been stimulated by reports from his nephew, [[Frederick Henry Litchfield]].  Early in 1873 he visited [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] where there was a gold-rush, and found matters completely disorganized. Many of the official staff had not only taken up claims but had been allowed leave of absence to look after their mines. Reynolds did his best to restore order and returned to Adelaide where he reported favourably on the mineral resources of the north. Not finding himself in agreement with his colleagues in the ministry he retired from parliament and went to Darwin. He was not successful there, and was returning to Adelaide on the [[SS Gothenburg]] which was wrecked in a [[tropical cyclone]] near the [[Great Barrier Reef]] on 24 February 1875, and he was drowned. He was married to Anne Litchfield, who lost her life in the same shipwreck. He was survived by two sons.

Long associated with the [[Temperance movement|total abstinence (temperance)]] movement in Adelaide, Reynolds was known as "Teapot Tommy". Reynolds was a shrewd business man, a hard worker, and a good treasurer, but was of too sanguine and fiery a temperament to be a politician of the first rank. He was a pioneer in [[jam]]-making and [[raisin]]-curing in South Australia, but his devotion to his parliamentary duties led sometimes to the neglect of his own financial interests.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Twitch Plays ''Pokémon''}}
[[File:Twitch plays pokemon animated.gif|thumb|Commands identified by the [[game engine]] shown on-screen (right of image) are applied to the [[player character]] in ''[[Pokémon Red]]'' (left)]]
'''Twitch Plays ''Pokémon''''' ('''TPP''')  is a [[social experiment]] and channel on the [[video game live streaming]] website [[Twitch (website)|Twitch]], consisting of a [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] attempt to play [[Game Freak]]'s and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video games]] by parsing commands sent by users through the channel's [[chat room]]. It holds the ''[[Guinness World Record]]'' for having "the most participants on a single-player online videogame" with 1,165,140.&lt;ref name=record/&gt;

The concept was developed by an anonymous Australian programmer and launched on 12 February 2014, starting with the game ''[[Pokémon Red]]''. The stream became unexpectedly popular, reaching an average concurrent viewership of over 80,000 viewers (with at least 10% participating). On 1 March 2014, the game was completed after more than 16 continuous days of gameplay; Twitch estimated that over 1.16 million people participated, with peak simultaneous participation at 121,000, and with a total of 55 million views during the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/03/twitch-prevails-at-pokemon/ | title = Victory! The Thundershock Heard Around the World | author = Chase | publisher = [[Twitch (website)|Twitch]] | date = 1 March 2014 | accessdate= 1 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2014, Twitch Plays ''Pokémon'' received a [[The Game Awards|Game Award]] in the "Best Fan Creation" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegameawards.com/nominees/ |title=The Game Awards Nominees 2014 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114024126/http://thegameawards.com/nominees/ |archivedate=14 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was met with attention by media outlets and staff members of Twitch for its interactivity, its erratic and chaotic nature, the unique challenges faced by players due to the mechanics of its system, and the community and [[Internet meme|memes]] developed by participants. Following the completion of ''Red'', the broadcaster continued the channel with many other games in the ''Pokémon'' series along with unofficial [[ROM hacking|ROM hacks]]. The broadcaster has plans to continue with other ''Pokémon'' games as long as there remains interest in the channel. The success of the experiment led to a number of similar Twitch-based streams for other games, and led Twitch to promote more streams with similar interactivity with watchers.

== Premise ==
Inspired by another Twitch-based interactive game, ''Salty Bet'' (a website where users could wager on the outcome of randomized ''[[M.U.G.E.N.]]'' matches)&lt;ref name="ars-tpp"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-bizarre-mind-numbing-mesmerizing-beauty-of-twitch-plays-pokemon/ | title=The bizarre, mind-numbing, mesmerizing beauty of "Twitch Plays Pokémon" | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described as a [[social experiment]], the system used by the stream was coded by an anonymous Australian programmer, colloquially known as the "Streamer", consisting of an [[IRC bot]] written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and the [[Game Boy]] [[Video game emulator|emulator]] [[VisualBoyAdvance]]. The script captures specific messages (directional commands, "B", "A", "select", and "start") sent into the stream's chat room by users, and sends them to the emulator as button input, thus controlling the game. An additional web app coded using [[JavaScript]] is used to display a live tally of moves that are shown within the stream. The Streamer chose ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' for the project, citing nostalgia for the early games,&lt;ref name=cnet-theydidit/&gt; the fact that "Even when played very poorly it is difficult not to make progress in ''Pokémon''",&lt;ref name="beat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/02/20/twitch-plays-pokemon-but-can-twitch-beat-pokemon/ | title=Twitch Plays Pokemon, but can Twitch beat Pokemon? | publisher=AOL | work=Joystiq | date=20 February 2014 | accessdate=25 March 2014 | author=Xav de Matos}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because its current control structure "[wouldn't] work with any genre that isn't a [[History of Eastern role-playing video games#Japanese computer RPGs|JRPG]]", particularly targeting its "forgiving" turn-based structure and lack of reaction-based gameplay, compensating for the large amount of [[input lag]] between the game and the stream. The Streamer used an [[ROM hacking|edited]] version of the game, which claims to make all the original 151 Pokémon accessible, in hopes of making completion of the [[Pokédex]] a possibility. However, the edited version used was unfinished and has no gameplay differences when compared to the original game.&lt;ref name=cnet-theydidit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/02/19/twitch-plays-pokemon-a-wild-experiment-in-crowd-sourced-gameplay/?__lsa=e52a-6474 | title=Twitch Plays Pokémon a wild experiment in crowd sourced gameplay | publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] | work=Financial Post | last=O'Mara | first=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M0D3Rn|title=An interview with the creator of TwitchPlaysPokémon!|url=http://badatvideogames.net/2014/02/16/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-twitchplayspokemon/|work=BADatVIDEOGAMES|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228233606/http://badatvideogames.net/2014/02/16/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-twitchplayspokemon/|archivedate=28 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gs-tpp80k"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-60k-people-watching-twitch-play-pokemon-update/1100-6417762/ | title=Over 60k people watching Twitch play Pokémon [UPDATE] | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-tpp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/14/5411790/twitch-plays-pokemon-creator-interview-twitchplayspokemon | title=How Twitch is crowd-sourcing an amazing Pokémon multiplayer game | publisher=Vox Media | work=Polygon | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=polygon-65million/&gt;

The erratic nature of the control scheme has made the game longer and harder to play than under normal circumstances;  an ''[[Ars Technica]]'' writer commented that "([[Red (Pokémon)#Player characters|Red]]) gets stuck in corners. He walks in circles, compulsively checking his Pokédex and saving over and over again. Commands stream in from the chat channel faster than the game can possibly process them, making progress difficult-to-impossible even without the lag factor or the 'help' of gleeful trolls." Recurring difficulties have occurred with areas of the game involving mazes and ledges (areas with the latter taking as long as several hours to navigate due to users intentionally sending "down" commands to jump off the ledges), the accidental release of several Pokémon (including an incident referred to as "Bloody Sunday," where a total of twelve Pokémon were accidentally released whilst trying to manipulate the character's party),&lt;ref name="gz-bloodysunday"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamezone.com/originals/2014/02/25/bloody-sunday-in-kanto-this-weekend-in-twitch-plays-pokemon | title=Bloody Sunday in Kanto—This weekend in Twitch Plays Pokemon | publisher=GameZone Online | work=GameZone | accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and users repeatedly sending "start" commands to open the pause menu, often followed by opening the character's inventory to select random items.&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku-miraculous"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/the-miraculous-progress-of-twitch-plays-pokemon-1524605696 | title=The Miraculous Progress of 'Twitch Plays Pokémon' | publisher=Gawker Media | work=Kotaku | accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-tpp&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitch Plays Pokémon is 'like watching a car crash in slow motion'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/twitch-plays-pokmon-the-largest-massively-multiplayer-pokmon-game-is-beautiful-chaos-9133732.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system to throttle inputs on the Start button was added to mitigate this particular effect.&lt;ref name=polygon-beatable/&gt;

Despite the seemingly erratic process of playing the game, players have attempted to collaborate and strategize through various means, including infographics and a [[user script]] which hides command messages from the chat window to allow conversation. This was necessary for the players to progress as several areas of the game require coordinated actions to gain Pokémon with a specific skill needed to clear obstacles in Red's way, and earlier attempts without such coordination resulted in missing out on specific opportunities early on in the playthrough. In essence, the majority of players have attempted to counteract [[Internet troll|trolls]] trying to impede progress.&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku-miraculous/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku-progress"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/how-people-are-actually-making-progress-in-twitch-play-1525261786 | title=How Players Actually Make Progress in 'Twitch Plays Pokémon' | publisher=Gawker Media | work=Kotaku | accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A computer program was even created to automatically identify these trolls.&lt;ref name="HAQUE2014"&gt;A. Haque. "[http://albert.cm/dl/twitch_paper.pdf Unsupervised Context-Aware Anomaly Detection for Identifying Trolls in Streaming Data]," ''Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Streamer has since collaborated with others to continue preparing tools for the games for the Twitch channel. This group had added live commentary on the games as they were played. As a result of intra-group hostility from some of the collaborates, the Streamer will step down from his role as lead for Twitch Plays Pokemon on November 22, 2017, and give control to another collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/twitch-plays-pokemon-s-creator-says-he-is-stepping-down-1820486151 | title = Twitch Plays Pokémon’s Creator Says He Is Stepping Down Following Alleged Doxing | first = Gita | last = Jackson | date = November 15, 2017 | accessdate = November 15, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progression and further games ==
On 18 February 2014, after encountering major difficulties with a puzzle in the [[Team Rocket]] hideout, a new mechanic was introduced in an effort to make the game easier to play. Initially, all movements became subject to a vote: all inputs received over a period of time (usually 30 seconds) were tallied, and the winning command would be executed at the end of that time. Users could also append their movements with numbers to specify the length of the motion, such as "right3" to mean three consecutive "right" inputs. Many people were outraged over this new system and protest broke out in the Twitch chat, many of them using the command "start9" (which would open and close the pause menu nine times to slow down progress) to fight the system. The broadcaster later reworked the mechanic so that users could vote to switch between two modes: "Anarchy", the previous default, and this new mode "Democracy."&lt;ref name=nouse&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nouse.co.uk/2014/02/27/twitch-plays-pokemon/| title=Twitch Plays Pokémon | author=Niall Whitehead | date=27 February 2014 | publisher=Nouse }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soul&gt;{{cite web | title='Twitch Plays Pokemon' is now a fight for the soul of the Internet | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/twitch-plays-pokemon-is-now-a-fight-for-the-soul-of-the-internet/ | author=Nick Statt | date=21 February 2014 | publisher=CBS Interactive |work=CNET | accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a change to Democracy mode requires a [[supermajority]] vote, while a change to Anarchy mode requires only a majority vote, as indicated by an on-screen meter. This change was considered divisive by players, who believed that Democracy mode conflicted with the original concept of the stream and eliminated the potential for randomness which had helped to drive the elaborate narrative and mythology that had built up around the playthrough.&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet-theydidit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57619740-93/twitch-plays-pokemon-conquers-elite-four-beating-game-after-390-hours/ | title=Twitch Plays Pokemon conquers Elite Four, beating game after 390 hours | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=CNET | accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-beatable"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/20/5428398/twitch-plays-pokemon-democracy-vs-anarchy | title=Twitch Plays Pokémon creator tweaks channel to make game more 'beatable' | publisher=Vox Media | work=Polygon | accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soul/&gt;&lt;ref name=joystiq-democracy/&gt;&lt;ref name="mashable-religion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mashable.com/2014/02/19/pokemon-stream-twitch/ | title=How a Week-Long Game of Pokémon Became a War of Religion | work=[[Mashable]] | accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of ''Pokémon Red'', a new game began on 2 March 2014, this time with the second generation game ''Pokémon Crystal''.&lt;ref name="gs-crystal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitch-plays-pokemon-crystal-after-beating-pokemon-red/1100-6418045/ | title=Twitch Plays Pokemon Crystal after beating Pokemon Red | publisher=CBS Interactive | work=GameSpot | accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer set a deadline for the completion of ''Crystal'' with the plan to start ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]'' on a fixed date, though the players were able to complete ''Crystal'' well before this point.&lt;ref name="polygon continue"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/25/5506594/twitch-plays-pokemon | title=Twitch Plays Pokemon will continue as long as it has an active following | publisher=Vox Media | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=25 March 2014 | last=Farokhmanesh | first=Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the change to ''Crystal'' also came a change to the voting system; the Democracy mode was automatically activated at the top of each hour.&lt;ref name="ign-crystal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/03/03/twitch-plays-pokemon-starts-pokemon-crystal | title=Twitch Plays Pokemon Starts Pokemon Crystal | publisher=IGN Entertainment | work=IGN.com | accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 14 March 2014, players had reached a major battle on Mt. Silver against Red, a trainer representing the player-character from ''Red'' and ''Blue''; however, the game was also modified so that Red's team would consist of the same Pokémon that were used to beat the Elite Four in the Twitch Plays ''Pokémon'' playthrough of ''Pokémon Red'' earlier.&lt;ref name="kotaku-redreturn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/lord-helix-makes-a-most-unexpected-return-in-twitch-pl-1543901152 | title=Lord Helix Makes A Most Unexpected Return In 'Twitch Plays Pokémon' | publisher=Gawker Media | work=Kotaku | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer stated that he intentionally changed the game data of ''Crystal'' to behave in this way, as it was Game Freak's original intent when creating the game that the player would face Red in ''Crystal'' using the Pokémon they had finished ''Red'' with.&lt;ref name="polygon continue"/&gt; ''Crystal'' was beaten on 15 March, with more than 13 days of playtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/03/15/twitch-plays-pok-233-mon-defeat-crystal-countdown-timer-starts-for-emerald.aspx  | title = Twitch Plays Pokémon Defeats Crystal, Countdown Timer Starts For Emerald | first =  Kyle | last = Hillard | date = 15 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 March 2014 | work = [[Game Informer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emerald"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/132889-Twitch-Plays-Pokemon-Interview-TPP-Will-Continue-on-to-Emerald |title=Twitch Plays Pokemon Interview: TPP Will Continue on to Emerald |last=Bogos |first=Steven |work=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer stated that even though fewer viewers watched ''Pokémon Crystal'' compared to ''Pokémon Red'', he will continue the stream with other ''Pokémon'' games as long as there remains interest in the experiment.&lt;ref name="polygon continue"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://venturebeat.com/2014/03/01/twitch-plays-pokemon-to-continue-with-second-gen-game-tomorrow-will-keep-going-as-long-as-people-care/ | title = Twitch Plays Pokémon continues with second-gen game—will keep going as long as people care | first = Jeffrey | last = Grubb | date = 1 March 2014 | accessdate = 2 March 2014 | publisher = [[VentureBeat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon Emerald'' was started on 21 March 2014. With the shift to ''Emerald,'' the Democracy mode was initially disabled entirely.&lt;ref name=escapist-emeraldbegin&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitch Plays Pokemon Starts Pokemon Emerald, Plays as a Girl|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/133159-Twitch-Plays-Pokemon-Starts-Pokemon-Emerald-Plays-as-a-Girl|work=The Escapist|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Emerald'' was repeatedly restarted due to its [[soft reset]] ability, but was later fixed by the broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Dean|url=http://www.justpushstart.com/2014/03/twitch-plays-pokemon-starts-anew-hoenn-region/|title=Twitch Plays Pokemon Starts Anew In The Hoenn Region|publisher=JustPushStart|date=22 March 2014|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift to ''[[Pokémon X]]''—the 1st installment in the franchise for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], brought changes to the stream's setup. As there was no PC-based emulator for the 3DS at the time, the stream was conducted on actual 3DS hardware using a hardware modification known as the 3DS Streaming Console with External Control Interface (3xtDS); developed by Reddit user dekuNukem, also known as Twitch_plays_3ds (who has also designed an automated rig for "chaining" and detecting [[Shiny Pokémon|"shiny" Pokémon]]),&lt;ref name=vox-shinyfinder&gt;{{cite web|title=Modder creates Pokemon X and Y shiny-finding machine|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/5/5069912/pokemon-x-y-shiny-pokemon-finder|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mod allows direct control of inputs on the device via an [[USB]]-based interface, and added the video output required for [[video capture|capturing]] the screens' content. The change to native hardware also allowed the stream to use the [[Wi-Fi]] capabilities of the device; other players of ''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'' could directly interact with the stream's player via [[Nintendo Network]] and the game's internet-enabled features, such as online battles, [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon trades|trades]], and O-Powers.&lt;ref name=polygon-twitchxy&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitch Plays Pokémon starting ''Pokémon X'' on July 27 thanks to modded 3DS|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/25/5937763/twitch-plays-pokemon-x-modded-3ds|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its release, ''[[Pokémon Omega Ruby]]'' was also played in the stream.&lt;ref name=polygon-twitchomegaruby&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitch Plays Pokémon is returning for Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/23/7047589/twitch-plays-pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In honour of the one-year anniversary of the original run, a new playing of ''Pokémon Red'' began in February 2015.

To celebrate the project's fourth anniversary, the channel started a new playthrough of both ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Pokémon Blue'' simultaneously. Players in the Twitch channel can specify which game their command is for, but otherwise commands are issues alternating between the two games, and when the game's democratic mode is on, the command voted on is used in both games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/four-years-later-twitch-is-playing-pokemon-red-and-blu-1822961614 | title = Four Years Later, Twitch Is Playing Pokémon Red and Blue At Once | first = Patricia | last = Hernandez | date = 13 February 2018 | accessdate = 13 February 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viewership ==
{{Update|section|date=September 2014}}
Launched on 12 February 2014 as a "[[proof of concept]]", the stream was relatively inactive for the first day and a half of playing.&lt;ref name=beat/&gt; However, the stream quickly went [[Viral video|viral]] after that, reaching a total viewership of around 175,000 by 14 February (when players managed to beat the first of eight [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon gyms|Gym leaders]]).&lt;ref name=hive-mind&gt;{{cite web | title=The hive mind at work: Twitch Plays Pokemon | url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/features/the-hive-mind-at-work-twitch-plays-pokemon-499384 | author=Gopal Sathe | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited | accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 17 February, the channel had reached over 6.5&amp;nbsp;million total views. By 20 February, the channel had over 17&amp;nbsp;million total views, and was averaging concurrent viewership between 60 and 70&amp;nbsp;thousand viewers with at least 10% participating.

It's overwhelming how popular it has become."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

An active community of players also emerged on communities and social networks such as [[Reddit]], which have [[liveblog]]ged the proceedings and developed [[Internet meme|memes]] and other works around occurrences in the game. One item in Red's inventory from the start of the game was the Helix Fossil, which was used later in the game to revive [[Omanyte]], but is otherwise functionless. The Helix Fossil was selected so frequently that it became an [[inside joke]] among players, and at times humorously calling it a [[deity]] which the player-character was constantly consulting for advice, and it quickly became the players' "religion". Players went as far as treating the fossil as a symbol representing a [[sect]] which supports Anarchy mode, while treating its counterpart, the Dome Fossil (which revives [[Kabuto (Pokémon)|Kabuto]]), as a deity to those who support Democracy mode.&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku-miraculous/&gt;&lt;ref name=mashable-religion/&gt;&lt;ref name="recode-anarchy"/&gt; Fans even published "bibles" for the Helix religion.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Michael, [https://www.thebookpatch.com/BookStore/the-helix-bible/d9bdbd3a-52cf-44b1-9d4f-00901e9243ea The Helix Bible] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/audreydijeau/docs/the_book_of_helix_kanto_and_johto The Book of Helix]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Pokémon captured by Red during the gameplay have also gained fan followings. Two Pokémon that were obtained early in the game, and then later accidentally released were the [[Charmeleon]] and [[Rattata]], "ABBBBBBK("&lt;!-- Yes, that parenthesis is supposed to be there. Note: There is no space between K and (; Pokémon has a monospace font; and the parenthesis hangs on the right half of the character, which creates a gap, making people believe there is a space. --&gt; and "JLVWNNOOOO", further nicknamed "Abby" and "[[Jay Leno]]".&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku-miraculous/&gt; The team's [[Pidgeot]], one of the highest level Pokémon in the group and often successful in battles, was named "Bird Jesus" by the community; concurrently, the team's [[Zapdos]] was nicknamed "AA-j" but referred to as "Archangel of Justice" or "Anarchy Bird".&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku-miraculous/&gt;&lt;ref name=escapist-crystalbeaten/&gt; Their [[Flareon]] was dubbed the "False Prophet", as players had accidentally obtained it instead of [[Vaporeon]], which was needed so they could teach it the "Surf" move needed to travel on water, and it had later caused the release of the Charmeleon and Rattata.&lt;ref name="joystiq-recap"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/02/22/twitch-plays-pokemon-its-history-highlights-and-bird-jesus/ | title=Twitch Plays Pokemon: Its history, highlights and Bird Jesus | publisher=AOL | work=Joystiq | accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the eleventh day of the event (23 February), which fell on a Sunday, the players inadvertently released a dozen of the captured Pokémon, effectively deleting the creatures from the game, an event that later became known as "Bloody Sunday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/article/praise-helix-strange-hilarious-mythology-crowdsour-202017 | title=Praise Helix: The strange mythology of a crowdsourced Pokémon game | work=[[The A.V.

== Reception ==
Media outlets have described the proceedings of the game as being "mesmerizing," "miraculous," and "beautiful chaos," with one viewer comparing it to "watching a car crash in slow motion."&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku-miraculous/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-tpp/&gt; [[Ars Technica]] felt that it encapsulated "the best and worst qualities of our user-driven, novelty-hungry age," providing hours of arguable time-wasting entertainment through a word-of-mouth viral distribution.&lt;ref name=ars-tpp/&gt; The stream has been compared to the [[infinite monkey theorem]] in that effectively random input to a game still ultimately comes out with forward progress in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/02/16/twitch-plays-pokemon-wasted-our-entire-weekend-was-it-worth-it/74496/|title=Twitch Plays Pokémon Wasted Our Entire Weekend; Was It Worth It?|first=Nikola|last=Suprak|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=[[Hardcore Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamersyndrome.com/2014/news/twitch-plays-pokemon-infinite-mankey-theorem-follows-suit/|title=Twitch Plays Pokémon: Infinite Mankey Theorem Follows Suit|first=Pashford|last=Murano|date=18 February 2014|accessdate=18 February 2014|publisher=[[Gamersyndrome]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223035301/http://gamersyndrome.com/2014/news/twitch-plays-pokemon-infinite-mankey-theorem-follows-suit/|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitch vice president of marketing Matthew DiPietro praised the stream, considering it "one more example of how video games have become a platform for entertainment and creativity that extends WAY beyond the original intent of the game creator. By merging a video game, live video and a participatory experience, the broadcaster has created an entertainment hybrid custom made for the Twitch community. This is a wonderful proof on concept that we hope to see more of in the future."&lt;ref name=gs-tpp80k/&gt;

From ''Platinum'' to ''Black 2'', the stream showed a second game, ''Pokémon Stadium 2'', alongside the main game. Unlike other games, inputs for Stadium 2 were chosen at random and were not controlled by the chat. Instead, players on the chat were given virtual currency that could be used to place bets on the outcome of Stadium 2 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/05/05/twitch-plays-pokemon-gambles-with-pokemon-stadium-2/|title=Twitch Plays Pokemon gambles with Pokemon Stadium 2|publisher=Joystiq|author= Mike Suszek|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Pokémon X'' concluded on 1 August 2014, a similar system was implemented, with ''Pokémon Battle Revolution'' taking the place of Stadium 2, as it added more features such as better graphics. This time, instead of inputs being entirely random, players who bet on the current match could vote on which move would be used by their team each turn; the system would randomly choose one of the bettors' choices, but players who had placed higher bets had a higher chance of their move being chosen.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The developer has created a modded version of ''Pokémon Battle Revolution'' known as ''Pokémon Battle Revolution 2.0''. It is meant to fix glitches and add various improvements such as additional battle arenas.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} During the interim, the stream showed ''[[Harvest Moon GB]]'', ''[[Pokkén Tournament]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Robopon Sun]]'', and save states of the first four runs in reverse order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44212">There are many '''types of artificial neural networks''' ('''ANN''').

[[Artificial neural network]]s are [[computational model]]s inspired by [[biological neural network]]s, and are used to [[Universal approximation theorem|approximate]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] that are generally unknown. Particularly, they are inspired by the behaviour of [[neuron]]s and the electrical signals they convey between input (such as from the eyes or nerve endings in the hand), processing, and output from the brain (such as reacting to light, touch, or heat). The way neurons semantically communicate is an area of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/06/040616064016.htm University Of Southern California. (2004, June 16).

ScienceDaily] Quote: "...McCormick said future investigations and models of neuronal operation in the brain will need to take into account the mixed analog-digital nature of communication. Only with a thorough understanding of this mixed mode of signal transmission will a truly in depth understanding of the brain and its disorders be achieved, he said..."&lt;/ref&gt; Most artificial neural networks bear only some resemblance to their more complex biological counterparts, but are very effective at their intended tasks (e.g. classification or segmentation).

Some artificial neural networks are [[adaptive system]]s and are used for example to [[population model|model populations]] and environments, which constantly change.

Neural networks can be hardware- (neurons are represented by physical components) or [[Neural network software|software-based]] (computer models), and can use a variety of topologies and learning algorithms.

==Feedforward ==

{{Main|Feedforward neural network}}

The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type. In this network the information moves only from the input layer directly through any hidden layers to the output layer without cycles/loops. Feedforward networks can be constructed with various types of units, such as binary [[McCulloch-Pitts neuron]]s, the simplest of which is the [[perceptron]]. Continuous neurons, frequently with sigmoidal activation, are used in the context of [[backpropagation]].

=== Autoencoder ===
{{Main|Autoencoder}}
An autoencoder, autoassociator or Diabolo network&lt;ref name="bengio"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2009|title=Learning Deep Architectures for AI|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf|journal=Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning|volume=2|pages=1–127|doi=10.1561/2200000006|pmc=|pmid=|last1=Bengio|first1=Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} is similar to the [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP) – with an input layer, an output layer and one or more hidden layers connecting them. However, the output layer has the same number of units as the input layer. Its purpose is to reconstruct its own inputs (instead of emitting a target value). Therefore, autoencoders are [[unsupervised learning]] models. An autoencoder is used for [[unsupervised learning]] of [[Feature learning|efficient codings]],&lt;ref&gt;Modeling word perception using the Elman network, Liou, C.-Y., Huang, J.-C. and Yang, W.-C., Neurocomputing, Volume 71, 3150–3157 (2008), {{doi|10.1016/j.neucom.2008.04.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Autoencoder for Words, Liou, C.-Y., Cheng, C.-W., Liou, J.-W., and Liou, D.-R., Neurocomputing, Volume 139, 84–96 (2014), {{doi|10.1016/j.neucom.2013.09.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically for the purpose of [[dimensionality reduction]] and for learning [[generative model]]s of data.&lt;ref name="VAE"&gt;Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes, Kingma, D.P. and Welling, M., ArXiv e-prints, 2013 {{url|https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gan_faces"&gt;Generating Faces with Torch, Boesen A., Larsen L. and Sonderby S.K., 2015 {{url|http://torch.ch/blog/2015/11/13/gan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic ===
{{Main|Probabilistic neural network}}
A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a four-layer feedforward neural network. The layers are Input, hidden, pattern/summation and output. In the PNN algorithm, the parent probability distribution function (PDF) of each class is approximated by a [[Kernel density estimation|Parzen window]] and a  non-parametric function. Then, using PDF of each class, the class probability of a new input is estimated and Bayes’ rule is employed to allocate it to the class with the highest posterior probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312519997_Competitive_probabilistic_neural_network|title=Competitive probabilistic neural network (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the [[Bayesian network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herselfsai.com/2007/03/probabilistic-neural-networks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218121158/http://herselfsai.com/2007/03/probabilistic-neural-networks.html |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a statistical algorithm called [[Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~vincent/research/presentations/PNN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131053940/http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~vincent/research/presentations/PNN.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for classification and pattern recognition.

=== Time delay ===
{{Main|Time delay neural network}}
A time delay neural network (TDNN)  is a feedforward architecture for sequential data that recognizes features independent of sequence position. In order to achieve time-shift invariance, delays are added to the input so that multiple data points (points in time) are analyzed together.

It usually forms part of a larger pattern recognition system. It has been implemented using a [[perceptron]] network whose connection weights were trained with back propagation (supervised learning).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/UserManual/node176.html TDNN Fundamentals], Kapitel aus dem Online Handbuch des [[SNNS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convolutional ===
{{Main|Convolutional neural network}}
In a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet or shift invariant or space invariant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Wei|date=1988|title=Shift-invariant pattern recognition neural network and its optical architecture|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B65v6Wo67Tk5Zm03Tm1kaEdIYkE/view?usp=sharing|journal=Proceedings of annual conference of the Japan Society of Applied Physics|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Wei|date=1990|title=Parallel distributed processing model with local space-invariant interconnections and its optical architecture|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B65v6Wo67Tk5ODRzZmhSR29VeDg/view?usp=sharing|journal=Applied Optics|volume=29|issue=32|doi=10.1364/ao.29.004790|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the unit connectivity pattern is inspired by the organization of the visual cortex. Units respond to stimuli in a restricted region of space known as the receptive field.  Receptive fields partially overlap, over-covering the entire [[visual field]].  Unit response can be approximated mathematically by a [[convolution]] operation.&lt;ref name="deeplearning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html|title=Convolutional Neural Networks (LeNet) – DeepLearning 0.1 documentation|publisher=LISA Lab|work=DeepLearning 0.1|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are variations of [[multilayer perceptron]]s that use minimal [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]].&lt;ref name="LeCun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/|title=LeNet-5, convolutional neural networks|last=LeCun|first=Yann|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have wide applications in [[Computer vision|image and video recognition]], [[recommender system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5004-deep-content-based-music-recommendation.pdf|title=Deep content-based music recommendation|last=van den Oord|first=Aaron|last2=Dieleman|first2=Sander|last3=Schrauwen|first3=Benjamin|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Curran Associates, Inc.|editor-last=Burges|editor-first=C.

Regulatory feedback networks started as a model to explain brain phenomena found during recognition including network-wide [[bursting]] and [[Visual search|difficulty with similarity]] found universally in sensory recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tsvi Achler|title=Neural Phenomena Focus|date=2016-02-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gTJorBeLi8|accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach can also perform mathematically equivalent classification as feedforward methods and is used as a tool to create and modify networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/no-i-wont-fix-your-computer/two-duck-rabbit-paradigm-shift-anomalies-in-physics-and-one-maybe-in-machine-learning-86e6e1fbdcd7#.bd5ongugu|title=Two Duck-Rabbit Paradigm-Shift Anomalies in Physics and One (maybe) in Machine Learning|last=fernandez|first=ed|date=2016-02-09|website=Medium|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tsvi Achler|title=Technical Video for Optimizing Mind|date=2016-04-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4aoQUxqlZg|accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radial basis function (RBF) ==
{{Main|Radial basis function network}}Radial basis functions are functions that have a distance criterion with respect to a center. Radial basis functions have been applied as a replacement for the sigmoidal hidden layer transfer characteristic in multi-layer perceptrons. RBF networks have two layers: In the first, input is mapped onto each RBF in the 'hidden' layer. The RBF chosen is usually a Gaussian. In regression problems the output layer is a linear combination of hidden layer values representing mean predicted output. The interpretation of this output layer value is the same as a [[regression analysis|regression model]] in statistics. In classification problems the output layer is typically a [[sigmoid function]] of a linear combination of hidden layer values, representing a posterior probability. Performance in both cases is often improved by shrinkage techniques, known as [[ridge regression]] in classical statistics. This corresponds to a prior belief in small parameter values (and therefore smooth output functions) in a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] framework.

RBF networks have the advantage of avoiding local minima in the same way as multi-layer perceptrons. This is because the only parameters that are adjusted in the learning process are the linear mapping from hidden layer to output layer. Linearity ensures that the error surface is quadratic and therefore has a single easily found minimum. In regression problems this can be found in one matrix operation. In classification problems the fixed non-linearity introduced by the sigmoid output function is most efficiently dealt with using [[iteratively re-weighted least squares]].

RBF networks have the disadvantage of requiring good coverage of the input space by radial basis functions. RBF centres are determined with reference to the distribution of the input data, but without reference to the prediction task. As a result, representational resources may be wasted on areas of the input space that are irrelevant to the task. A common solution is to associate each data point with its own centre, although this can expand the linear system to be solved in the final layer and requires shrinkage techniques to avoid [[overfitting]].

Associating each input datum with an RBF leads naturally to kernel methods such as [[support vector machine]]s (SVM) and Gaussian processes (the RBF is the [[kernel function]]). All three approaches use a non-linear kernel function to project the input data into a space where the learning problem can be solved using a linear model. Like Gaussian processes, and unlike SVMs, RBF networks are typically trained in a maximum likelihood framework by maximizing the probability (minimizing the error). SVMs avoid overfitting by maximizing instead a margin. SVMs outperform RBF networks in most classification applications. In regression applications they can be competitive when the dimensionality of the input space is relatively small.

===How RBF networks work===
RBF neural networks are conceptually similar to [[K-nearest neighbors algorithm|K-Nearest Neighbor]] (k-NN) models. The basic idea is that similar inputs produce similar outputs.

In the case in of a training set has two predictor variables, x and y and the target variable has two categories, positive and negative. Given a new case with predictor values x=6, y=5.1, how is the target variable computed?

The nearest neighbor classification performed for this example depends on how many neighboring points are considered. If 1-NN is used and the closest point is negative, then the new point should be classified as negative. Alternatively, if 9-NN classification is used and the closest 9 points are considered, then the effect of the surrounding 8 positive points may outweigh the closest 9 (negative) point.

An RBF network positions neurons in the space described by the predictor variables (x,y in this example). This space has as many dimensions as predictor variables. The Euclidean distance is computed from the new point to the center of each neuron, and a radial basis function (RBF) (also called a kernel function) is applied to the distance to compute the weight (influence) for each neuron. The radial basis function is so named because the radius distance is the argument to the function.

''Weight'' = RBF(''distance'')

====Radial Basis Function====

The value for the new point is found by summing the output values of the RBF functions multiplied by weights computed for each neuron.

The radial basis function for a neuron has a center and a radius (also called a spread). The radius may be different for each neuron, and, in RBF networks generated by DTREG, the radius may be different in each dimension.

With larger spread, neurons at a distance from a point have a greater influence.

====Architecture====

RBF networks have three layers:

* '''Input layer:''' One neuron appears in the input layer for each predictor variable. In the case of [[categorical variable]]s, N-1 neurons are used where N is the number of categories. The input neurons standardizes the value ranges by subtracting the [[median]] and dividing by the [[Interquartile range|interquartile]] range. The input neurons then feed the values to each of the neurons in the hidden layer.
* '''Hidden layer:''' This layer has a variable number of neurons (determined by the training process). Each neuron consists of a radial basis function centered on a point with as many dimensions as predictor variables. The spread (radius) of the RBF function may be different for each dimension. The centers and spreads are determined by training. When presented with the x vector of input values from the input layer, a hidden neuron computes the Euclidean distance of the test case from the neuron’s center point and then applies the RBF kernel function to this distance using the spread values. The resulting value is passed to the summation layer.
* '''Summation layer:''' The value coming out of a neuron in the hidden layer is multiplied by a weight associated with the neuron and adds to the weighted values of other neurons. This sum becomes the output. For classification problems, one output is produced (with a separate set of weights and summation unit) for each target category. The value output for a category is the probability that the case being evaluated has that category.

====Training ====

The following parameters are determined by the training process:

* The number of neurons in the hidden layer
* The coordinates of the center of each hidden-layer RBF function
* The radius (spread) of each RBF function in each dimension
* The weights applied to the RBF function outputs as they pass to the summation layer

Various methods have been used to train RBF networks. One approach first uses [[K-means clustering]] to find cluster centers which are then used as the centers for the RBF functions. However, K-means clustering is computationally intensive and it often does not generate the optimal number of centers. Another approach is to use a random subset of the training points as the centers.

DTREG uses a training algorithm that uses an evolutionary approach to determine the optimal center points and spreads for each neuron. It determines when to stop adding neurons to the network by monitoring the estimated leave-one-out (LOO) error and terminating when the LOO error begins to increase because of overfitting.

The computation of the optimal weights between the neurons in the hidden layer and the summation layer is done using ridge regression. An iterative procedure computes the optimal regularization Lambda parameter that minimizes the generalized cross-validation (GCV) error.

=== General Regression Neural Network ([[General regression neural network|GRNN]]) ===
GRNN is an associative memory neural network which is similar to the [[probabilistic neural network]] but it is used for regression and approximation not classification.

==Recurrent neural network==
{{Main|Recurrent neural network}}
[[Recurrent neural network]]s (RNN) propagate data forward, but also backwards, from later processing stages to earlier stages. RNN can be used as general sequence processors.

===Fully recurrent ===
This architecture was developed in the 1980s. Its network creates a directed connection between every pair of units. Each has a time-varying, real-valued (more than just zero or one) activation (output). Each connection has a modifiable real-valued weight. Some of the nodes are called labeled nodes, some output nodes, the rest hidden nodes.

For [[supervised learning]] in discrete time settings, training sequences of real-valued input vectors become sequences of activations of the input nodes, one input vector at a time. At each time step, each non-input unit computes its current activation as a nonlinear function of the weighted sum of the activations of all units from which it receives connections. The system can explicitly activate (independent of incoming signals) some output units at certain time steps. For example, if the input sequence is a speech signal corresponding to a spoken digit, the final target output at the end of the sequence may be a label classifying the digit. For each sequence, its error is the sum of the deviations of all activations computed by the network from the corresponding target signals. For a training set of numerous sequences, the total error is the sum of the errors of all individual sequences.

To minimize total error, [[gradient descent]] can be used to change each weight in proportion to its derivative with respect to the error, provided the non-linear activation functions are [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]. The standard method is called "[[backpropagation through time]]" or BPTT, a generalization of back-propagation for feedforward networks.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Werbos.

In [[reinforcement learning]] settings, no teacher provides target signals. Instead a [[fitness function]] or [[reward function]] or [[utility function]] is occasionally used to evaluate performance, which influences its input stream through output units connected to actuators that affect the environment. Variants of [[evolutionary computation]] are often used to optimize the weight matrix.

====Hopfield ====
{{main|Hopfield network}}

The [[Hopfield network]] (like similar attractor-based networks) is of historic interest although it is not a general RNN, as it is not designed to process sequences of patterns. Instead it requires stationary inputs. It is an RNN in which all connections are symmetric. It guarantees that it will converge. If the connections are trained using [[Hebbian learning]] the Hopfield network can perform as robust [[content-addressable memory]], resistant to connection alteration.

====Boltzmann machine====
{{main|Boltzmann machine}}
The [[Boltzmann machine]] can be thought of as a noisy Hopfield network. It is one of the first neural networks to demonstrate learning of latent variables (hidden units). Boltzmann machine learning was at first slow to simulate, but the contrastive divergence algorithm speeds up training for Boltzmann machines and [[Product of Experts|Products of Experts]].

====Self-organizing map====

{{main|Self-organizing map}}

The self-organizing map (SOM) uses [[unsupervised learning]]. A set of neurons learn to map points in an input space to coordinates in an output space. The input space can have different dimensions and topology from the output space, and SOM attempts to preserve these.

====Learning vector quantization====

{{main|Learning vector quantization}}

[[Learning vector quantization]] (LVQ) can be interpreted as a neural network architecture. Prototypical representatives of the classes parameterize, together with an appropriate distance measure, in a distance-based classification scheme.

===Simple recurrent ===
Simple recurrent networks have three layers, with the addition of a set of "context units" in the input layer. These units connect from the hidden layer or the output layer with a fixed weight of one.&lt;ref&gt;Neural Networks as Cybernetic Systems 2nd and revised edition, Holk Cruse
[http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/615/bmm615.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; At each time step, the input is propagated in a standard feedforward fashion, and then a backpropagation-like learning rule is applied (not performing [[gradient descent]]). The fixed back connections leave a copy of the previous values of the hidden units in the context units (since they propagate over the connections before the learning rule is applied).

===Echo state ===
{{main|Echo state network}}

The [[echo state network]] (ESN) is a [[recurrent neural network]] with a sparsely connected random hidden layer. The weights of output neurons are the only part of the network that can change (be trained). ESN are good at reproducing certain time series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = H. | last2 = Harnessing | first2 =  | year = 2004 | title = Predicting chaotic systems and saving energy in wireless communication | url = | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = | pages = 78–80 | doi=10.1126/science.1091277}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant for spiking neurons is known as [[liquid state machines]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Maass, T. Natschläger, and H. Markram. A fresh look at real-time computation in generic recurrent neural circuits.

===Long short-term memory ===
{{main|Long short-term memory}}

The [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM)&lt;ref name="lstm" /&gt; has no [[vanishing gradient problem]]. It works even when with long delays, and it can handle signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components. LSTM RNN outperformed other RNN and other sequence learning methods such as [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]] in applications such as language learning&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Gers and J. Schmidhuber. LSTM recurrent networks learn simple context free and
context sensitive languages ''IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks'' 12(6):1333–1340, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and connected handwriting recognition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Graves, J. Schmidhuber. Offline Handwriting Recognition with Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 22, NIPS'22, p 545-552, Vancouver, MIT Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bi-directional ===
Bi-directional RNN, or BRNN, use a finite sequence to predict or label each element of the sequence based on both the past and the future context of the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schuster | first1 = Mike | last2 = Paliwal | first2 = Kuldip K. | year = 1997 | title = Bidirectional recurrent neural networks | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 2673–2681 | doi=10.1109/78.650093}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by adding the outputs of two RNN: one processing the sequence from left to right, the other one from right to left. The combined outputs are the predictions of the teacher-given target signals. This technique proved to be especially useful when combined with LSTM RNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graves | first1 = A. | last2 = Schmidhuber | first2 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Framewise phoneme classification with bidirectional LSTM and other neural network architectures | url = | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 602–610 | doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2005.06.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchical ===
Hierarchical RNN connects elements in various ways to decompose hierarchical behavior into useful subprograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. | year = 1992 | title = Learning complex, extended sequences using the principle of history compression | url = | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 234–242 | doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.2.234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdc.brain.riken.go.jp/~rpaine/PaineTaniSAB2004_h.pdf Dynamic Representation of Movement Primitives in an Evolved Recurrent Neural Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stochastic ===
{{main|Stochastic neural network}}

A stochastic neural network introduces random variations into the network. Such random variations can be viewed as a form of [[statistical sampling]], such as [[Monte Carlo sampling]].

=== Genetic Scale RNN ===
A RNN (often a LSTM) where a series is decomposed into a number of scales where every scale informs the primary length between two consecutive points. A first order scale consists of a normal RNN, a second order consists of all points separated by two indices and so on. The Nth order RNN connects the first and last node. The outputs from all the various scales are treated as a Committee of Machines and the associated scores are used genetically for the next iteration.

==Modular ==
{{main|Modular neural network}}
Biological studies have shown that the human brain operates as a collection of small networks. This realization gave birth to the concept of [[modular neural networks]], in which several small networks cooperate or compete to solve problems.

===Committee of machines===
{{main|Committee machine}}

A committee of machines (CoM) is a collection of different neural networks that together "vote" on a given example. This generally gives a much better result than individual networks. Because neural networks suffer from local minima, starting with the same architecture and training but using randomly different initial weights often gives vastly different results.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} A CoM tends to stabilize the result.

The CoM is similar to the general [[machine learning]] ''[[bootstrap Aggregating|bagging]]'' method, except that the necessary variety of machines in the committee is obtained by training from different starting weights rather than training on different randomly selected subsets of the training data.

===Associative ===
The associative neural network (ASNN) is an extension of committee of machines that combines multiple feedforward neural networks and the k-nearest neighbor technique. It uses the correlation between ensemble responses as a measure of distance amid the analyzed cases for the kNN. This corrects the bias of the neural network ensemble. An associative neural network has a memory that can coincide with the training set. If new data become available, the network instantly improves its predictive ability and provides data approximation (self-learns) without retraining. Another important feature of ASNN is the possibility to interpret neural network results by analysis of correlations between data cases in the space of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vcclab.org/lab/asnn|title=Associative Neural Network|website=www.vcclab.org|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical ==
{{Main|Physical neural network}}
A physical neural network includes electrically adjustable resistance material to simulate artificial synapses. Examples include the [[ADALINE]] [[memristor]]-based neural network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-l-yim2lNRUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=adaline+smithsonian+widrow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k56zCTw0Ah&amp;sig=6lR7UKfSUnTHTCvMJrs8Z8FXr1o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=af0ZUJaNJuThiwKp8oHgBw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=adaline%20smithsonian%20widrow&amp;f=false|title=Talking Nets: An Oral History of Neural Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; An&amp;nbsp;[[optical neural network]]&amp;nbsp;is a physical implementation of an&amp;nbsp;[[artificial neural network]]&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;[[Photonics|optical components]].

==Other types==

===Instantaneously trained ===

[[Instantaneously trained neural networks]] (ITNN) were inspired by the phenomenon of short-term learning that seems to occur instantaneously. In these networks the weights of the hidden and the output layers are mapped directly from the training vector data. Ordinarily, they work on binary data, but versions for continuous data that require small additional processing exist.

===Spiking ===

[[Spiking neural network]]s (SNN) explicitly consider the timing of inputs. The network input and output are usually represented as a series of spikes (delta function or more complex shapes). SNN can process information in the [[time domain]] (signals that vary over time). They are often implemented as recurrent networks. SNN are also a form of [[pulse computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/SPNM.html|title=Spiking Neuron Models:  Single Neurons, Populations, Plasticity|last=Gerstner|first=|last2=Kistler|date=|website=icwww.epfl.ch|access-date=2017-06-18}} Freely available online textbook&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiking neural networks with axonal conduction delays exhibit polychronization, and hence could have a very large memory capacity.&lt;ref name="pmid16378515"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Izhikevich EM |title=Polychronization: computation with spikes |journal=Neural Computation |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=245–82 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16378515 |doi=10.1162/089976606775093882 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNN and the temporal correlations of neural assemblies in such networks—have been used to model figure/ground separation and region linking in the visual system.

=== Regulatory feedback ===
A regulatory feedback network makes inferences using [[negative feedback]].&lt;ref name="shedding2"&gt;Achler T., Omar C., Amir E., "Shedding Weights: More With Less", IEEE Proc. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   The feedback is used to find the optimal activation of units. It is most similar to a [[Non-parametric methods|non-parametric method]] but is different from K-nearest neighbor in that it mathematically emulates feedforward networks.

=== Neocognitron ===
The [[neocognitron]] is a hierarchical, multilayered network that was modeled after the [[visual cortex]]. It uses multiple types of units, (originally two, called [[Simple cell|simple]] and [[Complex cell|complex]] cells), as a cascading model for use in pattern recognition tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YrxWojxUA4C&amp;pg=PA106|title=Brain and visual perception: the story of a 25-year collaboration|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-517618-6|page=106|author=David H.

== Dynamic ==
Dynamic neural networks address nonlinear multivariate behaviour and include (learning of) time-dependent behaviour, such as transient phenomena and delay effects. Techniques to estimate a system process from observed data fall under the general category of system identification.

===Cascading ===

Cascade correlation is an architecture and [[supervised learning]] [[algorithm]]. Instead of just adjusting the weights in a network of fixed topology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahlman|first1=Scott E.|last2=Lebiere|first2=Christian|title=The Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture|url=http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/fahlman.pdf|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]|accessdate=4 October 2014|date=August 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cascade-Correlation begins with a minimal network, then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit has been added to the network, its input-side weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network, available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detectors. The Cascade-Correlation architecture has several advantages: It learns quickly, determines its own size and topology, retains the structures it has built even if the training set changes and requires no [[back-propagation|backpropagation]].

===Neuro-fuzzy ===

A neuro-fuzzy network is a [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] [[inference system]] in the body of an artificial neural network. Depending on the FIS type, several layers simulate the processes involved in a fuzzy inference-like fuzzification, inference, aggregation and defuzzification. Embedding an FIS in a general structure of an ANN has the benefit of using available ANN training methods to find the parameters of a fuzzy system.

===Compositional pattern-producing ===
{{Main|Compositional pattern-producing network}}
Compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs) are a variation of artificial neural networks which differ in their set of [[activation function]]s and how they are applied. While typical artificial neural networks often contain only [[sigmoid function]]s (and sometimes [[Gaussian function]]s), CPPNs can include both types of functions and many others. Furthermore, unlike typical artificial neural networks, CPPNs are applied across the entire space of possible inputs so that they can represent a complete image. Since they are compositions of functions, CPPNs in effect encode images at infinite resolution and can be sampled for a particular display at whatever resolution is optimal.

== Memory networks ==

===One-shot associative memory===

This type of network can add new patterns without re-training. It is done by creating a specific memory structure, which assigns each new pattern to an orthogonal plane using adjacently connected hierarchical arrays.&lt;ref&gt;B.B. Nasution, A.I. Khan, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4359217 A Hierarchical Graph Neuron Scheme for Real-Time Pattern Recognition], IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol 19(2), 212-229, Feb. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The network offers real-time pattern recognition and high scalability; this requires parallel processing and is thus best suited for platforms such as [[wireless sensor network]]s, [[grid computing]], and [[GPGPU]]s.

===Hierarchical temporal memory===
{{main|Hierarchical temporal memory}}

Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) models some of the structural and [[algorithm]]ic properties of the [[neocortex]]. HTM is a [[bionics|biomimetic]] model based on [[memory-prediction framework|memory-prediction]] theory. HTM is a method for discovering and inferring the high-level causes of observed input patterns and sequences, thus building an increasingly complex model of the world.

HTM combines existing ideas to mimic the neocortex with a simple design that provides many capabilities. HTM combines and extends approaches used in [[Bayesian networks]], spatial and temporal clustering algorithms, while using a tree-shaped hierarchy of nodes that is common in [[neural networks]].

=== Holographic associative memory ===
{{Main|Holographic associative memory}}
Holographic Associative Memory (HAM) is an analog, correlation-based, associative, stimulus-response system. Information is mapped onto the phase orientation of complex numbers. The memory is effective for [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] tasks, generalization and pattern recognition with changeable attention. Dynamic search localization is central to biological memory. In visual perception, humans focus on specific objects in a pattern. Humans can change focus from object to object without learning. HAM can mimic this ability by creating explicit representations for focus. It uses a bi-modal representation of pattern and a hologram-like complex spherical weight state-space. HAMs are useful for optical realization because the underlying hyper-spherical computations can be implemented with optical computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=John G.|date=1 January 1990|title=A holographic model of memory, learning and expression|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0129065790000163|journal=International Journal of Neural Systems|publisher=|volume=01|issue=03|pages=259–267|doi=10.1142/S0129065790000163|via=worldscientific.com (Atypon)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1689">'''Urine-indicator dye''' is a substance which is supposed to be able to react with urine to form a colored cloud in a [[swimming pool]], thus indicating the location of people who are urinating while they are in the pool.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/science/poolpiss.asp | title=Piscine of the Crime | publisher=Snopes | date=December 14, 2000 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 | author=Mikkelson, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report from the [[National Swimming Pool Foundation]] called this "the most common pool myth of all time", with nearly half of Americans surveyed by researchers believing that the dye existed.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/pee-chlorine-red-eyes-swimming-pools-cdc-1.3127865 | title=Pee, not chlorine, causes red eyes from swimming pools: CDC | publisher=CBC News | date=25 June 2015 | accessdate=26 June 2015 | author=O'Neil, Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors of this chemical's existence go back at least as far as 1958,&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; and the story is commonly told to children by parents who do not wish them to urinate in the pool.&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt; A 1985 biography of [[Orson Welles]] describes him using such a dye as part of a prank in 1937,&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; and references to the substance can be found through popular culture over quite a lengthy time period. However, such a dye does not exist, and although a chemical could be manufactured that would react with urine, it would be difficult to prevent it from reacting to other organic substances present in pool water.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;
