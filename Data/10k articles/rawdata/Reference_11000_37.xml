The '''Arena Football Hall of Fame''' is the official Hall of Fame of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL). The inaugural class was announced in 1998 and the Hall was not formally organized until 2011. Prior to 2011, there were four classes: 1998&amp;ndash;2000 and then another in 2002. The Arena Football Hall of Fame is the highest honor for players, coaches, and contributors involved in the AFL. The voting process consists of fans and current Hall of Fame members voting on the finalists. The finalists are selected by the League Office in which they collect ballots from the Arena Football Hall of Fame Advisory Board, a group which consisted of former players, executives, journalists and media personnel with a long-time involvement in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/071415aad.html | title=Hall of Fame Voting Officially Opens | publisher=Arena Football | date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/060514aad.html | title=Arena Football Hall of Fame Advisory Board Announced | publisher=arenafootball.com | date=June 5, 2014 | accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
In order to be nominated for the Arena Football Hall of Fame, a candidate must meet at least one of four criteria (as of 2015, depending upon whether he is being considered as a player, a coach, or a contributor).  A player who has played after the 1989 season must have played a minimum of three seasons. A player must be retired for a minimum of three full seasons. A coach must have been active for a minimum of five seasons but does not need to be retired. There is no minimum number of seasons required for contributors but rather contribution to the significant advancement of the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/071415aad.html |publisher=Arena Football League |title=Hall of Fame Voting Officially Opens |date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gxXmUHTA?url=http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/071415aad.html |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
There is currently no physical location for the Arena Football Hall of Fame. Unlike the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], which recognizes the greats not only of the NFL but the history of other outdoor pro football leagues, there is not a museum associated with Arena Football, but there is, however, within the Pro Football Hall of Fame a relatively small exhibit that features the history of the Arena Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=2785610 |publisher=ESPN |title=Hall of Fame features exhibit on Arena Football League |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gxXwgbPH?url=http://espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=2785610 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony and Hall of Fame Game==
Much like the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Arena Football League has a weekend dedicated to the inductees and during a selected Hall of Fame Game the inductees will partake in a Hall of Fame ceremony. This ceremony takes place prior to the game and will feature highlights as well as speeches from each of the inductees; each of the Hall of Fame Games are aired on [[CBS Sports Network]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabaystorm.com/news/detail/hydrive-arena-football-hall-of-fame-weekend-set-to-kick-off-friday |publisher=Tampa Bay Storm |title=HYDRIVE Arena Football Hall of Fame Weekend Set to Kick Off Friday |date=April 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gxY5ybBG?url=http://www.tampabaystorm.com/news/detail/hydrive-arena-football-hall-of-fame-weekend-set-to-kick-off-friday |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro Football Hall of Fame==
[[Joe DeLamielleure]] was the first [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductee to ever play with an Arena Football Team; as an apparent [[publicity stunt]], he played two games for the [[Charlotte Rage]] in the [[1992 Arena Football League season|1992 season]], seven years after he had retired from professional football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/2014/12/11/1992-1996-charlotte-rage/ | title=1992-1996 Charlotte Rage | website=Funwhileitlasted.com | accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Warner]], who played three seasons with the [[Iowa Barnstormers]] from 1995 to 1997 and was inducted into the Arena Football Hall of Fame in 2011, is the first player with substantial arena football experience to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as well as the first to be inducted into both halls. Warner was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">'''Colley Matrix''' is a computer-generated [[sports rating system]] designed by Dr. Wes Colley. 
 
The site is one of more than 40 polls, rankings, and formulas recognized by the [[NCAA]] in its list of national champion major selections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/from-the-sports-editor/os-sp-ucf-national-champions-colley-matrix-0109-story.html "National champions: UCF Knights finish season ranked No. 1 in Colley Matrix"] ''Orlando Sentinel''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Mountain West Conference]] moved away from using the poll, along with three others, to determine the host site for its conference championship game in football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/aztecs/sd-sp-mountain-west-football-championship-host-procedure-0724-story.html "Mountain West announces new host procedure for conference football championship game"] ''San Diego Union-Tribune''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
In this initial paper at [[Princeton University]], Colley states, "The method is based on very simple statistical principles, and uses only Div. I-A wins and losses as input — margin of victory does not matter. The scheme adjusts effectively for strength of schedule, in a
way that is free of bias toward conference, tradition, or region."&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleyrankings.com/matrate.pdf "Colley’s Bias Free College Football Ranking Method: The Colley Matrix Explained"] ColleyRankings.com. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Colley claims that his method is bias-free for estimating the ranking of a team given a particular schedule. The resulting values for each team are identified as a ranking, thus being a realization of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]’s [[Rule of Succession]].

In a 2018 study released in the journal ''Science Advances'', the ratings system finished third for highest accuracy of ranking synthetic data sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/7/eaar8260 "A physical model for efficient ranking in networks"] ''Science Advances''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BCS Rankings==
The Colley Matrix was one of the computer rankings used during [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) system of determining national championship game participants from 2001-2014. Added in 2001, The Peter Wolfe and Wes Colley/''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' computer rankings were used in place of the ''NYT'' and Dunkel rankings. The change was made because the BCS wanted computer rankings that did not depend heavily on margin of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/0712/1225482.html |title=BCS formula still subject of debate |publisher=ESPN.com |date=September 16, 2002 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018201242/http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/0712/1225482.html |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The methodology of the rankings have been questioned by others on the grounds of subjectivity and specifics of the statistical math.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jellyjuke.com/the-problem-with-rpi-elo-and-the-colley-matrix.html "The problem with RPI, Elo, and the Colley Matrix"] ''Jelly Juke''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://squared2020.com/2017/11/04/statistics-of-colleys-ranking-methodology/ "Statistics of Colley’s Ranking Methodology"] ''Squared Statistics''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In the final BCS rankings of 2010, LSU was incorrectly ranked ahead of Boise State, at No. 10 instead of No. 11. The error was a result of Colley failing to input the Appalachian State/Western Illinois [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] playoff game correctly, a mistake that affected an order that helped determine bowl pairings that season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/college-football/2018/07/11/bcs-computer-rankings-polls-formula-sagarin-billingsley "The Computer Poll Uprising: Creators of the BCS's Most Controversial Component Look Back"] ''Sports Illustrated''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 2012 season, the Colley Matrix ranked Notre Dame as first and Alabama second despite the Crimson Tide defeating the Fighting Irish 42-14 in the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/01/11/bcs-computers-rank-notre-dame-ahead-of-alabama/1826755/ "Notre Dame is still No. 1, according to one BCS computer"] ''USA Today''. Retrieved 2018-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the 2017 season, Central Florida was ranked atop the Colley Matrix despite Alabama winning the [[College Football Playoff]]. UCF claimed a share of the national title and is listed in the NCAA stat book as the top-ranked team by the Colley Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/08/26/ncaa-rule-book-recognizes-ucfs-national-championship/ "NCAA rule book recognizes UCF’s national championship"] ''NBC Sports''.

[[WYSIWYG]] means that see the output file automatically updated during the edit. Note that some PDF viewers (e.g. evince) automatically reload the PDF document when it is updated on the disk.

A '''conflict style inventory''' is a written tool for gaining insight into how people respond to conflict.  Typically, a user answers a set of questions about their responses to conflict and is scored accordingly.

Most people develop a patterned response to conflict based on their life history and history with others. This response may fit some situations well, but may be ineffective or destructive in other circumstances. The goal is to increase people's awareness of their own patterns and bring more options and flexibility within reach. 

The most widely used conflict style inventories are based on the Mouton Blake Axis which posits five styles of conflict response (see [[Managerial Grid Model]]). These include the Jay Hall Conflict Management Survey, the [[Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument]], a standard since the 1960s, and the [[Kraybill Conflict Style Inventory]], a more recent publication that is culturally sensitive.

More extensive personality type instruments are also useful to help understand conflict style differences. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], which is based on the work of [[Carl Jung]], and the Gilmore Fraleigh instruments fall in this category.

Conflict resolution teachers and trainers, mediators, organizational consultants, and human resource managers use conflict style inventories in their work to help people reflect on and improve their responses to conflict. Awareness of styles helps people recognize that they have choices in how to respond to conflict. Since each style has a preferred way of interacting with others in conflict, style awareness also can greatly assist people in meeting the needs of those they live and work with.

[[File:Dictionary of National Biography volume 01.djvu|thumb|page=11|The title page of the first volume of the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' (1885)]]

The '''''Dictionary of National Biography''''' ('''''DNB''''') is a standard work of reference on notable figures from [[History of the British Isles|British history]], published from 1885. The updated '''''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''''' ('''''ODNB''''') was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes and online, with 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives.

==First series==
Hoping to emulate national [[biography|biographical]] collections published elsewhere in Europe, such as the ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (1875), in 1882 the publisher [[George Murray Smith|George Smith]] (1824–1901), of [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]], planned a universal dictionary that would include biographical entries on individuals from world history. He approached [[Leslie Stephen]], then editor of the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', owned by Smith, to become the editor. Stephen persuaded Smith that the work should focus only on subjects from the United Kingdom and its present and former colonies. An early working title was the ''Biographia Britannica'', the name of [[Biographia Britannica|an earlier eighteenth-century reference work]].

The first volume of the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' appeared on 1 January 1885. In May 1891 Leslie Stephen resigned and [[Sidney Lee]], Stephen's assistant editor from the beginning of the project, succeeded him as editor.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Biography |volume=3 |page=954 |last=Gosse |first=Edmund William |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}} The ''DNB'' is described in the last paragraph of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; A dedicated team of sub-editors and researchers worked under Stephen and Lee, combining a variety of talents from veteran journalists to young scholars who cut their academic teeth on dictionary articles at a time when postgraduate historical research in British universities was still in its infancy. While much of the dictionary was written in-house, the ''DNB'' also relied on external contributors, who included several respected writers and scholars of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, more than [[List of contributors to the Dictionary of National Biography|700 individuals]] had contributed to the work. Successive volumes appeared quarterly with complete punctuality until midsummer 1900, when the series closed with volume 63.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The year of publication, the editor and the range of names in each volume is given [[Dictionary of National Biography#First series contents|below]].

==Supplements and revisions==
[[File:George Smith by John Collier.jpg|right|thumb|[[George Murray Smith]] conceived of the ''DNB'', subsidised it, and saw it finally into print before he died in 1901.]]

Since the scope included only deceased figures, the ''DNB'' was soon extended by the issue of three supplementary volumes, covering subjects who had died between 1885 and 1900 or who had been overlooked in the original alphabetical sequence. The supplements brought the whole work up to the death of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 22 January 1901. Corrections were added.

After issuing a volume of errata in 1904, the dictionary was reissued with minor revisions in 22 volumes in 1908 and 1909; a subtitle said that it covered British history "from the earliest times to the year 1900". In the words of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', the dictionary had "proved of inestimable service in elucidating the private annals of the British",&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; providing not only concise lives of the notable deceased, but additionally lists of sources which were invaluable to researchers in a period when few libraries or collections of manuscripts had published catalogues or indices, and the production of indices to periodical literatures was just beginning. Throughout the twentieth century, further volumes were published for those who had died, generally on a decade-by-decade basis, beginning in 1912 with a supplement edited by Lee covering those who died between 1901 and 1911. The dictionary was transferred from its original publishers, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., to [[Oxford University Press]] in 1917. Until 1996, Oxford University Press continued to add further supplements featuring articles on subjects who had died during the twentieth century.

The supplements published between 1912 and 1996 added about 6,000 lives of people who died in the twentieth century to the 29,120 in the 63 volumes of the original ''DNB''. In 1993 a volume containing missing biographies was published. This had an additional 1,000 lives, selected from over 100,000 suggestions. This did not seek to replace any articles on existing ''DNB'' subjects, even though the original work had been written from a Victorian perspective and had become out of date due to changes in historical assessments and discoveries of new information during the twentieth century. Consequently, the dictionary was becoming less and less useful as a reference work.

In 1966, the [[University of London]] published a volume of corrections, cumulated from the ''[[Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of London]]. ''Corrections and Additions to the Dictionary of National Biography, Cumulated from the Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research Covering the Years 1923–1963''. Boston: G. K. Hall, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concise dictionary==
There were various versions of the ''[[The Concise Dictionary of National Biography|Concise Dictionary of National Biography]]'', which covered everyone in the main work but with much shorter articles; some were only two lines.  The last edition, in three volumes, covered everyone who died before 1986.

In the early 1990s [[Oxford University Press]] committed itself to overhauling the ''DNB''. Work on what was known until 2001 as the ''New Dictionary of National Biography'', or ''New DNB'', began in 1992 under the editorship of [[Colin Matthew]], professor of Modern History at the [[University of Oxford]]. Matthew decided that no subjects from the old dictionary would be excluded, however insignificant the subjects appeared to a late twentieth-century eye; that a minority of shorter articles from the original dictionary would remain in the new version in revised form, but most would be rewritten; and that room would be made for about 14,000 new subjects. Suggestions for new subjects were solicited through questionnaires placed in libraries and universities and, as the 1990s advanced, online, and assessed by the editor, the 12 external consultant editors and several hundred associate editors and in-house staff.

The new dictionary would cover British history, "broadly defined" (including, for example, subjects from [[Roman Britain]], the [[Thirteen Colonies|United States of America before its independence]], and from [[British Empire|Britain's former colonies]], provided they were functionally part of the Empire and not of "the indigenous culture", as stated in the Introduction), up to 31 December 2000. The research project was conceived as a collaborative one, with in-house staff co-ordinating the work of nearly 10,000 contributors internationally. It would remain selective&amp;nbsp;– there would be no attempt to include all [[members of parliament]], for example – but would seek to include significant, influential or notorious figures from the whole canvas of the life of Britain and its former colonies, overlaying the decisions of the late-nineteenth-century editors with the interests of late-twentieth-century scholarship in the hope that "the two epochs in collaboration might produce something more useful for the future than either epoch on its own", but acknowledging also that a final definitive selection is impossible to achieve.

Following Matthew's death in October 1999, he was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Professor [[Brian Harrison (historian)|Brian Harrison]], in January 2000.  The new dictionary, now known as the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (or ''ODNB''), was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes in print at a price of £7500, and in an online edition for subscribers. Most UK holders of a current library card can access it online free of charge. In subsequent years, the print edition has been able to be obtained new for a much lower price.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., at least one [http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=2694312245&amp;searchurl=n%3D200000169%26tn%3DOxford%2BDictionary%2Bof%2BNational%2BBiography%26x%3D64%26y%3D8 U.K. bookseller] in 2012  was asking £1738.44 (US$2842.42) including free worldwide delivery.&lt;/ref&gt;  At publication, the 2004 edition had 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives, including entries on all subjects included in the old ''DNB''. (The old ''DNB'' entries on these subjects may be accessed separately through a link to the "DNB Archive" – many of the longer entries are still highly regarded.) A small permanent staff remain in Oxford to update and extend the coverage of the online edition. Harrison was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Dr [[Lawrence Goldman]], in October 2004. The first online update was published on 4 January 2005, including subjects who had died in 2001. A further update, including subjects from all periods, followed on 23 May 2005, and another on 6 October 2005. New subjects who died in 2002 were added to the online dictionary on 5 January 2006, with continuing releases in May and October in subsequent years following the precedent of 2005. The ''ODNB'' also includes some new biographies on people who died before the ''DNB'' was published and are not included in the original ''DNB'', because they have become notable since the ''DNB'' was published through the work of more recent historians, for example [[William Eyre (leveller)|William Eyre]] (fl. 1634–1675).

The online version has an advanced search facility, allowing a search for people by area of interest, religion and "Places, Dates, Life Events". This accesses an electronic index that cannot be directly viewed.

Response to the new dictionary has been for the most part positive, but in the months following publication there was occasional criticism of the dictionary in some British newspapers and periodicals for reported factual inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stefan Collini |date= 20 January 2005 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n02/coll01_.html |title=Our Island Story |publisher=''[[London Review of Books]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Vanessa Thorpe |date=6 March 2005 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1431473,00.html |title=At £7,500 for the set, you'd think they'd get their facts right |newspaper=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of articles publicly queried in this way was small – only 23 of the 50,113 articles published in September 2004, leading to fewer than 100 substantiated factual amendments. These and other queries received since publication are being considered as part of an ongoing programme of assessing proposed corrections or additions to existing subject articles, which can, when approved, be incorporated into the online edition of the dictionary.  In 2005, The [[American Library Association]] awarded the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' its prestigious [[Dartmouth Medal]]. A general review of the dictionary was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1411984|title=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Dictionary or Encyclopaedia? |journal=[[The Historical Journal]]. 50, no. 4: 991–1006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[David Cannadine]] took over the editorship from October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://global.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/contact/press/3743987/| title =  David Cannadine is the new Editor of the Oxford DNB| date = 1 October 2014

The '''''Directorium Inquisitorum''''' is [[Nicholas Eymerich]]'s most prominent and enduring work, written in Latin and consisting of approximately 800 pages, which he had composed as early as 1376. Eymerich had written an earlier treatise on [[magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], perhaps as early as 1359, which he extensively reworked into the ''Directorium Inqusitorum'' In compiling the book, Eymerich used many of the magic texts he had previously confiscated from accused sorcerers. It can also be considered as an assessment of a century and half of official Inquisition in the "[[albigensian]]" country.

==Subject matter==
The Dominican friar Nicholas Eymerich was appointed Inquisitor General of Aragon in 1357. As he directed much of his efforts to the apparent errors of members of the clergy, he often found his investigations blocked by the court, curia, or papacy. King [[Peter IV of Aragon]] had him removed from office at the general chapter held at Perpignan in 1360.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05735c.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. "Nicolas Eymeric." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 27 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of being elected the Vicar General of the Dominicans in Aragon in 1362 however, Eymerich was again Inquisitor General. For a time King [[Peter IV of Aragon]] prevented Eymerich from serving as inquisitor. Finally in 1376 he drove him from the kingdom and Eymerich fled to the papal court of [[Pope Gregory XI]] in [[Avignon]]. There he wrote the ''Directorium Inquisitorum''. It was further amplified by Spanish canonist Francis Peña in 1578. According to Karen Sullivan, they viewed the accused "as a soul deciding for itself whether it is to be united with God or forever alienated from him.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rNtsVAgxG4EC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=nicholas+eymerich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qekp3RgIrq&amp;sig=kYuC-YPARUWjHnrJvgzdTRfLW1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZltrG0ZnLAhXDqx4KHX0EA5A4HhDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=nicholas%20eymerich&amp;f=false Sullivan, Karen. ''The Inner Lives of Medieval Inquisitors'', University of Chicago Press, 2011] {{ISBN|9780226781679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eymerich appears to have been familiar with [[Bernard Gui]]'s earlier ''Liber sententiarum'' and other inquisitorial treatises.&lt;ref name=Given/&gt; The ''Directorium Inquisitorum'' includes definitions of various types of heresies, discussion of questions of jurisdiction, and proper trial procedure.&lt;ref name=Seitz&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zWSx4FVsYxUC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=directorium+inquisitorum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS4ri87ZnLAhWFaz4KHXQlDU84FBDoAQhCMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=directorium%20inquisitorum&amp;f=false Seitz, Jonathan. ''Witchcraft and Inquisition in Early Modern Venice'', Cambridge University Press, 2011] {{ISBN|9781139501606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was used as a manual for inquisitors, and gave practical advice on how to conduct inquiries.&lt;ref name=Given&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1vefN9Fmu3YC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=directorium+inquisitorum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-2FB4_b9pa&amp;sig=3dbPa-zD2z5WXRz2sPJa04q6fCw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd1qfn55nLAhUJOz4KHXDJBE44KBDoAQgeMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=directorium%20inquisitorum&amp;f=false Given, James Buchanan. ''Inquisition and Medieval Society: Power, Discipline, and Resistance in Languedoc'', Cornell University Press, 2001] {{ISBN|9780801487590}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also described various means an accused heretic might use to dissemble, such as equivocation or the pretense of insanity.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7KU8DNdWYzcC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=directorium+inquisitorum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3ZPiN22LWN&amp;sig=ypKehwblxp0Tb5hV4F314Fwez_U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd1qfn55nLAhUJOz4KHXDJBE44KBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=directorium%20inquisitorum&amp;f=false Matrin, John. ''Venice's Hidden Enemies: Italian Heretics in a Renaissance City'', University of California Press, 1993] {{ISBN|9780520912335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witchcraft, which was a marginal issue for early inquisitors, assumed more importance in the later edition.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt; On the subject of magic, it discusses various types and techniques of divination and draws a distinction between practices deemed heretical and non-heretical.&lt;ref name=Seitz/&gt;

He quotes [[Pope Innocent V]] in saying that in order to receive aid from a demon, a person must enter into some form of [[deal with the Devil|pact]] with the demon. Eymerich then extrapolates on this postulate to demonstrate that any agreement with a demon is a heresy. Eymerich was among the first to condemn all forms of demonic conjuration as heresy. Previously, the common belief had been that even a saint might make a demonic pact as exemplified by the story of [[Theophilus of Adana|Saint Theophilus]], who made a pact with the devil to gain an ecclesiastical position.

In addition to describing common magical practices, Eymerich also described means of extracting a confession which included primitive [[psychological manipulation]] as well as outright [[torture]]. Regarding torture, Eymerich said, ''"Quaestiones sunt fallaces et inefficaces"'' meaning, "Torture is deceptive and ineffectual." However, Eymerich was the first inquisitor to get around the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s prohibition against torturing a subject twice. He interpreted the directive very liberally, permitting a separate instance of torture for a separate charge of heresy.

==Legacy==
The ''Directorium Inquisitorum'' was to become the definitive handbook of procedure for the [[Spanish Inquisition]] until into the seventeenth century. It saw numerous printings, including a run at [[Barcelona]] in 1503 and one in Rome in 1578. The ''Directorium Inquisitorum'' was one of the primary forerunners of the better known ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''.

The '''Domain Name System''' ('''DNS''') is a [[hierarchical]] decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the [[Internet]] or a private network. It associates various information with [[domain name]]s assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical [[IP address]]es needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying [[communication protocol|network protocol]]s. By providing a worldwide, distributed [[directory service]], the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating [[authoritative name server]]s for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over [[sub-domain]]s of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and [[fault tolerance|fault-tolerant]] service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.

The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the [[Database model|database]] service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]].

The Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s, the domain name hierarchy&lt;ref name=rfc1034&gt;RFC 1034, ''Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[address space]]s.&lt;ref name="rfc781"&gt;RFC 781, ''Internet Protocol - DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, J. Postel (Ed.), The Internet Society (September 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet [[name server]]s and a [[communication protocol]] implement the Domain Name System.&lt;ref name=rfc1035&gt;RFC 1035, ''Domain Names - Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority ([[SOA record|SOA]]), [[IP address]]es ([[List of DNS record types#A|A]] and [[AAAA record|AAAA]]), [[SMTP]] [[mail exchanger]]s (MX), [[name server]]s (NS), pointers for [[reverse DNS lookup]]s (PTR), and [[domain name alias]]es (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as [[DNSSEC]] records, or for human queries such as ''responsible person'' (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating [[unsolicited email]] (spam) by storing a [[real-time blackhole list]] (RBL).  The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the [[zone file]], but other database systems are common.

==Function==
An often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the [[telephone directory|phone book]] for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer [[hostname]]s into IP addresses. For example, the domain name [[example.com|www.example.com]] translates to the addresses 93.184.216.34 ([[IPv4]]) and 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 ([[IPv6]]). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators ([[URL]]s), and [[e-mail address]]es without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.

An important and ubiquitous function of DNS is its central role in distributed Internet services such as [[cloud service]]s and  [[content delivery network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Dilley, B. Maggs, J. Parikh, H. Prokop, R. Sitaraman, and B. Weihl. {{cite web | url=https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ramesh/Site/PUBLICATIONS_files/DMPPSW02.pdf| title =Globally Distributed Content Delivery, IEEE Internet Computing, September/October 2002, pp. 50-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a user accesses a distributed Internet service using a URL, the domain name of the URL is translated to the IP address of a server that is proximal to the user.  The key functionality of DNS exploited here is that different users can ''simultaneously'' receive different translations for the ''same'' domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nygren., E. |author2=Sitaraman R.

The DNS reflects the structure of administrative responsibility in the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Implementation and Specification |rfc=1035 |sectionname=SOA RDATA format |section=3.3.13 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each subdomain is a [[DNS zone|zone]] of administrative autonomy delegated to a manager. For zones operated by a [[Domain name registry|registry]], administrative information is often complemented by the registry's [[Registration Data Access Protocol|RDAP]] and [[WHOIS]] services.  That data can be used to gain insight on, and track responsibility for, a given host on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://conference.apnic.net/data/39/dns-abuse-handling-final_1425362607.pdf |title=DNS Abuse Handling |author1=Champika Wijayatunga |date=February 2015 |publisher=[[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|APNIC]] |access-date=18 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Using a simpler, more memorable name in place of a host's numerical address dates back to the [[ARPANET]] era. The Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) maintained a text file named [[hosts (file)|HOSTS.TXT]] that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET.&lt;ref name=rfc2467&gt;RFC 3467, "Role of the Domain Name System (DNS)", J.C. Klensin, J. Klensin (February 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth J. Feinler|Elizabeth Feinler]] developed the first Resource Handbook for the ARPANET which later became the ARPANET directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=112}} Feinler and her staff maintained the directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=113}} Maintenance of numerical addresses, called the Assigned Numbers List, was handled by [[Jon Postel]] at the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Annals [3B2-9] man2011030074.3d 29/7/011 11:54 Page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Addresses were assigned manually. To request a hostname and an address and add a computer to the master file, users contacted the SRI's [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (NIC), directed by Elizabeth Feinler, by telephone during business hours.&lt;ref name="internethalloffame.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internethalloffame.org/blog/2012/07/23/why-does-net-still-work-christmas-paul-mockapetris|title=Why Does the Net Still Work on Christmas?

By the early 1980s, maintaining a single, centralized host table had become slow and unwieldy and the emerging network required an automated naming system to address technical and personnel issues.  Postel directed the task of forging a compromise between five competing proposals of solutions to [[Paul Mockapetris]]. Mockapetris instead created the Domain Name System.&lt;ref name="internethalloffame.org"/&gt;

The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] published the original specifications in RFC 882 and RFC 883 in November 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2013/11/happy-30th-birthday-dns |title=Happy 30th Birthday, DNS! |author1=Andrei Robachevsky |date=26 November 2013 |publisher=[[Internet Society]] |access-date=18 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Feinler, IEEE Annals, 3B2-9 man2011030074.3d 29/7/011 11:54 Page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, four [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] students, Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle, and Songnian Zhou, wrote the first [[Unix]] name server implementation for the Berkeley Internet Name Domain, commonly referred to as [[BIND]].&lt;ref name="Terry USENIX 2004"&gt;{{cite conference

In November 1987, RFC 1034&lt;ref name="rfc1034"/&gt; and RFC 1035&lt;ref name="rfc1035"/&gt; superseded the 1983 DNS specifications. Several additional [[Request for Comments]] have proposed extensions to the core DNS protocols.&lt;ref name="rfc7719"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=DNS Terminology |rfc=7719 |author1=Paul Hoffman |author2=Andrew Sullivan |author3=Kazunori Fujiwara |year=2015 |month=December |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=18 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure {{anchor|The domain name space}}==
===Domain name space===
The domain name space consists of a [[tree data structure]]. Each node or leaf in the tree has a ''label'' and zero or more ''resource records'' (RR), which hold information associated with the domain name.  The domain name itself consists of the label, possibly concatenated with the name of its parent node on the right, separated by a dot.&lt;ref name=dnsterms&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Domain Concepts and Facilities |rfc=1034 |sectionname=Name space specifications and terminology |section=3.1 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree sub-divides into ''zones'' beginning at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]].  A [[DNS zone]] may consist of only one domain, or may consist of many domains and sub-domains, depending on the administrative choices of the zone manager.  DNS can also be partitioned according to ''class'' where the separate classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.&lt;ref name=dnsparts&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Domain Concepts and Facilities |rfc=1034 |sectionname=How the database is divided into zones |section=4.2 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Domain name space.svg|right|thumb|400px|The hierarchical Domain Name System for class ''Internet'', organized into zones, each served by a name server]]

Administrative responsibility for any zone may be divided by creating additional zones. Authority over the new zone is said to be ''delegated'' to a designated name server. The parent zone ceases to be authoritative for the new zone.&lt;ref name=dnsparts/&gt;

===Domain name syntax===
The definitive descriptions of the rules for forming domain names appear in RFC  1035, RFC 1123, and RFC 2181.
A [[domain name]] consists of one or more parts, technically called ''labels'', that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com.

The right-most label conveys the [[top-level domain]]; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain ''com''.

The hierarchy of domains descends from right to left; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or [[subdomain]] of the domain to the right. For example, the label ''example'' specifies a subdomain of the ''com'' domain, and ''www'' is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

A label may contain zero to 63 characters. The null label, of length zero, is reserved for the root zone. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation.&lt;ref name=rfc1034/&gt; In the internal binary representation of the DNS the maximum length requires 255 octets of storage, as it also stores the length of the name.&lt;ref name=rfc1035/&gt;

Although no technical limitation exists to use any character in domain name labels which are representable by an octet, hostnames use a preferred format and character set. The characters allowed in labels are a subset of the [[ASCII]] character set, consisting of characters ''a'' through ''z'', ''A'' through ''Z'', digits ''0'' through ''9'', and hyphen. This rule is known as the ''LDH rule'' (letters, digits, hyphen). Domain names are interpreted in case-independent manner.&lt;ref&gt;Network Working Group of the IETF, January 2006, RFC 4343: Domain Name System (DNS) Case Insensitivity Clarification&lt;/ref&gt; Labels may not start or end with a hyphen.&lt;ref name=rfc3696&gt;RFC 3696, ''Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names'', J. Klensin&lt;/ref&gt; An additional rule requires that top-level domain names should not be all-numeric.&lt;ref name=rfc3696 /&gt;

===Internationalized domain names===
The limited set of ASCII characters permitted in the DNS prevented the representation of names and words of many languages in their native alphabets or scripts. To make this possible, [[ICANN]] approved the [[Internationalized domain name|Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications]] (IDNA) system, by which user applications, such as web browsers, map [[Unicode]] strings into the valid DNS character set using [[Punycode]]. In 2009 ICANN approved the installation of internationalized domain name [[Country code top-level domain|country code top-level domains (''ccTLD''s)]]. In addition, many [[domain name registry|registries]] of the existing top-level domain names ([[Top-level domain|''TLD'']]s) have adopted the IDNA system.

===Name servers===
The Domain Name System is maintained by a [[distributed database]] system, which uses the [[client–server model]]. The nodes of this database are the [[name server]]s. Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the hierarchy is served by the [[root name server]]s, the servers to query when looking up (''resolving'') a TLD.

====Authoritative name server====
An ''authoritative'' name server is a name server that only gives [[Name server#Authoritative answer|answers]] to DNS queries from data that has been configured by an original source, for example, the domain administrator or by dynamic DNS methods, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another name server that only maintains a cache of data.

An authoritative name server can either be a ''master'' server or a ''slave'' server. A master server is a server that stores the original (''master'') copies of all zone records. A slave server uses a special automatic updating mechanism in the DNS protocol in communication with its master to maintain an identical copy of the master records.

Every DNS zone must be assigned a set of authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with name server (NS) records.

An authoritative server indicates its status of supplying definitive answers, deemed ''authoritative'', by setting a protocol flag, called the "''Authoritative Answer''" (''AA'') bit in its responses.&lt;ref name="rfc1035" /&gt; This flag is usually reproduced prominently in the output of DNS administration query tools, such as [[Domain Information Groper|dig]], to indicate ''that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question.''&lt;ref name="rfc1035" /&gt;

==Operation==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

===Address resolution mechanism===
Domain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label.

[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|400px|A DNS resolver that implements the iterative approach mandated by RFC 1034; in this case, the resolver consults three name servers to resolve the [[fully qualified domain name]] "www.wikipedia.org".]]

For proper operation of its domain name resolver, a network host is configured with an initial cache (''hints'') of the known addresses of the root name servers. The hints are updated periodically by an administrator by retrieving a dataset from a reliable source.

Assuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a query to one of the root servers.  In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for "www.wikipedia.org" is referred to the ''org'' servers.   The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeats this process until it receives an authoritative answer. The diagram illustrates this process for the host that is named by the [[fully qualified domain name]] "www.wikipedia.org".

This mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice [[#Record caching|caching]] is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a relatively small fraction of all requests.

====Recursive and caching name server====
In theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.

To improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (''time-to-live'') of the domain name record in question.
Typically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.

The combination of DNS caching and recursive functions in a name server is not mandatory; the functions can be implemented independently in servers for special purposes.

[[Internet service providers]]  typically provide recursive and caching name servers for their customers. In addition, many home networking routers implement DNS caches and recursors to improve efficiency in the local network.

===DNS resolvers===
The client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. DNS resolvers are classified by a variety of query methods, such as ''recursive'', ''non-recursive'', and ''iterative''. A resolution process may use a combination of these methods.&lt;ref name="rfc1034" /&gt;

In a ''non-recursive query'', a DNS resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case of a [[#Record_caching|caching DNS resolver]], the non-recursive query of its local [[Name server#Caching name server|DNS cache]] delivers a result and reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS request records for a period of time after an initial response from upstream DNS servers.

In a ''recursive query'', a DNS resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple stub resolver running on a [[home router]] typically makes a recursive query to the DNS server run by the user's [[ISP]]. A recursive query is one for which the DNS server answers the query completely by querying other name servers as needed. In typical operation, a client issues a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which subsequently issues non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver, negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to support recursive queries.

The ''iterative query'' procedure is a process in which a DNS resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server refers the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root server, then a "com" server, and finally an "example.com" server.

===Circular dependencies and glue records===
Name servers in delegations are identified by name, rather than by IP address. This means that a resolving name server must issue another DNS request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been referred. If the name given in the delegation is a subdomain of the domain for which the delegation is being provided, there is a [[circular dependency]].

In this case, the name server providing the delegation must also provide one or more IP addresses for the authoritative name server mentioned in the delegation. This information is called ''glue''.   The delegating name server provides this glue in the form of records in the ''additional section'' of the DNS response, and provides the delegation in the ''authority section'' of the response. A glue record is a combination of the name server and IP address.

For example, if the [[authoritative name server]] for example.org is ns1.example.org, a computer trying to resolve www.example.org first resolves ns1.example.org. As ns1 is contained in example.org, this requires resolving example.org first, which presents a circular dependency. To break the dependency, the name server for the [[top level domain]] org includes glue along with the delegation for example.org.  The glue records are address records that provide IP addresses for ns1.example.org. The resolver uses one or more of these IP addresses to query one of the domain's authoritative servers, which allows it to complete the DNS query.

===Record caching===
A standard practice in implementing name resolution in applications is to reduce the load on the Domain Name System servers by caching results locally, or in intermediate resolver hosts. Results obtained from a DNS request are always associated with the [[time to live]] (TTL), an expiration time after which the results must be discarded or refreshed. The TTL is set by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server. The period of validity may vary from a few seconds to days or even weeks.

As a result of this distributed caching architecture, changes to DNS records do not propagate throughout the network immediately, but require all caches to expire and to be refreshed after the TTL. RFC 1912 conveys basic rules for determining appropriate TTL values.

Some resolvers may override TTL values, as the protocol supports caching for up to sixty-eight years or no caching at all. [[Negative cache|Negative caching]], i.e. the caching of the fact of non-existence of a record, is determined by name servers authoritative for a zone which must include the [[SOA record|Start of Authority]] (SOA) record when reporting no data of the requested type exists. The value of the ''minimum'' field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the TTL for the negative answer.

===Reverse lookup===
{{Main article|Reverse DNS lookup}}
A reverse lookup is a query of the DNS for domain names when the IP address is known. Multiple domain names may be associated with an IP address. The DNS stores IP addresses in the form of domain names as specially formatted names in pointer (PTR) records within the infrastructure top-level domain [[.arpa|arpa]]. For IPv4, the domain is in-addr.arpa.  For IPv6, the reverse lookup domain is ip6.arpa. The IP address is represented as a name in reverse-ordered octet representation for IPv4, and reverse-ordered nibble representation for IPv6.

When performing a reverse lookup, the DNS client converts the address into these formats before querying the name for a PTR record following the delegation chain as for any DNS query. For example, assuming the IPv4 address 208.80.152.2 is assigned to Wikimedia, it is represented as a DNS name in reverse order: 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa. When the DNS resolver gets a pointer (PTR) request, it begins by querying the root servers, which point to the servers of [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for the 208.in-addr.arpa zone. ARIN's servers delegate 152.80.208.in-addr.arpa to Wikimedia to which the resolver sends another query for 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which results in an authoritative response.

===Client lookup===
[[Image:DNS in the real world.svg|right|thumb|400px|DNS resolution sequence]]
Users generally do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as [[web browser]]s, [[e-mail client]]s, and other Internet applications. When an application makes a request that requires a domain name lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the [[DNS resolver]] in the local operating system, which in turn handles the communications required.

The DNS resolver will almost invariably have a cache (see above) containing recent lookups. If the cache can provide the answer to the request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers. In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider to which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a user will either have configured that server's address manually or allowed [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to set it; however, where systems administrators have configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers point to separately maintained name servers of the organization. In any event, the name server thus queried will follow the process outlined [[#Address resolution mechanism|above]], until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands the result back to the software which initiated the request.

====Broken resolvers====
Some large ISPs have configured their DNS servers to violate rules, such as by disobeying TTLs, or by indicating that a domain name does not exist just because one of its name servers does not respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Providers ignoring DNS TTL?

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some applications, such as web browsers, maintain an internal DNS cache to avoid repeated lookups via the network. This practice can add extra difficulty when debugging DNS issues, as it obscures the history of such data. These caches typically use very short caching times – in the order of one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyn.com/web-browser-dns-caching-bad-thing/|title=Ben Anderson: Why Web Browser DNS Caching Can Be A Bad Thing|author=Ben Anderson|date=7 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet Explorer]] represents a notable exception: versions up to IE 3.x cache DNS records for 24 hours by default. Internet Explorer 4.x and later versions (up to IE 8) decrease the default time out value to half an hour, which may be changed by modifying default configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Chrome]] triggers a specific error message for DNS issues. When the DNS server is down or broken, Google Chrome returns an error message.
===Other applications===
The Domain Name System includes several other functions and features.

Hostnames and IP addresses are not required to match in a one-to-one relationship. Multiple hostnames may correspond to a single IP address, which is useful in [[virtual hosting]], in which many web sites are served from a single host. Alternatively, a single hostname may resolve to many IP addresses to facilitate [[fault tolerance]] and [[load balancing (computing)|load distribution]] to multiple server instances across an enterprise or the global Internet.

DNS serves other purposes in addition to translating names to IP addresses. For instance, [[mail transfer agent]]s use DNS to find the best mail server to deliver [[e-mail]]: An [[MX record]] provides a mapping between a domain and a mail exchanger; this can provide an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.

The DNS is used for efficient storage and distribution of IP addresses of blacklisted email hosts. A common method is to place the IP address of the subject host into the sub-domain of a higher level domain name, and to resolve that name to a record that indicates a positive or a negative indication.

For example:
* The address {{IPaddr|102.3.4.5}} is blacklisted. It points to 5.4.3.102.blacklist.example, which resolves to {{IPaddr|127.0.0.1}}.
* The address {{IPaddr|102.3.4.6}} is not blacklisted and points to 6.4.3.102.blacklist.example. This hostname is either not configured, or resolves to {{IPaddr|127.0.0.2}}.
E-mail servers can query blacklist.example to find out if a specific host connecting to them is in the blacklist. Many of such blacklists, either subscription-based or free of cost, are available for use by email administrators and anti-spam software.

The [[Sender Policy Framework]] and [[DomainKeys]] were designed to take advantage of another DNS record type, the [[TXT record]], but have since been assigned specific record types.

To provide resilience in the event of computer or network failure, multiple DNS servers are usually provided for coverage of each domain. At the top level of global DNS, thirteen groups of root name servers exist, with additional "copies" of them distributed worldwide via [[anycast]] addressing.

[[Dynamic DNS]] (DDNS) updates a DNS server with a client IP address on-the-fly, for example, when moving between ISPs or mobile [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hot spots]], or when the IP address changes administratively.

==DNS message format==
The DNS protocol uses two types of DNS messages, queries and replies, and they both have the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space. A header field (''flags'') controls the content of these four sections.&lt;ref name=rfc1034/&gt;

The header section contains the following fields: ''Identification'', ''Flags'', ''Number of questions'', ''Number of answers'', ''Number of authority resource records'' (RRs), and ''Number of additional RRs''. The identification field can be used to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits indicating the type of query, or the type of query this message is a response to. 0 is a standard query, 1 an inverse query, 2 is a server status request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), as not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the message was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit sub-field is used for error codes. The ''question'' section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The ''answer'' section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross, Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 6th ed. Essex, England: Pearson Educ. Limited, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNS Protocol transport==
DNS primarily uses the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on [[port number]] 53 to serve requests.&lt;ref name=rfc1035/&gt; DNS queries consist of a single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. When the length of the answer exceeds 512 bytes and both client and server support [[EDNS]], larger UDP packets are used. Otherwise, the query is sent again using the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).  TCP is also used for tasks such as [[DNS zone transfer|zone transfers]]. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.

==Resource records==
{{Too abstract|date=November 2017}}
The Domain Name System specifies a set of various [[List of DNS record types|types of resource records]] (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time ([[Time to live#DNS records|time to live]]), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a ''resource record set'' (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement [[round-robin DNS|round-robin ordering]] to achieve [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. The [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.

When sent over an [[Internet Protocol]] network, all records use the common format specified in RFC 1035:&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5395, ''Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations'', D. Eastlake 3rd (November 2008), Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ Resource record (RR) fields
|-
! Field !! Description !! Length ([[Octet (computing)|octets]])
|-
| NAME || Name of the node to which this record pertains || Variable
|-
| TYPE || Type of RR in numeric form (e.g., 15 for MX RRs) || 2
|-
| CLASS || Class code || 2
|-
| [[Time to live|TTL]] || Count of seconds that the RR stays valid (The maximum is 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;−1, which is about 68 years) || 4
|-
| RDLENGTH || Length of RDATA field (specified in octets) || 2
|-
| RDATA || Additional RR-specific data || Variable, as per RDLENGTH
|}

''NAME'' is the fully qualified domain name of the node in the tree {{clarify|date=November 2017}}. On the wire, the name may be shortened using label compression where ends of domain names mentioned earlier in the packet can be substituted for the end of the current domain name. A free standing ''@'' is used to denote the current origin.

''TYPE'' is the record type. It indicates the format of the data and it gives a hint of its intended use. For example, the ''A'' record is used to translate from a domain name to an [[IPv4 address]], the ''NS'' record lists which name servers can answer lookups on a [[DNS zone]], and the ''MX'' record specifies the mail server used to handle mail for  a domain specified in an e-mail address.

''RDATA'' is data of type-specific relevance, such as the IP address for address records, or the priority and hostname for MX records. Well known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but "unknown" record types must not (RFC 3597).

The ''CLASS'' of a record is set to IN (for ''Internet'') for common DNS records involving Internet hostnames, servers, or IP addresses. In addition, the classes [[Chaosnet|Chaos]] (CH) and [[Hesiod (name service)|Hesiod]] (HS) exist.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5395, ''Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations'', D. Eastlake 3rd (November 2008), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Each class is an independent name space with potentially different delegations of DNS zones.

In addition to resource records defined in a [[zone file]], the domain name system also defines several request types that are used only in communication with other DNS nodes (''on the wire''), such as when performing zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) or for [[EDNS]] (OPT).

===Wildcard DNS records===
The domain name system supports [[wildcard DNS record]]s which specify names that start with the ''asterisk label'', '*', e.g., *.example.&lt;ref name=rfc1034/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfc4592&gt;RFC 4592, ''The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System'', E. Lewis (July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; DNS records belonging to wildcard domain names specify rules for generating resource records within a single DNS zone by substituting whole labels with matching components of the query name, including any specified descendants. For example, in the following configuration, the DNS zone ''x.example'' specifies that all subdomains, including subdomains of subdomains, of ''x.example'' use the mail exchanger (MX) ''a.x.example''. The A record for ''a.x.example'' is needed to specify the mail exchanger IP address. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, an additional MX record for the subdomain ''a.x.example'', as well as a wildcarded MX record for all of its subdomains, must also be defined in the DNS zone.

&lt;pre&gt;
x.example.       MX   10 a.x.example.
*.x.example.     MX   10 a.x.example.
*.a.x.example.   MX   10 a.x.example.
a.x.example.     MX   10 a.x.example.
a.x.example.     AAAA 2001:db8::1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The role of wildcard records was refined in RFC 4592, because the original definition in RFC 1034 was incomplete and resulted in misinterpretations by implementers.&lt;ref name="rfc4592" /&gt;

==Protocol extensions==
The original DNS protocol had limited provisions for extension with new features. In 1999, Paul Vixie published in RFC 2671 (superseded by RFC 6891) an extension mechanism, called [[Extension mechanisms for DNS]] (EDNS) that introduced optional protocol elements without increasing overhead when not in use. This was accomplished through the OPT pseudo-resource record that only exists in wire transmissions of the protocol, but not in any zone files. Initial extensions were also suggested (EDNS0), such as increasing the DNS message size in UDP datagrams.

==Dynamic zone updates==
[[Dynamic DNS|Dynamic DNS updates]] use the UPDATE DNS opcode to add or remove resource records dynamically from a zone database maintained on an authoritative DNS server. The feature is described in RFC 2136. This facility is useful to register network clients into the DNS when they boot or become otherwise available on the network. As a booting client may be assigned a different IP address each time from a [[DHCP]] server, it is not possible to provide static DNS assignments for such clients.

==Security issues==
Originally, security concerns were not major design considerations for DNS software or any software for deployment on the early Internet, as the network was not open for participation by the general public. However, the expansion of the Internet into the commercial sector in the 1990s changed the requirements for security measures to protect [[data integrity]] and user [[authentication]].

Several vulnerability issues were discovered and exploited by malicious users. One such issue is [[DNS cache poisoning]], in which data is distributed to caching resolvers under the pretense of being an authoritative origin server, thereby polluting the data store with potentially false information and long expiration times (time-to-live). Subsequently, legitimate application requests may be redirected to network hosts operated with malicious intent.

DNS responses traditionally do not have a [[cryptographic signature]], leading to many attack possibilities; the [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. [[DNSCurve]] has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as [[TSIG]], add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.

Some domain names may be used to achieve spoofing effects. For example, {{not a typo|paypal.com}} and paypa1.com are different names, yet users may be unable to distinguish them in a graphical user interface depending on the user's chosen [[typeface]]. In many fonts the letter ''l'' and the numeral ''1'' look very similar or even identical. This problem is acute in systems that support [[internationalized domain name]]s, as many character codes in [[ISO 10646]] may appear identical on typical computer screens. This vulnerability is occasionally exploited in [[phishing]].&lt;ref&gt;APWG. "Global Phishing Survey: Domain Name Use and Trends in 1H2010." [http://www.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_1H2010.pdf 10/15/2010 apwg.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques such as [[forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] can also be used to help validate DNS results.

==Privacy/tracking issues==
A device looking up a DNS record must communicate with a DNS server to do so. Considerable attention has been given to the adverse privacy implications. Even if DNS records cannot easily be read, modified or spoofed due to security extensions, a person with access to the DNS server or the traffic stream "on the wire" may have little difficulty in matching the IP address of the device (which often identifies the user), to the websites, email or other domains they visit, and track how often and when these records are queried, since DNS records typically expire and must be requeried regularly.

DNS can also "leak" from otherwise secure or private connections, if attention is not paid to their configuration, and at times DNS has been used to bypass firewalls by malicious persons, and [[exfiltrate]] data, since it is often seen as innocuous.

Two main approaches are in use to counter privacy issues with DNS:
* [[Proxy server|Proxies]] (including [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]) and [[VPN]]s which can reroute or anonymize DNS inquiries in order to mask the source IP address.
* Intermediate DNS servers that are configured with minimal logging, and which can be queried instead of querying usual DNS servers whose privacy policy may be untrusted. In 2018, [[Cloudflare]] launched a DNS server of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.eweek.com/security/cloudflare-launches-1.1.1.1-dns-service-to-improve-internet-privacy |title=Cloudflare Launches 1.1.1.1 DNS Service to Improve Internet Privacy |access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain name registration==
The right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) or other organizations such as [[OpenNIC]], that are charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet. In addition to ICANN, each top-level domain (TLD) is maintained and serviced technically by an administrative organization, operating a registry. A ''registry'' is responsible for operating the database of names within its authoritative zone, although the term is most often used for TLDs.  A ''registrant'' is a person or organization who asked for domain registration.&lt;ref name="rfc7719"/&gt;  The registry receives registration information from each domain name ''registrar'', which is authorized (accredited) to assign names in the corresponding zone and publishes the information using the [[WHOIS]] protocol.  As of 2015, usage of [[Registration Data Access Protocol|RDAP]] is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2015-12-03-en |title=Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Operational Profile for gTLD Registries and Registrars |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=[[ICANN]] |access-date=18 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222144443/https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2015-12-03-en |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICANN publishes the complete list of TLDs, TLD registries, and domain name registrars. Registrant information associated with domain names is maintained in an online database accessible with the WHOIS service. For most of the more than 290 [[country code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs), the domain registries maintain the WHOIS (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.) information. For instance, [[DENIC]], Germany NIC, holds the DE domain data. From about 2001, most [[Generic top-level domain]] (gTLD) registries have adopted this so-called ''thick'' registry approach, i.e. keeping the WHOIS data in central registries instead of registrar databases.

For top-level domains on COM and NET, a ''thin'' registry model is used. The domain registry (e.g., [[GoDaddy]], [[Directi|BigRock and PDR]], [[VeriSign]], etc, etc) holds basic WHOIS data (i.e., registrar and name servers, etc.). Organizations, or registrants using ORG on the other hand, are on the [[Public Interest Registry]] exclusively.

Some domain name registries, often called ''network information centers'' (NIC), also function as registrars to end-users, in addition to providing access to the WHOIS datasets. The top-level domain registries, such as for the domains COM, NET, and ORG use a registry-registrar model consisting of many domain name registrars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verisign.com/en_US/domain-names/domain-registrar/index.xhtml|title=Find a Registrar|publisher=VeriSign, Inc.|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method of management, the registry only manages the domain name database and the relationship with the registrars. The ''registrants'' (users of a domain name) are customers of the registrar, in some cases through additional subcontracting of resellers.

In '''''Ehrlich v CEO, Legal Aid Board''''' (2005), an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], the accused was [[Verdict|convicted]] and [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] on charges of [[indecent assault]]. He applied for legal representation at State expense in order to prosecute an [[appeal]] against both conviction and sentence. Various representatives of the Legal Aid Board, as well as counsel approached directly by the applicant, concluded that there were no prospects of success on appeal. Accordingly, the LAB declined to provide representation at State expense.

The applicant then sought an order reviewing and setting aside this decision. He contended that he was entitled to assistance based on his [[Right to counsel|right to legal representation]] at State expense.

The court noted that the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] entitled accused persons to legal representation at State expense if substantial injustice would otherwise result. The Board was required to determine whether a refusal to grant legal representation would result in substantial injustice to the applicant.

The Board's decision had not been arbitrary or capricious; it had considered the opinions of its own officers as well as that of outside counsel, all of whom were satisfied that there were no prospects of success on appeal. The Board was therefore entitled to conclude that a refusal to provide representation would not result in substantial injustice, especially when it was borne in mind that the Board's primary source of funds was the public purse, upon which there was substantial demand.

Therefore, the application was dismissed.

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=7}}
The '''''{{transl|akk|Enûma Eliš}}''''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian Cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|[[wikt:𒂊𒉡𒈠𒂊𒇺#Akkadian|𒂊𒉡𒈠𒂊𒇺]]}}, also spelled "Enuma Elish"), is the [[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian]] [[creation myth]] (named after its opening words). It was recovered by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1849 (in fragmentary form) in the ruined [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] at [[Nineveh]] ([[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]). A form of the myth was first published by [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] in 1876; active research and further excavations led to near completion of the texts, and improved translation.

The ''Enûma Eliš'' has about a thousand lines and is recorded in [[Old Babylonian language|Old Babylonian]] on seven [[clay tablet]]s, each holding between 115 and 170 lines of [[Cuneiform script|Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform script]]. Most of Tablet V has never been recovered but, aside from this [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]], the text is almost complete.

This epic is one of the most important sources for understanding the [[Babylonia]]n world view. Over the seven tablets it describes the creation of the world, a battle between gods focused on supremacy of [[Marduk]], the creation of man destined for the service of the [[Mesopotamian deities]], and ends with a long passage praising Marduk. Its primary original purpose is unknown, although a version is known to have been used for certain festivals, there may also have been a political element to the myth, centered on the legitimization or primacy of Mesopotomia over Assyria. Some later versions replace Marduk with the Assyrian primary god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]].

The ''Enûma Eliš'' exists in various copies from Babylon and Assyria. The version from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] dates to the 7th century BCE. The composition of the text probably dates to the [[Bronze Age]], or even earlier, to the time of [[Hammurabi]]. Some elements of the myth are attested by illustrations that date to, at least, as early as the [[Kassites|Kassite]] era (roughly 18th to 16th centuries BCE).

==Background and discovery==
Prior to the discovery of the tablets, substantial elements of the myth had survived via the writings of [[Berossus]], a 3rd-century BC Babylonian writer and priest of Bel ([[Marduk]]). These were preseved in [[Alexander Polyhistor]]'s book on Chaldean History, which was reproduced by [[Eusebius]] in Book 1 of his [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|''Chronicon'']]. In it are described the primeval state of an abyssal darkness and water, the two primeval beings existing therein, said to be of a twofold principle. The description then relates the creation of further beings, partly human but with variants of wings, animal heads and bodies, and some with both sex organs. (Berossus states images of these are to be found at the temple of Bel in Babylon.) The text also describes a female being leading over them, named as Omoroca (Chaldean: ''Thalatth''), and her slaying by Bel, who cut her in half, forming Heaven of one part and Earth of the other - this, Berossus claims to have been an allegory. The text also describes the beheading of a god, and the mixing of the god's blood with the Earth's soil, leading to the creation of men (people). Finally, there is also reference to Bel's creation of the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets.{{sfn|Cory|1828|pp=25-29}}{{sfn|Cory|1876|pp=58-60|ps=(quote) ''"There was a time in which there was nothing but darkness and an abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings which were produced of a two-fold principle. Men appeared with two wings, some with four wings, and two faces. They had one body but two heads, one of a man, the other of a woman. They were likewise, in their several organs, both male and female. Other human figures were to be seen with the legs and horns of goats. Some had horses' feet ; others had the limbs of a horse behind but, in front, were fashioned like men resembling hippocentaurs. Bulls, likewise, bred there with the heads of men ; and dogs, with fourfold bodies, and the tails of fishes. Also horses, with the heads of dogs : men, too, and other animals, with the heads and bodies of horses and the tails of fishes. In short, there were creatures with the limbs of every species of animals. Add to these fishes, reptiles, serpents, with other wonderful animals, which assumed each other's shape and countenance. Of all these were preserved delineations in the temple of Belus at Babylon."&lt;br/&gt;"The person, who was supposed to have presided over them, was a woman named Omoroca ''[A corruption of the Aramaic ''Amqia'' - 'the deep', or 'ocean' cf [[Tiamat]].]'' ; which in the Chaldee language is Thalatth ; which in Greek is interpreted Thalassa, the sea : but, according to the most true computation, it is equivalent to Selene, the Moon. All things being in this situation, Belus came, and cut the woman asunder : and, out of one half of her, he formed the Earth, and of the other half the heavens ; and at the same time he destroyed the animals in the abyss. All this (he says) was an allegorical description of nature. For the whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being continually generated therein ; the deity (Belus), above-mentioned, cut off his own head ; upon which the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with the earth ; and from thence men were formed. On this account it is that men are rational, and partake of divine knowledge. This Belus, whom men call Dis, (or Pluto,) divided the darkness, and separated the heavens from the earth, and reduced the universe to order. But the animals so recently created, not being able to bear the prevalence of light, died."&lt;br/&gt;"Belus upon this, seeing a vast space quite uninhabited, though by nature very fruitful, ordered one of the gods to take off his head ; and when it was taken off, they were to mix the blood with the soil of the Earth, and from thence to form other men and animals, which should be capable of bearing the light. Belus also formed the stars, and the Sun and the Moon, together with the five planets."''}}{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978| p = 8|ps= (quote) ''"If Berossus exercised little criticism on his sources, the fragments make it clear that he did choose good sources, most likely from a library at Babylon, and that he reliably reported their contents in Greek. Thus, in book one he essentially followed a version of Enuma Elish for the story of creation"'' }} Berossus also gave an account of the [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]], a sort of fish-man hybrid, who appeared from the sea and taught people all manner of knowledge, including writing, lawmaking, construction, mathematics, and agriculture;{{sfn|Cory|1876|p=57}}  Berossus presented the account of creation in the form of a speech given by the Oannes.{{sfn|Mayer Burstein|1978|pp=7; p.14}}{{sfn|Cory|1828|loc=pp.25-29 (quote) ''"Moreover Oannes wrote concerning the generations of mankind, of their different ways of life, and of their civil polity; and the following is the purport of what he said : "There was a time in which there was nothing but darkness and an abyss of waters, .."''}} The neo-platonist [[Damascius]] also gave a short version of the Babylonian cosmological view, which closely matches the Enuma Elis.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=75-76}}

Clay tablets containing inscriptions relating to analogues of biblical stories were discovered by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]], [[Hormuzd Rassam]], and [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] in the ruins of the Palace and Library of [[Ashur-bani-pal]] (668-626 BC) during excavations at the mound of Kuyunjik, [[Nineveh]] (near [[Mosul]]) between 1848 and 1876. Smith worked through Rassam's find of ~20,000 fragments from 1852, and identified references to the kings [[Shalmaneser II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]], and other rulers mentioned in the Bible - furthermore he discovered versions of a Babylonian deluge myth (see [[Gilgamesh flood myth]]), as well as creation myths.{{sfn|Budge|1921|p=1}}{{sfn|Smith|1876|p=2-3}}

On examination it became clear that the Assyrian myths were drawn from or similar to the Babylonian ones; additionally [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]] had noted similarities between Biblical accounts of creation and the geography of [[Babylonia]] - he suggested that biblical creation stories might have their origin in that area - a link was found on a tablet labeled K 63 at the [[British Museum]]'s collection by Smith, as well as similar text on other tablets - Smith then began searching the collection for textual similarities between the two mythoses, and found several references to a deluge myth with an 'Izdubar' (literal translation of cuneiform for [[Gilgamesh]]). Smith's publication of his work led to an expedition to Assyria funded by the [[Daily Telegraph]] - there he found further tablets describing the deluge as well as fragmentary accounts of creation, a text on a war between good and evil 'gods', and a [[Fall of man]] myth. A second expedition by Smith brought back further creation legend fragments. By 1875 he had returned and began publishing accounts of these discoveries in the Daily Telegraph from 4 March 1875.{{sfn|Smith|1876|pp=3-18}}{{sfn|Budge|1921|pp=1-2}}

Smith envisioned that the creation myth, including a part describing the fall of man must have originally spanned at least nine or ten tablets.{{sfn|Smith|1876|p=13}} He also identified tablets that in part were closer with Borusus' account.{{sfn|Smith|1876|pp=101-112}} Some of Smith's early assignments, such as references to the stories of the temptation of Eve, to the Tower of Babel, and to instructions given from God to Adam and Eve, were later held to be erroneous.{{sfn|Budge|1921|loc = p.67, Note 2}}{{sfn|King|1902|loc = v.1, preface; pp.219-, Appendix IV}}

The connection with the Bible stories brought a great deal of additional attention to the tablets - in addition to Smith's early scholarship on the tablets, early translation work included that done by E. Schrader, [[Archibald Sayce|A.H. Sayce]], and [[Jules Oppert]]. In 1890 [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|P. Jensen]] published a translation and commentary ''Die Kosmologie der Babylonier'' {{harv|Jensen|1890}}, followed by an updated translation in his 1900 "Mythen und Epen" {{harv|Jensen|1900}}; in 1895 Prof. Zimmern of Liepzig gave a translation of all known fragments, {{harv|Gunkel|Zimmern|1895}}, shortly followed by a translation by [[Friedrich Delitzsch]], as well as contributions by several other authors.{{sfn|King|1902|loc = v.1, preface; pp.XXVI-XXX, introduction}}{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=2}}

In 1898 the trustees of the British Museum ordered publication of a collation of all the Assyrian and Babylonian creation texts held by them, a work which was undertaken by [[Leonard William King|L.W.King]]. King concluded that the creation myth as known in Nineveh was originally contained on seven tablets.{{sfn|Budge|1921|pp=2-4}} This collection was published 1901 as ''"Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum" (Part XIII)'' {{harv|British Museum|1901}}. King published his own translations and notes in two volumes with additional material 1902 as ''The Seven Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends concerning the creation of the world and of mankind''.{{harv|King|1902}} By then additional fragments of tablet six had been found, concerning the creation of man - here Marduk was found to have made man from his blood combined with bone, which brought comparison with Genesis 2:23 ("This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man") where the creation of woman required the use of a man's bone.{{sfn|King|1902|loc = v.1, preface}}

New material contributing to the fourth and sixth tablets also further corroborated other elements of Berossus' account.{{snf|King|pp=XLIX, LIV}} The seventh tablet added by King was a praise of Marduk, using around fifty titles over more than one hundred lines of cuneiform.{{sfn|King|1902|p=LXIII}} Thus King's composition of the "Enuma Elis" consisted of five parts - the birth of gods, legend of [[Enki|Ea]] and [[Abzu|Apsu]], Dragon ([[Tiamat]]) myth, account of creation, and finally a hymn to Marduk using his many titles.{{sfn|King|1902|p=LXVII}} Importantly, tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian, when possessing [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s had the number of the tablet inscribed.{{sfn|King|1902|p=CXIII}}

Further expeditions by German researchers uncovered further tablet fragments (specifically tablet 1, 6, and 7) during the period 1902-1914 - these works replaced Marduk with the Assyrian  god [[Ashur]]; additional important sources for tablets 1 and 6, and tablet 7 were discovered by expeditions in 1924-5, and 1928-9 respectively.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=1}} The Ashur texts uncovered by the Germans necessitated some corrections - it was [[Kingu]] not [[Marduk]] who was killed and whose blood made men.{{sfn|Luckenbill|1921|pp=12-13}} These discoveries were further supplemented by purchases from antiquity dealers - as a result by the mid 20th century most of the text of the work was known, with the exception of tablet 5.(Although a version of tablet 5 was recently discovered in 2011 in the Iraq museum archives) {{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=1-2}} These further discoveries were complemented by a stream of publications and translations in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=2-3}}

In the 21st century the text continues to be a subject of active research, analysis, or discussion - significant publications include  ''The Standard Babylonian Creation Myth Enūma Eliš'' {{harv|Talon|2005}}; ''Das Babylonische Weltschopfungsepos Enuma Elis'' {{harv|Kammerer|Metzler|2012}}, and  ''Babylonian Creation Myths'' {{harv|Lambert|2013}}; as well as other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| jstor = 10.7817/jameroriesoci.137.4.0833| title = Some Notes on enūma eliš| first = Andrea| last = Seri| volume = 137| number = 4| year = 2017| pages = 833–838| journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society| doi =10.7817/jameroriesoci.137.4.0833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| jstor =10.5615/jcunestud.69.2017.0221|title = From Text to Reading in Enūma Eliš| first = Johannes |last = Haubold| journal = Journal of Cuneiform Studies | volume =  69 | year = 2017 | page =  221| publisher =  The American Schools of Oriental Research| doi = 10.5615/jcunestud.69.2017.0221| quote = The last decade has seen important advances in scholarship on the Babylonian poem ''Enuma Elis''.

===Dating of the Myth===
[[File:Chaos Monster and Sun God.png|thumb|A ''bas-relief'' thought to be of Marduk and Tiamat from a temple at Nimrud dates the legend to at least the reign of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883-859 BC) ]]

King's set of tablets dated to no earlier than the 7th century BC, being from the library of Ashur-bani-pal at Nineveh - however King proposed that the tablets were copies of earlier Babylonian works as they glorified Marduk (of Babylon), and not the Assyrians' favored god, Ashur.{{sfn|King|1902|p=LXXII}} He also thought sculptures found at the temple of [[Ninib]] at [[Nimrud]] depicted Marduk fighting Tiamat and so date the dragon legend to at least [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883-859 BC), two centuries earlier than the date of Ashur-bani-pal's library. Legends of Tiamat and her monsters existed much earlier, as far as the Kassite ruler [[Agum I]], ~17th C. BC.{{sfn|King|1902|pp=LXXIII-LXIV}}{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=13}}

It has been suggested that the myth, or at least the promotion of Marduk in it, dates to the ascendancy of the [[First Babylonian dynasty]] (1894-1595 BC), during the same period that Marduk became a national god.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=14}} A similar promotion of Marduk is seen in the first lines of the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (c.1754 BC).{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=14}}

===Variants===
Numerous copies of the tablets exist - even by 1902 fragments of four copies of the first tablet where known, as well as extracts, possibly examples of 'handwriting practice'.{{sfn|King|1902|loc=v.2, preface}} Tablets from the library of Ashur-bani-pal tended to be well written on fine clay, whereas the [[Neo-Babylonian]] tablets were often less well written and made, though fine examples existed.{{sfn|King|1902|pp=CXI-CXIII}} All tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian had the text in lines, not columns, and the form of the text was generally identical between both.{{sfn|King|1902|pp=CXIII-CXIV}}

A tablet at the British Museum (No 93014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=284240&amp;partId=1| title = Library of Ashurbanipal No. 93014| work = www.britishmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;), known as the "bilingual" version of the creation legend describes a version of the creation legend that describes the creation of man, and animals (by [[Marduk]] with the aid of [[Aruru (Babylonian goddess)|Aruru]]), as well as the creation of the rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], of land and plants, as well as the first houses and cities.{{sfn|Budge|1921|pp=5-7}}

The epic itself does not [[rhyme]], and has no [[Metre (poetry)|meter]] - it is composed of [[couplet]]s, usually written on the same line, occasionally forming [[quatrain]]s.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=15}} The title ''Enuma Elish'', meaning "when on high", is the [[incipit]].

:The following per tablet summary is based on the translation in ''Akkadian Myths and Epics'' (E.A. Spicer), in ''[[Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament]] '' {{harv|Pritchard|1969}}

===Tablet 1===
{{quote box|When on high the heaven had not been named,

Firm ground below had not been called by name,

Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,

(And) Mummu†-Tiamat, she who bore them all, Their waters commingling as a single body;

No reed hut had been matted, no marsh land had appeared,

When no gods whatever had been brought into being,

Uncalled by name, their destinies undetermined—

Then it was that the gods were formed within them.

|source = First eight lines of the Enuma Elis. {{harvnb|Pritchard|1969|pp=60–1}}&lt;br/&gt;† Here Mummu may be an [[epithet]], different from the god [[Mummu]]
}}
The tale begins before the advent of ''anything'', when only the primordial entities [[Apsu]] and [[Tiamat]]  existed, co-mingled together. No other things or gods are said to exist, nor had any future destinies been foretold .. then from the mixture of Apsu and Tiamat two gods were made - [[Lahmu]] and [[Lahamu]]; next [[Anshar]] and [[Kishar]] were created. From Anshar came a firstly the god [[Anu]], and from Anu, came [[Nudimmud]] (also known as [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]]).

Then these new gods disturbed Tiamat through their motions, and Apsu could not calm them. Further Tiamat found this abhorrent - Apsu called Mummu so that they might speak with Tiamat - he proposed to destroy them, but Tiamat was reticent on destroying what they had made. Mummu advised Apsu to destroy them, and he took it to do so, and embraced Mummu. The new gods heard of this and were worried - Ea however crafted a spell against Apsu's plan, and put Apsu to sleep with it.

Mummu sought to wake Apsu but could not - Ea took Apsu's halo and wore it himself, slew Apsu, and chained Mummu. Apsu became the dwelling place of Ea, together with his wife [[Damkina]]. Within the heart of Apsu Ea and Damkina created [[Marduk]]. Marduk exceeded Ea and the other gods in his godliness - Ea called him "My son, the Sun!". Anu creates four winds.

Other gods then say to Tiamat - 'when your consort (Apsu) was slain you did nothing', and complain about the wind which disturbs them. Tiamat then proposed to make 'Monsters' and do battle with the other gods. She creates eleven chimeric creatures armed with weapons, and makes the god [[Kingu]] chief of the war party, and her new consort too. The 'Tablet of Destinies' is then given to Kingu, making his command unchallengeable.

===Tablet 2===

Ea heard of Tiamat's plan to fight and avenge Apsu. He speaks to his grandfather Anshar - he tells that many gods have gone to Tiamat's cause, and that she has created eleven monstrous creatures fit for war, and made Kingu their leader, given him the 'Tablet of Destinies'. Anshar is troubled. Eventually Anshar tells Anu to go speak with Tiamat, see if he can calm her, but is too weak to face her and turns back. Anshar becomes more worried, thinking no god can or will stand against Tiamat.

After thinking, Anshar proposes Marduk as their champion. Marduk is brought forth, and asks what god he must fight—to which Anshar replies that it is not a god but the goddess Tiamat. Marduk confidently assures the other gods that he will defeat Tiamat in short order, but presents the condition that he will be proclaimed supreme god—and be given authority over even Anshar—if he succeeds.

===Tablet 3===
Anshar speaks to [[Gaga (god)|Gaga]], his advisor, who tells him to fetch Lahmu and Lahamu - tell them of Tiamat's war plans, of the eleven monsters she has created, and so on, telling also of Marduk's willingness to fight, and his demands for overlordship if he wins. Lahmu and Lahamu and other [[Igigi]] (heavenly gods) are distressed by this tale. The gods then drank together, becoming drowsy, whilst agreeing the contract with Marduk.

===Tablet 4===
Marduk is given a throne, and sits presiding over the other gods - the other gods honor him, agreeing to his overlordship.

{{quotebox|Lord, truly thy decree is first among gods.

Say but to wreck or create; it shall be.

Open thy mouth: the Images will vanish!

Speak again, and the Images shall be whole!
|source = (Other gods speak to Marduk) Translation, Table IV. Lines 20-. {{harvnb|Pritchard|1969|p=66}}
}}

Marduk is given both the throne, as well as sceptre and vestments. He is given weapons, and sent to fight Tiamat - bow, quiver, mace, and bolts of lightning, together with the four winds - his body was aflame.

Using the four winds Marduk made a trap so that Tiamat could not escape - he added a whirlwind, a cyclone, and [[Imhullu]] ("the Evil Wind") - together the seven winds stirred up Tiamat. In his war chariot drawn by four creatures he advanced. He challenges Tiamat stating she has unrightfully made Kingu her consort, accusing her of being the source of the trouble. Tiamat becomes enraged and single combat begins.

Marduk uses a net, a gift from Anu, to entrap Tiamat; Tiamat attempts to swallow Marduk, but 'the Evil Wind' enters her mouth, preventing this. With the winds swirling within her she becomes distended - Marduk then fires his arrow, hitting her heart - she is slain. The other gods attempt to flee but cannot, and Marduk captures them, breaks their weapons, and are trapped in the net. Her eleven monsters are also captured and chained; whilst Kingu is taken to [[Uggae]] (the Angel of Death) - the 'Tablet of Destinies' is taken from Kingu. Marduk then smashes Tiamat's head with the mace, whilst her blood is carried off by the North Wind.

Marduk then splits Tiamat's remains in two - from one half he makes the sky - in it he made places for Anu, Enlil, and Ea.

===Tablet 5===

Marduk makes likenesses of the gods in the sky, creating constellations, and defines the days of the year from them. He creates night and day, and the moon also. He creates clouds, causes them to rain, and their water to make the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. He gives the 'Tablet of Destinies' to Anu.

Statues of the eleven monsters of Tiamat are made and installed at the gate of [[Apsu]]

===Tablet 6===
Marduk then speaks to Ea - saying he will use his blood to create man - and that man will serve the gods. Ea advises one of the gods be chosen as a sacrifice - the Igigi advice that Kingu be chosen - his blood is then used to create man.

{{quotebox|Construct Babylon, whose building you have requested,

|source = (Marduk commands the other gods aka the [[Anunnaki]])&lt;br/&gt;Translation, Table VI. Lines 57-. {{harvnb|Pritchard|1969|p=68}}
}}

Marduk then divides the gods into "above" and "below" - three hundred are placed in the heavens, and six hundred on earth.  The gods then propose that they should build a throne or shrine for him - Marduk tells them to construct Babylon. The gods then spend a year making bricks - they build the [[Esagila]] (Temple to Marduk) to a great height, making it a place for Marduk, Ea, and [[Enlil]].

A banquet is then held, with fifty of the great gods taking seats. Anu praises Enlil's bow, then Marduk is praised.

The first nine names or titles of Marduk are given.

===Tablet 7===

The remainder of Marduk's fifty names or titles are read.

===Colophon===

Tablets Smith examined also contained attributions on the rear of the tablet - the first tablet contained eight lines of a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] - Smith's reconstruction and translation of this states : 
{{quote box|"When Above"&lt;br/&gt;

==Significance, interpretation, and ritual use==

The ''Enuma Elis'' is the primary source for Mesopotamian cosmology.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=10}} According to Heidel its main purpose was as a praise of Marduk, and was important in making that Babylonian god head of the entire pantheon, through his deeds in defeating Tiamat, and in creation of the universe.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=10-12}} Heidel also considers the text to have a political as well as religious message - that is - the promotion to primacy of a Babylonian god to better justify any Babylonian influence over the whole Mesopotamian region.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=11}} The text as a whole contains many words which are [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] in origin, including the names of Tiamat's monsters, Marduk's wind, and the name for man used is the Sumerian ''lullu''; however the chief god in the epic is the Babylonian Marduk, and not the Sumerian [[Enlil]].{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=12}}

A ritual text from the [[Seleucid]] period states that the ''Enuma Elis'' was recited during the [[Akitu]] festival.&lt;ref name="akitu"&gt;{{citation| url = | page = 93|  title = Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown| first = Jonathan Z. | last = Smith | authorlink=Jonathan Z. Smith | year = 1982 | publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 0 226 76360 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the reading, if it occurred, and even the identity of the said text to be used as this festival is a matter of debate amongst scholars. Most analysists considered that the festival concerned and included some form of re-enactment of [[Tiamat]]'s defeat by [[Marduk]], representing a renewal cycle and or triumph over chaos, however a more detailed analysis by [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] led him to argue that the described ritual should be understood in terms of its post-Assyrian and post-Babylonian imperial temporal context, and may include an elements of psychological and political theater addressing the non-native origin of the Seleucid rulers who then controlled the area; he also questions whether the ''Enuma Elis'' read during that period was the same as that known to the ancient Assyrians. Whether the ''Enuma Elis'' creation myth was created for the Akitu ritual, or ''vice versa'', or neither, is unclear; nevertheless there are definite connections in subject matter between the myth and festival, and there is also evidence of the festival as celebrated during the neo-Babylonian period that correlates well with the ''Enuma Elis'' myth.{{sfn|Sommer|2000|pp = 81-85; p.82, note 7; p.90; p.91, note 49}} A version of the ''Enuma Elis'' is also thought to have been read during the month of Kislimu.{{sfn|Sommer|2000|pp = 91, note 49}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Problems of the Babylonian Akitu Festival| first = Ichiro| last= Nakata| journal = Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society (JANES)| volume =1| year = 1968|page = 42| url = https://janes.scholasticahq.com/article/2224.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that ritual reading of the poem coincided with spring flooding of the Tigris or Euphrates in following the melting of snow in mountainous regions upstream - this interpretation is supported by the defeat of the (watery being) Tiamat by Marduk.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=17}}

==Influence on biblical research==
{{See also|Panbabylonism}}
The ''Enuma Elis'' contains numerous parallels with the [[Old Testament]], and has led to a general conclusion amongst some researchers that the paralleled Old Testament stories were based on the mesopotamian work. Overarching similarities include : reference to a watery chaos before creation; a separation of the chaos into heaven and earth; different types of waters and their separation during the creation process; as well as the indirect textual similarity between the number of tablets, and the number of days of creation - that is - seven.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|p=82}} However, in a deeper analysis {{harv|Heidel|1951}} notes many differences, including polytheism vs. monotheism, and personification of forces or properties in the Babylonian myth vs. imperative creation by god in the biblical stories; permanence of matter vs. creation out of nothing; and the lack of any real parallel for the extended description of Marduk's battles with monsters. He also notes some broad commonalities with other religions in both  e.g. a ''watery chaos'' found in Egyptian, Phoenician, and Vedic works; and that the linguistic analysis of both belief system's texts are complicated by a common Semitic root for both languages.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=82-118}} In terms of creation of man there are similarities in terms of the use of dust or earth (clay) for his creation, but man's purpose is inverted in the two texts - in the Enuma Elis man is created as a servant of gods, whereas in Genesis man is given more agency - nevertheless in both man contains "godhood" - either through a god's blood in the Babylonia, or being made "in His own Image" in Genesis; in both man is the final creative act of the god/gods.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=118-122}} In terms of the seven tablets and seven days of each system  - the numbered itineraries in general do not closely match - but there are some broad commonalities in order of occurrence i.e. creation event; theme of darkness; light created; firmament created; dry land created; man created; followed by god/god's  inactivity.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=128-129}}

Different theories have been proposed to explain the similarities.  Based on an analysis of proper names in the texts [[Albert Tobias Clay|A.T. Clay]] proposed that the Enuma Elish was a combination of a Semitic myth from [[Amurru (god)|Amurru]] and a Sumerian myth from [[Eridu]] - this theory is thought to lack solidity, and specifically any historical or archaeological evidence. An alternative theory is a westward migration of the Mesopotamian myth, being known to other cultures such as the Hebrews, and so influencing their own beliefs; additionally the Hebrews specifically would expect to be influenced during their exposure to Mesopotamian culture during their [[Babylonian captivity]]. A third explanation supposes a common ancestor for both sets of belief.{{sfn|Heidel|1951|pp=129-139}}

[[Conrad Hyers]] of the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] suggests that the Genesis creation myth [[polemics|polemically]] addressed earlier Babylonian and other creation myths to "repudiate the divinization of nature and the attendant myths of divine origins, divine conflict, and divine ascent," thus rejecting the idea that Genesis borrowed from or appropriated the form of the Enûma Eliš.&lt;ref name="Hyers"&gt;{{citation| first = M |last = Conrad Hyers|authorlink=Conrad Hyers | title = The Meaning of Creation: Genesis and Modern Science| publisher = John Knox| year= 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the Enûma Eliš was comfortable using connections between the divine and inert matter, while the aim of Genesis was to state the superiority of the Hebrew God [[Yahweh]] Elohim over all creation (and subsequent deities).

Reconstruction of the broken Enûma Eliš tablet seems to define the rarely attested ''Sapattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''Sabattu&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' as the [[full moon]]. This word is cognate or merged with Hebrew ''[[Shabbat]]'' (cf. {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:2-3|NIV}}), but is monthly rather than weekly; it is regarded as a form of [[Sumer]]ian ''sa-bat'' ("mid-rest"), attested in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''um nuh libbi'' ("day of mid-repose"). This conclusion is a contextual restoration of the damaged tablet, which is read as "[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly."&lt;ref name=ere&gt;{{citation|editor-last = Hastings|editor-first = James| editorlink=James Hastings | work=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=10|publisher=Kessinger Publishing | year = 1918 | pages = 889–891 | title = Sabbath (Babylonian) | url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Erasmus House''' ({{lang-fr|Maison d'Érasme}}, {{lang-nl|Erasmushuis}}) is a museum in [[Anderlecht]], a municipality in [[Brussels]], devoted to the Dutch [[Humanism|humanist]] writer [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmushouse.museum/|title=Erasmus House|publisher=Museum website|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The house, of late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style, was built in 1458, and it was a school in 1515 under the tutelage of Pieter Wijchmans, canon and schoolmaster of the chapter of Anderlecht and a friend of Erasmus. Erasmus stayed in the house for 5 months from May to October 1521 working on his translation of the [[New Testament]] from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] into [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amarant.be/BR112/RO25085erasmushuisanderlecht.html Erasmushuis Anderlecht]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The building was converted to a museum in 1931. Its garden is split into two parts that both try to adhere to the spirit of Erasmus; one through art and [[philosophy]] and the other through medicinal herbs from the 16th century. It was designated a historic monument on 25 October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;http://patrimoine.brussels/liens/registre/registre-du-patrimoine-protege-en-region-de-bruxelles-capitale-catalogue-illustre&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Everest Science Center Nepal''', located in Sitagunj, [[Sunsari]]; approximately seven kilometers west of Biratnagar,Nepal, is the only science center in [[Nepal]]. The Center was founded in 2001 by Dr. Dilip Adhikari. The Center and its exhibits concentrate upon easily available materials to teach Nepal's rural population. Its annual science fair, known as Bigyan Mela is said to be attended by more than 15,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In addition to the Center's [[Botany]], [[Zoology]] and [[Agriculture]] departments, it is home to Nepal's first Planetarium.It is mostly a family owned business that objectively caters the need to young students to think and explore beyond theoretical science education taught in Nepal's lower and higher secondary schools.

The '''Freedom Trail''' is a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} path through [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], that passes by 16 locations significant to the [[history of the United States]]. Marked largely with brick, it winds between [[Boston Common]] to the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]]. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. While most of the sites are free or suggest donations, the [[Old South Meeting House]], the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]], and the [[Paul Revere House]] charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/ |title=Freedom Trail |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported in part by grants from various nonprofits and foundations, private philanthropy, and [[Boston National Historical Park]].

The Freedom Trail was conceived by local journalist William Schofield, who in 1951 suggested building a pedestrian trail to link important local landmarks. Boston mayor [[John Hynes (politician)|John Hynes]] decided to put Schofield's idea into action. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the trail annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Northeastern University Press |isbn = 1-55553-161-X |publication-place = Boston |title = Building a new Boston: politics and urban renewal, 1950–1970 |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1737146M/Building_a_new_Boston |author = O'Connor, Thomas H. |publication-date = 1993 |id = 155553161X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Park Service operates a visitor's center on the first floor of Faneuil Hall, where they offer tours, provide free maps of the Freedom Trail and other historic sites, and sell books about Boston and United States history.

Some observers have noted the tendency of the Freedom Trail's [[Framing (social sciences)|narrative frame]] to omit certain historical locations, such as the sites of the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the [[Liberty Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Trouble with the Freedom Trail |author=Alfred F. Young |date=21 Mar 2004 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GOPAC''' is a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] (GOP) state and local political training organization. Although often thought of as a PAC, or [[political action committee|Political Action Committee]], it is actually a [[527 organization]]. It describes itself as "the premier training organization for Republican candidates in elected office on the state and local levels". GOPAC's mission is "educating and electing a new generation of Republican leaders".

==History==
GOPAC was founded by [[Delaware]] Governor [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] in 1978 in "an effort to build a farm team of Republican officeholders who could then run for congress or higher state offices later".&lt;ref name=corner /&gt; On February 1, 2007, former [[Maryland]] Lieutenant Governor [[Michael S. Steele|Michael Steele]] became the chairman and served until his election as chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] in January 2009. The current chairman of GOPAC is David Avella.&lt;ref name=corner&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gopac.org/chairmans-corner/|title=Chairman's Corner|website=GOPAC|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who have chaired GOPAC include former [[Oklahoma]] Governor [[Frank Keating]], former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Representative and [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Howard Callaway|Bo Callaway]], [[California]] Representative [[David Dreier]], [[Arizona]] Representative [[John Shadegg]], former Oklahoma Representative [[J.C. Watts]], Gay Gaines and former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]] of Georgia.

Instructional tapes used to train aspiring Republican politicians from 1986 to 1994 were selected by the [[Library of Congress]] as a 2010 addition to the [[National Recording Registry]] for their influence in "shaping political discourse". The Library of Congress selects recordings annually that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2010reg.html | title=The National Recording Registry 2010 | accessdate=April 10, 2011 | publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GOPAC memo of 1990==
Drawing rhetorical inspiration from Newt Gingrich, GOPAC wrote and distributed a memo to Republican Party legislative candidates in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Memo; For G.O.P. Arsenal, 133 Words to Fire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/09/us/political-memo-for-gop-arsenal-133-words-to-fire.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo, called "Language: A Key Mechanism of Control", contained a list of "contrasting words" and "optimistic positive governing words" that Gingrich recommended for use in describing Democrats and Republicans, respectively. For example, words to use against opponents include decay, failure (fail), collapse(ing), deeper, crisis, urgent(cy), destructive, destroy, sick, pathetic, lie, liberal, they/them, unionized bureaucracy, "compassion" is not enough, betray, consequences, limit(s), shallow, traitors, sensationalists; words to use in defining a candidate's own campaign and vision included share, change, opportunity, legacy, challenge, control, truth, moral, courage, reform, prosperity, crusade, movement, children, family, debate, compete, active(ly), we/us/our, candid(ly), humane, pristine, provide.

The cover page of the memo said: "The words in that paper are tested language from a recent series of focus groups where we actually tested ideas and language."&lt;ref name="fair"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fair.org/home/language-a-key-mechanism-of-control |title=Language: A Key Mechanism of Control |date=February 1995 |work=Fair.org |publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.utk.edu/~glenn/GopacMemo.html |publisher=UTK.edu |title=GOPAC Memo on Language (1990) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902053532/http://web.utk.edu/~glenn/GopacMemo.html |archivedate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic strip ''[[Doonesbury]] '' mentions the memo in a strip, calling it the "Magna Carta

'''Giorgio Vasari''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒordʒo vaˈzaːri|lang}}; 30 July 1511 – 27 June 1574) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[List of Italian painters|painter]], [[Architecture of Italy|architect]], writer, and historian, most famous today for his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', considered the ideological foundation of [[art history|art-historical]] writing.

==Early life==
Vasari was born on 30 July 1511 in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name=gaunt&gt;Gaunt, W. (ed.) (1962) ''Everyman's dictionary of pictorial art. Volume II.'' London: Dent, p. 328. {{ISBN|0-460-03006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommended at an early age by his cousin [[Luca Signorelli]], he became a pupil of [[Guglielmo da Marsiglia]], a skillful painter of [[stained glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelingintuscany.com/art/giorgiovasari.htm|title=Art in Tuscany {{!}} Giorgio Vasari and Italian Renaissance painting {{!}} Podere Santa Pia, Holiday house in the south of Tuscany|website=www.travelingintuscany.com|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sent to [[Florence]] at the age of sixteen by Cardinal Silvio Passerini, he joined the circle of [[Andrea del Sarto]] and his pupils [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and [[Jacopo Pontormo]], where his humanist education was encouraged. He was befriended by [[Michelangelo]], whose painting style would influence his own. He died on 27 June 1574 in [[Florence]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], at aged 62.&lt;ref name=gaunt/&gt;

[[File:Giorgio Vasari - The Garden of Gethsemane - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Giorgio Vasari, ''The Garden of Gethsemane'']]  
In 1529, he visited [[Rome]] where he studied the works of [[Raphael]] and other artists of the Roman [[High Renaissance]]. Vasari's own [[Mannerist]] paintings were more admired in his lifetime than afterwards. In 1547 he completed the hall of the chancery in Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome with frescoes that received the name [[Sala dei Cento Giorni]]. He was consistently employed by members of the [[Medici family]] in [[Florence]] and Rome, and worked in [[Naples]] (for example on the [[Vasari Sacristy]]), Arezzo and other places. Many of his pictures still exist, the most important being the wall and ceiling paintings in the Sala di Cosimo I in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in Florence, where he and his assistants were at work from 1555, and the frescoes begun by him inside the vast [[cupola]] of the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] were completed by [[Federico Zuccari]] and with the help of [[Giovanni Balducci]]. He also helped to organize the decoration of the [[Studiolo of Francesco I|Studiolo]], now reassembled in the Palazzo Vecchio.

Among his other pupils or followers are included [[Sebastiano Flori]], [[Bartolomeo Carducci]], Domenico Benci,  Tommaso del Verrocchio, Federigo di Lamberto (Federigo del Padovano), Niccolo Betti, Vittor Casini, [[Mirabello Cavalori]] (Salincorno), Jacopo Coppi (Jacopo di Meglio), Piero di Ridolfo, [[Stefano Veltroni]] of [[Monte San Savino]], Orazio Porta of Monte San Savino, [[Alessandro Fortori]] of Arezzo, Bastiano Flori of Arezzo, Fra Salvatore Foschi of Arezzo, and Andrea Aretino.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BaIZAAAAYAAJ ''The History of Painting in Italy: The Florentine, Sienese, and Roman schools''], by Luigi Lanzi, page 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Aside from his career as a painter, Vasari was also successful as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;"Vasari's ability as a painter cannot match his talents either as an historian or as an architect," according to [[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.4 (Facts on File, 2005): 695.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[loggia]] of the [[Uffizi|Palazzo degli Uffizi]] by the [[Arno]] opens up the vista at the far end of its long narrow courtyard. It is a unique piece of urban planning that functions as a public piazza, and which, if considered as a short street, is unique as a Renaissance street with a unified architectural treatment. The view of the Loggia from the Arno reveals that, with the [[Vasari Corridor]], it is one of very few structures that line the river which are open to the river itself and appear to embrace the riverside environment.

[[File:Firenze - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|right|The Uffizi Loggia]]
In Florence, Vasari also built the long passage, now called Vasari Corridor, which connects the Uffizi with the [[Palazzo Pitti]] on the other side of the river. The enclosed corridor passes alongside the River Arno on an arcade, crosses the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and winds around the exterior of several buildings. It was once the home of the Mercado de Vecchio.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N., ''A History of Building Types,'' Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

He also renovated the medieval churches of [[Santa Maria Novella]] and [[Basilica di Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. At both he removed the original [[rood screen]] and loft, and remodelled the retro-[[choir]]s in the Mannerist taste of his time.  In Santa Croce, he was responsible for the painting of ''The Adoration of the Magi'' which was commissioned by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1566 and completed in February 1567.  It was recently restored, before being put on exhibition in 2011 in Rome and in Naples.  Eventually it is planned to return it to the church of Santa Croce in [[Bosco Marengo]] (Province of Alessandria, Piedmont).

In 1562 Vasari built the octagonal dome on the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Humility]] in [[Pistoia]], an important example of [[high Renaissance]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Travelers Guide to Italy'' by David Bershad, Carolina Mangone, Irving Hexham 2001 {{ISBN|0-310-22573-6}}-page [https://books.google.com/books?id=KRkU9ocQr2oC&amp;pg=PA139]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, Vasari worked with [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] at [[Pope Julius III]]'s [[Villa Giulia]].

==''The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''==
{{main|Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects}}
[[File:Vite.jpg|thumb|A cover of the ''Lives'']]
Often called "the first art historian",&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/vasarig Vasari, Giorgio.] Dictionary of Art Historians, 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari invented the genre of the encyclopedia of artistic biographies with his ''Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori'' (''[[Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''), dedicated to Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], which was first published in 1550. He was the first to use the term "[[Renaissance]]" (''rinascita'') in print, though an awareness of the ongoing "rebirth" in the arts had been in the air since the time of [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]], and he was responsible for our use of the term [[Gothic Art]], though he only used the word Goth which he associated with the "barbaric" German style. The ''Lives'' also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural).

The work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of [[Florence, Italy|Florentines]], and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art – for example, the invention of [[engraving]]. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including [[Titian]]), it did so without achieving a neutral point of view. There are also many inaccuracies within his ''Lives''. For example, Vasari writes that [[Andrea del Castagno]] killed [[Domenico Veneziano]], which is not true, given Andrea died several years before Domenico.

Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young [[Giotto]] painting a fly on the surface of a painting by [[Cimabue]] that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism – with new materials opened up by research – has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions.

Vasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of the ''Lives'', and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]].

According to the historian Richard Goldthwaite,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Goldthwaite, ''The Economy of Renaissance Florence'', 2009, pp. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term "competition" (or "concorrenza" in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of [[Pietro Perugino]], in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so.  Competition, he said, is "one of the nourishments that maintain them."

==Social standing==

Vasari enjoyed high repute during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1547, he built himself a fine house in [[Arezzo]] (now a museum honouring him), and decorated its walls and vaults with paintings. He was elected to the municipal council or priori of his native town, and finally rose to the supreme office of [[gonfalonier]]e.

In 1563, he helped found the Florence [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']], with the Grand Duke and Michelangelo as ''capi'' of the institution and 36 artists chosen as members.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]], ‘Santi di Tito and the Florentine Academy: Solomon Building the Temple in the Capitolo of the Accademia del Disegno (1570-71),’ Apollo CLV, 480 (February 2002): 31-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Haarlem schutterij''' refers to a collective name for the voluntary [[Schutterij|civic guard]] of [[Haarlem]], from medieval times up to the [[Batavian Revolution]] in 1794, when the guilds of Haarlem were disbanded.

==History==
[[File:Samuel Ampzing - Lof der stad Haerlem - schutters van Haarlem 1628.jpg|thumb|Pages from [[Samuel Ampzing]]'s description of Haarlem listing the officers of the schutterij in 1628]]
During the [[Hook and Cod wars]] in 1402, Haarlem formed a hand bow schutterij under the patronage of St. George of 120 citizen volunteers to support the local court of Justice. The guild-like group had its own altar in the [[St. Bavochurch]] and they even had processions through town on the name day of their saint. The town suffered from uprisings in 1417 and 1422. After another uprising in 1425, a "New" schutterij was formed to educate young men in the use of the [[crossbow]] and they defended the city in 1426 against [[Jacoba of Beieren]].  The "New" crossbow schutterij had a new meeting hall built for them near the Spaarne river, and in 1468 a separate schutterij was formed under the patronage of [[St. Sebastian]] for hand bowmen. Around 1500 Haarlem had three schutterij groups, two (old and new) under the patronage of [[St. George]] (St. Joris), and one under the patronage of St. Sebastian, all with their own altars in church. 

In 1520 the Haarlem schutterij was reorganized; the two groups under St. Joris were merged into one group for crossbowmen and a new group was formed under the patron saint [[Adrian and Natalia of Nicomedia|St. Hadrian]] (St. Adrian), called ''Cloveniers''. Though the St. Sebastian group was also still active, by 1560 all were using muskets, and the town even owned some cannons, for which special "kannoniers" were trained. They still kept up their social activities in church, though the [[Protestant reformation]] began to cause various problems with their political support for the court of Justice.

The most heroic deeds of the Haarlem schutterij occurred during the Spanish [[siege of Haarlem]], which ended in victory for the Spanish. After the changeover to the Dutch Republic in 1581, the Haarlem schutters, or shooters, were reorganized into two groups, one keeping the name St. Joris and also called the "Oude schuts", and the other keeping the name Cloveniers, and receiving a new building in their old location in the Gasthuisstraat in 1612, leading them to earn the nickname "Nieuwe schuts". The activities of both groups around their church altars, including the yearly processions, were discontinued. Today many of the shooters have been immortalized in the group portraits by [[Frans Hals]] and other portrait painters on show at the [[Frans Hals museum]].

The split into two groups was more for convenience sake than for tradition, as the two groups were split geographically into a group north of the Bavochurch (officially renamed Grote Kerk) and a group south of the Bavochurch. 

==Cloveniers==
[[File:De doelen poort Haarlem.JPG|thumb|View of the keystone on the gatehouse to the Doelenplein around which the library is situated; it shows the weapons the 'shooters' carried.]]
The term "Cloveniers", or ''Cluveniers'', just means "musket bearers". The group name changed over time according to the fashions and locations of the guild. Until the siege of Haarlem they were under the patronage of the Saint Adrian, but were most often referred to as the "Jonge schuts", or "New shoots", since they were formed in 1520. After the siege, since all "Catholic" saints were banned, and they had a new meeting hall built in 1612, they became known as the "Nieuwe schuts", or "New shoots". That meeting hall in the Gasthuisstraat is still called the "Doelen" building after them. Today it is a study hall and part of the [[Stadsbibliotheek Haarlem|Haarlem Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;cOffset=1&amp;cLimit=25&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cSubmit=1&amp;sCompMonNr=19558 report] on [[Rijksmonument]] number 19558&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings by Hals and others hung in the main hall of the building in the Gasthuisstraat. Today all of the schutterstukken that once hung here have been transferred to the [[Frans Hals Museum]].

In 1577, the city council refurbished the main buildings of the old St. Michiels cloister to house the [[schutterij]] called the "Oude schuts", whose hall had been burned in the fire of 1572. Though they officially no longer had a patron saint, they were still referred to as the ''St. Jorisdoelen'', or ''St. George militia target field''. The former garden was converted to include two shooting lanes, and a new meeting hall was built in 1592.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;cOffset=1&amp;cLimit=25&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cSubmit=1&amp;sCompMonNr=19243 report] on [[Rijksmonument]] number 19243&lt;/ref&gt; Today the location  houses a shop, restaurant, and a [[hofje]] surrounds the garden called the [[Proveniershuis]].

The '''Historische Lexikon Bayerns''' (abbr: ''HLB'') or '''Historical Lexicon of Bavaria''' is a  specialist, historical [[lexicon]] about the [[History of Bavaria]], which has been published as a genuine [[online publication]]. It is the first specialised lexicon on the history of the [[Free State of Bavaria]] and its various regions.

== History and development ==
The concept of publishing an online encyclopedia on the history of Bavaria has been worked on since the late 1990s. Work on the lexicon began in February 2005, the first articles on the module [[Weimar Republic]] were published in May 2006. By the end of 2015, the HLB, which had been expanded with modules on the [[Late Middle Ages]] in 2007 and the [[History of Germany (1945–90)|post-1945 period]] in 2008, had grown to 966 articles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/HLB:Bearbeitungsstand, retrieved 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the HLB is to provide comprehensive coverage of all historical eras in Bavaria since the time of [[prehistory]]. Authors of the articles are professional historians and experts in their particular field.

The HLB sees itself as part of the Bavarian Regional Library Online which has been developed since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bayerische-landesbibliothek-online.de/histlexbay ''www.bayerische-landesbibliothek-online.de''], retrieved 9 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the linked to the Bavarian cultural portal, [[bavarikon]]. In 2014/2015 the HLB underwent an extensive technical and optical [[relaunch]]. Since then, it has been possible to conduct a search by eras and categories, as well as entering it via a [[map (cartography)|map]].

== Management structure ==
The sponsors of the HLB are the [[Bavarian State Library]] (BSB), the Commission for Bavarian Regional History at the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]] and the Conference of Regional Historians at the Bavarian universities. Its editorial team is located at the Bavarian State Library.

The project leader of the HLB is the head of Bavarica unit of BSB, Stephan Kellner. The lead historian is Ferdinand Kramer, Institute of Bavarian History at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].
Technical support is provided by the [[Munich Digitization Centre]] / Digital Library of BSB (Director: Markus Brantl).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/HLB:Traeger, retrieved 9 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Target audience ==
The HLB is aimed both at specialist historians as well as that element of the wider public interested in history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/HLB:Das_Lexikon, retrieved 9 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Layout ==
The HLB's articles are structured as in a traditional specialist lexicon. It provides information  based on the most current research on particular subjects in compressed form. In addition, the articles are supplemented by short extracts and other information in the form of significant secondary literature, illustrations, primary sources and [[Hyperlink|external links]]; the HLB thereby benefits from the growing electronic section of the Bavarian State Library and other institutions, by being directly linked to [[digitalised]] sources and works.

All article content is indexed by [[Integrated Authority File|standard people and location data]]. Readers are able to make comments and suggestions to the author of the article via the editorial staff.

("If you will it, it is no dream.")&lt;ref&gt;Fiammetta Martegani,

On its establishment in 2006, the organization stated that its mission was to renew "Zionist discourse, Zionist thinking and Zionist ideology to ensure the future of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel."&lt;ref name="NPNG" &gt;Nicola Perugini, [[Neve Gordon]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=F8n9CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69 ''The Human Right to Dominate,''] [[Oxford University Press]], 2015 p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming to "strengthen and advance the values of Zionism in Israel", it sees itself as dedicated to combating a "campaign of de-legitimization against the State of Israel and to [provide] responses to [[Post-Zionism|Post-Zionist]] and [[Anti-Zionism| Anti-Zionist]] phenomena".&lt;ref name="Im Tirtzu movement" /&gt; Im Tirtzu is mostly known for its campaigns against the [[New Israel Fund]], foreign government-funded NGOs, and alleged bias in the [[curriculum|curricula]] of Israeli universities.
According to critics, Im Tirtzu's strategies focus on delegitimizing Israeli left and human-rights groups and driving a wedge between them and their funding sources.&lt;ref name="NPNG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Natanel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RbQwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 ''Sustaining Conflict: Apathy and Domination in Israel-Palestine,''] [[University of California Press]] 2016 pp.170-171, p.209 n.5:‘Deemed fascist and McCarthyist by Ha’aretz journalist Gideon Levy, Im Tirtzu is a right-wing extra-parliamentary organization which “works to strengthen and advance the values of Zionism in Israel.”: it does so in part through targeting academics, institutions, and organizations deemed ‘anti-Zionist’ by its own estimation.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Tirtzu operates fifteen branches at universities and colleges throughout the country&lt;ref name="Im Tirtzu movement" /&gt; and runs the largest Zionist academic extra-curricular program in Israel.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lidar Gravé-Lazi |date=29 June 2016 |title=Boosting Zionist education – within Israel |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Boosting-Zionist-education-within-Israel-459097 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some have maintained that Im Tirtzu bears similarities to fascist groups,&lt;ref name="Hasson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Court to rule on anti-Im Tirzu Facebook page |author=Joanna Paraszczuk |date=13 February 2012 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Court-to-rule-on-anti-Im-Tirzu-Facebook-page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have labelled it an important Zionist movement.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=PM Netanyahu's message to 'Im Tirtzu' supporters |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nSxRPGCRew |via=YouTube |accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Nobel Prize Laureate Yisrael Aumann Congratulating IMTI's Program for Zionist Thought |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbrJ-gjD8I0&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLVLWOBzqoMSsrCkNvWBGGD1eK7wiK4DSy |via=YouTube |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Im Tirtzu has received wide support from the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Im Tirtzu" Celebrated a Decade of Activity|url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/502095|website=Israel Hayom|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Minister of the State of Israel and the Prime Minister Congratulate Im Tirtzu|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6yrEVsG0Jo|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==
Im Tirtzu was set up in 2006, and soon was closely meshed with  a network of other  bodies, new and old, such as [[The Legal Forum for the Land of Israel]], [[My Israel|Israel  Sheli]], [[Institute for Zionist Strategies]], and  [[NGO Monitor]], organized to further Zionist aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Chazan]], 'Israel and the World: The Democracy Factor,' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBbFw6hb_68C&amp;pg=PA80 ''Israel in the World: Legitimacy and Exceptionalism,'']  [[Routledge]], 2013 pp.73-96 p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; It was little known until February 2010 when it made headlines with a claim that  Israeli NGOs, esp. the [[New Israel Fund]],  were in good part responsible for the damage to Israel’s international standing that resulted from the publication  of the [[Goldstone Report]] regarding the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|conduct of the 2008-2009 Gaza War]]. Some three months later, [[Kadima]] led by [[Ronit Tirosh]], together with right wing parties, proposed a bill to outlaw any NGO that furnished foreign or international organizations with information that might buttress accusations of war  crimes by either Israel or the [[Israeli Defense Forces|IDF]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nathan Jeffay,[https://forward.com/news/127974/kadima-bill-ngos-that-assist-in-war-crime-accusat/ Kadima Bill: NGOs That Assist in War Crime Accusations Should Be Illegal] [[The Forward]] 12 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==
=== Alleging politicization in academia ===
==== Ben-Gurion University ====
In 2008, Im Tirtzu published a report about the syllabuses used in various academic departments in Israel. According to the report, authors who reject the notion of nationality, or support [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] views, get much more exposure in reading lists. In 2010, Im Tirtzu sent Rivka Karmi, the head of the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] a letter, demanding that the university stop the anti-Zionist bias in its Department of Politics and Government. The letter alleged that 9 out of 11 professors in the department were involved in extreme left-wing activities (among others, attempting to persuade other countries to join the [[academic boycott of Israel]]). Im Tirtzu threatened to notify the donors of the university if the problem was not rectified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Amit Barak |date=5 December 2011 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/An-open-letter-to-the-president-of-Ben-Gurion-University |title=An open letter to the president of Ben-Gurion University |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint statement about the above campaign, the heads of Israel's seven leading universities urged condemnation of what they called Im Tirtzu's "dangerous attempt to create a thought police".&lt;ref name=IPS1&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Jerrold Kessel]] |author2=Pierre Klochendler |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/08/mideast-mccarthyism-rises-in-israel/ |title='McCarthyism' Rises in Israel |publisher=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Im Tirtzu responded, "All Im Tirtzu asked from BGU is that a solution be found to the extreme bias found in the Political Science department, where only [[Post-Zionism|post-Zionist]] opinions are presented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan Illouz |date=23 August 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/McCarthyism-and-post-Zionism |title=McCarthyism and post-Zionism |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Im Tirtzu's report, the Israeli Council for Higher Education appointed an international committee to investigate the allegations. The committee came to the conclusion that the curriculum in the Political Science department was imbalanced. The committee said it was "concerned that the study of politics as a scientific discipline may be impeded by such strong emphasis on political activism", and recommended closing the department unless changes were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tamar Trabelsi-Hadad |date=23 November 2011 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4152161,00.html|title=Recommendation: Shut down 'leftist' department |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was widely criticized by academics, who said that it was politically motivated, noting that well-known scholars had been rejected from the committee because of their political views and that the original committee chair had resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international-academics-seek-to-keep-biased-department-at-israeli-university-open-1.402450 |date=20 December 2011 |title=International academics seek to keep 'biased' department at Israeli university open |first=Talila |last=Nesher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Education, [[Gideon Sa'ar]], said "I believe the report is important since it encourages public discussion" but rejected any attempts to block or apply conditions for donations to Israeli universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[Coalition of Women for Peace]] |title=All-Out War: Israel Against Democracy |date=November 2010 |page=33 |url=http://coalition.s482.sureserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/AllOutWar-internet-ENG.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jp20101018&gt;{{cite news |author=Ron Friedman |title=Right-wing group Im Tirzu threatens BGU donations|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Right-wing-group-Im-Tirzu-threatens-BGU-donations |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Im Tirtzu alleged that Ben-Gurion University was sponsoring a conference featuring the CEO and public relations coordinator of [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]] in violation of a ruling by Israel's Council for Higher Education against politicizing academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lea Speyer |date=20 May 2016 |title=Watchdog: Ben-Gurion University Actively Supporting Delegitimization of Israel With Sponsorship of Conference Featuring Breaking the Silence |url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2016/05/20/watchdog-ben-gurion-university-actively-supporting-delegitimization-of-israel-with-sponsorship-of-breaking-the-silence-conference/ |newspaper=[[Algemeiner Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University denied claims of politicization and responded that it is a "pluralistic academic institution, which promotes and enables an open and diverse dialogue and does not seek to espouse a particular political viewpoint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Israel |date=18 May 2016 |title=Ben-Gurion University Sponsoring 'Breaking the Silence' Event (Updated)|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/ben-gurion-university-sponsoring-breaking-the-silence-event/2016/05/18/|newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the conference, a prominent donor and longstanding member of the university's board of governors announced that he was withholding a donation of $1 million due to the conference. The university responded that they were unaware of such a pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lidar Gravé-Lazi |date=27 May 2016 |title=Donor Withholds $1M. From BGU over Breaking the Silence Panel |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Donor-withholds-1m-from-BGU-over-Breaking-the-Silence-panel-455179 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Haifa University legal clinics ====
In 2013 Im Tirtzu released a report alleging "severe politicization" of the legal clinics at the University of Haifa. According to the report, 80% of the cases treated by the clinics dealt with security prisoners, among those convicted of terrorism and espionage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Kalman Liebskind]] |date=3 November 2013 |title=כך פועלת אונ' חיפה למען ייצוג מחבלים |language=he |trans-title=This is How Haifa University Works for Terrorists |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/518/845.html |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report charged that certain clinics of the University are part of the "Arab nationalist struggle against Zionism" and "cooperate with organizations that oppose the existence of the State of Israel as a democratic state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 November 2013 |title=Im Tirtzu: University of Haifa legal clinics are politicized |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=13065 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the report, then Minister of Education [[Shai Piron]] together with the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] commissioned an international committee of experts to investigate the clinics. In 2016, the committee published its recommendations that matched "virtually all of the conclusions from the Im Tirtzu report".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Im Tirtzu: Decision to investigate legal clinics 'historic' step |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/218197|publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hebrew University's Minerva Center for Human Rights ====
Following numerous media reports citing Im Tirtzu's criticism of a Minerva Center program that offers students four academic credits and a scholarship in exchange for interning eight hours per week at a human rights organization, a group of bereaved families penned a letter to Education Minister [[Naftali Bennett]] calling on him to investigate the program.&lt;ref name="JPost Bereaved Families"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lidar Gravé-Lazi |date=19 October 2016 |title=Exclusive: Bereaved Families Call Hebrew U. Human Rights Program 'Anti-Israel' |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Exclusive-Bereaved-families-call-Hebrew-U-human-rights-program-anti-Israel-470381 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the bereaved families, they were "horrified" to learn that the program allows for internship at organizations including [[B'Tselem]], [[HaMoked]] and [[Public Committee Against Torture in Israel]], which they called "anti-Israel" organizations.&lt;ref name="JPost Bereaved Families" /&gt;

At a Knesset Education Committee that was convened to discuss the program, Hebrew University's legal advisor Pepi Yakirevich stated: "The program asks of students to volunteer 8 weekly hours in human rights organizations that the Law Faculty sees of holding high importance.... Do you expect for the Hebrew University to act as a content filter? At the moment there is no red line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 December 2016 |author=Eliran Karsenty |title=ההורים השכולים זעקו: "מתירים את דם יקירנו" |language=he |trans-title=The Cry of the Bereaved Families: They are Permitting the Blood of our Loved Ones |url=http://www.20il.co.il/%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%99%D7%93%D7%90%D7%95-%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%93-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%92-%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%9E/ |publisher=[[Channel 20 (Israel)|Channel 20]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American Anthropological Association boycott vote ====
In 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report alleging the involvement of Israeli academics in the proposed resolution of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) to impose an academic boycott on Israel. The report cited a letter allegedly sent by 20 Israeli academics that the group said encouraged the members to vote in favor of the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lidar Gravé-Lazi |date=27 May 2016 |title=20 Israeli academics encourage BDS, Im Tirtzu says |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/20-Israeli-academics-encourage-BDS-Im-Tirtzu-says-455181 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=JNS |date=26 May 2016 |title=Report: 20 Israeli Academics Encourage Anthropology Association's Boycott of Israel |url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2016/05/26/report-20-israeli-academics-encourage-anthropology-associations-boycott-of-israel/ |newspaper=[[Algemeiner Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the report, [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] Member of Knesset [[Oded Forer]] called an emergency session of the Knesset Education Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Altman |date=29 May 2016 |title=MK pushes for Knesset meeting on anti-Israel academic boycott |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=33987 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was attended by MKs from both sides of the political aisle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 June 2016 |agency=JNi.Media |title=Heated Debate at Education Committee Emergency Session on Pro-BDS Israeli Academics|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/heated-debate-at-education-committee-emergency-session-on-pro-bds-israeli-academics/2016/06/08/|newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli involvement in Israeli Apartheid Week ===
In 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report stating that a number of Israeli citizens and organizations were among the participants in the annual [[Israeli Apartheid Week]]. The report named [[Zochrot]] and individuals including [[Ilan Pappe]], [[Uri Davis]] and [[Jeff Halper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Im Tirzu report exposes Israelis behind 'Apartheid Week' |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=32471 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guy Davidi]], producer of [[5 Broken Cameras]] who was also named in the report, responded by saying: "I strongly reject the attempt to present boycott actions taken by Israelis as an act of treason. In my view, boycotting and divesting are legitimate political actions that represent a positive way to protest -- a positive alternative to violent action, which I strongly condemn. It is the right of every person to choose to boycott certain products if they don't accept the origin or the way the product is manufactured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Altman |date=16 March 2016 |title=Im Tirzu report exposes Israelis behind 'Apartheid Week' |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=32471 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nakba Harta campaign ===
In May 2011, with the approach of [[Nakba Day]], Im Tirtzu launched a campaign accompanied by a 70-page booklet titled "Nakba Harta" in Hebrew (נכבה חרטא), translated by ''The Jerusalem Post'' as "Nakba BS", and titled "Nakba Nonsense" in English.&lt;ref name=jp20110513/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakba Nonsense"/&gt; The booklet describes the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]], called ''Nakba'' by [[Palestinians]], as "a lie that threatens to drown us like a tsunami" and attempts to discredit what Im Tirtzu regards as "a narrative of myths and lies dealing with the teaching of the founding of the State of Israel".&lt;ref name=jp20110513&gt;{{cite news |title= Im Tirtzu launches campaign against 'myths' of the Nakba |url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Im-Tirtzu-launches-campaign-against-myths-of-the-Nakba | newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=13 May 2011 |author=Ben Hartman |author2=Lahav Harkov |accessdate=15 May 2011 |quote=As Palestinians in the West Bank and Arab Israelis inside the Green Line plan to commemorate 'Nakba Day' on 15 May, the right-wing student group Im Tirtzu has launched a campaign to discredit what it says is a narrative of myths and lies dealing with the teaching of the founding of the State of Israel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakba Nonsense"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erez Tadmor |author2=Erel Segal |title=Nakba-Nonsense |url=https://imti.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%98%D7%90-%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA.pdf |publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;!--Hebrew URL; English document --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 2011, dozens of Im Tirtzu activists gathered outside the offices of [[UNRWA]] in Jerusalem holding signs and chanting, "They expelled, they attacked, they lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eli |first=Yossi |title=פעילי אם תרצו מפגינים מול משרדי אונר"א נגד יום הנכבה |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/HP_487.html |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]] |date=15 May 2011 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Tens of Im Tirtzu activists protest outside UNRWA offices against Nakba Day |accessdate=15 May 2011 |quote=עשרות פעילי תנועת "אם תרצו" מפגינים מול משרדי אונר"א, סמוך לגבעת התחמושת בירושלים תחת הכותרת "נכבה חארטה" בסמוך ומניפים שלטים כנגד יום הנכבה והאו"ם וקוראים: "הם גרשו, הם תקפו ,הם הפסידו". |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511193033/http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/HP_487.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Im Tirtzu set up a 15-foot-tall inflatable Pinocchio doll across from the Nakba ceremony at [[Tel Aviv University]] in order to "emphasize the lie of the Nakba."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dov Lieber |date=15 May 2016 |title=Nakba rally faces right-wing protest at Tel Aviv University |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/nakba-rally-faces-right-wing-protest-at-tel-aviv-university/ |publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for IDF soldiers ===
Im Tirtzu has acted in a number of ways to support IDF soldiers:

* In March 2010, the "Azad" restaurant in Haifa refused to serve IDF soldiers claiming that "the uniform does not serve the atmosphere or the place". In response, Im Tirtzu protested outside the restaurant and even assisted the soldiers in filing a lawsuit. The Haifa supreme court ruled that this was an act of severe discrimination against IDF soldiers and required the restaurant owners to pay the soldiers a sum of 5,000 NIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Halley |date=2 February 2011 |title=המסעדה שסירבה לשרת חייל – תשלם לו |language=he |trans-title=The restaurant that refused to serve a soldier will pay him |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/207/309.html |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 February 2011 |title=Haifa Restaurant Azad to Pay Soldier NIS 5000 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Haifa-restaurant-Azad-to-pay-soldier-NIS-5000 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work with minorities ===
Im Tirtzu has advocated for minorities in Israel to join the Israeli military. The Forum for Drafting the Christian Community and its founder Father [[Gabriel Naddaf]] have worked closely with Im Tirtzu to encourage and promote the safety of [[Christianity in Israel|Christian Israelis]] who wish to perform IDF service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Elhanan Miller |date=27 June 2013 |title=In Arab Israel, a battle over Christian conscription |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-arab-israel-a-battle-over-christian-conscription/|publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Father [[Gabriel Naddaf]] |date=29 March 2015 |title=It's hard to be a Christian in Israel, but not because of prejudice |url=http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Its-hard-to-be-a-Christian-in-Israel-but-not-because-of-prejudice-395467 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father Naddaf is a frequent guest speaker at Im Tirtzu events and sits on their Public Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Council |url=https://imti.org.il/en/about-us/council/ |publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Israeli Arabs who promote the integration of minorities in Israeli society have received awards from the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 March 2016 |agency=JNi.Media |title=Rightwing Israeli Group Awards Zoabi for Advocacy on Behalf of Israel [video]|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/rightwing-israeli-group-awards-zoabi-for-advocacy-on-behalf-of-israel-video/2016/03/31/|newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]] |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Roy Arad|Roy "Chicky" Arad]] |date=28 December 2014 |title=איך "ערביה טובה" מנסה לשכנע את מתפקדי הבית היהודי לבחור בה |language=he |trans-title=How a "good Arab" tries to convince members of The Jewish Home to choose her |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/elections/.premium-1.2523282 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Tirtzu has also organized social activities with Israeli minorities, including distributing clothing and toys in [[Bedouin]] kindergartens and organizing meetings and tours in [[Druze]] villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Boaz Wolinitz |date=18 October 2010 |title=פעילי "אם תרצו" חילקו צעצועים לילדי הבדואים |language=he |trans-title=Im Tirtzu activists distributed toys to Bedouin children |url=http://news.walla.co.il/item/1745116 |publisher=[[Walla!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an act of vandalism against Jerusalem's [[Dormition Abbey]], in which vandals spray-painted anti-Christian slogans, Im Tirtzu activists arrived for a solidarity visit. Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg stated: "[We] see this as an act that is at its very core both anti-Zionist as well as anti-Israeli, an act which dangerously threatens all of the Israeli society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Benjamin Glatt |date=18 January 2016 |title=Im Tirzu Movement Shows Solidarity with Defaced Jerusalem Abbey |url=http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Im-Tirzu-movement-shows-solidarity-with-defaced-abbey-441918 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a new parliamentary caucus to encourage minorities to join the army was created based on the idea of Im Tirtzu. The opening ceremony of the caucus was attended by MKs from the right, center, and left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ariel Ben Solomon |date=14 October 2015 |title=New parliamentary group created to encourage minorities to join army |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-parliamentary-group-created-to-encourage-minorities-to-join-army-424945 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Im Tirtzu's fourth annual Zionist Conference for Human Rights centered around the integration of minorities, featuring speeches from Deputy Minister [[Ayoob Kara]], Father [[Gabriel Naddaf]] and other Israeli Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dov Lieber |date=11 December 2016 |title=PA ministers secretly hope there won't be Palestinian state, deputy minister claims |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/pa-ministers-pleading-there-wont-be-palestinian-state-deputy-minister-claims/ |publisher=[[The Times of Israel]] |accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Program for Zionist Thought ===
In 2012, Im Tirtzu inaugurated its first Program for Zionist Thought, a serious of lectures given by prominent Israeli figures and personalities. The program is featured at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], Ben-Gurion University, [[University of Haifa]], [[Bar-Ilan University]], and [[Ariel University]].

Some of the speakers include Nobel Prize laureate [[Robert Aumann]], [[Caroline Glick]], [[Nitsana Darshan-Leitner]], Father Gabriel Naddaf, [[Ben-Dror Yemini]], [[Mordechai Kedar]], Major General [[Yaakov Amidror]], former MK [[Einat Wilf]], Rabbi [[David Stav]], Yoram Ettinger, and Ran Baratz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Program for Zionist Thought |url=http://imti.ravpage.co.il/pzt |publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jordan Scope |date=3 March 2015 |title=מרצים מוחים על סמינר ש"אם תרצו" מעבירה באוניברסיטאות: "התוכנית אינה אקדמית" |language=he |trans-title=Lecturers protest seminar that Im Tirtzu gave at universities: 'The program isn't academic' |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/.premium-1.2579028 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is the largest Zionist academic extra-curricular program in Israel.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

=== Hebron tours ===
In 2016 Im Tirtzu began to organize student tours of Hebron together with the [[Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 December 2016 |agency=JNi.Media |title=Breaking the Silence: Teaching Hebron's Real Jewish History to Young Israelis |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/jewish-news/breaking-the-silence-teaching-hebrons-real-jewish-history-to-young-israelis/2016/12/01/ |newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg, the tours are aimed to provide an answer to the tours of Hebron given by left-wing NGO [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], which he dubs "de-legitimization and lies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shakked Auerbach |date=24 March 2017 |title=The Right Angle: A Nationalist Group Takes Israelis on a Tour of Hebron |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.779062 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ten year anniversary conference ===
In September 2017 Im Tirtzu held a conference celebrating ten years of activity. Hundreds of activists and supporters participated in the event, which featured a keynote speech from Speaker of the Knesset [[Yuli-Yoel Edelstein]] and video-recorded congratulatory messages from Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Defense Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]], Education Minister [[Naftali Bennett]], Justice Minister [[Ayelet Shaked]], Jerusalem Mayor [[Nir Barkat]], and a number of other ministers, members of Knesset, and cultural figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Im Tirtzu" Celebrated a Decade of Activity|url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/502095|website=Israel Hayom|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Minister of the State of Israel and the Prime Minister Congratulate Im Tirtzu|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6yrEVsG0Jo|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaign against Jenin, Jenin movie director Mohammed Bakri ===
{{undue|section|date=December 2017}}
In 2012, Im Tirtzu organized a campaign against Israeli-Arab actor [[Mohammed Bakri]] who was slated to appear in [[Federico Garcia Lorca]]'s ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba]]'' at [[Tel Aviv]]'s Tzavta Theater. Im Tirtzu objected to Bakri because of his involvement in the film ''[[Jenin, Jenin]]''. In a ''[[Haaretz]]'' opinion piece, Im Tirtzu chairman Ronen Shoval called ''Jenin, Jenin'' an antisemitic [[blood libel]] "unprecedented in its fierceness" and referred to Bakri as a "sophisticated enemy". Shoval accused the Tzavta Club of offering a platform to "an inciter and a liar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shoval |first=Ronen |authorlink=Ronen Shoval |title=מגיניו של בכרי |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/1.1641903 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=15 February 2012 |language=He |trans-title=Bakri's defenders |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind the curtain of a right-wing campaign against an Israeli-Arab actor |author=[[Michael Handelzalts]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/behind-the-curtain-of-a-right-wing-campaign-against-an-israeli-arab-actor-1.410100 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of New Israel Fund &amp; foreign government funded NGOs ==

=== New Israel Fund ===
In 2010, Im Tirtzu published a document&lt;ref name="israelbehindthenews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelbehindthenews.com/library/pdfs/NIFGoldstone.pdf |title=The influence of New Israel Fund organizations on the Goldstone Report |publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched a campaign in the Israeli media that said there were connections between organizations supported by the New Israel Fund and the [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict]] (also known as the Goldstone Report). Im Tirtzu said that 92 percent of all Israeli testimonials in the report came from NIF funded organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.haaretz.com/the-new-israel-fund-for-deepening-the-jewish-arab-rift-1.263120 |title= The New Israel Fund for Deepening the Jewish-Arab Rift| author= Israel Harel | date=11 February 2010 |work=[[Haaretz]] | accessdate = 7 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign included "vilifying" NIF chairwoman [[Naomi Chazan]] as an agent of Hamas and Iran&lt;ref name="Hedges" /&gt; and the diffusion of posters caricaturing her with a horn strapped by a string on her forehead (in Hebrew, the word for "horn" also means "fund"),&lt;ref name=horn&gt;{{cite news | author = Esti Ahronovitz | title = Fighting for Israel's soul | newspaper=[[Haaretz]] | url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/fighting-for-israel-s-soul-1.374700 |date = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a caption reading ''Naomi-Goldstone-Chazan.''&lt;ref name="Hedges" &gt;[[Chris Hedges]],[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ow85DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT138 ''Death of the Liberal Class,''] Hachette UK, 2010 p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ron Kampeas]] ([[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]) Im Tirtzu's report said 16 NIF affiliated groups comprised 14 percent of all sources for the Goldstone report, while stating in a separate section that these constitute 92 percent of Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report; some reporting had incorrectly confused the two separate figures and accused Im Tirzu as being inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking down the Im Tirtzu report on New Israel Fund|url=https://www.jta.org/2010/02/10/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/breaking-down-the-im-tirtzu-report-on-new-israel-fund|website=JTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the report there were calls in the Knesset to investigate the NIF and its operational arms in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glick|first1=Caroline |authorlink=Caroline Glick |title=Column One: The NIF and the next war|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Column-One-The-NIF-and-the-next-war|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benny Begin]], a cabinet minister at the time, characterized the allegations Im Tirtzu published as "lies" in a radio interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Menachem Rahat |date=4 February 2015 |title=ד"ר בגין ומיסטר בני |language=he |trans-title=Dr. Begin and Mr. Benny |publisher=[[News1]] |url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-99669-00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abe Foxman]] said it was "absurd to blame Goldstone on the NIF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Knesset Slimers Retreat After Foxman Slams Defamation of New Israel Fund |author=[[J.J.

Chazan claimed that, in her eyes, the campaign was directed against democracy itself.&lt;ref name=horn/&gt; The executive director of the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]], Hagai El-Ad, denied Im Tirtzu's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/pins-in-the-goldstone-voodoo-doll-1.290274 | author = Hagai El-Ad | title=Pins in the Goldstone voodoo doll | date = 13 May 2010 | newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gideon Levy]], writing in ''Haaretz'', likened Im Tirtzu's campaign against NIF to fascist tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/im-tirtzu-hides-behind-respectable-mask-of-zionism-1.262891 | author = [[Gideon Levy]] | title=Im Tirtzu hides behind respectable mask of 'Zionism' | date = 7 February 2010 | newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gershon Baskin]], a columnist in ''The Jerusalem Post'', spoke out about the newspaper's decision to cancel Naomi Chazan's column and accused Im Tirtzu of using an "anti-Semitic motif" as part of a "witch-hunt" that "is reminiscent of the darkest days of McCarthyism".&lt;ref name=jp-dark&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/A-dark-day-for-democracy |title=A dark day for democracy |last=Baskin |first=Gershon |authorlink=Gershon Baskin |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That poster was called "style ''Der Stürmer''" by the Facebook group "Im Tirzu - fascists" and was charged for libel by "Im Tirtzu". Judge Refael Yaakobi accepted the characterization of Im Tirtzu's poster as being similar in style to that of the Nazi party's newspaper, writing in the court's decision, "examining that publication and the source for comparison reveals that indeed there is truth in the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Oren Persico |date=7 September 2013 |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/77493 |title=לא לסטריליות: שופט המחוזי דחה בפסק דין את רוב תביעת הדיבה של אם-תרצו וקרא לצדדים להפסיק את המשפט |language=he |trans-title=Unsterile: District judge rejected the verdict of Im Tirtzu's libel suit and called on the parties to stop the trial |publisher=[[HaAyin HaShevi'it]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Operation Pillar of Defense]], Im Tirtzu published an open letter in American Jewish newspapers addressed to the New Israel Fund chair. The letter gave examples of NIF funded organizations that Im Tirtzu said accused Israel of war crimes, and asked if the NIF agrees with their accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://israelbehindthenews.com/an-open-letter-to-the-new-israel-fund/9139/ An Open Letter to the New Israel Fund], Israel Behind the News, Media Reprints, 14 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The NIF rebutted Im Tirtzu's charges, stating, "Not one of the human rights organizations Im Tirtzu attacks accused Israel of war crimes in the recent Gaza action." NIF also quoted [[Avichai Mandelblit]], the IDF's Chief Military Advocate General during Operation Cast Lead: "The organizations are a conduit for getting information on very important matters so that IDF activity is normative.... I'm trying to get at the truth and they really help us do that. Our cooperation with B'tselem [A NIF-supported group] stands out. They help us to speak with witnesses, to investigate complaints ... with all of the criticism from these organizations on us, their goal is to get to the truth."&lt;ref name=nif20121213&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet following Im Tirtzu Ad Blitz |url=http://www.nif.org/news-media/press-releases/fact-sheet-following-im-tirtzu-ad-blitz/ |publisher=[[New Israel Fund]] |date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign Agents campaign ===
In December 2015, Im Tirtzu launched a campaign calling Israeli left-wing and human rights organizations that receive funding from foreign entities as "foreign agents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign Agents Report|url=https://imti.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Foreign-Agents-Report-2.pdf|publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zionist NGO: Leftist groups sabotaging Israel 'from within'|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=30425|newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It released a video depicting the heads of these organizations as foreign agents encouraging terrorist attacks; the [[Anti-Defamation League]] criticized the video as "hate speech;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 December 2015 |title=ADL slams right-wing 'foreign-backed moles' video |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/adl-slams-right-wing-foreign-backed-moles-video/ |publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lawsuit against Im Tirtzu for incitement to violence was dismissed after the Attorney General determined that the video was urging the Israeli public to support MK [[Yoav Kisch]]'s "foreign agent bill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gideon Allon |author2=Shlomo Cesana |date=18 December 2015 |title=17 MKs back bill labeling left-wing NGOs as foreign 'plants' |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=30527|newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shlomo Piotrokovsky |date=24 January 2016 |title=Im Tirzu video won't be probed for 'incitement' |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/206937 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made a Facebook post calling a number of Israeli artists "cultural foreign agents". Following criticism, Im Tirtzu apologized and CEO Matan Peleg decided to suspend himself over the decision to upload the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 January 2016 |title=Im Tirtzu head suspends self over 'culture mole' campaign|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/im-tirtzu-head-suspends-self-over-culture-mole-campaign/|publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gil Ronen |date=31 January 2016 |title=Im Tirtzu head suspends himself |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/207315 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HaMoked ===
In 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report claiming that the Israeli NGO [[HaMoked]] received over 15 million NIS from European governments and has submitted nearly 60 petitions to the Supreme Court from mid-2014 to 2016 on behalf of 48 families of Palestinian terrorists responsible for the murder of 50 people.&lt;ref name="JPost NGO receives"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lidar Gravé-Lazi |date=13 February 2017 |title=Human Rights NGO Receives NIS 15m. From Europe |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Human-Rights-NGO-receives-NIS-15m-from-Europe-481451|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HaMoked declined to comment on the report.&lt;ref name="JPost NGO receives" /&gt;

In response to the report, MK Oded Forer submitted a bill that would require organizations that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments to declare their funding sources on every document submitted to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Lis |date=13 February 2017 |title=הצעת חוק: עמותות שעיקר מימונן ממדינות זרות יידרשו להצהיר על כך בפני בג"ץ |language=he |trans-title=Bill: Organizations That Receive the Majority of Their Funding From Foreign Governments Will Need to Declare Such in Front of the High Court |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politi/1.3849973 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zochrot ===
Im Tirtzu released a report ahead of 2017's International Holocaust Remembrance Day detailing Germany's funding of the NGO [[Zochrot]], which works to "promote Israeli Jewish society's acknowledgement of and accountability for the ongoing injustices of the Nakba and the reconceptualization of Return as the imperative redress of the Nakba".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Vision |url=http://zochrot.org/en/content/17 |publisher=[[Zochrot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, the Government of Germany had provided over 1,100,000 shekels ($290,000) to Zochrot from 2012 to 2016, which is used by Zochrot to engage in "anti-Israeli" activities including screening its "Film Festival on Nakba and the Right of Return" on college campuses during "Israeli Apartheid Week", promoting an "iNakba" smartphone application, and accusing Israel of "ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 January 2017 |agency=JNi.Media |title=Outrage: Germany to Observe Holocaust Remembrance Day while Funding Anti-Israel NGO |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/outrage-germany-to-observe-holocaust-remembrance-day-while-funding-anti-israel-ngo/2017/01/25/ |newspaper=[[The Jewish Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Tirtzu contacted the German Ambassador to Israel over the funding, yet received no response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Rosenberg |date=27 January 2017 |title='Germany dishonoring the memory of the murdered Six Million' |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/223966 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machsom Watch ===
In May 2011 the organization called on Attorney-General [[Yehuda Weinstein]] to launch a criminal investigation into the operations of [[Machsom Watch]] (an NIF funded organization) for allegedly violating an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] order prohibiting Israelis from entering the Palestinian village of [[Awarta]].&lt;ref name="JPost Im Tirtzu calls"&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Yaakov |authorlink=Yaakov Katz (journalist) |title= Im Tirtzu calls for criminal investigation of Machsom Watch | url= http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Im-Tirtzu-calls-for-criminal-investigation-of-Machsom-Watch |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date = 2 May 2011 | accessdate = 15 May 2011 | quote = Im Tirtzu, a self-described Zionist extra-parliamentary group, has asked Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein to open a criminal investigation against activists from Machsom Watch who allegedly entered the Palestinian village of Awarta last month in violation of an IDF order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week before the [[Shin Bet]] (Israel Security Agency) revealed the identities of the murder suspects for the [[Itamar attack]], senior Machsom Watch activist, Raya Yaron, was photographed hugging the mother of one of the men. Yaron said many other human rights organizations had also visited the village.&lt;ref name="JPost Im Tirtzu calls"/&gt;

In May 2012 [[Peace Now]] filed a police complaint that said Im Tirtzu activists had impersonated Peace Now activists and waved Palestinian flags during [[Jerusalem Day]] celebrations in what was reported as a presumed attempt to portray them as Palestinian sympathizers. They described Im Tirtzu as an "extremist movement" that, together with "extreme Islamic movements on the Arab side", they claimed would "drag us to a religious war steeped in blood". Im Tirtzu accused Peace Now of "impersonating an Israeli organization while operating with backing from foreign countries in order to give the Temple Mount to Palestinian Authority" and said freedom of speech gave them the right to ridicule Peace Now's positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Potter |first=George |title= Peace Now cries foul on Palestinian flag wavers | url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/cops-called-on-flag-wavers/ | publisher=[[The Times of Israel]] | date = 21 May 2012 | quote = Peace Now cries foul on Palestinian flag waversLeft-wing group files complaint with police, claims right-wing Im Tirtzu activists impersonated it in Jerusalem Day parade | accessdate = 21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National service in foreign governments funded NGOs ===
In 2016 Im Tirtzu issued a report stating that at least seven foreign government funded organizations that it deemed "anti-Israel" are eligible to receive [[Sherut Leumi]] (National Service) positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Altman |date=27 October 2016 |title=National service slots for 6 left-wing groups under review |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=37441 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Lis |date=30 August 2016 |title=New Bill Aims to Limit State-funded Volunteers at Israeli Left-wing NGOs |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.739296 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the report, MK [[Amir Ohana]] introduced a bill in cooperation with Im Tirtzu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lahav Harkov |date=12 December 2016 |title=Ban on National Service at Foreign-Funded NGOs Clears Hurdle |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Ban-on-national-service-at-foreign-funded-NGOs-clears-hurdle-475098 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was supported by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Altman |date=31 October 2016 |title=Knesset mulls nixing national service in foreign-funded bodies |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=37549 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed to cancel national service positions in groups that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments.

The bill was later passed into law by the Knesset in a vote of 40–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Udi Shaham |date=22 March 2017 |title=Knesset Passes Law Forbidding National Service in Left-Wing NGOs |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Knesset-passes-law-forbidding-natl-service-in-foreign-funded-NGOs-484916 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli organizations with UN advisor status ===
In 2015 Im Tirtzu released a report titled "Activity of Israeli Organizations with Advisor Status to the United Nations, Against Israeli Policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Activity of Israeli Organizations with Advisor Status to the United Nations, Against Israeli Policy |url=https://imti.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Activity-of-Israeli-Organizations-with-Advisor-Status-to-the-United-Nations-Against-Israeli-Policy.pdf |publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claims that three Israeli NGOs use their U.N. advisor to promote anti-Israel sentiments in the United Nations.

According to the report, [[Adalah]], [[Ittijah]], and the [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions]] encourage the U.N. to accuse Israel of international law violations. These three organizations declined to comment on the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shlomo Cesana |author2=Gideon Allon |date=16 June 2015 |title=3 Israeli groups operate against Israel within UN, study finds |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=26233 |newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UN Fact Finding Mission on the 2014 Israel–Gaza Conflict ===
Following the release of the findings by the "United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict", Im Tirtzu released a report detailing the use by the UN of research by Israeli NGOs in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Israeli Organizations That Enable the UN Report|url=https://imti.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%90%D7%AA-%D7%93%D7%95%D7%97-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9D.pdf |publisher=Im Tirtzu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, the UN report contained 72 references to reports by B'tselem, 8 references to Adalah, 8 references to Breaking the Silence, 12 references to HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual, and 5 references to Yesh Din.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 June 2015 |title=Revealed: Israeli Leftist NGOs' Major Input into UN Gaza Repor |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/197141 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Akiva Lem |date=23 June 2015 |title=דו"ח של האו"ם: ישראלים נגד ישראל |language=he |trans-title=UN Report: Israelis Against Israel |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4671468,00.html |publisher=[[Ynet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jerusalem ===
Ahead of 2016's [[Jerusalem Day]], Im Tirtzu released a report claiming that the Palestinian organization Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat transfers millions of dollars to Israeli NGOs in order to delegitimize Israel and "obscure Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem". According to the report, the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat acts as an independent organizations that manages donations from Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Holland and then transfers them to pro-BDS Palestinian and Israeli NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Eric Bender |date=5 June 2016 |title=דוח אם תרצו: "מיליונים מועברים לעמותות הפועלות לחלוקת ירושלים" |language=he |trans-title=Im Tirtzu Report: Millions Are Being Transferred to Organizations Working to Divide Jerusalem |url=http://www.maariv.co.il/news/politics/Article-544388 |newspaper=[[Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarit Michaeli, the spokesperson for B'Tselem – one of the NGOs named in the report as receiving funds – said "this is a recycled lie by Im Tirtzu. This money actually comes from Switzerland, Holland, Denmark and Sweden. This organization transfers the funds from the donating countries and deals with the bureaucracy of the transfer. The organization itself does not determine who receives the funds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Eric Bender |date=5 June 2016 |title=דוח אם תרצו: "מיליונים מועברים לעמותות הפועלות לחלוקת ירושלים" |language=he |trans-title=Im Tirtzu Report: Millions Are Being Transferred to Organizations Working to Divide Jerusalem |url=http://www.maariv.co.il/news/politics/Article-544388 |newspaper=[[Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
In 2010, Im Tirtzu received funding from the following sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Major Israeli businesses helped quadruple donations to right-wing Im Tirtzu movement |author=[[Uri Blau]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/major-israeli-businesses-helped-quadruple-donations-to-right-wing-im-tirtzu-movement-1.404637 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Azrieli Group]], a shareholder in [[Bank Leumi]] and LeumiCard, which also owns 13 malls throughout the country and a controlling share in the [[Sonol]], [[Tambour (company)|Tambour]] and Supergaz companies and is behind the [[Azrieli Center]] in [[Tel Aviv]]
*[[Leo Schachter]], Israel's second-largest exporter of processed diamonds, headed by Elliot Tannenbaum
*Keren Segal Leyisrael, a fund headed by Jerusalem businessman Yotam Bar-Hama
*The Forum for Religious Zionism, an organization registered in 2010 in the name of Zvi Soibel, former director of the [[Bnei Akiva]] yeshiva in [[Kfar Haroeh]].

Under [[John Hagee]]'s management, [[Christians United for Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;Faydra L. Shapiro, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0_W7CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 ''Christian Zionism: Navigating the Jewish-Christian Border,''] [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]], 2015 p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; was a funder of Im Tirtzu but discontinued the funding on the grounds that Im Tirtzu "misrepresented its focus" by claiming that their work focused on "Zionist education" rather than "political" activity according to a spokesperson for the Evangelical organization.&lt;ref name="jpHagee"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gil Shefler |date=23 August 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/John-Hagee-to-cut-Im-Tirtzu-funding |title=John Hagee to cut Im Tirtzu funding |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Uri Blau]], in an [[Haaretz]] investigation Im Tirtzu, though highly critical of foreign governmental funding for 'leftist' Israeli NGOs, is itself the beneficiary of substantial donations from two American organisations closely associated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;ref&gt;Uri Blau, [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-group-slamming-israeli-ngos-foreign-funding-got-1m-from-u-s-donors-1.5487652 'Firebrand Anti-leftist Group, Which Slams Foreign Funding of Israeli NGOs, Received Over $1M From U.S. Donors,'] [[Haaretz]]  23 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;During the 2015 election, Shining City, a U.S. [[front organization|front group]], contributed 3.7 million shekels (about 1 million U.S. dollars) to Im Tirtzu. Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, the alleged leader of Shining City, now serves as senior adviser to U.S. ambassador to Israel [[David M. Friedman]].  According to Im Tirzu, most of its donors are Israelis, but the group is "pleased to find private donors from around the world as well (individuals and private foundations)" except those that are from a "foreign state entity or foundations that promote delegitimization of Israeli society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.815979 |title=U.S. Ambassador's Adviser Ran 'Dark Money' Nonprofit That Donated $1M to Right-Wing Israeli Group |first=Uri |last=Blau |authorlink=Uri Blau |date=6 October 2017 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=7 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==

The group was founded in 2006 by [[Ronen Shoval]], who also served as its chairman until his retirement in 2013, and Erez Tadmor, who was a group spokesperson until his retirement in 2011.

Following Ronen's retirement, Matan Peleg was elected as Im Tirtzu's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 December 2013 |title= 96 שנה למות אבשלום פיינברג צויינו באזכרתו |language=he |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/535/115.html |trans-title=Memorial for 96 years to Avshalom Feinberg's death |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peleg was the founder of the Im Tirtzu branch in Haifa and the head of the northern branch of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imti.org.il/docs/P188/?ThisPageID=809 "A letter to the rector of Haifa University"], Im Tirtzu  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214853/http://imti.org.il/docs/P188/?ThisPageID=809 |date=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=6 May 2011 |url=http://www.karmel.co.il/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17469&amp;Itemid=12 |title=אם תרצו תיקח חלק ביום הזיכרון בעוספיה |language=he |trans-title=Im tirtzu will take part in the memorial-day event In Isfiya |publisher=Carmel Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Erez's retired, Matan replaced him in the role of missions coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Uzi Baruch |date=7 December 2013 |url=http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/266631 |title=דנון: לעצור ההסתה של הח"כים הערבים |language=he |trans-title=Danon: Stop the incitement of Arab Mks |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alon Schwartzer was elected as head of the policy department alongside Matan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |date=9 January 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKAbXkqs580 |title=הקרן לישראל חדשה מאחורי מחאת המסתננים של 2014 - גלי ישראל |language=he |trans-title=New Israel Fund infiltrators behind protests of 2014 - Galei Yisrael |publisher=Im Tirtzu |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matan Peleg suspended himself in January 2016 in the wake of an Im Tirtzu campaign against Israeli artists who supported human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Im Tirtzu director suspends self after controversy |date=31 January 2016 |publisher=[[The Times of Israel]] |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/im-tirtzu-director-suspends-self-after-controversy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later in May 2016 Peleg returned to his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After the "Cultural Implants" storm, Im Tirtzu CEO returns to his position|url=http://news.walla.co.il/item/2959173|website=Walla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Likened to fascist groups ===
A [[Israeli New Shekel|NIS]] 2.6-million lawsuit was filed by Im Tirtzu against Israelis who had opened a [[Facebook]] page that suggested that Im Tirtzu was a Fascist group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nir Hasson |date=12 February 2012 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/jerusalem-court-starts-debating-meaning-of-fascism-as-im-tirtzu-sues-activists-1.412357|title=Jerusalem Court Starts Debating Meaning of Fascism as Im Tirtzu Sues Activists |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court in Jerusalem rejected some of the charges but found one person guilty of slander.&lt;ref name="Hasson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Rejecting bulk of libel suit, court rules Im Tirtzu movement can be likened to Fascism |url=http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/.premium-1.545657 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=7 September 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the verdict the Judge Refael Ya'akobi found that there were commonalities between the group and "certain principles of Fascism". He also stated that it is clear that the defendants are "bitter adversaries" of Im Tirtzu. He additionally wrote that the defendants do not imply a full identification Fascism with Im Tirtzu, but only some common lines. Finally the judge ruled that as Im Tirtzu emphasizes national aspects, the defendants can rely on the protections set in the law in order to be acquitted.&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;{{cite web |title=Verdict of the regional court |date=2 September 2013 |publisher=Jerusalem regional court |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%A7-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%95.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasson"/&gt; and wrote also that there is truth in comparing the poster of "Im Tirtzu" against the New Israel Fund to the style of the Nazi newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]''.&lt;ref name="verdict"/&gt; The judge wrote: "One should view these publications (against Im Tirtzu) as saying and warning that past experience teaches that support of similar principles to those that Im Tirtzu supports ... brought harsh and bad results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Altman |date=8 September 2013 |url=http://news.walla.co.il/item/2676349 |title=שופט מחוזי: "יש דמיון בין 'אם תרצו' לפאשיזם" |language=he |trans-title=District judge: There are similarities between Im Tirtzu and fascism |publisher=[[Walla!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, the judge rejected the majority of Im Tirtzu's arguments, and cleared four of the five defendants. One defendant, Roy Yellin, was found to have libeled Im Tirtzu by implying that the group shared the "Nazi race theory". However, the judge criticised Im Tirtzu for bringing the action in the first place, and postponed awarding any damages for the one successful claim.&lt;ref name="Hasson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Persico |first=Oren |date=7 September 2013 |title=לא לסטריליות |language=he |trans-title=No to sterility |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/77493 |publisher=[[HaAyin HaShevi'it]] |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the court rejected Im Tirtzu's claim for damages, though it also rejected the defendants' claim for legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nir Hasson | title = Jerusalem court throws out Im Tirtzu's claim against left-wing activists | newspaper=[[Haaretz]] | date = 3 February 2014 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/.premium-1.572078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Im Tirtzu and the defendants appealed to the high court. In the appeal, the high court declared the previous ruling as void and null and decided that the libel suit should have not been heard in court, since the main discussion is ideological, not juridical.&lt;ref name="Blank"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blank|first= Cynthia |title=Supreme Court: Im Tirtzu Does Not Have 'Fascist' Traits|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/198181 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]|date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In court proceedings, Professor [[Zeev Sternhell]], one of the world's leading experts on Fascism, testified that Im Tirtzu was "not worse than Fascism, it is that, more or less".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Oren Persico |date=12 May 2013 |title=לנתח עם גרזן |language=he |trans-title= |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/62652}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also testified that Fascist principles "provide a basis for Im Tirtzu's operations".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Sternhell analyzed the writings published by Im Tirtzu and observed expressions of fascist thinking in the writings of the group's founder. These include seeing the nation as an organic body, viewing the West as being weakened, and describing the situation in the country as an emergency situation that requires unusual action against "traitors".&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Nir Hasson |date=12 February 2012 |title=Jerusalem Court Starts Debating Meaning of Fascism as Im Tirtzu Sues Activists |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jerusalem-court-starts-debating-meaning-of-fascism-as-im-tirtzu-sues-activists-1.412357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other court testimony documented that Im Tirtzu's founder admitted to drawing inspiration from German philosophers considered to have been precursors to Fascist ideology.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

In 2016, Knesset Member [[Benny Begin]] also used the term "Fascist" to describe a campaign by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/.premium-1.700085 "Netanyahu condemns ads attacking left-wing artists: My political opponents are not 'traitors'"], 28 January 2016, ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
In 2009, Im Tirtzu's largest donor was the [[John Hagee]] Ministries (JHM) via the [[Christian Zionism|Christian-Zionist]] organization [[Christians United for Israel]] (CUFI). Im Tirtzu received US$100,000 from JHM and $34,000 from other sources. In 2010, ''The Jerusalem Post'' reported that JHM "expressed deep displeasure" with Im Tirtzu after its campaigns against the New Israel Fund and Ben-Gurion University and announced the cessation of its funding. A JHM spokesman said that Im Tirtzu "misrepresented its focus when they told us their mission was strictly Zionist education".&lt;ref name="jpHagee"/&gt;

The group's former spokesperson, Erez Tadmor, was found guilty of embezzling munitions from the Israeli military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Omri Maniv |date=24 February 2010 |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/067/985.html |title=מי אתה ארז תדמור? |language=he |trans-title=Erez Tadmor who are you? |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was accused of acting in an Anti-Semitic fashion, including emulating Nazi propaganda, in its criticisms of U.S. Ambassador [[Martin Indyk]] and of the New Israel Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 August 2013 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.539319 |title=U.S. Peace Envoy Depicted as Puppet by Israeli Right-wing Group |work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Oren Persico |date=7 September 2013 |title=לא לסטריליות |language=he |trans-title=No to sterility |url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/77493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haaretz]] newspaper alleged that "Im Tirtzu has taken over political discourse in Israel, and injected into it the crazy idea of the internal enemy," and accused [[The Jewish Home]] party as "operating as the political arm of Im Tirtzu."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Declaring War on Academia|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/1.794974|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===

Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has publicly endorsed Im Tirtzu.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=False equivalence in Israel |author=Noam Shelef |date=29 January 2016 |newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]] |url=http://jewishjournal.com/opinion/181749/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Tirtzu has been active on college campuses throughout Israel, and has received support from members of the Israeli Parliament and prominent Israeli writers and personalities.&lt;ref name="haolam.de"&gt;{{cite news|title=Im Tirtzu's Third Annual Convention |url=http://www.haolam.de/index.php?site=dertag&amp;id=5631 |newspaper=haOlam.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219095926/http://www.haolam.de/index.php?site=dertag&amp;id=5631 |archivedate=19 December 2013 }}{{failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=The named article isn't at the archive page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ben-Dror Yemini]] |date=20 August 2010 |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]] |title=שטיפת מוח אקדמית |language=he |trans-title=Academic Brainwashing |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/app/index.php?do=blog&amp;encr_id=f2b4c1b55be76d1e6d7b777256ea0370&amp;id=1565 |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arutz Sheva]] has described Im Tirtzu as the largest Zionist movement in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=European governments funding the defense of terrorists |date=16 August 2016 |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/216478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 Ministry of Culture and Education competition, Im Tirtzu won first prize for their video titled, "Zionism Without Jerusalem?" In a competition featuring almost 150 entries, Im Tirtzu's video won the most popular video, and was awarded a prize of 25,000 shekels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Emilie Grunzweig |date=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |title=Culture Ministry to award NIS 25,000 to Im Tirtzu for short film |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/culture-ministry-to-award-nis-25-000-to-im-tirtzu-for-short-film-1.451558 |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese eel''' (''Anguilla japonica''; Japanese: 日本鰻 ''nihon'unagi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=日本鰻|url=http://localsensei.com/dictionaries/1/words/110250|work=Local Sensei|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a species of anguillid [[eel]] found in [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Vietnam]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724123019/http://www.vncreatures.net/chitiet1.php?page=1&amp;loai=1&amp;ID=5102 Vietnam Faunas], vncreatures.net&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the northern [[Philippines]]. Like all the eels of the genus ''Anguilla'' and the family [[Anguillidae]], it is [[catadromous]], meaning it spawns in the sea, but lives parts of its life in fresh water. The spawning area of this species is in the [[North Equatorial Current]] in the western North Pacific to the west of the [[Mariana Islands]]. The larvae are called [[leptocephalus|leptocephali]] and are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the [[Kuroshio Current]] to East Asia, where they live in rivers, lakes, and estuaries.  The Japanese eel is an important food fish in East Asia, where it is raised in [[aquaculture]] ponds in most countries in the region.   In Japan, where they are called ''[[unagi]]'', they are an important part of the food culture, with many restaurants serving grilled eel, which is called ''[[kabayaki]]''.  Eels also have uses in [[Chinese medicine]].

==Life history and habitat==
[[File:Anguilla japonica 1856.jpg|thumbnail|left|Japanese eel]]
The Japanese eel and other anguillid eels live in fresh water and estuaries where they feed and grow as yellow eels for a number of years before they begin to mature and become silver eels.  The silver eels then migrate out of fresh water into the ocean and start their long journey to their spawning area. Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in [[East Asia]] to their spawning area without feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=402 |pages=233–238 |year=2010 |title=Japanese eel ''Anguilla japonica'' do not assimilate nutrition during the oceanic spawning migration: Evidence from stable isotope analysis |doi=10.3354/meps08448 |last1=Chow |first1=S. |last2=Kurogi |first2=H |last3=Katayama |first3=S |last4=Ambe |first4=D |last5=Okazaki |first5=M |last6=Watanabe |first6=T |last7=Ichikawa| first7=T |last8=Kodama |first8=M |last9=Aoyama |first9=J |last10=Shinoda |first10=A |last11=Watanabe |first11=S |last12=Tsukamoto |first12=K |last13=Miyazaki |first13=S |last14=Kimiura |first14=S |last15=Yamada |first15=Y |last16=Nomura |first16=K |last17=Tanaka |first17=H |last18=Kazeto |first18=Y |last19=Hata |first19=K |last20=Handa |first20=T |last21=Tawa |first21=A |last22=Mochioka |first22=N }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spawning area of this species was discovered in 1991 by collecting small leptocephali about 10&amp;nbsp;mm in size, and then in 2005 the same team of Japanese scientists at the [[University of Tokyo]] found a more precise location of spawning based on genetically identified specimens of newly hatched preleptocephali only 2 to 5 days old in a small area near the Suruga Seamount to the west of the [[Mariana Islands]] (14–17° N, 142–143° E).&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tsukamoto |first=Katsumi |journal=Nature |volume=439 |date=23 February 2006 |title=Spawning of eels near a seamount |page=929 |doi=10.1038/439929a |pmid=16495988 |issue=7079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, more pre-leptocephali have been collected at sea, and even Japanese eel eggs have been collected and genetically identified on the research vessel. The collections of eggs and recently hatched larvae have been made along the western side of the seamount chain of the [[Mariana Trough|West Mariana Ridge]]. Mature adults of the Japanese eel and [[Anguilla marmorata|giant mottled eel]] were captured using large midwater trawls in 2008 by Japanese scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Fisheries Science |volume=75 |pages=257–259 |year=2009 |title=Discovery of mature freshwater eels in the open ocean |doi=10.1007/s12562-008-0017-5 |last1=Chow |first1=S. |last2=Kurogi |first2=Hiroaki |last3=Mochioka |first3=Noritaka |last4=Kaji |first4=Shunji |last5=Okazaki |first5=Makoto |last6=Tsukamoto |first6=Katsumi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The adults of the Japanese eel appear to spawn in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean, based on the recent catches of their spawning adults, eggs, and newly hatched larvae. The timing of catches of eggs and larvae and the ages of larger larvae have shown that Japanese eels only spawn during the few days just before the [[new moon]] period of each month during their spawning season.

After hatching in the ocean, the leptocephali are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia. In the open ocean, the larvae feed on [[marine snow]], before they metamorphose into the [[glass eel]] stage. The glass eels then enter the estuaries and headwaters of rivers and many travel upstream. In fresh water and estuaries, the diet of yellow eels consists mainly of shrimp, other crustaceans, aquatic insects, and small fishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Man |first1=S.H. |last2=Hodgkiss |first2=I.J. |year=1981 |title=Hong Kong freshwater fishes |agency=Urban Council |publisher=Wishing Printing Company |location=Hong Kong |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese eel population, along with [[Anguillidae|anguillid eel]] populations worldwide, have declined drastically in recent years, presumably due to a combination of overfishing and habitat loss or changing water conditions in the ocean interfering with spawning and the transport of their leptocephali. In the case of the Japanese eel, spawning is likely affected by the north-south shifts of a salinity front created by an area of low-salinity waters resulting from tropical rainfall. The front is thought to be detected by the adult spawning eels and to affect the latitudes at which they spawn. A northward shift in the front that occurred over the past 30 years appears to have occurred, which could cause more larvae to be retained in eddies offshore in the region east of Taiwan, and southward shifts in the salinity front have been observed in recent years that could increase southward transport into the [[Mindanao Current]] that flows into the [[Celebes Sea]]. These types of unfavorable larval transport are thought to reduce the recruitment success of the Japanese eels that reach river mouths as glass eels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Fisheries Oceanography |volume=10 |pages=51–60 |year=2001 |title=Fluctuation in the distribution of low-salinity water in the North Equatorial Current and its effect on the larval transport of the Japanese eel |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2419.2001.00159.x |last1=Kimura |first1=S. |last2=Inoue |first2=Takashi |last3=Sugimoto |first3=Takashige}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
The Japanese freshwater eel produces a fluorescent protein. This protein is the basis of a new test to assess dangerous blood toxins that can trigger liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;Sandle, Tim (2013) [http://digitaljournal.com/article/352895 The glowing eel can help assess blood toxins"]. ''Digital journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma]]'', in Team Shokugeki, Satoshi Isshiki and Jurio Shiratsu are competing each other with Japanese eel as main ingredient.

In various [[Super Mario]] games, most notably [[Super Mario 64]] and [[New Super Mario Bros]] there is an enemy by the of name Maw-Ray. This a reference to the Japanese eel, as the character was previously called simply [[Unagi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mariowiki.com/Maw-Ray&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''[[bibliography]]''' of works by Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet, and translator '''[[Jorge Luis Borges]]''' (1899–1986).

Each year links to its corresponding "[year] in literature" article (for prose) or "[year] in poetry" article (for verse).

== Original book-length publications ==
This list follows the chronology of original (typically Spanish-language) publication in books, based in part on the rather comprehensive (but incomplete) bibliography online at the Borges Center (originally the J. L. Borges Center for Studies &amp; Documentation at the [[University of Aarhus]], then at the [[University of Iowa]], now—as of 2010—at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]). The following list focuses on book-length 
publication of original work (including collaborative work): it does not include individual short stories, poems, and translations published in magazines, nor does it include books (such as anthologies of fantasy and of Argentine literature) that Borges edited or co-edited. It also excludes several chapbooks, privately printed editions, etc. of under 50 pages each and does not attempt to identify first publication dates of individual stories, poems, etc. ISBNs refer to recent editions, not original publications. (Many English-language titles and ISBNs still missing. Some of the volumes might be better classified in terms of genre.)
* ''[[Fervor de Buenos Aires]]'', [[1923 in poetry|1923]], poetry.
* ''[[Inquisiciones]]'', [[1925 in literature|1925]], essays. English title: ''Inquiries''.

* ''Libro de sueños'', [[1976 in literature|1976]], mostly translations and paraphrases of short excerpts from world literature. Some are narrations of dreams, some are about dreams, some merely dreamlike. There are a small number of original pieces and other Spanish-language pieces as well.
* ''Poesía Juvenil de J.L. Borges'', [[1978 in poetry|1978]], a collection of poems written 1919-1922, with an extensive introduction (rather longer than the poems) by Carlos Meneses.
* ''Textos recobrados 1919 - 1929'', [[1997 in literature|1997]], previously unpublished early works, both prose (in a variety of genres) and poetry ({{ISBN|84-7888-337-1}}).
* ''Textos recobrados 1931 - 1955'', [[2002 in literature|2002]], previously unpublished stories, essays, poems, newspaper articles, book and movie reviews, etc. ({{ISBN|950-04-2326-X}}).

==Short stories and prose poems==
The translations of the titles are from ''Collected Fictions'', translated by [[Andrew Hurley (academic)|Andrew Hurley]]. The information is compiled from the ''Bibliografía cronológica de la obra de Jorge Luis Borges'' by Annick Louis and Florian Ziche. Not all of these works can be classified as short stories. For example, "The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell" is largely factual, but it reads like a work of fiction. Conversely, the fictional "Pierre Menard, Author of the ''Quixote''" is written in a style resembling an essay in literary criticism.

The groupings represent books in which these were first published; they are listed by the English translation of the original Spanish-language book.

'''Judith Miller''' (born January 2, 1948) is an American journalist and commentator known for her coverage of Iraq's [[Weapon of mass destruction|Weapons of Mass Destruction]] (WMD) program both before and after [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the 2003 invasion]], which was later discovered to have been based on inaccurate information from the intelligence community.&lt;ref name=foer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A few months after the aluminum tubes story, a former CIA analyst explained to me how simple it had been to manipulate [Judith Miller] and her newspaper. 'The White House had a perfect deal with Miller ... Chalabi is providing the Bush people with the information they need to support their political objectives, and he is supplying the same material to Judy Miller. Chalabi tips her on something and then she goes to the White House, which has already heard the same thing from Chalabi, and she gets it corroborated. She also got the Pentagon to confirm things for her, which made sense, since they were working so closely with Chalabi.

Bill Miller was famous for booking iconic Las Vegas performances.

Miller attended [[Ohio State University]], where she was a member of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] sorority.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} She graduated from [[Barnard College]] in 1969 and received a master's degree in public affairs from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]].

==Career at ''The New York Times''==
[[File:Mike Pence and Judith Miller.png|thumb|right|Miller and [[Mike Pence]] in 2005]]
During Miller's tenure at ''[[The New York Times]]'', she was a member of the team that won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]], for its 2001 coverage of global terrorism before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. She and James Risen received the award and one of the cited articles appeared under her byline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2002|title=The 2002 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Explanatory Reporting |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=May 21, 2017}} With reprints of ten 2001 works.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her writing during this period has been criticised by Middle-east scholar [[Edward Said]] for the anti-Islamic bias in her writing. In his book ''[[Covering Islam]]'' Said stated that Miller's book ''God Has Ninety-Nine Names'' "is like a textbook of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam." He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that "nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject." He concludes, "she fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn't bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world."&lt;ref name="said"&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Covering Islam: how the media and the experts determine how we see the rest of the world|year=1997|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-75890-7|pages=xxxiv-xliii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Miller asserted that in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] she argued that militant [[Islamism]] of the type represented by [[Al Qaeda]] had peaked and was fading into insignificance.&lt;ref name="MillerEvildoers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Judith|title=Naming the Evildoers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/books/naming-the-evildoers.html?mcubz=2|accessdate=12 July 2017|website=The New York Times|date=29 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthrax hoax victim===
On October 12, 2001, Miller opened an [[anthrax hoax]] letter mailed to her ''New York Times'' office. The [[2001 anthrax attacks]] had begun occurring in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to [[ABC News]], [[CBS News]], [[NBC News]], and the ''[[New York Post]]'', all in [[New York City]], as well as the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' in [[Boca Raton, Florida]]. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators [[Tom Daschle]] and [[Patrick Leahy]] in Washington. Twenty-two people were infected; five died. In 2008, the government's investigation of these mailings focused on [[Bruce Ivins]], who later committed suicide, with the investigation determining that Ivins acted alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/February/10-nsd-166.html|title=Justice Department and FBI Announce Formal Conclusion of Investigation into 2001 Anthrax Attacks|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2010-07-02|author=Office of Public Affairs, Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller was the only major U.S. media reporter, and ''The New York Times'' the only major U.S. media organization, to be victimized by a fake anthrax letter in the fall of 2001. Miller had reported extensively on the subject of biological threats and had co-authored, with Stephen Engelberg and [[William Broad]], a book on bio-terrorism, ''[[Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War]]'' which was published on October 2, 2001. Miller co-authored an article on Pentagon plans to develop a more potent version of weaponized anthrax, "U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits", published in ''The New York Times'' on September 4, 2001, weeks before the first anthrax mailings.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Judith [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/world/us-germ-warfare-research-pushes-treaty-limits.html "U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits"], ''The New York Times'', September 4, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller also participated in a senior-level bio-terror attack simulation on [[Oklahoma City]] conducted on June 22 and June 23, 2001, called "[[Operation Dark Winter]]"; her role was media reporter/observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2001_dark-winter/about.html|title=About the Exercise: Dark Winter|last=UPMC|first=Center for Biosecurity of|website=www.upmchealthsecurity.org|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic charities search leak===
Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government was considering adding the [[Holy Land Foundation]] to a list of organizations with suspected links to terrorism and was planning to search the premises of the organization. The information about the impending raid was given to Miller by a confidential source. On December 3, 2001, Miller telephoned the Holy Land Foundation for comment, and ''The New York Times'' published an article in the late edition papers and on its website that day. The next day, the government searched HLF's offices. These occurrences led to a lawsuit brought by US Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]],&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times v. Gonzales'', 459 F.3d 160 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; with prosecutors claiming that Miller and her colleague Philip Shenon had queried this Islamic charity, and another, in ways that made them aware of the planned searches.&lt;ref&gt;A brief analysis of the decisions in ''New York Times v. Gonzales'' and ''Miller v. Unitesd States/Cooper v. United States'' is at: [https://swap.stanford.edu/20080725074543/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/analysis.aspx?id=15634 Ongoing confidential sources cases], accessed October 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Iraq War===
At ''The New York Times'', Miller wrote on [[National security|security]] issues, particularly about [[Iraq]] and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Many of these stories later turned out to have been based upon faulty information.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Moore (May 27, 2004), [http://www.salon.com/2004/05/27/times_10/ "Not fit to print: How Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraq war lobby used New York Times reporter Judith Miller to make the case for invasion"], ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes Editors (May 26, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html "FROM THE EDITORS; The Times and Iraq"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; (One of her stories that wasn't disproved reported that inspectors in Iraq "saw nothing to prompt a war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/international/middleeast/31BLIX.html|title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INSPECTOR; Blix Says He Saw Nothing to Prompt a War|author=Judith Miller|author2=Julia Preston|journal=The New York Times|date=January 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

On September 8, 2002, Miller and fellow ''Times'' reporter [[Michael R. Gordon]] reported the interception of "aluminum tubes" bound for Iraq. Her front-page story quoted unnamed "American officials" and "American intelligence experts" who said the tubes were intended to be used to enrich nuclear material, and cited unnamed "[[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] officials" who claimed that, in recent months, Iraq had "stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and [had] embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an [[atomic bomb]]".&lt;ref name="Gordon and Miller, Sept. 8, 2002"&gt;Michael R. Gordon and Judith Miller (Sept. 8, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/international/middleeast/08IRAQ.html?ex=1121140800&amp;en=76eddceb628af81e&amp;ei=5070 "U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Miller added that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Hussein's dogged insistence on pursuing his nuclear ambitions, along with what defectors described in interviews as Iraq's push to improve and expand Baghdad's chemical and biological arsenals, have brought Iraq and the United States to the brink of war.&lt;ref name="Gordon and Miller, Sept. 8, 2002" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortly after Miller's article was published, [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Colin Powell]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] appeared on television and pointed to Miller's story in support of their position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As summarized by the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', "in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration's case for war, and the ''Times'' played a critical part in legitimizing it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Miller later said of the controversy

&lt;blockquote&gt;[M]y job isn't to assess the government's information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of ''The New York Times'' what the government thought about Iraq's arsenal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael Massing (Feb. 26, 2004), [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/feb/26/now-they-tell-us/ "Now They Tell Us: The American Press and Iraq"], ''[[New York Review of Books]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an April 2003 article, Miller, ostensibly on the basis of statements from the military unit in which she was [[Embedded journalism|embedded]], reported claims allegedly made by an Iraqi scientist that Iraq had kept biological and chemical weapons until "right before the invasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Judith Miller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/21/international/worldspecial/21CHEM.html|title=Illicit Arms Kept Till Eve of War, an Iraqi Scientist Is Said to Assert|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 21, 2003|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was widely repeated in the press. Miller went on ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' and stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I think they found something more than a [[smoking gun]]. What they've found is a [[silver bullet]] in the form of a person, an Iraqi individual, a scientist, as we've called him, who really worked on the programs, who knows them firsthand, and who has led MET Alpha people&lt;ref&gt;MET Alpha: Mobile Exploitation Team Alpha. A U.S. Army unit charged with trying to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, at the time&lt;/ref&gt; to some pretty startling conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east-jan-june03-search_04-22/ "Search for Evidence: Judith Miller Reports"], transcript by [[PBS]], April 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 26, 2004, a week after the U.S. government apparently [[Burn notice (document)|severed ties]] with [[Ahmed Chalabi]], a ''Times'' [[op-ed|editorial]] acknowledged that some of the paper's coverage in the run-up to the war had relied too heavily on Chalabi and other Iraqi exiles, who were bent on [[regime change]].&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes Editors (May 26, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html "FROM THE EDITORS; The Times and Iraq"], ''The New York Times''
&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial also expressed "regret" that "information that was controversial [was] allowed to stand unchallenged." However, the editorial explicitly rejected "blame on individual reporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/international/middleeast/20040526CRITIQUE.html|title=The ''Times'' and Iraq: A Sample of the Coverage|work=New York Times|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}  "sampling of articles published by ''The Times'' about the decisions that led the United States into the war in Iraq, and especially the issue of Iraq's weapons"&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 2004, the day after the ''Times''' ''[[mea culpa]],'' [[Bush's Brain|James C. Moore]] quoted Miller in an article in ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;You know what, ... I was proved fucking right. That's what happened. People who disagreed with me were saying, 'There she goes again.' But I was proved fucking right."&lt;ref&gt;James C. Moore (May 27, 2004), [http://www.salon.com/2004/05/27/times_10/ "Not fit to print: How Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraq war lobby used New York Times reporter Judith Miller to make the case for invasion"], ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement about being "proved...right" was in relation to another Miller story, wherein she'd claimed that [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] found in Iraq had been shown to be [[mobile weapons laboratory|mobile weapons labs]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith Miller and William J. Broad (May 21, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/21/world/aftereffects-germ-weapons-us-analysts-link-iraq-labs-to-germ-arms.html "AFTEREFFECTS: GERM WEAPONS; U.S. Analysts Link Iraq Labs To Germ Arms"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; However that claim, too, was subsequently refuted as false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Woodward|title=State of Denial: Bush at War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHn-M8fZ96MC&amp;lpg=PT210&amp;q=%22alleged%20mobile%20lab%22|year=2008|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-84739-603-7|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Cockburn (Aug. 16, 2003), [https://www.counterpunch.org/2003/08/16/judy-miller-s-war/ "Judy Miller's War"], ''Counterpunch''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Calame (Oct. 23, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/opinion/the-miller-mess-lingering-issues-among-the-answers.html "The Miller Mess: Lingering Issues Among the Answers"], ''The New York Times'' &lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged later in ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' that, while Miller's reporting "frequently [did] not meet published ''Times'' standards", she was not sanctioned and was given a relatively free rein, because she consistently delivered frequent front-page [[Scoop (news)|scoops]] for the paper by "cultivating top-ranking sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William E.

After her release, the ''Times''' [[Public Editor]] [[Byron Calame]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ms. Miller may still be best known for her role in a series of ''Times'' articles in 2002 and 2003 that strongly suggested [[Saddam Hussein]] already had or was acquiring an arsenal of [[weapons of mass destruction]] ... Many of those articles turned out to be inaccurate ... [T]he problems facing her inside and outside the newsroom will make it difficult for her to return to the paper as a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;Byron Calame (Oct. 23, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/opinion/the-miller-mess-lingering-issues-among-the-answers.html "The Miller Mess: Lingering Issues Among the Answers"], ''The New York Times'' &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two weeks later, Miller negotiated a private [[severance package]] with ''Times''' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]] She contested Calame's claims about her reporting and gave no ground in defending her work. She cited "difficulty" in performing her job effectively after having become "an integral part of the stories [she] was sent to cover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/11/09/miller.retires/index.html|title=Reporter at center of CIA leak retires|date=November 10, 2005|accessdate=June 26, 2006|agency=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refusal to disclose source==
In July 2005, several months prior to her October 2005 resignation from ''The New York Times'', Miller was jailed for [[contempt of court]] for refusing to testify before a federal [[grand jury]] investigating a [[Political leak|leak]] naming [[Valerie Plame]] as a CIA officer. While Miller never wrote about Plame, she was believed to be in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation. According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official, later revealed to be [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], Vice President [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]]'s Chief of Staff, on July 8, 2003. Plame's CIA identity was divulged publicly in a column by conservative political commentator [[Robert Novak]] on July 14, 2003. Novak's source was revealed to have not been Libby, but [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] of the Department of State.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On July 16, 2005, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, which could have extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kurtz|first1=Howard|last2=Leonnig|first2=Carol D.|authorlink2=Carol D.

Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4296090.stm|title=US CIA case reporter will testify|publisher=BBC News|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. This was several weeks ''before'' Joseph Wilson's ''New York Times'' editorial was published. This belied the theory that Libby was retaliating against Wilson for his ''Times'' editorial. According to Miller's notes from that earlier meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her July 8, 2003, meeting with Libby contains the name "Valerie Flame [sic]".&lt;ref&gt;Don Van Natta Jr., Adam Liptak &amp; Clifford J.

Miller's grand jury account was the basis for her last article in the ''Times''. ''The New York Times'' published Miller's first-person account, "My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room", on October 16, 2005. Miller claimed she could not remember who gave her the name "Valerie Plame" but she was sure it didn't come from Libby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Judith|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1016-01.htm|title=My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room|work=The New York Times|publisher=Common Dreams|date=October 16, 2005|accessdate=March 29, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618070748/http://commondreams.org/headlines05/1016-01.htm|archivedate=June 18, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller testified as a witness on January 30, 2007, at the trial of Scooter Libby, which began in January 2007. The trial ended on March 6, 2007, with Libby's conviction on four of five counts, though none of the counts had to do with actually revealing Plame's name to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013000178.html|title=Reporter's Account Hurts Libby Defense|date=January 30, 2007|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contempt of court==
{{Further|CIA leak grand jury investigation|CIA leak scandal timeline}}
On October 1, 2004, federal Judge [[Thomas F. Hogan]] found Miller in [[contempt of court]] for refusing to appear before a federal grand jury, which was investigating who had leaked to reporters the fact that [[Valerie Plame]] was a CIA operative. Miller did not write an article about the subject at the time of the leak, but others did, notably [[Robert Novak]], spurring the investigation. Judge Hogan sentenced her to 18 months in jail, but stayed the sentence while her appeal proceeded. On February 15, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld Judge Hogan's ruling. On June 17, 2005, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On July 6, 2005, Judge Hogan ordered Miller to serve her sentence at "a suitable jail within the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia". She was taken to [[Alexandria City Jail]] on July 7, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4654969.stm|title=US reporter jailed in CIA trial|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=July 6, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/politics/06cnd-leak.html|title=Prosecutor in Leak Case Calls for Reporters' Jailing|work=The New York Times|date=July 6, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521043021/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/politics/prosecutor-in-leak-case-calls-for-reporters-jailing.html|archivedate=May 21, 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate case, Federal Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] ruled on February 24, 2005, that Miller was not required to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Patrick Fitzgerald, the same prosecutor who had had Miller jailed in the Plame case, argued that Miller's calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller's phone records to confirm the time of the tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor's needs were outweighed by a 'reporter's privilege' to keep sources confidential. On August 1, 2006, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Sweet's decision, holding 2–1 that federal prosecutors could inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.]] wrote: "No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, much less to indict or not indict, without the reporters' evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/washington/02phones.html?hp&amp;ex=1154577600&amp;en=f960a842e0fe8b0a&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=U.S. Wins Access to Reporter Phone Records|work=The New York Times|date=August 2, 2006|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her jailing for civil contempt, Miller's lawyers argued that it was pointless to imprison her because she would never talk or reveal confidential sources. Under such circumstances, argued her lawyers, jail term would be "merely punitive" and would serve no purpose. Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller's lawyers suggested that "impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her".&lt;ref name="Leonnig July 2"&gt;[[Carol D. Leonnig]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070101962.html "Reporters Ask Judge for Home Detention"], ''The Washington Post'', July 2, 2005, p. A02.&lt;/ref&gt; Failing that, Miller's lawyers asked that she be sent to a women's facility in [[Danbury, Connecticut]], nearer to "Ms. Miller's 76-year-old husband", retired book publisher [[Jason Epstein]], who lives in New York City, and whose state of health was the subject of a confidential medical report filed by Miller's attorneys. Upon being jailed, the Times reported on July 7, 2005, that Miller had purchased a [[cockapoo]] puppy to keep her husband company during her absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D04E1D7163DF934A35754C0A9639C8B63&amp;legacy=true|last=Manly|first=Lorne|title=A Reporter Jailed: Woman in the News; A Difficult Moment, Long Anticipated|work=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Miller had received a "parade of prominent government and media officials" during her first 11 weeks in prison, including visits by former U.S. Republican Senator [[Bob Dole]], NBC News anchor [[Tom Brokaw]], and [[John R. Bolton]], U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/16/AR2005091601646.html|title=Jailed Reporter Is Distanced From News, Not Elite Visitors|first=Carol D.|last=Leonnig|author-link=Carol D. Leonnig|work=The Washington Post|date=September 17, 2005|page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her release on September 29, 2005, Miller agreed to disclose to the grand jury the identity of her source, [[Lewis Libby]], Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

On Tuesday, January 30, 2007, Miller took the stand as a witness for the prosecution against Lewis Libby.  Miller discussed three conversations she had had with Libby in June and July 2003, including the meeting on June 23, 2003. In her first appearance before the grand jury, Miller said she could not remember. According to ''The New York Times'', when asked if Libby discussed Valerie Plame, Miller responded in the affirmative, "adding that Libby had said Wilson worked at the agency's (C.I.A.) division that dealt with limiting the proliferation of unconventional weapons". The trial resulted in guilty verdicts against Libby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/washington/31libby.html?hp&amp;ex=1170306000&amp;en=4abd0f1b7056947a&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage|title=Reporter Who Was Jailed Testifies in Libby Case|work=The New York Times|date=January 31, 2007|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent journalist and author==
Since leaving ''The New York Times'', Miller has continued her work as a writer in Manhattan and has contributed several [[op-ed piece]]s to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. On May 16, 2006, she summarized her investigations on U.S. foreign policy regarding [[Libya]]'s dismantling of its weapons programs in an essay published in two parts.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Miller, "How Gadhafi Lost His Groove: The complex surrender of Libya's WMD", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', May 16, 2006, [http://www.judithmiller.com/502/how-gadhafi-lost-his-groove Archived at Miller's website]; "Gadhafi's Leap of Faith". ''The Wall Street Journal'', May 17, 2006, [http://www.judithmiller.com/503/gadhafis-leap-of-faith Archived at Miller's website].&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2006, NavySEALs.com and MediaChannel.org published an exclusive interview with Miller in which she detailed how the attack on the [[USS Cole (DDG-67)|U.S.S. ''Cole'']] led her to investigate [[Al-Qaeda]] and, in July 2001, to her receiving information from a top-level White House source concerning top-secret [[NSA]] [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) about an impending Al-Qaeda attack, possibly against the continental United States. Two months later, on September 11, Miller and her editor at the ''Times'', Stephen Engelberg, both regretted not writing that story.&lt;ref&gt;Rory O'Connor and William Scott Malone, {{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/36388/the_9_11_story_that_got_away|title=The 9/11 Story That Got Away|publisher=[[AlterNet]]|date=May 17, 2006|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 2007, she was hired as an adjunct fellow of the [[Manhattan Institute|Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], a [[neoconservatism|neo-conservative]] free-market [[think tank]]. Her duties included being a contributing editor for the organization's publication, ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''. On October 20, 2008, [[Fox News]] announced that it had hired Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/20/judith-miller-joins-fox-n_n_136075.html|title=Judith Miller Joins Fox News|work=The Huffington Post|date=October 20, 2008|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, she is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/membership/membership-roster-a-f?letter=M|title=Membership Roster|date=October 25, 2018|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been a member of the [[Aspen Strategy Group]], and has served on a prestigious [[National Academy of Sciences]] panel examining how best to expand of the work of the [[Cooperative Threat Reduction]] program, which since 1991 has sought to stop the spread of WMD material and expertise from the [[former Soviet Union]]. She lectures frequently on the [[Middle East]], [[Islam]], [[terrorism]], [[bioweapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]], as well as other national security topics.

==The Iraq War revisited==
On April 3, 2015, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published an [[op-ed]] piece by Miller&lt;ref name=wsjmiller&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-iraq-war-and-stubborn-myths-1428087215|title=The Iraq War and Stubborn Myths|last=Miller|first=Judith|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 3, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she defended her comportment during the lead-up to the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], as well as the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's stance and decisions regarding the war. "Officials [of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]] didn't lie, and I wasn't fed a line," she wrote.&lt;ref name=wsjmiller/&gt; Miller acknowledged that "there was no shortage of mistakes about Iraq, and I made my share of them. The newsworthy claims of some of my prewar WMD stories were wrong", but rejected the notion that "I took America to war in Iraq. It was all me", which according to her "continue[d] to have believers".&lt;ref name=wsjmiller/&gt;

Critics subsequently wrote that "Miller's war reporting was disastrously wrong, and now she's trying desperately to spin it all away,".&lt;ref name=salonmill&gt;{{cite web|last=Malloy|first=Simon|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/04/06/judith_millers_pathetic_iraq_apologia_a_disgraced_reporter_rallies_to_her_own_defense/|title=Judith Miller's pathetic Iraq apologia: A disgraced reporter rallies to her own defense|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerie Plame]] commented that while "no one is crediting [Miller] with starting the Iraq war," and she was "not actually on the team that took us into the biggest, most tragic US foreign policy debacle ever..., [Miller's] attempt to re-write history is both pathetic and self-serving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ValeriePlameWilson/posts/1073870519295775|title=Dear Judy|work=[[Valerie Plame]]|publisher=[[Facebook]]|date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "in arguing that [[George W. Bush|Bush]] was a victim of faulty intelligence analysis, Miller ignores extensive reporting showing that the Bush administration was making plans for an Iraq invasion ''before'' the advent of intelligence used to justify it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Judith Miller: 'No senior official spoon-fed me a line about WMD'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/03/judith-miller-essay-wmd-saddam-hussein-iraq-war|work=The Guardian|accessdate=April 4, 2015|last=McCarthy|first=Tom|publication-date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoir==
In April 2015, Miller published ''The Story: A Reporter's Journey'', a [[memoir]] that focused largely on her reporting during the second Gulf War. Her former colleague [[Neil Lewis (journalist)|Neil Lewis]] characterized most of the reviews as "unreservedly critical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/first_person/what_we_can_learn_from_judith_miller.php|title=What we can learn from Judith Miller's rehab tour|journal=[[The Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''The New York Times'', former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter [[Terry McDermott (journalist)|Terry McDermott]] wrote that although "this is not a score-settling book," he found it "sad and flawed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/books/review-judith-millers-the-story-a-reporters-journey.html |title=Review: Judith Miller's 'The Story: A Reporter's Journey'|last=McDermott|first=Terry|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ιn ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Erik Wemple]] wrote that the book's "dynamic" of "Judy Miller against the world" lends her book an aspect that is "both depressing and desperate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-reporters-defense-of-her-flawed-reporting/2015/04/09/5bf93f14-de15-11e4-a500-1c5bb1d8ff6a_story.html|title=Judith Miller tries, and ultimately fails, to defend her flawed Iraq reporting|last=Wemple|first=Eric|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[The Columbia Journalism Review]]'' called the book "less a memoir than an [[apologia]] and an assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cjr.org/analysis/miller_review.php |title=Judith Miller tells her side of The Story |work=The Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', [[Lloyd Grove]] characterized Miller's work as "self-pitying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/15/former-nyt-reporter-judith-miller-pleads-her-shaky-case.html |last=Grove |first=Lloyd |title=Former NYT Reporter Judith Miller Pleads Her Shaky Case|work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=April 15, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticizing Miller's failure to fully take responsibility for the flaws in her reporting, [[Matt Taibbi]] wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "Most of ''The Story'' is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller's homework.&amp;nbsp;... Mostly, she just had a lot of rotten luck. Or at least, that's how it reads. It's a sweeping, epic non-apology. Every bad thing Miller has ever been accused of turns out to be wrong or taken out of context, according to her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/judith-millers-comeback-20150529 |last=Taibbi |first=Matt|title=Judith Miller's Comeback|work=Rolling Stone|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1180">A '''metadirectory''' system provides for the flow of data between one or more [[directory service]]s and [[database]]s, in order to maintain synchronization of that data, and is an important part of [[identity management]] systems. The data being synchronized typically are collections of entries that contain user profiles and possibly authentication or policy information. Most metadirectory deployments synchronize data into at least one [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]-based directory server, to ensure that LDAP-based applications such as [[single sign-on]] and portal servers have access to recent data, even if the data is mastered in a non-LDAP data source.

Metadirectory products support filtering and transformation of data in transit.

Most [[identity management]] suites from commercial vendors include a metadirectory product, or a [[provisioning#User provisioning|user provisioning]] product.

'''New Zealand Tenancy Bonds Ltd v Mooney''' [1986] 1 NZLR 280 is an often cited case regarding misrepresentation and whether the misrepresentation was "essential" in order for a party to be able to cancel the contract under the [[Contractual Remedies Act 1979]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
New Zealand Tenancy Bonds made an unconditional offer to purchase Mooney's Christchurch property which was accepted the same day. The sale agreement specified that the deposit was to be paid "immediately on acceptance of this offer". The sale agreement also stated that the payment of the deposit was "strictly of the essence of the contract".

However, the purchaser waited 53 days before paying the deposit. The vendor, not happy with the delay, cancelled the contract, and refused to continue with the sale to the purchaser.

==Decision==
The court ruled that as the time for the payment of the deposit was an essential term of the contract, and as this term was not complied with, the vendor was entitled to cancel the sale agreement under the Contractual Remedies Act [1979].

Richardson J stated: "non-payment in the circumstances of the case constituted a fundamental breach entitling the vendor to cancel the contract in terms of s 7(3) and (4) of the Contractual Remedies Act 1979."

'''''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung''''' ({{zh|s=毛主席语录|t=毛主席語錄|p=Máo Zhǔxí Yǔlù}}) is a book of statements from speeches and writings by [[Mao Zedong]] (formerly [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as Mao Tse-tung), the former [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]], published from 1964 to about 1976 and widely distributed during the [[Cultural Revolution]].
 
The most popular versions were printed in small sizes that could be easily carried and were bound in bright red covers, becoming commonly known in the West as the '''''Little Red Book'''''.

== Publication process ==
''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung'' was originally compiled by an office of the ''[[PLA Daily]]'' (''People's Liberation Army Daily'') as an inspirational political and military document. The initial publication covered 23 topics with 200 selected quotations by the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and was entitled ''200 Quotations from Chairman Mao''. It was first given to delegates of a conference on 5 January 1964 who were asked to comment on it. In response to the views of the deputies and compilers of the book, the work was expanded to address 25 topics with 267 quotations, and the title was changed simply to ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung''.

On 10 January, the work was re-issued to the delegates and sent to select units of the [[People's Liberation Army]] who received their advance copies for educating troops as well as for their comments. In May 1964, the [[PLA General Political Department]], the chief political organ under [[Central Military Commission]], revised ''Quotations'', adding a half title page with the slogan "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]" (全世界的无产阶级，联合起来！) in bold red letters, and endorsement leaves written by [[Lin Biao]], Mao's chosen successor, that included three lines from the diary of revolutionary soldier [[Lei Feng]] who is considered a hero in China. This version was issued "for internal use" to the military leaders. Following discussions that expanded the book twice more—finally closing on 33&amp;nbsp;topics and 427&amp;nbsp;quotations by Mao—the commission began publishing the definitive version in May 1965.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
At the end of 1965, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] officially approved the book for publication by the People's Publishing House and for distribution within China by the [[Xinhua Bookstore]].

The [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]] held special study meetings to develop a production and distribution plan. It sought assurances that the book would receive publishing priority and that there would be sufficient paper, ink, and printing presses available. The goal was for "ninety-nine percent (of the population of China to) read Chairman Mao's book", according to a catalogue of publication records of the People's Publishing House.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across China were ordered to build hundreds of new printing houses to publish the ''Quotations'' during the second half of 1966 which pushed the limits of the Chinese printing industry.

This disrupted plans for publishing any new volumes of ''The Complete Works of Marx and Engels'' that was already in progress. It also halted distribution of other ideological works. As late as 1970, more than 8 million copies of the 4-volume set of ''Selected Works of Marx and Engels'' that had already been printed (both in cloth hardcover and paperback) remained undistributed in storage warehouses on the grounds that other works "should not interfere with learning ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung''".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

On the other hand, several other works by Mao had very large printings during the same period, even though these editions were not produced in the huge numbers of ''Quotations from Chairman Mao''. These include ''Selected Works of Mao Zedong'' (in four volumes, 2.875 million copies in 14 languages), ''Selected Articles of Mao Zedong'' (various editions totalling 252 million copies), single article books, and works of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chinascope.org/main/content/view/413/131/ |accessdate=10 March 2010 |title = How Much Did Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin Get Paid for Their Publications? |publisher = ChinaScope Magazine, September 2005 (Updated 8 February 2008), article by Jiao Guobiao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign distribution ==

In 1966, the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China]] approved ''Quotations from Chairman Mao'' for export. To meet overseas requirements, the editors of the Chinese [[Foreign Languages Press]] made revisions necessitated by the situation. They added a "second edition preface" endorsement by [[Lin Biao]], dated 16 December 1966 (which was torn out following Lin Biao's death and public disgrace in September 1971). On the last page, they listed the names of the publisher (PLA [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|General Political Department]]) without an [[ISBN]], the printer and distributor (both [[Xinhua Bookstore]]), and the publication year.

By May 1967, bookstores in 117 countries and territories around the world – including Great Britain, France, Spain, Japan, the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Nepal, Indonesia, Burma, Iran, Arab and African nations and others – were distributing Mao's ''Quotations''. Foreign presses operating in 20 countries contributed to the publication of 20 translations in 35 versions.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Publication number ==
The ''Little Red Book'' has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures. Some sources claim that over 6.5 billion printed volumes have been distributed in total,&lt;ref&gt;Zhengyuan Fu, ''Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics'', Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 186. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uGZIziWmlmsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=autocratic+tradition+and+chinese+politics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI56TJyKv6yAIViXE-Ch0DEQvm#v=onepage&amp;q=autocratic%20tradition%20and%20chinese%20politics&amp;f=false Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; others contend that the distribution ran into the "billions,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Kent]], Harold Lancour, Jay E.

[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Encyclopedia+of+Library+and+Information+Science%3A+Volume+22 Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science]&lt;/ref&gt; and others cite "over a billion" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as "untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander C. Cook, ''Mao's Little Red Book: A Global History'', Cambridge University Press 2014, p. xiii [https://books.google.com/books?id=ttjSAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mao%27s+little+red+book:+a+global+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIwsfq57T6yAIVSfI-Ch0XggzB#v=onepage&amp;q=mao's%20little%20red%20book%3A%20a%20global%20history&amp;f=false Mao's Little Red Book: A Global History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leese, ''Mao Cult: Rhetoric and Ritual in China's Cultural Revolution'', Cambridge University Press 2013, p. 108 [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqjviY6aFloC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mao+Cult:+Rhetoric+and+Ritual+in+China%27s+Cultural+Revolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIzqqJwq_6yAIVgTI-Ch3k6wSv#v=onepage&amp;q=Mao%20Cult%3A%20Rhetoric%20and%20Ritual%20in%20China's%20Cultural%20Revolution&amp;f=false Mao Cult: Rhetoric and Ritual in China's Cultural Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's popularity may be because it was essentially an unofficial requirement for every Chinese citizen to own, to read, and to carry it at all times during the latter half of Mao's rule, especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite book

The most widely produced editions of the ''Quotations of Chairman Mao'' were published with a printed red [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] cover wrapper over cardboard with pages bound in 64 folios that included colour photos of Mao. Other editions of the book were covered in cloth, silk, leather, paper, and other materials.

Most editions were produced in a functional, compact size that fitted into a pocket, were easy to carry, and could be taken out at any time "for practice, learning, application." It was published in 32 other common sizes, allegedly the largest format printed on only 4 pages as large as the newspaper ''[[Reference News]]'', and the smallest format the size of a [[matchbox]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Role and social impact ==
[[File:Huayangpalace layers 2007 09.jpg|thumb|185px|''Study Chairman Mao's writings, follow his teachings, and act according to his instructions.''-[[Lin Biao]] (with his name scratched out) on the Huayang Palace in [[Jinan]], photo 2007.]]
Today in China, the book is a symbol of [[Mao Zedong Thought]]. The tradition of the ritual chanting of slogans originated with [[Lin Biao]], whom Mao Zedong met in the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]]. Among the best known is: "Saying ''[[Wansui]]'' (literally: 10,000 years old) in their mouths, holding the Quotations (from Chairman Mao) in their hands!" ({{zh|s=万岁不离口，语录不离手！|hp=|links=no}}) which became a cliché of dogmatism or formalist irony.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In certain situations, the ''Quotations'' is given as a gift, for example, when public funds are involved, or when personal events arise, such as congratulating newlyweds, and so on.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Foreign press report called the work "The Little Red Book", reflecting its common small size and bright cover. After the [[Cultural Revolution]] ended, some Chinese people also adopted the nickname ([[back-translation|back-translated]] into Chinese as "The Treasured Red Book") {{zh|s=红宝书|t=紅寶書|p=''hóng bǎoshū''|links=no}}.

During the 1960s, the book was the single most visible icon in mainland China, even more visible than the image of the Chairman himself. In posters and pictures created by [[Communist Party of China|CPC's]] propaganda artists, nearly every painted character, whether smiling or looking determined, was seen with a copy of the book in his or her hand.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the rise of [[Deng Xiaoping]] in 1978, the importance of the book waned considerably, and the glorification of Mao's quotations was considered to be [[deviationism|left deviationism]] and a [[cult of personality]].

Today in China, the book ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung'' is mostly a piece of [[nostalgia]]. Various editions are popular with some collectors, and rare and unusual printings command extremely high prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2004-07/13/content_1595108.htm |script-title=zh:《毛主席语录》成为热门收藏品 |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=1 March 2011 |language=zh |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622081556/http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2004-07/13/content_1595108.htm |archive-date=22 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be purchased at shops in Beijing, Shanghai, other major cities in China, as well as at some tourist attractions.

==Synopsis==

''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung'' consists of 427 quotations, organized thematically into 33 chapters. It is also called "Thoughts of Chairman Mao" by many Chinese people. The quotations range in length from a sentence to a few short paragraphs, and borrow heavily from a group of about two dozen documents in the four volumes of Mao's ''Selected Works''.

In the book's latter half, a strong empiricist tendency evidences itself in Mao's thought.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Usually the quotations are arranged logically, to deal with one to three themes in the development of a chapter. The table below summarizes the book.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Chapter !! Number of quotations !! Title !! Summary
|-
| 1 || 13 || The Communist Party || The [[Chinese Communist Party]] is the core of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese revolution]], and its principles are based on [[Marxism–Leninism]]. Party criticism should be carried out within the Party.
|-
| 2 || 22 || Classes and Class Struggle || The revolution, and the recognition of [[Social class|class]] and [[class struggle]], are necessary for [[peasants]] and the [[Chinese people]] to overcome both domestic and foreign enemy elements. This is not a simple, clean, or quick struggle.
|-
| 3 || 28 || Socialism and Communism || [[Socialist mode of production|Socialism]] must be developed in China, and the route toward such an end is a democratic revolution, which will enable socialist and [[Communism|communist]] consolidation over a length of time. It is also important to unite with the middle peasants, and educate them on the failings of [[capitalism]].
|-
| 4 || 16 || The Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People || There are at least two basic kinds of contradiction: the antagonistic contradictions which exist between communist countries and their capitalist neighbors and between the people and the [[enemies of the people]], and the contradictions among the people themselves, people unconvinced of China's new path, which should be dealt with in a democratic and non-antagonistic fashion.
|-
| 5 || 21 || War and Peace || War is a continuation of politics, and there are at least two types: just (progressive) and unjust wars, which only serve bourgeois interests. While no one likes war, we must remain ready to wage just wars against imperialist agitations.
|-
| 6 || 10 || Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers || [[U.S. imperialism]], and [[European imperialism|European]] and domestic [[reactionary]] forces, represent real dangers, and in this respect are like real tigers. However, because the goal of [[Chinese communism]] is just, and reactionary interests are self-centered and unjust, after struggle, they will be revealed to be much less dangerous than they were earlier perceived to be.
|-
| 7 || 10 || Dare to Struggle and Dare to Win || Fighting is unpleasant, and the people of China would prefer not to do it at all. At the same time, they stand ready to wage a just struggle of self-preservation against reactionary elements, both foreign and domestic.
|-
| 8 || 10 || People's War || China's masses are the greatest conceivable weapon for fighting against [[Japanese imperialism]] and domestic reactionaries. Basic strategic points for war against the [[Kuomintang]] are also enumerated.
|-
| 9 || 8 || The People's Army || The [[People's Liberation Army|People's Army]] is not merely an organ for fighting; it is also an organ for the political advancement of the Party, as well as of production.
|-
| 10 || 14 || Leadership of Party Committees || Internal life of the Party is discussed. Committees are useful to avoid monopolization by others, and Party members must demonstrate honesty, openness in discussing problems, and the ability to learn and multitask.
|-
| 11 || 22 || The Mass Line || The mass line represents the creative and productive energies of the masses of the Chinese population, which are potentially inexhaustible. Party members should take their cue from the masses, and reinterpret policy with respect to the benefit of the masses.
|-
| 12 || 21 || Political Work || It is necessary for [[intellectuals]], [[students]], [[soldiers]] and the average [[peasant]] to pay attention and involve themselves with political work. This is particularly true in wartime.
|-
| 13 || 7 || Relations Between Officers and Men || Non-antagonistic and democratic relations between officers and men make for a stronger army.
|-
| 14 || 6 || Relations Between the Army and the People || An army that is cherished and respected by the people, and vice versa, is a nearly invincible force. The army and the people must unite on the grounds of basic respect.
|-
| 15 || 8 || Democracy in the Three Main Fields || [[New Democracy|Democracy]] and honesty play roles in the reform of the army, as well as in the life of the Party, and of cadres. "[[Western democracy|Ultra-democracy]]", which is defined as an [[Individualism|individualistic]] [[bourgeois]] aversion to [[discipline]], is to be avoided.
|-
| 16 || 9 || Education and the Training of Troops || [[Education in China|Education]] must have a practical and political basis for the army, Party and cadres. Along democratic lines, it will also be possible for the officers to teach the soldiers, for the soldiers to teach the officers, and for the soldiers to teach each other.
|-
| 17 || 9 || Serving the People || It is the duty of the cadres and the Party to serve the people. Without the people's interests constantly at heart, their work is useless.
|-
| 18 || 7 || Patriotism and Internationalism || The [[Socialist patriotism|patriotism]] of a [[communist nation]] and an [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist sympathy]] for just struggles in other countries are in no way exclusive; on the contrary, they are linked deeply, as [[World communism|communism spreads throughout the world]]. At the same time, it is important for a country to retain modesty, and shun arrogance.
|-
| 19 || 8 || Revolutionary Heroism || The same limitless creative energy of the masses is also visible in the army, in their fighting style and indomitable will.
|-
| 20 || 8 || Building Our Country Through Diligence and Frugality || China's road to [[modernization]] will be built on the principles of diligence and frugality. Nor will it be legitimate to relax if, 50 years later, modernization is realized on a mass scale.
|-
| 21 || 13 || Self-Reliance and Arduous Struggle || It is necessary for China to become [[Autarky|self-reliant]] in the course of the revolution, along the usual lines of class struggle. At the same time, it is a mistake for individuals to only see the good or the bad in a system, to the exclusion of all else.
|-
| 22 || 41 || Methods of Thinking and Methods of Work || Marxist [[dialectical materialism]], which connotes the constant struggle between opposites in an empirical setting, is the best method toward constant improvement. Objective analysis of problems based on empirical results is at a premium.
|-
| 23 || 9 || Investigation and Study || It is necessary to investigate both the facts and the history of a problem in order to study and understand it.
|-
| 24 || 15 || Correcting Mistaken Ideas || Arrogance, lack of achievement after a prosperous period, [[selfishness]], [[Laziness|shirking work]], and [[liberalism]], are all evils to be avoided in China's development. Liberalism is taken to mean that one may avoid conflict or work in order to be more comfortable for the moment, while the problem continues to grow.
|-
| 25 || 5 || Unity || Unity of the masses, the Party and the whole country is essential. At the same time, criticism may take place along comradely lines, while at the same time a basic unity is felt and preserved. This is the dialectical method.
|-
| 26 || 5 || Discipline || Discipline is seen not to be exclusive to democratic methods. Basic points of military conduct are also enumerated.
|-
| 27 || 15 || Criticism and Self-Criticism || [[Criticism]] is a part of the Marxist dialectical method which is central to Party improvement; as such, communists must not fear it, but engage in it openly.
|-
| 28 || 18 || Communists || A communist must be selfless, with the interests of the masses at heart. He must also possess a largeness of mind, as well as a practical, far-sighted mindset.
|-
| 29 || 11 || Cadres || [[Cadres]], the instrument for uniting with and working for the people, must be leaders versed in Marxist–Leninism. They must have both guidance and the freedom to use their creative inititave in solving problems. Newer cadres and older cadres must work together with a comradely respect, learning from each other.
|-
| 30 || 7 || Youth || The Chinese Youth represent an active, vital force in China, to be drawn upon. At the same time, it is necessary to educate them, and for the [[All-China Youth Federation|Youth League]] to give special attention to their problems and interests.
|-
| 31 || 7 || Women || [[Chinese women|Women]] represent a great productive force in China, and [[Gender equality|equality among the sexes]] is one of the goals of communism. The multiple burdens which women must shoulder are to be eased.
|-
| 32 || 8 || Culture and Art || [[Chinese literature|Literature]] and [[Chinese art|art]] are discussed with respect to communism, in an [[Socialist realism|orthodox fashion]]. (Principally consisting of quotations from "[[Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art|Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art]]".)
|-
| 33 || 16 || Study || It is the responsibility of all to cultivate themselves, and study Marxism–Leninism deeply. It is also necessary for people to turn their attention to contemporary problems, along empirical lines.

{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}
{{lowercase|title=resolvconf}}
In some [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]] distributions, and other [[Unix]]-like [[operating system]]s, the '''resolvconf''' program maintains the system information about the currently available [[name server]]s and manages the contents of the [[configuration file]] ''[[resolv.conf]]'', which determines [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) [[resolver (DNS)|resolver]] parameters.

Before a computer can connect to an external network resource by name, it must  convert that alpha-numeric name (e.g., ''wikipedia.org'') into its corresponding [[network address]] called an [[IP address]] (e.g., ''66.230.200.10''). The computer performs this conversion  by contacting one of a number of special computers called name servers, which have tables of resource names and corresponding IP addresses. The information about the servers is kept in the configuration file ''resolv.conf''. However, when multiple programs need to dynamically modify the ''resolv.conf'' file, they can interfere with each other and store incorrect information in the file.

The ''resolvconf'' program addresses this problem. It acts as an intermediary between programs that supply name server information (e.g., [[DHCP]] clients) and programs that use name server information (e.g., [[resolver (DNS)|resolvers]]). When ''resolvconf'' is properly installed, the ''resolv.conf'' file is replaced by a [[symbolic link]] to &lt;tt&gt;/etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt; and the resolver instead uses the dynamically generated linked file. In a system without resolvconf, the file is normally maintained manually or by a collection of scripts. The scripts may cause problems, because there is no program to control access to the file. Resolvconf controls access to the file, allowing many programs to use it at the same time.

resolvconf cannot easily be disabled on some systems.  On FreeBSD it can be disabled by placing &lt;tt&gt;resolvconf=NO&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;resolvconf.conf(5)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=resolvconf&amp;sektion=8&lt;/ref&gt;

In securely administered environments the resolvconf program (or [[daemon (computing)|daemon]], depending on the implementation) causes uneasiness since it interferes with the containment of &lt;tt&gt;resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt; security vulnerabilities, making changes to it without authorization. (Centralized change management, or centralized compliance, requires that system changes cannot be made from the sidelines.)

'''SIKART''' is a [[biographical dictionary]] and a database on [[visual art]] in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is published online by the [[Swiss Institute for Art Research]] (SIAR). Conceptually and in content, it is an expanded and continually updated online version of the SIAR's 1998 ''Biographical Lexicon of Swiss Art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biografisches Lexikon der Schweizer Kunst|first=Karl|last=Jost|publisher=Verlag Neue Zürcher Zeitung|date=1998|editor=Schweizerisches Institut für Kunstwissenschaft|isbn=3-85823-673-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured 12,000 short entries and some 1,100 detailed biographical articles.&lt;ref name=Masthead&gt;{{cite web|title=Masthead|work=SIKART|url=http://sik-isea.ch/Datenbanken/SIKART/tabid/56/Default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
SIKART states that it is aimed at both specialists and members of the general public with an interest in art. It covers professional artists from Switzerland and Liechtenstein "who work or have worked in the genres of [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[engraving]], [[sculpture]], [[Video art|video]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[photography]], [[performance art|performance]] and [[web art]]", but not artists "who worked or work exclusively in the [[applied arts]] ([[graphic art]], [[design]], [[bell foundry]], [[gold work]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], documentary photography, etc.)"&lt;ref name=Masthead/&gt;

The content is written in the language the artist is most associated with: French, Italian or German. The artists are rated with one to five stars according to their significance, which determines the depth of coverage. For all artists in SIKART, the database records the name (and any variants), the dates of birth and death, a brief [[Curriculum vitae|CV]], keywords and [[Index term|descriptors]], lexica entries, a bibliography and a link to the artist's website (if any). For artists rated with three to five stars, biographical articles of two to four pages in length are also provided, as are digital reproductions of their artworks.&lt;ref name=Masthead/&gt; 

==Funding==
SIKART is funded by the [[Swiss Confederation]], the [[Swiss cantons]] and private donors.&lt;ref name=Masthead/&gt; The website can be accessed free of charge, but at launch SIAR intended to charge for access at a later date so as to enable SIKART to operate independently of public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.unil.ch/isea/3Services/sprojSIKonline_deu.htm Laufende Forschugsprojekte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111115822/http://www2.unil.ch/isea/3Services/sprojSIKonline_deu.htm |date=2006-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scrivener''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|r|ɪ|v|ən|ər}}) is a [[Word processor program|word-processing program]] and [[outliner]] designed for [[author]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT 2008"&gt;{{cite news |last=Heffernan |first=Virginia |authorlink=Virginia Heffernan |title=An interface of one's own |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=6 January 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06wwln-medium-t.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210202540/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06wwln-medium-t.html |archivedate=10 December 2008 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrivener provides a management system for documents, notes and [[metadata]]. This allows the user to organize notes, concepts, research and whole documents for easy access and reference (documents including [[rich text]], images, [[PDF]], audio, video, web pages, etc.). Scrivener offers templates for screenplays, fiction, and non-fiction manuscripts. After writing a text, the user may export it for final formatting to a standard [[word processor]], [[screenwriting software]], [[desktop publishing]] software, or [[TeX]].

==Features==
Features include a corkboard, the ability to rearrange files by dragging-and-dropping virtual [[index card]]s on the corkboard, an [[outliner]], a split screen mode that enables users to edit several documents at once, a full-screen mode, the ability to export text into multiple document formats (including popular [[e-book]] formats like [[EPUB]] and [[Mobipocket]] for [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]], and markup languages such as [[Fountain (markup language)|Fountain]], [[HTML]], and [[MultiMarkdown]]), the ability to assign multiple keywords (and other metadata) to parts of a text and to sort the parts by keyword (such as characters, locations, themes, narrative lines, etc.), [[hyperlink]]s between parts of a text, and "snapshots" (the ability to save a copy of a particular document prior to any drastic changes).

Scrivener allows photos, URLs, and multiple other file formats, to be dragged into its interface as well. Because of its breadth of interfaces and features, it has positioned itself not only as a word processor, but as a [[Project management software|project management tool]] for writers, and includes many user-interface features that resemble [[Xcode]], Apple's [[integrated development environment]] (IDE). One computer programmer has called Scrivener "an IDE for writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bailey |first=Dan |title=Writing as programming |website=danbailey.net |date=24 January 2013 |url=http://www.danbailey.net/blog/2013/01/24/writing-as-programming/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002191944/http://www.danbailey.net/blog/2013/01/24/writing-as-programming/ |archivedate=2 October 2015 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Blount created, and continues to maintain, the program as a tool to help him write the "big novel", allowing him to keep track of ideas and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watt |first=Justin |title=Keith Blount, founder and lead developer at Literature &amp; Latte |website=objectivesee.com |date=2012 |url=http://www.objectivesee.com/keith.blount.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202062410/http://www.objectivesee.com/keith.blount.html |archivedate=2 February 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cordella |first=Francesco |date=May 2013 |title=Scrivener and me: an interview with Keith Blount |website=avventuretestuali.com |url=http://www.avventuretestuali.com/interviste/keith-blount-english/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427081859/http://www.avventuretestuali.com/interviste/keith-blount-english/ |archivedate=27 April 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built mostly on libraries and features of Mac [[OS X]] from version 10.4 onward. In 2011, a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the software was released, written and maintained by Lee Powell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About - Clever Dictionary |website=cleverdictionary.com |url=http://www.cleverdictionary.com/about/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126212126/http://www.cleverdictionary.com/about/ |archivedate=26 November 2014 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iOS ===
Scrivener for [[iOS]] was launched for iOS July 20, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener_ios.php|title=Scrivener just got a whole lot smaller|last=|first=|date=27 June 2016|website=Literature and Latte (official Scrivener site)|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux ===
There is no official release for [[Linux]], but there is a public beta version&lt;ref name="Linux"/&gt; which has been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laden |first=Greg |date=29 August 2014 |title=Scrivener on Linux: Try it, you’ll like it |website=scienceblogs.com |url=http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2014/08/29/scrivener-on-linux-try-it-youll-like-it/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908094515/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2014/08/29/scrivener-on-linux-try-it-youll-like-it/ |archivedate=8 September 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2017}} Updated as: {{cite web |last=Laden |first=Greg |date=2 January 2016 |title=Scrivener on Linux: Oh Well... |website=scienceblogs.com |url=http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2014/08/29/scrivener-on-linux-try-it-youll-like-it/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514064217/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2014/08/29/scrivener-on-linux-try-it-youll-like-it/ |archivedate=14 May 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macintosh ===
The latest version of Scrivener for Mac is version 3.0, and requires [[macOS Sierra]] or newer.&lt;ref name="Change List Mac"/&gt; Scrivener can be obtained from the [[Mac App Store]], but since the Mac App Store application is only usable on OS X 10.6.6 and later, users of earlier versions of OS X must buy it directly from the developer's website instead of the Mac App Store.&lt;ref name="Mac Download"&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrivener for Mac OS X Download |website=literatureandlatte.com |url=http://www.literatureandlatte.com/download_mac.php |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also makes Scrivener 2.5 available for earlier version of Mac OS X, but claims it is the final version of the software that was built to run on both [[PowerPC]] and Intel systems running Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.8. This version is available on the direct sale page in the sidebar titled "Mac OS X 10.4–8 and PowerPC".&lt;ref name="Mac Download"/&gt;

In addition to the Scrivener version 2 releases, the direct download page provides access to the obsolete version 1.54, but licenses are no longer available for purchase. The 1.54 release is compatible with Mac OS X versions 10.4 through 10.6.&lt;ref name="Mac Download"/&gt;

===Windows ===
The latest stable version of Scrivener for Windows is 1.9.7&lt;ref name="Change List Win"/&gt; It is compatible with [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows 10]]. Windows versions (1.xx) were released after Mac OS X version 2.xx, and are priced similarly as the Mac version. The developers have stated version numbers will be aligned when version 3.0 for Windows is released, currently in beta and expected later in 2018.&lt;ref name="Win 3.0 version"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literatureandlatte.com/introducing-scrivener-3|title=Introducing Scrivener 3|website=Literature &amp; Latte|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="win3beta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Jennifer|title=Scrivener 3.0 beta|url=https://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&amp;t=40621|website=www.litteratureandlate.com/forums|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) hierarchy, a '''subdomain''' is a [[domain name|domain]], that is a part of a main domain.&lt;ref name="RFC 1034 section 3.1"&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=1034 |title=Domain names - concepts and facilities |section=3.1 |sectionname=Name space specifications and terminology |author=P. Mockapetris |authorlink=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) has a [[tree structure]] or hierarchy, with each non-RR ([[resource record]]) node on the tree being a [[domain name]].  A '''subdomain''' is a domain that is part of a larger domain; the only domain that is not also a subdomain is the [[root domain]].&lt;ref name="RFC 1034 section 3.1" /&gt; For example, &lt;code&gt;west.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;east.example.com&lt;/code&gt; are subdomains of the &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; domain, which in turn is a subdomain of the &lt;code&gt;com&lt;/code&gt; [[top-level domain]] (TLD).
A "subdomain" expresses relative dependence, not absolute dependence: for example, &lt;code&gt;wikipedia.org&lt;/code&gt; comprises a subdomain of the &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; domain, and &lt;code&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/code&gt; comprises a subdomain of the domain &lt;code&gt;wikipedia.org&lt;/code&gt;. In theory this subdivision can go 127 levels deep&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dummies.com/programming/networking/network-administration-domains-and-domain-names&lt;/ref&gt; (though that limit is not in any published RFC). Per RFC 1035, each [[DNS label]] can contain up to 63 characters, as long as the whole domain name does not exceed a total length of 255 characters, but in practice most [[domain name registry|domain registries]] limit at 253 characters.

Subdomains in this context are defined by editing the DNS '''zone''' file pertaining to the parent domain. However, there is an ongoing debate over the use of the term “subdomain” when referring to names which map to the [[List of DNS record types#A|Address record]] A (host) and various other types of zone records which may map to any public [[IP address]] destination and any type of server. Certain{{which|date=March 2015}} groups insist that it is inappropriate to use the term “subdomain” to refer to any mapping other than that provided by zone [[Authoritative name server|NS]] (name server) records and any server-destination other than that

== Uses ==

In the [[United Kingdom]], the third-level domain names are standard and branch off from the [[second-level domain|second-level domains]]. For example:

* .ac.uk - [[academic]] ([[tertiary education]], [[further education colleges]] and [[research institute|research establishments]]) and [[learned society|learned societies]]
* .co.uk - general use (usually [[Commercial enterprise|commercial]])
* .gov.uk - [[government]] (central and local)
* .judiciary.uk - [[court]]s (to be introduced in the near future)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15860533 |title=BBC News - UK court systems set to adopt judiciary.uk domain names |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* .ltd.uk - [[limited company|limited companies]]
* .me.uk - general use (usually [[person]]al)
* .mod.uk - [[Ministry of Defence]] and [[HM Forces]] public sites
* .net.uk - [[ISP]]s and [[Telecommunications company|network companies]] (unlike [[.net]], use is restricted to these users)
* .nhs.uk - [[National Health Service]] institutions
* .nic.uk - [http://www.nic.uk/registrars/becomeregistrar/taglist/ network use only] ([[Nominet UK]])
* .org.uk - general use (usually for [[non-profit organisation]]s)
* .parliament.uk - parliamentary use (only for the [[UK Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]])
* .plc.uk - [[public limited company|public limited companies]]
* .police.uk - [[UK police|police forces]]
* .sch.uk - [[Local education authority|Local Education Authorities]], [[school]]s, [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], [[community education]]

Subdomains are also used by organizations that wish to assign a unique name to a particular department, function, or service related to the organization.  For example, a university might assign "cs" to the computer science department, such that a number of hosts could be used inside that subdomain, such as &lt;code&gt;mail.cs.example.edu&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;www.cs.example.edu&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Vanity domain ===
A [[vanity domain]] is a subdomain of an ISP's domain that is aliased to an individual user account, or a subdomain that expresses the individuality of the person on whose behalf it is registered.

=== Server cluster ===
Depending on application, a [[Resource record|record]] inside a domain, or subdomain might refer to a [[hostname]], or a service provided by a number of machines in a cluster. Some websites use different subdomains to point to different [[server cluster]]s. For example, &lt;code&gt;[[example.com|www.example.com]]&lt;/code&gt; points to Server Cluster 1 or Datacentre 1, and &lt;code&gt;www2.example.com&lt;/code&gt; points to Server Cluster 2 or Datacentre 2 etc..

Some domains host their [[nameservers]] as ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com, etc., and these do not typically show up in search engine results.

==== Subdomains versus directories ====
Subdomains are different from directories. For example, [[example.com|example.com/yn]] points to a [[Directory (computing)|directory]] within the example.com domain, not to a subdomain of example.com.

'''''Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass''''' [1971] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1971/1.html UKHL 1] is a leading decision of the [[House of Lords]] on the "directing mind" theory of [[corporate liability]].

This is a leading case on the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]] section 24(1), where Tesco relied upon the defence of the ‘act or omission of another person’ i.e. their store manager, to show that they had taken all reasonable precautions and all due diligence.

==Facts==
[[Tesco]] was offering a discount on washing powder which was advertised on posters displayed in stores. Once they ran out of the lower priced product the stores began to replace it with the regularly priced stock. The manager failed to take the signs down and a customer was charged at the higher price. Tesco was charged under the ''[[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]]'' for falsely advertising the price of washing powder. In its defence Tesco argued that the company had taken all reasonable precautions and all due diligence, and that the conduct of the manager could not attach liability to the corporation.

==Judgment==
The House of Lords accepted the defence and found that the manager was not a part of the "[[directing mind]]" of the corporation and therefore his conduct was not attributable to the corporation. The corporation had done all it could to enforce the rules regarding advertising.
 
Lord Reid held that, in order for liability to attach to the actions of a person, it must be the case that "The person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company."

In the House of Lords Tesco were successful with their defence showing that,
* a store manager was classed as ‘another person’, and,
* a system of delegating responsibility to that person was performance of due diligence, not avoidance of it

The store manager was not the directing mind and will of the company - the company had done all it could to avoid committing an offence and the offence was the fault of another person (an employee). The company was acquitted.

[[File:Teylers Challenge april 2012 - 7066.JPG|thumb|right|Teylers Coin and Medal Room]]
The '''Teylers Coin and Medal Room''', or '''Numismatisch Kabinet''', is a small display room in [[Teylers Museum]] that was designed in 1888 and furnished with special display cabinets in 1889.&lt;ref name=RCE&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1884 the expansion of the museum, called "Nieuwe Museum" (New Museum), with the addition of the entrance on the Spaarne river and the new Fossil rooms, had just been completed to commemorate 100 years of exhibits in the Oval Room. At the same time, the small room that had formerly been used for fossils was set up for use by the coin and medal collection. Pieter Teyler's personal coin and medal collection of 1,623 pieces was one of the original parts of the Teyler collection, but the viewing of the coins was only possible when 2 directors of [[Teylers Stichting]] were available to unlock the collection. Besides Pieter Teyler's original collection, the Teyler's had acquired collections of 675 coins from [[West-Friesland]] and 2,395 coins of [[Gelderland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/pdf/01_002.pdf Het penningkabinet van Teylers Museum]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, by H.E. van Gelder, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Atlas of Middle-earth''''' by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] is an [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]] of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fiction]]al realm of [[Middle-earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHAyr784pREC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=The Essential J. R. R. Tolkien Sourcebook |author=George Beahm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1981, following Tolkien's major works ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

''The Atlas'' includes many detailed maps of the lands described in those books. A revised and updated second edition was published in 1991, after publication of eight volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] after his father's death. A reissue edition was published in 2001.

The maps are treated as if they are of real landscapes, drawn according to the rules of a real atlas. For each area the history of the land is taken into account, as well as geography on a larger scale and from there maps are drawn. Discussion includes suggestions as to the geology that could explain various formations, and points that are contradictory between multiple accounts.

[[City map]]s and floor plans for important buildings are also included.

Karen Wynn Fonstad had earned a master's degree in Geography, specializing in [[cartography]], from the [[University of Oklahoma]], and worked as Director of Cartographic Services at the [[University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh]] before "retirement" to raising children and writing atlases of fictional worlds.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author", ''[[The Atlas of Pern]]'', New York: Del Rey Books, 1984.

The '''Vallard Atlas '''is a world [[atlas]], one of the [[Dieppe maps|Dieppe school of maps]], produced in 1547. It is believed to have been owned by Nicolas Vallard, its authorship being unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/digitalscriptorium/huntington/HM29.html |title=Guide To Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the Huntington Library : PORTOLAN ATLAS, anonymous |publisher=Bancroft.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is considered one of the most notable 16th century atlases of the Dieppe school of Cartography. It is believed that Nicholas Vallard was the first owner and this is why the publication bears his name &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=L'énigme de l'atlas dieppois|first1=Gilles|last1=Lapouge|pages=104-111|journal=GEOHISTOIRE|issue=2|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atlas is held at the [[Huntington Library]] based in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], California, US.

== Description ==
The atlas is made of 68 pages and contains 15 [[Nautical chart|nautical charts]] with rich illustrations as well as a calendar and some in-depth maritime information. 
The atlas contains numerous [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] that show the new world inhabitants and this is why it is considered a valuable testimony of discovery. The original publication is bound in crimson leather with golden decorations.

The maps depicted in the atlas are inverted compared to modern depictions, as the north pole is placed on the bottom side of the atlas while the south pole is placed on the top.&lt;ref name=val/&gt;

There is some speculation that like some other works of the Dieppe school of maps, the atlas shows the Australian coastline, a continent entitled [[Jave la Grande]], which would mean it was painted before the documented arrival of [[Willem Janszoon]] or [[James Cook]].&lt;ref name=val&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atlas Vallard, Libro de estudio|first1=Luís Filipe F.R.|last1=Thomaz|first2=D.|last2=Reinhartz|first3=C.M.|last3=García-Tejedor|year=2010|publisher=M.

Adelaide. {{ISBN|978-0-9751145-9-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; However, most historians do not accept this theory, and the interpretation of this feature of the Vallard and other Dieppe maps is highly contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=William Arthur Ridley|title=The Portuguese Discovery of Australia, Fact or Fiction?|date=1989|publisher=National Library of Australia|location=Canberra|isbn=0642104816|page=6|url=http://dspace.flinders.edu.au/xmlui/handle/2328/25694|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A voyage of rediscovery about a voyage of rediscovery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/26/australia.leadersandreply|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=The Guardian|date=26 March 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.

'''Wowpedia''' is a [[wiki]] about the ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'' [[fictional universe]]. It covers all of the ''Warcraft'' games, including the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. It is both a specialized wiki built around the ''Warcraft'' universe and a collaborative space for players to develop and publish strategies for ''Warcraft'' games. It was officially announced on 25 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.curse.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-news/857376.aspx |title=Ex-WoWWiki Admins Join Curse to Create Wowpedia |publisher=Curse |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2010-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028210559/http://www.curse.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-news/857376.aspx |archive-date=2010-10-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
Wowpedia began as [[WoWWiki]] on 24 November 2004 as a source of information pertaining to the ''World of Warcraft'' universe, including the [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] games, novels, the RPG reference books, manga, and other written sources, along with the ''WoW'' expansion packs, ''[[World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade|The Burning Crusade]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|Wrath of the Lich King]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor|Warlords of Draenor]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft: Legion|Legion]]'', and ''[[World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth|Battle for Azeroth]]''.

In 2007, the WoWWiki community joined [[Wikia]], and in the process transferred the rights to the "WoWWiki" domain name to Wikia. In late 2010, Wikia introduced a new fixed-width skin which caused layout issues with many articles and broke JavaScript-based features such as tooltips&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Forum:Should_WoWWiki_leave_Wikia%3F |title=Forum:Should WoWWiki leave Wikia? |publisher=WoWWiki |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718115702/http://www.wowwiki.com/Forum:Should_WoWWiki_leave_Wikia%3F |archive-date=2011-07-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as generating reports of eye strain and headaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.obscurecast.com/2010/10/the-obscurecast-ep-23-a-room-with-a-moose/ |title=The Obscurecast Ep 23: A Room With A Moose |publisher=The Obscurecast |date=October 30, 2010 |access-date=2010-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112064528/http://www.obscurecast.com/2010/10/the-obscurecast-ep-23-a-room-with-a-moose/ |archive-date=2010-11-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, the content and article history was [[fork (software development)|forked]] to Wowpedia.org on 20 October 2010, with most of the administrators of WoWWiki, as well as many of the other active contributors, moving to Wowpedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://azeroth.metblogs.com/2010/10/21/wowwiki-is-moving-to-wowpedia/ |title=WoWWiki is moving to Wowpedia |first=Alan |last=Henry |date=October 21, 2010 |access-date=2010-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027084739/http://azeroth.metblogs.com/2010/10/21/wowwiki-is-moving-to-wowpedia/ |archive-date=2010-10-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.curse.com/news/world-of-warcraft-news/16072-ex-wowwiki-admins-join-curse-to-create-wowpedia |title=Ex-WoWWiki Admins Join Curse to Create Wowpedia - Curse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2018-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229230346/http://www.curse.com/news/world-of-warcraft-news/16072-ex-wowwiki-admins-join-curse-to-create-wowpedia |archive-date=2012-12-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=Rik |date=November 2014 |title=Hypersocial-Interactive Writing: An Audience of Readers-as-Writers |url=http://licsjournal.org/OJS/index.php/LiCS/article/view/51/77 |journal=Literacy in Composition Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=17-43 |doi=10.21623/1.2.2.3 |access-date=2018-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063314/http://licsjournal.org/OJS/index.php/LiCS/article/view/51/77 |archive-date=2018-03-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2010, [[Blizzard Entertainment]] began to incorporate links to Wowpedia, as well as the database site [[Wowhead]], into the new version of its World of Warcraft Community Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1334974|title=World of Warcraft: The New World of Warcraft Community Site|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|date=December 6, 2010|access-date=2018-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530124146/http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1334974|archive-date=2016-05-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wowpedia's usefulness and strength as a wiki is in its establishment as a touchstone of "participatory culture", a "discourse community [...] in which more experienced contributors and various types of administrators play more or less strong roles in the editing process, often asking questions about edits made and offering suggestions."&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt; The success of Wowpedia has been described as the results of its editors' "blissful productivity, hard work and dedication at play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Smashing Book #2 |location= |publisher=Smashing Media GmbH |page=231 |date=March 2011 |isbn=9783943075229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wowpedia's format and coverage of the Warcraft games and lore contained therein has been used as an illustration of "the dedication of the community and how fans help each other when Blizzard’s official documents do not provide adequate guidance about gameplay features or the best way to engage with the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Bishop |first=Sarah |date=May 2013 |title=A Grandiose Reality: Addiction and Technical Communication in the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game |type=MA |publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/4550/BISHOP-THESIS-2013.pdf |access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In July 2013, Wowpedia moved to [[Curse]]'s [[Gamepedia]] game-based [[wiki hosting service]]. In December 2014, Wowpedia's URL was changed to a gamepedia domain, but the onscreen Wowpedia identity such as logos was retained.

In a career that spanned from the 1950s into the 1970s, he garnered several world championships.

==Early life==
Weiczorkiewicz was born in 1926 in [[Roanne]], [[Loire]], [[France]] to a [[Russia]]n father and a [[Poland|Polish]] mother.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He joined the French resistance during [[World War II]] under the [[Germany|German]] occupation and was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] and the [[Croix du combattant volontaire de la Résistance|Croix du combattant]] medals by the French government at the close of the war.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He moved to [[Montreal, Québec]] in 1956 and became a Canadian citizen.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He also became an all around athlete with gymnastic skills.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Carpentier was a crowd favourite, one of the first wrestlers to delight fans with acrobatic leaps from the turnbuckles and a variety of other aerial manoeuvres such as the [[Professional wrestling throws#Frankensteiner|rope-aided twisting headscissors]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He was always a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favourite]] in his bouts and was matched against numerous [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], perhaps the most well known of whom was the legendary [[Killer Kowalski]].

The highpoint of his career was his [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] reign from 1956 to 1957.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He won the title in a disputed contest against [[Lou Thesz]] on 14 June 1957.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Some NWA territories and officials recognized the disputed win as a legitimate title change, while others did not.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; This led to the split of the NWA and led to the creation of the [[American Wrestling Association]] and other organizations, all with their own world titles.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He was later recognized as the first holder of the AWA's Omaha version of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He eventually [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the belt to [[Verne Gagne]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Carpentier headlined [[Madison Square Garden]] three times in 1962 with tag team partner [[Bobo Brazil]]. They had two main events against [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] &amp; Handsome [[Johnny Barend]]; another against Rogers &amp; [[Killer Kowalski]]. He teamed numerous times with [[Antonino Rocca]], as well as with [[Vittorio Apollo]]. In solo matches at the Garden, he defeated [[Giant Baba]], [[Skull Murphy]], Magnificent Maurice, and [[Hans Mortier]].&lt;ref name=WWF6389Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 - 1989  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 | isbn=1492825972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement, Carpentier operated a school for teaching professional wrestling skills.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He also operated in the early 1980s as a babyface colour commentator, alongside heel play-by-play host Guy Hauray, for the Montreal-based [[Grand Prix Wrestling]], and then, together for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], when the WWF bought the Montreal territory in 1985. They hosted the French edition of the WWF television show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', sold to French-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He was replaced by former Québécois wrestler [[Raymond Rougeau]] in 1992.

==Death==
On 30 October 2010, Carpentier died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in [[Montreal]], aged 84. He had also suffered a heart attack in 2000. Carpentier had been in poor health for many years, battered from his acrobatic, high-flying style.&lt;ref name="slam_20101101"/&gt;

The '''[[Türkiye İş Bankası|İş Bank]] commercial featuring [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]''', the founder of [[Turkey]], first aired on Turkish television channels on 10 November 2007, coinciding with the 69th commemoration of Atatürk's death in 1938. This is reportedly the first commercial featuring Atatürk.&lt;ref name="Haberturk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haber5.com/haber.php?haber_id=298719|title=Atatürk'lü reklam filminin kamera arkası (video)|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Haber Türk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The commercial features a dialogue between a young boy and Atatürk working in a [[rose garden]]. A thorn pricks Atatürk's finger. The boy asks how a thorn ''can'' prick Atatürk's hand. Atatürk replies with the question: "can it not prick?" The boy further asks how Atatürk's hand ''can'' bleed. Atatürk replies with the question: "can it not bleed?" Shocked, the boy inquires whether he isn't Atatürk? Atatürk replies that he is indeed Atatürk. The boy, still shocked, replies "but...". Atatürk interrupts and explains that if one is going to grow a rose, one will suffer pain, one's hand will bleed, sun will make one sweat, there will be people putting to the gardener that the roses in the garden will never die, and that there will be people confronting the gardener on how a rose is supposed to be grown. Atatürk continues by saying that the boy should be asking him just one question: "Do I want to make this place a rose garden? Do I want to grow the world's most beautiful roses in this garden?" Atatürk further adds that if the boy really wishes it to be so, "he wouldn't care about neither the thorns that prick nor the words said". Atatürk continues by saying that whoever it might be, all he would care about is the scent of the rose garden. Atatürk concludes by asking, whether the boy understood the lesson and the boy acknowledges this. The commercial concludes with the statement "We respectfully commemorate Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of our country and bank".&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt;

==Production==
[[Image:Mustafa Kemal rose garden.ogv|thumb|The original sequence that is behind the inspiration at the rose garden]]
The commercial was directed by [[Gürkan Kurtkaya]] and was shot in black and white giving it a historic feel with the slogan "the roses you have grown are mourning" ({{lang-tr|Yetiştirdiğin güller bugün matemdeler}}).&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aksam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=98052,8|title=Atatürk belgeseli gibi reklam filmi|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Akşam]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112012132/http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=98052,8 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations for the commercial lasted three weeks. The actual filming itself lasted 3 days. A technical team made out of 50 people took part in the filming. For the details of the era, [[Rıdvan Akar]] was consulted.&lt;ref name="Aksam"/&gt;

The role of the boy was acted by [[Hakan Büyüktopçu]] and the role of Atatürk was acted by [[Haluk Bilginer]]. Prior to the shooting, [[Haluk Bilginer]] received a natural make-up lasting hours.&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt; Including the test shootings, Bilginer spent a total of 40 hours in the make-up room. The make-up work was conducted by [[Vittorio Sodano]] and his team. For one week, the make-up team worked in [[Italy]] for preparations and worked for another week in the set during the shootings. To convert Bilginer's face to Atatürk, first a cast was made of his face. Hair and eyebrow pieces that were prepared in Italy were put in their places by [[Suzan Kardeş]] after a 2-day worth work on them. The costumes were based on a photo from June 21, 1936 of Atatürk.
