      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">'''Abdulrab Muhammad Muhammad Ali al-Sayfi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ) a Yemeni, became wanted in 2002, by the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[FBI]], which was then seeking information about his identity and whereabouts. He was identified as a known associate of the Yemen cell leader, [[Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei]].

He is no longer listed by the FBI on their "Seeking Information" lists.

== February 12, 2002 Yemeni terror alert ==
On February 11, 2002, al-Sayfi was named in a suspected Yemen plot, for which he was among 17 suspected terrorists (3 days later reduced to 11 suspects) were added to the FBI's third major "wanted" list, the "[[FBI Seeking Information - Terrorism list#Yemen plot|Seeking Information" list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI - Seeking Information - 2-11-02|url=http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/2-11-02.htm|publisher=FBI|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020605061032/http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/2-11-02.htm|archive-date=5 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, his details had been removed and archived from the FBI's current main wanted pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Wanted Terrorists|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists|publisher=FBI|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeking Information - Terrorism|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo|publisher=FBI|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether foiled, aborted, or merely incorrect specific intelligence, the February 12, 2002 attack never occurred. However, other [[Terrorism in Yemen|attacks and plots in Yemen]] soon followed.

'''Age fraud''' is [[age fabrication]] or the use of false documentation to gain an advantage over opponents. In football, it is common amongst players belonging to nations where records are not easily verifiable. The media often refer to the player with false documentation as an "age-cheat".

There are several reasons why players choose to use false documentation. In countries that could be considered poor, European [[scout (sport)|scouts]] are looking for young talented players to sign for a European club. The players know that there is a lesser chance of being signed if they are, for example, 23 years old as opposed to 17 years old as there would be less time for the club to develop the player.

FIFA say that "over-age players have been wrongly entered into various youth competitions, often benefiting from an unfair advantage due to their greater physical maturity compared to players of the proper age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caught by the wrists |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/medical/news/newsid=1121679.html |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106072312/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/medical/news/newsid%3D1121679.html |archivedate=6 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, it is possible for the player not to know their own date of birth and make an approximate guess when it comes to gaining official documents.

==Examples==

===Africa===
One of the best known examples of a player falsifying documentations is Cameroon's international football defender [[Tobie Mimboe]] who held several documents during the course of his career that indicated he became younger as time went by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkey|first=Ian|title=Feet of the chameleon : the story of African football|year=2009|publisher=Portico|location=London|isbn=978-1-906032-71-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Nigeria's youth national teams were banned by [[FIFA]] for fielding over-age players in FIFA-organised youth tournaments. The birth dates of three players at the 1988 Olympics were different than the ones used by those players at previous tournaments.&lt;ref name=foreveryoung&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/21/nigerian-football-age-old-problem | title = Forever young: Nigerian football's age-old problem | last =  | first =  |date = 21 February 2010 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ban lasted for two years and Nigeria was also stripped of its right to host the [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After The Eaglets Have Landed|url=http://www.nigeriavillagesquare.com/articles/chris-ngwodo/after-the-eaglets-have-landed.html|publisher=NigeriaVillageSquare.com|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South African journalist Thomas Kwenaite uncovered several "age-cheats" representing South Africa who participated in an Under-15 age group tournament hosted in France. The captain of that side was a 24-year-old third-year University student from Port Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=supersport-kwenaite&gt;{{cite web|last=Kwenaite|first=Thomas|title=Age cheating has come back to haunt us|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/blogs/thomas-kwenaite/Age_cheating_has_come_back_to_haunt_us|publisher=SuperSport.com|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After revealing the age of the player, the player's father took Kwenaite to the South African press ombudsman for "slander" before withdrawing his complaint after it was found that school records show that the player would have started school aged 2 years old. Kwenaite also claims that he was told that he was "unpatriotic" for reporting the story.

In late 1999, Anthony Kojo Williams was appointed as head of the [[Nigeria Football Federation]]. He lasted less than three months in the job and was dismissed because, in NFF board member Zaria Sani's words "he has failed to carry the other board members along"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigerian soccer chief replaced|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/africa/cup_of_nations/cup_news/609067.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=18 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 BBC World service documentary ''Africa Kicks'', Williams stated that the Nigerian Government were "afraid of change". He went on to say, "I don't see Nigerian football getting out of the quagmire, the problem it is in today is because it [corruption] is getting deeper and deeper and deeper. From time to time we get flashes where we do well in some competition with overage players and we celebrate.  That was one of the issues I looked at, we can't keep using overage players. We use over-age players for junior championships, I know that. Why not say it? It's the truth. We always cheat. It's a fact. When you cheat, you deprive the young stars that are supposed to play in these competitions their rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa Kicks: Part two|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2010/01/100114_africa_kicks_two.shtml|publisher=BBC|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Kenya's Under-17 national team were dissolved by the Kenyan Government after some players revealed themselves to be over 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age-cheat team disbanded|url=http://cdnedge.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/2766977.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=15 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Ghana's Deputy Youth and Sports Minister Joe Aggrey said he wished to stop age cheats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Cheated In The Past - Joe Aggrey|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/soccer/artikel.php?ID=31610|publisher=Ghanaweb|accessdate=24 May 2011|date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Nigerian journalist Adokiye Amiesimaka accused the [[Nigeria Football Federation]] (NFF) of being complicit with age-cheats because it gave the nation a competitive advantage. He had what he considered to be proof that some players were overage but the NFF were not interested in taking his complaint seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adokiye: I have documentary evidence|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/article.aspx?id=322582|publisher=Supersport|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the [[Senegal Football Federation]] withdrew Diawandou Diagne, Hervé Diédhiou and Samba Diallo from their under-17 national team after it was found they were overage following an MRI scan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three players removed for age fraud |url=http://www.starafrica.com/en/football/news/article/article/afcon-u17-senegal-three-players-remov-136281.html |publisher=StarAfrica.com |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=29 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002502/http://www.starafrica.com/en/football/news/article/article/afcon-u17-senegal-three-players-remov-136281.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Ivorian football manager and [[SuperSport (South African TV channel)|SuperSport]] television pundit Mamadou Gaye responded to a question asking who he thought would win the 2011 U-17 World Cup with "...any of the four team representing us [Africa] in the world cup U17 can win the trophee (sic), because at that level we like cheating on our age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A with Mamadou gaye|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/football-features/news/110203/QA_with_Mamadou_Gaye|publisher=Supersport|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The [[Asian Football Confederation]] ejected DPR Korea, Tajikistan and Iraq from the [[2008 AFC U-16 Championship]] after qualifying, and Cambodia, Macau, Bangladesh, Tajikistan, Bhutan and Kyrgyzstan were ejected from the qualifying after being found to have fielded over-age players, while Yemen were ejected from the tournament for fielding an overage player.

Sixteen players were banned by AFC in 2000 and eight were banned in the [[2010 AFC U-16 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFC Propose MRI Solution For Age Cheat Issue ?|url=http://football-asia.net/?p=1078|publisher=Football-Asia.net|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AFC introduced age detection methods in its age group competitions in 2000.

===Europe===
Dave Bowler, author of ''Winning Isn't Everything: Biography of Sir Alf Ramsey'', claims that Englishman [[Alf Ramsey]] forged documents so that his date of birth changed from 1920 to 1922. Bowler alleges that Ramsey feared that come the end of the Second World War, he would be considered too old to be offered a professional contract.&lt;ref name="vickery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6142694.stm|title=Tim Vickery column|date=13 November 2006|work=BBC sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Brown of Sherington Veterans claimed to be 37. this was found to be false as be had doctored his birth certificate and was in fact 42. &lt;ref name ="sherington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fulltime-league.thefa.com/DisplayTeam4.do?divisionseason=483254208&amp;id=274542374&amp;seasonTeamID=703135743|title=AFC SHERINGTON|website=fulltime-league.thefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
In the scandal known as the [[Cachirules]], all of Mexico's international teams were banned for two years by [[FIFA]] from international competition in 1988 when the Under-20 national team was proven to consciously field several over aged players.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], many documents containing birth details of Spanish citizens were destroyed. Many [[South American]]s used the situation to their advantage and claimed that their parents were of Spanish origin in the hope that they could start a new life in [[Spain]] or become professional players in Spain.

Brazilian [[Carlos Alberto de Oliveira Júnior]] won the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship]] using fake documents to claim that he was born on 24 January 1983. Because of this, he was banned for 360 days from football.&lt;ref name="vickery"/&gt;

An Ecuadorian footballer, real name Ángel Cheme, played the majority of his professional career as [[Gonzalo Chila]], which was the real name of a player three years his junior whom he had met when they both had trials at a local club, thus enabling him to play in age-restricted matches for three years after he was entitled to do so; he was eventually suspended for two years.

==Introduction of MRI==
The mandatory use of [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) was introduced by FIFA in 2009 for the [[2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup|FIFA Under-17 World Cup]] to help ascertain whether players are over age or not.

MRI is considered to be 99% accurate until the age of 17, after which it becomes harder for medical professionals to calculate a person's age. Professor Jiri Dvorak of FIFA said: "The efficiency stops at 17 and it's just pure coincidence that Fifa made their competition an under-17 event".&lt;ref name=bbc-edwards&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Piers|title=An age of change?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/piersedwards/2011/01/age.html|publisher=BBC Sports|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every bone in the arm and leg has an end plate from which bones grow. When the growth is completed (usually around the age of 17-18), then this end plate disappears on the MRI scans.&lt;ref name="bbc-edwards"/&gt; Dvorak concedes that the scan results "will be unjust to 1% of all examined players".&lt;ref name="bbc-edwards"/&gt;

The researchers had classified the scans into 6 grading system, as follows:

{| class="wikitable" width="600px"
!Grade
!Comment
!Eligibility for U16/U17 tournament
|-
|1
|Completely unfused (physis may be thin)
|rowspan="5"|Player eligible

Of the 429 MRI done by the Asian Football Confederation in 2007, 10 players (or 2.7%) were found to be over the age of 16 years in an otherwise Under-15 tournament. In 2008, one out of the 116 MRI conducted had full fusion.&lt;ref name="afc-qa"/&gt;

Not everybody was pleased by the introduction of MRI, Nigeria had lost 15 players after they were proven to be over-age. Nigeria's Football Federation President Sani Lulu said: "I’ll not use the MRI to disqualify my players."&lt;ref name="gamsports"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cham |first=Yusupha |title=Nigeria FA Chief rejects FIFA’s MRI |url=http://www.gamsports.com/nigeria-fa-chief-rejects-fifa-s-mri.html |publisher=Gamsports.com |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=16 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322164850/http://www.gamsports.com/nigeria-fa-chief-rejects-fifa-s-mri.html |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that FIFA had sprung their decision to use MRI upon the nations.

Lulu wanted to invite the parents of the national under-17 players to verify their sons' ages. Nigerian Sports Minister Sani Ndanusa dismissed the parent verification system and stated the "whole world has gone digital and we're following suit. We're no longer in the analogue era."&lt;ref name="okeleji"&gt;{{cite web|last=Okeleji|first=Oluwashina|title=Nigeria rejects Fifa age scans|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8259652.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lulu stated that NFF did not need to scan players as it wasn't in the competition's rules and regulations. Ndanusa stated: "FIFA wants MRI scans used and we're going to adhere to that, simple."&lt;ref name="okeleji"/&gt;

For the same tournament, the [[Gambia Football Association]] had scanned 53 of its players and "few" failed. It was suggested that "two or three" whom the MRI scan had revealed to be overage were participants at the [[2009 African Under-17 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrocks|first=Jenny|title=Gambia admits to failed age tests|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8271272.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) enforced the use of MRI for the [[2011 African Under-17 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAF ready to showcase success of MRI to rest of world|url=http://www.cafonline.com/competition/can-u-17_2011/news/7518-caf-ready-to-showcase-success-of-mri-to-rest-of-world.html|publisher=CAFonline.com|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, sixteen-year-old United States-born [[Abuchi Obinwa]] failed an MRI test when undergoing assessment to represent the Nigeria U17 team at the [[2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okeleji|first=Oluwashina|title=Obinwa refuses to rule out Nigeria despite MRI scan failure|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24282432|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 September 2013|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, it was reported that 26 Nigeria U17 players had failed MRI tests prior to their match against Niger U17's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAF ready to showcase success of MRI to rest of world|url=http://africanfootball.com/news/635461/EXCLUSIVE-Staggering-26-fail-Eaglets-MRI-test-first-team-wiped-out|publisher=africanfootball.com|accessdate=3 August 2016|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">The '''Akiek''' are an ethnic and linguistic group in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], living in the [[Arusha Region]] in northern Tanzania and in southern Kenya, with an estimated population of 3,700 people.&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;{{cite book |title=Tanzania And Its People |last=Lawrence |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=CreateSpace |location= |isbn=1-4414-8692-5 |page=97 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Akiek language is said to be a [[Endangered language|moribund language]]: only a few elderly speakers are left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D10510%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |title=UNESCO |access-date=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192034/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D10510%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Akiek in Tanzania now speak [[Maasai language|Maasai]], and those in Kenya speak [[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]].&lt;ref name=lawrence /&gt;

The Akiek are a subgroup of the Ogiek or [[Okiek people|Okiek]], who intermarried and lost contact with the core of the Ogiek. The terms Akiek and Okiek are sometimes used interchangeably and confusingly. The correct name of the original people is Ogiek.

'''Robert Clinton Smith''' (born March 30, 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] who served as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] from 1985 to 1990 and the state of [[New Hampshire]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1990 to 2003.

First elected to the House of Representatives as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1984, he was re-elected twice before running for the Senate [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1990|in 1990]], winning the open seat and assuming it early when incumbent [[Gordon J. Humphrey]] resigned. He was re-elected [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1996|in 1996]] and then entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|Republican primary]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]. After failing to gain traction, he withdrew before the primaries began and joined the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Taxpayers' Party]], seeking their nomination instead. He then changed parties again, becoming an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] before dropping out of the presidential race altogether. He then re-joined the Republican Party after the Chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] became open, which he then assumed.

Smith ran for re-election [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2002|in 2002]] but lost the Republican primary to Congressman [[John E. Sununu]], who won the general election. After his defeat he moved to Florida and briefly ran for the Senate from there [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2004|in 2004]] and [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|in 2010]], but dropped out early on in both cases after faring poorly in polls of the Republican primary. He subsequently returned to New Hampshire, where he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2014|2014 Senate election]], but was subsequently defeated in the Republican primary by former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]].

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Margaret (née Eldridge) and Donald Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=010fAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=New Hampshire Notables: Presenting Biographical Sketches of Men and Women who Have Helped Shape the Character of the Granite State|last=Brereton|first=Charles|date=1986|publisher=New Hampshire Historical Society|isbn=9780914339113|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Lafayette College]] in 1965 and did graduate work at [[California State University, Long Beach]].  He served in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] from 1962 to 1965, and was on active duty from 1965 to 1967, including a year in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].  He remained in the Navy Reserve until 1969.  Smith settled in [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire]], where he taught [[history]] and [[English language|English]].  He also served on his local school board and got into the [[real estate]] business as owner and operator of the Yankee Pedlar brokerage.

==Political career==

===U.S. House of Representatives===
[[File:Bob Smith with Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|right|Smith with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
Smith ran for [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1982#New Hampshire|1982 elections]]. With [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|the recession]] and [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s unpopularity aiding Democratic candidates, Smith lost to incumbent [[Norman D'Amours]] by 55% to 45%. D'Amours did not seek re-election in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1984#New Hampshire|1984]], unsuccessfully running for the U.S. Senate instead and Smith was elected in his place, riding Reagan's coattails to beat Democrat [[Dudley Dudley (politician)|Dudley Dudley]] by 59% to 40%. A member of NH's Executive Council, her campaign slogan was "Dudley Dudley, Worth Repeating". Smith responded "Dudley Dudley, Liberal Liberal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/01/08/cq_2094.html|title=Dudley Not Redundant for Shea-Porter|date=8 January 2007|accessdate=24 July 2013|work=The New York Times|first=Rachel|last=Kapochunas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was re-elected [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1986|in 1986]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1988|1988]] by wide margins, first beating Democrat James M. Demers 56% to 44%, then beating Democrat Joseph F. Keefe by 60% to 40%.

===U.S. Senate===
Smith did not run for re-election in 1990, instead running for [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1990|the U.S. Senate seat]] that was being vacated by retiring Republican [[Gordon J. Humphrey]], who was retiring after pledging not to serve more than two terms. His opponent was Democrat [[John A. Durkin]], who had previously served in the Senate from 1975 to 1980. Smith beat him in a landslide, taking 65% of the vote to Durkin's 31%. Humphrey resigned in December after being elected to the [[New Hampshire Senate]] and Smith was appointed to replace him for the final two months of his term.

The [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]], concerning the fate of possible missing or captured Americans in Vietnam, became Smith's major issue in Congress in 1985, partly spurred on by his growing up without knowing how his own father died in [[World War II]]. Smith helped create, and served as vice-chairman of, the 1991–1993 [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]]. Smith ran for re-election [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 1996|in 1996]] and only narrowly defeated Democratic former U.S. Representative [[Richard Swett]], taking 49% of the vote to Swett's 46%. Smith had established himself as the most conservative Senator from the Northeast, and [[Bill Clinton]]'s coattails nearly caused his defeat. On the night of the election many American media networks incorrectly projected that Swett had won.&lt;ref name=Crabtree_1996&gt;{{cite news  |date=December 2, 1996  |authorlink=Susan Crabtree |first=Susan |last=Crabtree  |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n45_v12/ai_18917399/  |accessdate=2012-04-29  |title=1996 Ad  |newspaper=[[Insight on the News]]  |quote=An incorrect exit poll by [[Voter News Service]], or VNS, resulted in an early and ultimately incorrect projection of victory in New Hampshire for Democratic Senate candidate Dick Swett over Republican incumbent Sen. Robert C. Smith. "Every election night, you know, its cardiac-arrest time in some state, in some race - sometimes in several races," [[CBS News|CBS]]' [[Dan Rather]] explained at 9:40 p.m. EST. "This race is as hot and tight as a too-small bathing suit on a too-long car ride back from the beach." But the network "oops" came too late for a number of newspapers that featured Swett's exit-poll victory in their early editions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure in the Senate, Smith was a strident opponent of [[gay rights]]. In 1994, Smith and fellow Republican senator [[Jesse Helms]] of [[North Carolina]] introduced an amendment denying federal funding to schools which promoted [[homosexuality]] in their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-04/news/mn-23437_1_gay-rights|title=Gay Activists Downplay Senate School Bill|last=BOXALL|first=BETTINA|date=1994-08-04|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment passed by a vote of 63-36.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/us/senate-backs-cuts-for-schools-that-endorse-homosexuality.html|title=Senate Backs Cuts for Schools That Endorse Homosexuality|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] nominated openly gay diplomat [[James Hormel]] to be [[United States Ambassador to Luxembourg]], the first time an openly LGBT person had been nominated for an ambassadorship. Smith, with fellow Republican Senators [[James Inhofe]] and [[Tim Hutchinson]], campaigned vigorously against Hormel's nomination.&lt;ref name="GALAAPP"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_boGY8AUTIC | title=Gay and lesbian Americans and political participation: a reference handbook | author=Raymond A. Smith |author2=Donald P. Haider-Markel | year=2002 |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. | publisher=ABC-Clio| isbn=1-57607-256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wetlands-conservation-act.jpg|thumb|left|Smith, second from right, watches as [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signs a bill in 2002.]]
In January 1999, at [[Kingswood Regional High School]] in [[Wolfeboro, New Hampshire|Wolfeboro]], Smith announced that he was a candidate for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|Republican nomination]] for President of the United States (at the time the front-runner was [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/19/us/native-son-says-he-s-running-and-few-are-happy-about-it.html|title=Native Son Says He's Running, And Few Are Happy About It|date=19 February 1999|accessdate=24 July 2013|work=The New York Times|first=Richard L.|last=Berke}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, after failing to gain any ground in the presidential race and before any primaries or caucuses had taken place, Smith announced he was leaving the Republican Party and would seek the nomination of the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Taxpayers' Party]]. One month later, Smith left the Taxpayers Party after claiming that ideologues within the party resisted his candidacy due to his [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and announced as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. He withdrew completely from the race in October and endorsed Bush.
[[File:Bobsmith2000.gif|thumb|right|Logo from Smith's 2000 Presidential campaign]]
In the meantime, Republican Senator [[John Chafee]] of [[Rhode Island]] had died and thus the chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] had re-opened. Smith recanted his repudiation of the Republican party, claiming it had been "a mistake" and claiming that since he had never officially changed his voting registration that he had never left the party. Smith was then elected as Chafee's successor to the chairmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/03/us/prodigal-smith-named-chairman-of-senate-environment-panel.html?ref=johnhchafee|title=Prodigal Smith Named Chairman of Senate Environment Panel|date=3 November 1999|accessdate=24 July 2013|work=The New York Times|first=Lizette|last=Alvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New Hampshire voters were uncomfortable with Smith's passionate way of expressing his views on certain issues. In one case, he used a pair of scissors to stab a plastic doll on the Senate floor to illustrate his anti-abortion stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belluck|first1=Pam|title=Senator Smith Ousted in Republican Primary in New Hampshire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/11/us/senator-smith-ousted-in-republican-primary-in-new-hampshire.html|accessdate=9 October 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=11 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Smith attempted to assist the Miami-based family of [[Elián González]] after Elián was returned to his [[Elian Gonzales#Elián returned to father's custody|father's custody]] by accompanying them to the entrance of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], where Elián was being held; they were turned away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Raid and Reunion: 'What's happening?' |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=2000-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith ran for re-election to a third term [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2002|in 2002]], but was defeated in the Republican primary by Congressman [[John E. Sununu]], winning 45% of the vote to Sununu's 53%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2002/senate.htm Federal Elections 2002 U.S. Senate Results]".

In 2003, Smith founded the American Patriot Foundation, to support "the families of soldiers lost in war."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=robert_c____bob___smith_1|title=Robert C. ("Bob") Smith|website=www.historycommons.org|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014}}, its website describes the group as "a non-partisan, non-profit national foundation with the primary function of educating the American public as to the importance and relevance in today's society of the United States Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', and other founding documents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpatriotfoundation.net/projects.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318181916/http://www.americanpatriotfoundation.net/projects.html |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Smith turned the running of the group over to a friend and it became essentially dormant. The group was re-activated in 2010 during the [[court-martial of Terry Lakin]], a [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], who refused to deploy to [[Afghanistan]] because of his [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|concerns over President Obama's alleged constitutional eligibility to be president]]. The APF supported Lakin and released a video where he explained his intent to disobey what he believed to be "illegal orders". Asked whether he supported the group's work for Lakin, Smith said: "...my personal belief is that when an officer has a constitutional question I don't have a problem with that being answered, that's his legal right to have that answered, but I'm not involved in it."&lt;ref name="salon20100405"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koppelman |first1=Alex |date=2010-04-05 |title=New soldier joins Birthers' anti-Obama crusade |journal=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=2011-01-02 |url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/04/05/birther_soldier_terrence_lakin |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vRpMK2xA?url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/04/05/birther_soldier_terrence_lakin |archivedate=2011-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith ran for the [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2004|U.S. Senate seat from Florida in 2004]] against [[Mel Martinez]], but dropped out after raising little money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/florida/2004-04-15-smith-florida_x.htm |date=April 15, 2004 |work=Associated Press |title=Former New Hampshire senator ends bid for Florida seat }}&lt;/ref&gt; and receiving less than 1% support in Republican polls. Martinez would go on to win the election.

Less than a month before the November 2004 election, Smith wrote an op-ed for the ''[[Concord Monitor]]'' in which he denounced the lack of Republican outrage over [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal|phone jamming]] on Election Day 2002, in which Republican operatives had jammed phone banks used by the Democrats to contact Democratic voters and get them to the polls. Smith implied that this action may have made the difference in Shaheen's narrow loss to Sununu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041019/REPOSITORY/410190316/1037/NEWS04 |title=Phone-jamming was an outrage; Republicans should speak out in anger |work=Concord Monitor |author=Bob Smith |date=October 18, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417064111/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041019%2FREPOSITORY%2F410190316%2F1037%2FNEWS04 |archivedate=April 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2007, Smith endorsed Congressman [[Duncan Hunter]] of California for the Republican presidential nomination. In a letter to New Hampshire Republicans ahead of the first-in-nation New Hampshire Primary, Smith cited Hunter as the best candidate to carry the "Reagan Torch" and the most qualified candidate to protect conservative values.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former New Hampshire Sen.Bob Smith Endorses Duncan Hunter for President|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20071221154639tsop.nb/topstory.html|work=News Blaze|date=December 21, 2007|accessdate=December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Smith began writing editorials on the web page of the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] (formerly called the U.S. Taxpayers' Party), which fueled speculation that Smith intended to seek the party's presidential nomination. The nomination went to [[Chuck Baldwin]], a Baptist pastor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5560">The '''Caja Navarra scandal''' unraveled in 2012 after the absorption of [[Caja Navarra]] (CAN), integrated in the financial conglomerate [[Banca Civica]], by [[CaixaBank]] (3 August 2012). [[Caja Navarra]] lost all its worth, causing its actual demise. Caja Navarra's acronym and brand CAN was kept converted into a foundation. The highly controversial crash of the institution gave way to a demand of responsibilities.

==Approach==
[[File:CAN scandal.jpg|thumb|A closed Caja Navarra branch in [[San Sebastián]]]]
[[File:Miguelsanz.jpg|thumb|Miguel Sanz, ex-president of Navarre]]
[[Caja Navarra]] (CAN) is a merger of two entrenched savings banks renowned for their proximity to the Navarrese people, and considered a sign of identity, as well as a symbol of Navarre's economic solvency and autonomy. In the 1980s and 1990s, 43% of the money of the Navarrese was held in either of both institutions, representing the prime financial institution in [[Navarre]].

After the fusion of the savings banks Caja Provincial de Navarra and Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Pamplona in 2000, the re-founded institution undertook a series of financial operations and expansion of its branches out of Navarre (including a representative office in Washington). As a result, CAN's assets plummeted. 

The savings bank became insolvent in 2012 after years of asset-stripping, including the mysterious disappearance of its artistic collection. The fallout of the scandal affected high- and mid-ranking officials of the regional party UPN ([[Unión del Pueblo Navarro]]) who held political and managerial positions both within the bank and the Government of Navarre.

==Mismanagement==
In 2010 the Board of Founding Partners was established to insulate Caja Navarra from political meddling, but paradoxically it integrated well-known political personalities, all of them high-ranking members of UPN and PSN ([[Socialist Party of Navarre|Spanish Socialists in Navarre]]), such as [[Yolanda Barcina]], [[Miguel Sanz]], Alberto Catalán, Roberto Jimenez, or Enrique Maya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=2013-06-25 |title=El gran golpe (The big sting)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqXTZwdfLwE&amp;feature=share |format= |medium= |language=Spanish |publisher=Ateak Ireki |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2015-01-25|time=35’35|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (mayor of Pamplona since 2011).

Caja Navarra-related societies of dubious operation came into being, such as Sociedad Industrial de CAN and HISCAN Patrimonio  S.L. Their Permanent Board members, all of them high-ranking officials or ex-officials of the government of Navarre (UPN) and PSN, have come to be accused of receiving irregular bonuses. Only in 2011, the 16 permanent board members of HISCAN Patrimonio S.L. received 121,000 euros in bonuses, a period in which CAN incurred heavy financial losses estimated at 203 million euros in just one year, down from 500-plus millions’ worth, during Yolanda Barcina’s one-year tenure in the board.&lt;ref&gt;Ateak Ireki (2013), 37’18&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was revealed that Yolanda Barcina, Miguel Sanz, Álvaro Miranda, and Enrique Maya got paid 2,860 and 1,717 euros each for participating in one-hour meetings (two consecutively) of a ghostly Permanent Board, held 16 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Caja Navarra pagó hasta 2.680 euros a cargos de UPN por reuniones de una hora |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/03/07/actualidad/1362683681_364258.html |newspaper=El País |location=Madrid |access-date=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meetings consisted of a financial briefing to the board members, in which no questions were made and no minutes were recorded. After the revelations, president of the region Yolanda Barcina claimed she would give the money back, while apologizing to the people of Navarre for her behaviour. 

In the period extending from 2004 to 2011, the estimated figure in bonuses to representatives of political, social and cultural agencies affiliated to Caja Navarra (including Ricardo Martín Fluxa, a Spanish ex-Secretary of State for Security, or Javier Iturbe, PSN ex-president and member of the Board of Directors) amounted to 4,3 million euros.

==Parliamentary investigation==
In late 2014, opposition parties of the [[Parliament of Navarre]] promoted the establishment of a parliamentary investigation panel to clear responsibilities. The [[Socialist Party of Navarre|Spanish Socialists' branch in Navarre]], the PSN, voiced its misgivings, while the party at the centre of the controversy, the anti-Basque UPN, showed a frontal refusal, arguing that the case had to be left to Justice, actually Madrid tribunals (a Supreme Court ruling had recently acquitted the president of Navarre Yolanda Barcina of legal misconduct in the scandal of Caja Navarra’s irregular bonuses). 

However, a vote majority in the regional parliament made it possible the creation of that panel. Opposition parties ([[Geroa Bai]], [[EH Bildu]], [[Izquierda-Ezkerra]]) other than the Spanish Conservatives (PP) lashed out at the Socialists for attempting to constrain the range of topics to be addressed in the scrutiny, as well as allowing with their abstention to propel the party UPN, allegedly responsible for Caja Navarra's demise and main opponent to the parliamentary investigation, to chair the investigation panel and hold a critical position.

[[Maulavi]] or [[Mullah]] '''Dadullah''' or '''Dadullah Akhund''' ({{lang-ps|'''ملا دادالله آخوند'''}}) (1966 – May 13, 2007) was the [[Taliban]]'s senior military commander until he was killed by [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] [[special forces]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070513/ap_on_re_as/afghan_commander_killed Yahoo News – Top Taliban Commander Killed In Fighting]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] from the [[Kakar]] tribe of [[Kandahar province]]. According to the [[United Nations]]' list of entities belonging to or associated with the Al-Qaida organization, he had been the Taliban's Minister of Construction.&lt;ref name=UNAlQaidaList2003&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Denied_Persons_Pursuant_to_UN_Security_Council_Resolution|title=Denied Persons Pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution |publisher=[[United States Federal Registry]]|author=[[John R.

== Early life ==
Dadullah Belong Kakar Pashtun tribe ,He lost a leg when fighting with the [[Mujahideen]] against [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4998836.stm The Taleban's most feared commander], [[BBC News]], May 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Taliban's 10-man leadership council before the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US-led invasion in 2001]]. He was reportedly also a close aide to [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]. In the period of 1999–2000, he led the suppression of a revolt by [[Hazaras]] in [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]] province.&lt;ref name=Afgha&gt;[http://www.afgha.com/?q=en/node/520 The Specter of Mullah Dadullah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711021659/http://www.afgha.com/?q=en%2Fnode%2F520 |date=2006-07-11}}, [[afgha.com]] June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, Dadullah's forces committed several massacres of ethnic Hazaras, resulting in the death of some 300 civilians in the [[Yakaolang]] area. On March 10, 2001, he supervised the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], which had been ordered by Mullah Omar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maley|first= William |title=The Afghanistan Wars|year=2002|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0-333-80291-5|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Taliban regime fell in December 2001, Dadullah escaped capture by [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] forces in [[Kunduz province]].&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;

== Fight post 2001 ==
Rumors that Dadullah may be headed to recapture the city with as many as 8,000 Taliban fighters, following the November 2001 [[Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif]], a thousand American ground forces were airlifted into the city.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. Ismail. ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', [http://www.dawn.com/2001/11/10/top2.htm Mazar falls to Alliance: Taliban says they're regrouping], November 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

He allegedly participated (by giving orders via cell phone) in the murder of [[Ricardo Munguía (aid worker)|Ricardo Munguia]] on March 27, 2003. In 2005 he was sentenced ''in absentia'' to life in prison, along with three others, by [[Pakistan]] for the attempted murder of a member of Pakistan's parliament, [[Maulana Muhammad Khan Sherani]] of the [[Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam]] party. Sherani, an opponent of the Taliban, survived an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] attack in his home constituency of [[Balochistan (Afghanistan)|Balochistan]] in November, 2004.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4566206.stm Fugitive Taleban leader sentenced], ''[[BBC News]]'', December 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Western intelligence source" claimed Dadullah may have been operating out of [[Quetta]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,,1784304,00.html Across the border from Britain's troops, Taliban rises again], ''[[The Guardian]]'', May 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including the Pakistani government, claimed he was operating near [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan. In 2006, he claimed to have 12,000 men and control 20 districts in the former Taliban heartland in the southern provinces of Kandahar, [[Helmand Province|Helmand]], [[Zabul Province|Zabul]] and [[Orūzgān Province|Orūzgān]].&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5029190.stm Afghanistan: Taleban's second coming], [[BBC News]], June 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dadullah had reportedly been a central figure in the recruitment of Pakistani nationals to the Taliban&lt;ref name=Afgha /&gt; and was also one of the main Taliban spokesmen, frequently meeting with Al-Jazeera television reporters.&lt;ref name=JPost1&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1148482062130&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Captured Taliban leader appears on Al-Jazeera], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', May 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2006, he was reportedly sent by Mullah Omar to [[South Waziristan]] to convince local Pashtun insurgents to agree to a [[Waziristan Accord|truce with Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph1&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/24/wafg24.xml Omar role in truce reinforces fears that Pakistan 'caved in' to Taliban], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', September 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2006 it was rumored&lt;ref name=Nation1&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061030/parenti_video Taliban Rising], ''[[The Nation]]'', October 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that the Afghan government was considering giving control of its defense ministry over to Dadullah as part of a reconciliation plan with the Taliban to stop the ongoing insurgency.

Mullah Dadullah was linked to massacres of Shi'a, the scorched earth policy of Shi'a villages in 2001 (which he boasted about once on the radio), and the summary execution of men suspected of throwing hand grenades into his compound in 2001 (they were hanged at one of the main roundabouts).  According to an interview he gave to the [[BBC]], he had hundreds of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombers]] waiting for his orders to launch an offensive against [[NATO]] troops.&lt;ref name="BBC-may13"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6650755.stm Afghan Taleban commander killed], [[BBC News]], May 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Dadullah oversaw Taliban negotiations for the hostage-taking of Italian reporter [[Daniele Mastrogiacomo]] and his two Afghan assistants in March 2007. Mastrogiacomo's driver was later beheaded. Mastrogiacomo was reportedly exchanged for five senior Taliban leaders, including Ustad Yasir, Abdul Latif Hakimi, Mansoor Ahmad, a brother of Dadullah, and two commanders identified as Hamdullah and Abdul Ghaffar. The Taliban threatened to kill the interpreter Ajmal Naqshbandi, one of the two Afghan assistants, on March 29, 2007, unless the [[Kabul]] government freed two Taliban prisoners.&lt;ref name=Reuters1&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL293332420070329 Taliban leader threatens to kill Afghan hostage], ''[[Reuters]], March 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ajmal was later beheaded after the Afghan government refused to free anymore Taliban prisoners. According to [[Asadullah Khalid]], the governor of [[Kandahar Province]], "Mullah Dadullah was the backbone of the Taliban. He was a brutal and cruel commander who killed and beheaded Afghan civilians."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/13/wafgh113.xml Top Taliban commander killed in Afghanistan], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', May 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Afghan officials reported on May 13, 2007, that Mullah Dadullah was killed the previous evening in a raid by U.S, Afghan and NATO forces, known to have included the [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS), a British special forces unit, in Helmand Province, after he left his "sanctuary" for a meeting with fellow commanders, in southern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/taliban+commander+mullah+dadullah+killed/510372 Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah killed], ''[[Channel 4]]'', May 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports indicate Dadullah was killed in the Gershk district, while others claim he was killed near the Sangin and Nari Saraj district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/05/mullah_dadullah_tali.php|title=Mullah Dadullah, Taliban top commander, killed in Helmand|publisher=Long War Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asadullah Khalid]], the governor of Kandahar province, put the body of Dadullah on display at his official residence. The body appeared to have three bullet wounds, two in the torso and one in the back of the head. The Taliban named [[Mullah Bakht]], Dadullah's younger brother, as his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/05/14/taliban-replacement.html Taliban Names Replacement After Death of Top Commander], [[CBC News]], May 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2007, the Taliban said that Dadullah's body had been returned to them, in exchange for four Afghan health ministry workers who had been held hostage, and had been buried by his family in Kandahar. The Taliban said that a fifth hostage had been beheaded because Dadullah's body was not returned quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6729343.stm "Taleban handed commander's body"], BBC News, June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/06/afghan_trade_fo.html The Blotter: Afghan Trade: Four Hostages for Body of Dead Taliban&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Those meeting the standards of excellence are nominated and voted for within the ASG after a vacancy occurs.&lt;ref name=FASG1/&gt; 

==Criteria for nomination==
Potential FASG members are reviewed for the following criteria.&lt;ref name=FASG1/&gt; 

*The quality of published work. 
*Compiled genealogies. 
*Demonstration to effectively "use primary source material; to evaluate and analyze data; to properly document evidence; and to reach sound, logical conclusions presented in a clear and proper manner."

'''The Harmonie Club''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] in [[New York City]].  Founded in 1852, the club is the second oldest social club in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2007/05/08/men-clubs-private-forbeslife-cx_hp_07networks_0509clubs.html Elite Membership Clubs Get A Makeover]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located at 4 East 60th Street, in a building designed by [[Stanford White]].

==History==
Originally named the Gesellschaft Harmonie, the club was founded on October 16, 1852 by N. Gutman, M. Werner, H. Beer, Herman Cohn, Charles Werner, and Sigmund Werner.  Although prominent [[German Jews]], the group was reportedly denied admission to the [[Union Club of the City of New York|Union Club]], which had a tacit policy of [[discrimination]].  The club's original charter provided that it was created to provide "mutually beneficial entertainment, occasional singing entertainments, lectures, etc" for recent German immigrants.  The first meeting of the club was held November 8, 1852 in a rented room on Broome Street with thirty-nine members in attendance. Between 1852 and 1867, the burgeoning club was regularly moved as the membership outgrew each rented space.  After this nomadic period the club purchased land at 45 West Forty-Second Street to erect a permanent location and raised enough funds to have architect [[Henry Fernbach]] design the building.  Later, this building was refurbished and had an annex added, both of which were designed by [[Henry Beaumont Herts|Herts and Tallant]], architects of the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] and Coram Library at [[Bates College]].

The growth of the club was supported through dues and the creation of a nomination process to accept new members. To govern the organization, the club held monthly meetings run by elected officers. During the first ten years of existence the group held balls, lectures, and other social events throughout New York City. The tenth anniversary was celebrated on October 18, 1863 with a banquet and ball attended by over one hundred and fifty members. Two years later the club was incorporated as, "The Harmonie Social Club of the City of New York", with two re-incorporations in 1867 and 1894.  The first re-incorporation altered the provisions to allow the club to own property and the building on Forty-Second Street.  The latter reincorporation was to change the name to "The Harmonie Club."   Members, however, continued to use the former name, Gesellschaft Harmonie, until 1893 when the club adopted English as its official language in place of German.  The club was so successful, that by 1884 the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that "many of New-York's leading German citizens are connected" with it.

The large building erected on West Forty-Second allowed the Harmonie Club to host in-house events, and for the next forty years the club regularly scheduled events such as dances, lectures, concerts, theatrical performances, billiards, cards, and bowling.  In 1891, the Admission Committee was created, removing the task of approving and voting on new members from the general monthly meetings.  The turn of the century brought several changes to the club.  These changes included the first events for non-married members, a declining interest in large social gatherings such as dances, and increasing property taxes along Forty-Second Street.  [[File:Harmonie Club 1867.JPG|thumb|right|42nd Street Location]]

In response to these pressures, a decision was made to relocate to a more suitable building.  The club solicited donations from its members to build a new clubhouse on property acquired on the [[Upper East Side]].  In December 1905, the club moved into new premises at Four East 60th Street, in a building designed by renowned [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] architect, [[Stanford White]] of [[McKim, Meade &amp; White]].  Lighting for the building was provided by [[Edward F. Caldwell &amp; Co.]]  Later alterations, inside and out, were designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris, III|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Norval &amp; Willensky, Elliot. ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' (Fourth Edition). New York:Three Rivers Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8129-3107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A banquet to celebrate the opening was attended by over four hundred members.

In 1914, to meet the changing interests of its members, the Harmonie Club purchased the North Shore Country Club on Long Island.  According to an April 1914 President's Report: "The trend of time is toward the country club and healthy outdoor activity.  With the increasing tendency to spread the weekends in suburban surrounding, with the increased use of the automobile, and with the increased desire for outdoor exercise, especially on the part of the younger generation." After several years of renovation the country club opened for Harmonie Club members only. This arrangement was designed to both serve and increase interest in the parent organization. Over the years, the North Shore Country Club has hosted several tournaments.  Although no longer affiliated with the club, [http://nsccli.com North Shore] still operates today as a private course.

The growth of the Harmonie Club was slowed by the outbreak of World War I and related anti-German sentiment, as well as, the wartime service of current and potential members. The club supported the United States' campaign through hosting events for enlisted men and their families. In addition, fifty of the club's members served in the war effort.  Following the war, the club prospered reaching a record high of eight hundred and fifty members in 1929. This number was cut in half by 1934 with the onset of the [[Great Depression]].  The Board of Governors began a large scale renovation of the building on Sixtieth Street under the expertise of architect Benjamin Morris in the late 1930s.  The new facilities along with a series of changes in the club's bylaws were designed to modernize the organization and attracted a large number of new and young members.

With its origins as a Jewish club, for several years it served as the meeting location for the [[American Jewish Committee]], especially in the tumultuous 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00815FF3E5C1B7A93C7A9178ED85F4C8385F9 | title = Jewish Ranks Split on U.S. Plebiscite — American Committee to Take Up Congress Plan Next Week | publisher = New York Times | date = 1938-05-05 | accessdate = 2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee took a leading role in resettling refugees from the Nazis and in ensuring their contribution to the Allied war effort.  Albert Einstein and other prominent Anti-Nazi figures of the day sponsored events at the club to raise awareness of the Nazis' persecution of the Jews.  The growth of the Club was halted in 1941 with the American entry into World War II.  The club continued to operate throughout the war and resumed its philanthropic programs from World War I, such as hosting functions for enlisted men.  Following the war, the Club's membership returned to pre-Depression numbers.

===Recent events===
Over the years its political role in the community appeared to have moderated, and it became more of a social center, as well as extending its membership to include non-German Jews and others.  In 1987, it was the location of the world's 'most charitable' bridge game, which raised $62,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D61E38F930A15756C0A961948260 | title = Bridge; A Record $62,000 Is Raised At a Harmonie Club Event | publisher = New York Times | first = Alan | last = Truscott | date = 1987-05-23 | accessdate = 2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically known as a Jewish club, the club has indicated a willingness to broaden its membership.  Nonetheless, a perceived lack of diversity caused member [[Michael Bloomberg]] to resign in 2001, in anticipation of his initial mayoral run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D91438F932A05756C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print | title = Where the Diner Is the Star  | first = Elaine | last = Louie | publisher = New York Times | date = 1995-05-31 | accessdate = 2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a New York cultural institution, the Harmonie Club has been host to numerous political and cultural luminaries in recent years, including a visit and address from former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2007, presentations or panel discussions with Senators [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Chuck Schumer]], Representative [[Charles Rangel]], every New York mayor and governor since Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], and Governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]].

'''Hazen Stuart Pingree''' (August 30, 1840 – June 18, 1901) was a four-term [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] mayor of Detroit (1889–1897) and the [[List of Governors of Michigan|24th Governor]] of the U.S. State of [[Michigan]] (1897–1901). A [[Yankee]] who migrated from New England, he was a successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] businessman turned politician.

As a businessman turned politician, Pingree was elected mayor in 1889 after a colorful campaign in which Pingree revealed his tolerance by making a circuit of saloons.  Pingree added to the old stock Yankee Republican base by making large inroads into the  German  and Canadian elements. He was reelected in 1891, 1893 and 1895.  Warning repeatedly against the dangers of monopolistic corporations, he launched nationally visible crusades against Detroit's streetcar, gas, electric, and telephone companies.  He successfully forced rate reductions that won him widespread popularity. He won public approval for a citizen-owned electric light plant, and became a national spokesman for municipal ownership and public regulation of utilities and street railways.  When the nationwide Panic of 1893 caused a severe depression, Pingree gained support by opening empty lots to garden farming launching Pingree's "Potato Patch Plan," initially financed by Pingree, who sold his prize horse to pay for the farming tools and seeds. Pingree was a Republican,  whose policies competed for support of the Populist Party voters and  labor union members.  He supported the gold standard in 1896, and worked to carry Michigan for [[William McKinley]] over silverite [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the intensely competitive 1896 U.S. presidential election.  Pingree was on the ballot, too, and was elected governor of Michigan. As governor, he succeeded in forcing passage of the nation's first major statewide reappraisal of railroad and corporate property, with intent on implementing taxes. This led to a rational basis for railroad regulation and other trust busting ideas launched by the  Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G.  Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S.  Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  A survey of scholars in 1999 ranked Pingree as the fourth best mayor in all of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melvin G. Holli|title=The American Mayor: The Best &amp; the Worst Big-City Leaders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7L101sa1qWEC&amp;pg=PA35|year=1999|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life in Maine and Massachusetts==
Pingree was born in [[Denmark, Maine]], to Jasper Pingree and Adeline (Bryant) Pingree and attended the common schools in [[Maine]].&lt;ref name = "cyclo"&gt;{{citation | title = CYCLOPEDIA OF MICHIGAN: HISTORICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL, COMPRISING A SYNOPSIS OF GENERAL HISTORY OF THE STATE, ABD BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF MEN | author== Western Publishing and Engraving Co. | publisher=Western Publishing and Engraving Co. | year =  1900 | pages = 144–146 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0V85bp_2F4MC&amp;pg=144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fourteen, he moved to [[Saco, Maine]], where he worked at a cotton factory. Two years later, he moved to [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]], and worked several years as a cutter in a shoe factory.&lt;ref name = "cyclo"/&gt;

==Civil War==
In 1862, Pingree enlisted in the [[Union Army]] to serve in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery Regiment (Company F). He fought on the front line during [[John Pope (military officer)|General Pope’s]] [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] and the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]].  The regiment he fought with was then ordered to defend Washington, D.C. until May 15, 1864, and then was sent to the front again.  He fought with the Second Brigade of Tyler’s Division, [[II Corps (ACW)|Second Corps]], which participated in battles at Fredericksburg Road (May 18), Harris Farm (May 19), and [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]] (May 19–21).&lt;ref name = "cyclo"/&gt;

His regiment was then assigned to the Second Corps, Third Division, in the [[Army of the Potomac]] and fought at North Anna (May 24–25) where he and some other men were captured by a detachment of [[John S. Mosby]]’s command.  Pingree was confined in Confederate prisons at [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]] and [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], and at [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. He was then taken to [[Andersonville prison]] and, while [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] was on his march to the sea, he was taken to [[Millen, Georgia]], where he later escaped by pretending to be someone else during a roll call for a prisoner exchange in November 1864. Pingree rejoined his regiment, fought in many more battles, and was present at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] when [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered on April 9, 1865.  A few months later, on August 15, his regiment was mustered out.&lt;ref name = "cyclo"/&gt;

==Business in Michigan==
Pingree was a cobbler by trade and, following the war, moved to Detroit and briefly worked for H. P. Baldwin's shoe company.&lt;ref name = "cyclo"/&gt;  In 1866, Pingree and his accountant, Charles H. Smith, purchased Baldwin's shoe-making machinery  and formed the Pingree and Smith company.
In 1883, Smith retired from the firm and J. B. Howarth and Pingree's son Joe joined the partnership.&lt;ref name = "cyclo"/&gt;  By 1886, it was a $1 million company with 700 employees turning out a half-million shoes and boots a year. It was the second biggest shoe manufacturer in the U.S. In March 1887, a fire destroyed the entire plant, yet they were able to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Loomis,  "Hazen Pingree: Quite possibly Detroit's finest mayor" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "catlin"&gt;{{cite book |first=George B. |last=Catlin |title=The story of Detroit |origyear=1900 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/apk1036.0001.001|year=2005 |pages=585–630 |chapter=Chapters CI through CVII|chapterurl = http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;q1=Pingree;rgn=full%20text;idno=APK1036.0001.001;didno=APK1036.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, Pingree married Frances A. Gilbert of [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]]. They had three children – Joe, Hazel, and Gertrude, who died in 1894 of tuberculosis at age 19.&lt;ref name="loch"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Shoemaker Who Looked Like a King | author = Don Lochbiler | newspaper = The Detroit News | date = June 11, 1998 | url = http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=175 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120709072637/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=175 | archivedate = July 9, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayor of Detroit==
Pingree had never been active in politics. As a citizen reformer he was elected [[mayor of Detroit]] in 1889 on a platform of exposing and ending corruption in city paving contracts, sewer contracts, and the school board. He soon turned to fighting privately owned utility monopolies.  He challenged the electric and gas monopolies through municipally owned competitors.&lt;ref name = "catlin"/&gt; His largest struggle, however, was with [[Tom L. Johnson]], president of the [[Detroit City Railway]], over lowering streetcar fares to three cents. Pingree again attempted to create a competing municipally owned company, but was barred from creating a railway by the [[Michigan Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Holli, 1970"&gt;Holli, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; When the company sought a thirty-year contract with the city, Pingree opposed it, leading a major shareholder, [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], to express vehement disapproval.&lt;ref name="Detroit News online"&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/picture-gallery/news/local/michigan-history/2014/12/17/hazen-pingree-detroits-superstar-mayor-of-the-1890s/20441163/ ''Detroit News'' online] (retrieved 24 January 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the severe nationwide [[depression of 1893]], Pingree expanded the public welfare programs, initiated public works for the unemployed, built new schools, parks, and public baths.  He gained national recognition through his "potato patch plan", which allowed poor people to use {{convert|430|acre|ha|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Detroit News online"/&gt; of vacant city land for growing food.  He was also an advocate of economist [[Henry George]]'s [[Georgism|single tax]].&lt;ref name="Holli, 1970"/&gt;

==Governor of Michigan==
In 1896 Pingree was nominated as the GOP candidate for [[Governor of Michigan]].  He campaigned on a platform of pluralism, inviting the Germans and other ethnics to join a grand coalition that would bring prosperity to everyone, unlike the false prosperity promised by the silverites. He carried the state both for himself and Republican presidential candidate [[William McKinley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Jensen|author-link=Richard J. Jensen|title=The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888-1896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpCgCNZwpvoC&amp;pg=PA292|year=1971|publisher=U of Chicago Press|pages=292, 295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking office on January 1, 1897, he intended to also fill the last year of his term as mayor of Detroit, which would have lasted until elections in November 1897. However, his right to hold the two offices simultaneously was contested, and after the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] ruled against him, Pingree resigned as mayor.&lt;ref name = "catlin"/&gt;

During his four years in office, Pingree promoted the regulation of railroad rates, equal taxation, and municipal ownership of public utilities. He also supported the direct election of U.S. senators; an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]]; an income tax; primary elections; the power of "referendum," the abolition of child labor, and compulsory arbitration of labor disputes. Opposition from Democrats and business-oriented Republicans blocked most of his proposals.  Pingree expressed the Progressive fear of corporate power, saying, "I do not condemn corporations and rich men," he said, "but I would keep them within their proper spheres. It is not safe to entrust the government of the country to the influence of Wall Street."&lt;ref&gt;Russel B. Nye, ''Midwestern Progressive Politics: A Historical Study of Its Origins and Development, 1870-1950'' (1951) p 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Pingree did not run for reelection in 1900. In 1901, Pingree arrived in London, England, while returning from an African safari with his son.  He was stricken with [[peritonitis]] and was unable to return to the U.S. [[King Edward VII]], Pingree’s famous look alike, even sent his own physicians to London's Grand Hotel to assist in Pingree's recovery.&lt;ref name = "loch"/&gt;

Pingree was interred at the Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan, and later reinterred at the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in Detroit.&lt;ref name = "pg"&gt;{{cite web | title = Index to Politicians: Pincus to Pingry  |publisher=Political Graveyard | url = http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/pindall-pingree.html#RHI18TDFP |accessdate = October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a statue of Pingree standing in the [[Grand Circus Park (Detroit)|Grand Circus Park]] in Detroit, commemorating him as "The Idol of the People."&lt;ref name="zach"&gt;{{cite news | title = The monuments of Detroit | author = Pat Zacharias | newspaper = The Detroit News | date = September 5, 1999 | url = http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=165 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120708060651/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=165 | archivedate = July 8, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was made by Austrian sculptor [[Rudolph Schwarz]].

There is also a bronze bust of him on the thirteenth floor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Building in Detroit.&lt;ref name="Detroit News online"/&gt;

[[Honduras]] is principally a source and transit country for women, girls, and boys trafficked for the purpose of commercial [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]]. Honduran children are typically trafficked from rural areas to urban and tourist centers such as [[San Pedro Sula]], the North [[Caribbean]] coast, and the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]]. Honduran women and children are trafficked to [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] for sexual exploitation. Most foreign victims of commercial sexual exploitation in Honduras are from neighboring countries; some are economic migrants en route to the United States who are victimized by traffickers. Internal [[child labor]] and forced child labor for violent criminal gangs are serious concerns.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Honduras". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105389.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 4, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Honduras does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, Honduras made strong efforts to increase [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] efforts against trafficking offenders and to increase collaboration with [[non-governmental organization]] (NGOs), but government services for trafficking victims, particularly adults, remained inadequate.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Honduran government took significant steps to investigate and punish human trafficking crimes during the reporting year. Honduras prohibits trafficking for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation through Article 149 of its penal code and an anti-trafficking statute enacted in February 2006, but does not prohibit trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation. Honduran laws against sex trafficking prescribe penalties of up to 13 years’ imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes such as [[rape]]. Last year, the government significantly increased efforts to investigate trafficking crimes by opening 74 investigations, initiating 13 [[prosecution]]s, and obtaining eight [[conviction]]s, with sentences ranging from 5 to 27 years’ imprisonment. This compares with 24 trafficking-related investigations, 17 prosecutions, eight convictions, and four significant prison terms obtained in 2006. The government also dedicated more prosecutors and police personnel to combat human trafficking activity. Of particular note was a joint effort by the police, NGO [[Casa Alianza]], and the [[Tegucigalpa]] mayor’s office to utilize proactive strategies such as raids and stakeouts to catch human traffickers and remove victims from trafficking situations. However, anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts outside the capital and San Pedro Sula were few. The government expanded anti-trafficking training for law enforcement officials in 2007, training thousands of personnel with the assistance of IOM. Law enforcement authorities regularly work with neighboring countries and the United States on anti-trafficking efforts, as well as investigations of child sex tourism. However, defendants over the age of 60 are subject to house arrest in Honduras while awaiting trial; many of these accused offenders, including American citizens, flee or bribe their way out of the country and avoid prosecution. Some acts of complicity with human trafficking have been reported among lower-level immigration officials and in other sectors. However, no investigations or prosecutions of such corrupt activity have been opened by the government.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Honduran government made limited progress in its efforts to assist trafficking victims during the reporting year. The government operated no dedicated shelters or services for trafficking victims, although it referred child trafficking victims to NGOs, which could only serve a small percentage of those in need. Honduran NGOs shouldered a heavy burden to provide victim care, and received no direct funding from the government. While the government increased training on referring trafficking victims for care, NGOs report that referrals in practice are unorganized and uneven. Moreover, few resources, public or private, are available for adult trafficking victims. During the reporting period, the government worked closely with IOM to repatriate more than a dozen young Hondurans who had been trafficked to neighboring countries for sexual exploitation, and Honduran consular officials are trained to identify trafficking victims. Victims are encouraged to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, and the government collaborated with NGOs to identify victim witnesses. There were no reports of victims being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a result of their being trafficked. Honduras does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or [[Revenge|retribution]]. There is no formal system for proactively identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations such as [[sex workers]] or criminal detainees. In collaboration with an NGO, law enforcement officials in Tegucigalpa undertook a number of victim rescue efforts; fifteen minors were rescued in Tegucigalpa in seven separate cases in 2007.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made solid progress in prevention activities during the reporting period. The government’s inter-institutional committee against human trafficking hosted more than 50 training sessions for government officials, civil society members, students, and [[journalist]]s, reaching more than 3,000 people. The government worked closely with NGOs and international organizations on additional [[TV]] and [[radio]] awareness-raising campaigns. In February 2008, the National Chamber of [[Tourism]] of Honduras and UNICEF launched a Code of Conduct campaign to encourage its tourism industry to prevent child sex tourism. No other government efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts were reported, although public awareness of the dangers of human trafficking appeared to be growing.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7781">[[File:Cover of Api Pemuda Indonesia, French edition.jpg|thumb|Cover of a French edition of ''Api Pemuda Indonesia'']]Following the military take-over in Indonesia and the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|massacres of 1965–66]], the Albanian capital [[Tirana]] became one of the main hubs for exiled members and sympathizers of the pro-Chinese wing of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI). According to prof. Justus van der Kroef there were about forty Indonesian communists staying in Tirana in the early 1970s, around half of them organized in the Persatuan Peladjar Indonesia ('Indonesian Students Association').&lt;ref name="Alexander1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Jackson Alexander|title=International Maoism in the developing world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIoFAQAAIAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-96149-7|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace|title=Yearbook on international communist affairs|series=[[Yearbook on International Communist Affairs]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc8KAAAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tirana-based group often acted as spokespersons of the party.&lt;ref name="Alexander1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace1973"/&gt;

==Establishment==
According to Ruth McVey the establishment of Tirana as a hub for PKI exiles began with the 5th congress of the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] (PPSh) in November 1966.&lt;ref name="TsouHo1968"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tang Tsou|authorlink1=Tsou Tang|author2=Ping-ti Ho|title=China in Crisis, Volume 2: China's Policies in Asia and America's Alternatives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DGYN9a6aGMC&amp;pg=PP103|year=1968|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-81519-0|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mozingo2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mozingo|title=Chinese Policy Toward Indonesia, 1949–1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oboWNz-7biUC&amp;pg=PA255|year=2007|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-979-3780-54-2|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PKI delegation at the congress was led by Jusuf Adjitorop, a candidate member of the PKI [[politburo]] before the coup.&lt;ref name="TsouHo1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mozingo2007"/&gt; Now he headed the PKI Delegation in Beijing, having survived the purge of PKI by being in China for medical treatment prior to the coup.&lt;ref name="Alexander1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace1973"/&gt; In his address to the Albanian party congress, Adjitorop called for the reconstruction of PKI under the banner of [[Maoism|Marxism–Leninism and Mao Tse-Tung Thought]], calling for protracted armed struggle of the peasantry to overthrow the rule of [[Suharto]] and [[Nasution]].&lt;ref name="Mozingo2007"/&gt; Following the Albanian party congress Tirana became the main centre the pro-Chinese wing of PKI in exile, rather than [[Beijing]]. The dominant view is that neither the Chinese government nor the PKI wished that the party would be perceived as too closely linked to China. Another key factor was that Tirana was geographically close to other hubs of exiled Indonesian student activists across Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="TsouHo1968"/&gt; Notably the PKI had opted not to condemn the Albanian party at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|1961 Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mozingo|title=Chinese Policy Toward Indonesia, 1949–1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oboWNz-7biUC&amp;pg=PA189|year=2007|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-979-3780-54-2|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing activities==
An English-language bimonthly journal, ''Indonesian Tribune'', was issued from Tirana.&lt;ref name="TsouHo1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroef1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justus Maria Van der Kroef|title=The Indonesian Maoists: doctrines and perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5wbAQAAMAAJ|date=June 1977|publisher=School of Law, University of Maryland|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing house of ''Indonesian Tribune'' was called Indonesia Progresif ('Indonesian Progressive').&lt;ref name="TsouHo1968"/&gt; The Persatuan Peladjar Indonesia ('Indonesian Students Association') in Albania published the journal ''Api Pemuda Indonesia'' ('Flame of Indonesian Youth').&lt;ref name="Service1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Broadcasting Corporation.

''Indonesian Tribune'' and ''Api Pemuda Indonesia'' were the two main organs of the pro-Chinese wing of PKI.&lt;ref name="Kroef1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DrachkovitchGann1980"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milorad M.

In the midst of the [[Sino-Albanian split]] some Indonesian communists left Albania. As a result, the publishing activity of the Indonesian group in Tirana was decreased.&lt;ref name="DrachkovitchGann1980"/&gt; The [[International Institute of Social History]] hold a number of issues of ''Api Pemuda Indonesia'', spanning from 1968 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Social History.

''[http://search.socialhistory.org/Record/1335644 Indonesian tribune. News and views of Indonesian current affairs. Publ. monthly by Indonesia progresif.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joan Kelly''' (March 29, 1928 &amp;ndash; August 15, 1982) was a prominent American historian who wrote on the [[Italian Renaissance]], specifically on [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Among her best known works is the essay "Did Women Have a Renaissance?" which was published in 1977. The article challenged the contemporary historiography of the [[Renaissance]], arguing that women's power and agency declined during the [[early modern period]].

==Personal life==

Kelly was born in Brooklyn in 1928 to George V. and Ruth (Jacobsen) Kelly. She received a BA from [[St. John's University (New York City)|St John’s University]] in 1953 and then went on to earn a PhD in history from [[Columbia University]] in 1963, where she was supervised by Garret Mattingley. Kelly was a member of the history faculty of the [[City College of New York]] of the [[City University of New York]] from 1956 until her death from cancer in 1982.

Kelly was married to Eugene Gadol until 1972 and to Martin Fleischer from 1979 until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Joan|title=JOAN KELLY, FEMINIST HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR AT CITY COLLEGE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/18/nyregion/joan-kelly-feminist-historian-and-professor-at-city-college.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=18 Aug 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While still a graduate student at Columbia, Kelly was employed as a lecturer for City College from 1956 onwards. Once she received her doctorate in 1963, she was promoted to assistant professor, and again promoted to associate professor in 1972. Kelly was appointed a full professor in 1972.

Her growing political involvement in the 1960s, particularly with Marxist theory and the civil rights movement, led to Kelly becoming more interested in women's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00662|title=Kelly, Joan, 1928-1982. Papers, 1973-1984: A Finding Aid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Gerda Lerner]], Kelly founded the first master's program in women's history at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. She was also the chair of the [[American Historical Association]]'s Committee on Women Historians, 1975-77. She received a number of awards, including a Woodrow Wilson fellowship, 1953–54 and a junior fellowship from the [[National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities]], 1967-68.

==Did Women Have a Renaissance?==

In the highly influential essay “[https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/ILL123/%CE%92%CE%84%20%CE%9A%CF%8D%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82%20%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CF%89%CE%BD%3A%20%CE%96%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1%20%CE%99%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82%20%CE%99%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9%20%CE%99%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82/2%20%CE%9C%CE%B1%CE%90%CE%BF%CF%85%202017%3A%20%CE%94%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BE%CE%B7%20%CE%BA.%20%CE%9C.%20%CE%9B%CE%B5%CE%BF%CE%BD%CF%84%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B7/Kelly%20Did%20Women%20Have%20a%20Renaissanace.pdf Did Women Have a Renaissance?] (1977),” Kelly explored women's roles in Renaissance society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Joan|title=Women, History &amp; Theory The Essays of Joan Kelly|year=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-43027-8|pages=19–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; She challenged traditional periodization, saying that women's historical experience was different to that of men's, and that while men's options may have expanded during the Renaissance period that the opposite was true for women. Drawing on contemporary literature, Kelly argued that concepts of courtly love led to an increased emphasis on women's passivity and virginity.

Kelly's argument broke with traditional historiography and encouraged other historians of women and gender to reassess historical periodization through the lens of women's experiences.

==Tribute==
The Joan Kelly Memorial Prize, founded in 1984, is awarded annually by the [[American Historical Association]] "for the book in women’s history and/or feminist theory that best reflects the high intellectual and scholarly ideals exemplified by the life and work of Joan Kelly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/awards-and-grants/awards-and-prizes/joan-kelly-memorial-prize|title=Joan Kelly Memorial Prize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaeo-Spanish''' or '''Judeo-Spanish''' ({{lang|lad-Latn|judeoespañol}}, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew script]]: {{lang|lad-Hebr|גֿודֿיאו-איספאנייול}}, [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: {{lang|lad-Cyrl|Ђудео-Еспањол}}&lt;ref name="Lekute Tefilot"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Hajim Mordehaj|title=ЛЕКУТЕ ТЕФИЛОТ (ОРАСJОНИС ЕСКУЖИДАС)|date=1927|location=Belgrade|language=Judaeo-Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;), commonly referred to as '''Ladino''', is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] derived from [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]]. Originally spoken in Spain and then after the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Expulsion]] spreading through the former territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (the [[Balkans]], [[Turkey]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]]) as well as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Morocco]], and the [[United Kingdom]], it is today spoken mainly by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Minority group|minorities]] in more than 30 countries, with most of the speakers residing in [[Israel]]. Although it has no official status in any country, it has been acknowledged as a [[minority language]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Israel, France and Turkey. It is also formally recognised by the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]].&lt;ref name=rae&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/01/spain-honours-ladino-language-of-jewish-exiles |title=Spain honours Ladino language of Jewish exiles |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 August 2017  |author=Sam Jones |accessdate= 1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core [[vocabulary]] of Judaeo-Spanish is [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] and it has numerous elements from all the old [[Romance languages]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]: [[Navarro-Aragonese|Old Aragonese]], [[Astur-Leonese languages|Astur-Leonese]], [[Old Catalan language|Old Catalan]], [[Galician-Portuguese]] and [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = El desarollo histórico del judeoespañol|last = Minervini|first = Laura|date = 2006|journal = Revista Internacional de Lingüística Iberoamericana|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been further enriched by [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] vocabulary, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], especially in the domains of [[religion]], [[law]] and [[spirituality]] and most of the vocabulary for [[Renaissance|new and modern]] concepts has been adopted through [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Furthermore, the language is influenced to a lesser degree by other local languages of the Balkans, such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].

Historically, the [[Rashi script]] and its cursive form [[Solitreo]] have been the main orthographies for writing Judaeo-Spanish. However today, it is mainly written with the Latin alphabet, though some other [[alphabet]]s such as Hebrew and Cyrillic are still in use. Judaeo-Spanish is known by many different names, mostly: ''Español/Espanyol'', ''Judió/Djudyo'' (or ''Jidió/Djidyo''), ''Judesmo/Djudezmo'', ''Sefaradhí/Sefaradi'' and ''Ḥaketía/Haketia''. In Turkey and formerly in the Ottoman Empire, it has been traditionally called ''Yahudice'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], meaning the Jewish language. In Israel, Hebrew speakers usually call the language ''(E)spanyolit'' or ''Ladino''.

Judaeo-Spanish, once the [[Lingua franca|trade language]] of the [[Adriatic Sea]], the Balkans and the Middle-East and renowned for its rich literature especially in [[Salonika]], today is under serious threat of [[language death|extinction]]. Most [[First language|native speakers]] are elderly, and the language is not transmitted to their children or grandchildren for various reasons. In some [[expatriate]] communities in [[Latin America]] and elsewhere, there is a threat of [[dialect levelling]] resulting in extinction by assimilation into modern Spanish. It is experiencing, however, a minor revival among Sephardic communities, especially in [[Sephardic music|music]].

==Name==
In recent decades in Israel, the United States and Spain, the language has come to be referred to as ''Ladino'' ({{script|Hebrew script:|לאדינו}}), literally meaning "Latin". However, some of its speakers consider that term to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Thessaloniki Museum"&gt;[http://www.jmth.gr/web/thejews.htm Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721081700/http://www.jmth.gr/web/thejews.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}. Jmth.gr. Retrieved on 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The language is also called ''judeo-espagnol'',{{efn|group=note|Speakers use different orthographical conventions depending on their social, educational, national and personal backgrounds, and there is no uniformity in spelling although some established conventions exist. The [[exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Judeo-Espanyol'' is also spelled as ''Cudeo-Espanyol'', ''Djudeo-Espanyol'', ''Djudeo-Espagnol'', ''Judeoespañol'', ''Judeo-Espaniol'', ''Džudeo-Espanjol'', ''Dzhudeo-Espanyol'', ''Tzoudeo-Espaniol'', ''Dschudeo-Espanjol'', ''Dżudeo-Espańol'', ''Giudeo-Espagnol'', ''Giudeo-Espaneol'', ''Xhudeo-Espanjol'', ''Dzsudeo-Eszpanyol'', ''Ġudeo-Espanjol'', ''Ǧudéo-Españól'', ''Judeo-Espanýol'', ''Ĵudeo-Español'' and ''Jūdeo-Esupanyōru''.

Spoken Ladino may also be referred to as Djudesmo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ladino-today/|title=Ladino Today {{!}} My Jewish Learning|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect of the [[Oran (department)|Oran area of Algeria]] was called ''[[Tetuani]]'', after the Moroccan city of [[Tétouan]] since many Orani Jews came from there. In Hebrew, the language is called ''Spanyolit''.

An entry in ''[[Ethnologue]]'' claims, "The name 'Judesmo' is used by Jewish linguists and Turkish Jews and American Jews; 'Judeo-Spanish' by Romance philologists; 'Ladino' by laymen, especially in Israel; 'Haketia' by Moroccan Jews; 'Spanyol' by some others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lad |title=Ladino |accessdate=2008-09-25 |author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; That does not reflect the historical usage. In the Judeo-Spanish press of the 19th and 20th centuries the native authors referred to the language exclusively as ''Espanyol'', which was also the name that its native speakers spontaneously gave to it for as long as it was their primary spoken language. More rarely, the bookish ''Judeo-Espanyol'' has also been used since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Death of a language: The history of Judeo-Spanish |last=Harris |first=Tracy |publisher=University of Delaware Press |year=1994 |isbn= |location=Newark, DE |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Judezmo'' is unknown and offensive to most native speakers, and it has never been used in print in the native press. However, in limited parts of Macedonia, its former use in the past as a low-register designation in informal speech by unschooled people has been documented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The derivation of the name ''Ladino'' is complicated. Before the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain]], the word meant literary Spanish, as opposed to other dialects {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} or Romance in general, as distinct from Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=ladino&amp;TIPO_HTML=2&amp;FORMATO=ampliado#0_2 DRAE: Ladino, 2nd sense]. Buscon.rae.es. Retrieved on 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; (The first European language grammar and dictionary, of Spanish, referred to it as ''ladino'' or ''ladina''. In the [[Middle Ages]], the word ''Latin'' was frequently used to mean simply "language", particularly one understood: a ''latiner'' or ''latimer'' meant a translator.) Following the Expulsion, Jews spoke of "the Ladino" to mean the traditional oral translation of the Bible into Old Spanish. By extension, it came to mean that style of Spanish generally in the same way that (among Kurdish Jews) ''[[Targum (Aramaic dialect)|Targum]]'' has come to mean [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Judeo-Aramaic]] and (among Jews of Arabic-speaking background) ''sharħ'' has come to mean [[Judeo-Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia 16]], 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Informally, especially in modern Israel, many speakers use ''Ladino'' to mean Judaeo-Spanish as a whole. The language used to be regulated by a body called the [[Autoridad Nasionala del Ladino]] in Israel. More strictly, however, the term is confined to the style used in translation. According to the website of the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ladino is not spoken, rather, it is the product of a word-for-word translation of Hebrew or Aramaic biblical or liturgical texts made by rabbis in the Jewish schools of Spain. In these translations, a specific Hebrew or Aramaic word always corresponded to the same Spanish word, as long as no exegetical considerations prevented this. In short, Ladino is only Hebrew clothed in Spanish, or Spanish with Hebrew syntax. The famous Ladino translation of the Bible, the [[Ferrara Bible|Biblia de Ferrara]] (1553), provided inspiration for the translation of numerous Spanish Christian Bibles."&lt;ref name="Thessaloniki Museum"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That Judaeo-Spanish ''ladino'' should not be confused with the ''ladino or [[Ladin language]]'' spoken in part of [[Northeastern Italy]], which is closely related to the [[Romansh language]] of Swiss [[Grisons]] (it is [[questione ladina|disputed]] whether or not they form a common [[Rhaeto-Romance language]]) and has nothing to do with either Jews or Spanish beyond being a [[Romance language]], a property that they share with French, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian.

In modern Spanish, the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] gives "Ladino"  nine meanings, including five as an adjective and four as a noun, but two are obsolete:

1.  Adj. Astute, sagacious, cunning&lt;br /&gt;
2.  Adj. Pertaining or relating to the Ladin language.&lt;br /&gt;
3.  Adj. In El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, describing a [[mestizo]] person who speaks only Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;
4.  Adj. In El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, a Mestizo person.&lt;br /&gt;
5.  Adj. Obsolete: A person with facility in languages other than his/her own.&lt;br /&gt;
6.  Noun. The Ladin language spoken in South Tyrol.&lt;br /&gt;
7.  Noun. The religious language of Sephardic Jews.&lt;br /&gt;
8.  Noun. Judeo-Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;
9.  Noun. Obsolete: The archaic literary form of Spanish called "romance" or "romantic Spanish".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dle.rae.es/?id=MmZovyA Real Academia Española dictionary (2001), entry: Ladino] ''Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy of the Spanish tongue, Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española'', Espasa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Origins==
At the time of the expulsion from Spain, the day-to-day language of the Jews of different regions of the peninsula was hardly, if at all, different from that of their Christian neighbours, but there may have been some dialect mixing to form a sort of Jewish lingua franca. There was  however, a special style of Spanish used for purposes of study or translation, featuring a more archaic dialect, a large number of Hebrew and [[Aramaic]] loanwords and a tendency to render Hebrew word order literally (''ha-laylah ha-zeh'', meaning "this night", was rendered ''la noche la esta'' instead of the normal Spanish ''esta noche''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryptojews.com/clearing_up_ladino.htm "Clearing up Ladino, Judeo-Spanish, Sephardic Music"] Judith Cohen, HaLapid, winter 2001; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142720/http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1596 |date=16 April 2008 |title=Sephardic Song}}, Judith Cohen, Midstream July/August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;). As mentioned above, some authorities would confine the term "Ladino" to that style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Attig|first=Remy|date=September 2012|title=Did the Sephardic Jews Speak Ladino?|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14753820.2012.712320?journalCode=cbhs20|journal=Bulletin of Spanish Studies|language=en|volume=89|issue=6|pages=831–838|doi=10.1080/14753820.2012.712320|issn=1475-3820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Expulsion, the process of dialect mixing continued, but Castilian Spanish remained by far the largest contributor. The daily language was increasingly influenced both by the language of study and by the local non-Jewish vernaculars, such as Greek and Turkish. It came to be known as ''Judesmo'' and, in that respect, the development is parallel to that of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. However, many speakers, especially among the community leaders, also had command of a more formal style, ''castellano'', which was nearer to the Spanish at the time of the Expulsion.

==Source languages==
===Spanish===
The grammar, the phonology and about 60% of the vocabulary of Judaeo-Spanish are basically Spanish but, in some respects, it resembles the dialects in southern Spain and South America, rather than the dialects of Central Spain. For example, it has [[yeísmo]] ("she" is ''{{wiktlad|eya}}''/''{{wiktlad|ella}}'' {{IPA|[ˈeja]}} (Judaeo-Spanish), instead of ''{{wiktspa|ella}}'') as well as [[seseo]].

In many respects, it reproduces the Spanish of the time of the Expulsion, rather than the modern variety, as it retains some archaic features such as the following:
* Modern Spanish ''j'', pronounced {{IPA|[x]}}, corresponds to two different phonemes in Old Spanish: ''x'', pronounced {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, and ''j'', pronounced {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. Judaeo-Spanish retains the original sounds. Similarly, ''g'' before ''e'' or ''i'' remains {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} or {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, not {{IPA|[x]}}.
** Contrast ''baxo''/''baṣo'' ("low" or "down", with {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, modern Spanish ''bajo'') and ''mujer'' ("woman" or "wife", spelled the same, with {{IPA|/ʒ/}}).
* Modern Spanish ''z'' (''c'' before ''e'' or ''i''), pronounced [s] or {{IPA|[θ]}}, like the "th" in English "think", corresponds to two different phonemes in Old Spanish: ''ç'' (''c'' before ''e'' or ''i''), pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}}; and ''z'' (in all positions), pronounced {{IPA|[dz]}}. In Judaeo-Spanish, they are pronounced {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}}, respectively.
**Contrast ''coraçón''/''korasón'' ("heart", with {{IPA|/s/}}, modern Spanish ''corazón'') and ''dezir'' ("to say", with {{IPA|/z/}}, modern Spanish ''decir'').
* In modern Spanish, the use of the letters ''b'' and ''v'' is determined partly on the basis of earlier forms of the language and partly on the basis of Latin etymology: both letters represent one phoneme ({{IPA|/b/}}), realised as {{IPA|[b]}} or as {{IPA|[β]}}, according to its position. In Judaeo-Spanish, {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are different phonemes: ''voz/boz'' {{IPA|/bɔs/}} ''voice'' vs. ''vos'' {{IPA|/vɔs/}} ''you''. ''v'' is a [[labiodental consonant|labiodental]] "v", like in English, rather than a bilabial.

===Portuguese and other Iberian languages===
However, the phonology of both the consonants and part of the lexicon is, in some respects, closer to Galician-Portuguese and Catalan than to modern Spanish. That is explained by direct influence but also because all three languages retained some of the characteristics of medieval Ibero-Romance languages that Spanish later lost.

Contrast Judaeo-Spanish ''{{wiktlad|daínda}}'' ("still") with Portuguese ''{{wiktpt|ainda}}'' (Galician ''{{wiktgl|aínda}}'', Asturian ''{{wiktast|aína}}'' or ''{{wiktast|enaína}}'') and Spanish ''{{wiktes|aún}}'' or the initial consonants in Judaeo-Spanish ''{{wiktlad|fija}}'', ''{{wiktlad|favla}}'' ("daughter", "speech"), Portuguese ''{{wiktpt|filha}}'', ''{{wiktpt|fala}}'' (Galician ''{{wiktgl|filla}}'', ''{{wiktgl|fala}}'', Asturian ''{{wiktast|fía}}'', ''{{wiktast|fala}}'', Aragonese ''{{wiktan|filla}}'', ''{{wiktan|fabla}}'', Catalan ''{{wiktcat|filla}}''), Spanish ''{{wiktes|hija}}'', ''{{wiktes|habla}}''. It sometimes varied with dialect, as in Judaeo-Spanish popular songs, both ''{{wiktlad|fijo}}'' and ''{{wiktlad|hijo}}'' ("son") are found.

The Judaeo-Spanish pronunciation of ''s'' as "{{IPA|[ʃ]}}" before a "k" sound or at the end of certain words (such as ''{{wiktlad|seis}}'', pronounced {{IPA|[seʃ]}}, for six) is shared with Portuguese (as spoken in Portugal, most of Lusophone Asia and Africa, and in a plurality of Brazilian registers with either partial or total forms of coda |S| palatalization) but not with Spanish.

===Hebrew and Aramaic===
Like other Jewish vernaculars, Judaeo-Spanish incorporates many Hebrew and Aramaic words, mostly for religious concepts and institutions. Examples are ''haham/ḥaḥam'' (rabbi, from Hebrew ''ḥakham'') and ''kal, kahal''/''cal, cahal'' (synagogue, from Hebrew ''qahal'').

===Other languages===
Judaeo-Spanish has absorbed some words from the local languages but sometimes Hispanicised their form:  ''bilbilico'' (nightingale), from Persian (via Turkish) ''bülbül''. It may be compared to the Slavic elements in Yiddish. It is not always clear whether some of these words were introduced before the Expulsion because of the large number of Arabic words in Spanish generally.

==Phonology==
Judaeo-Spanish phonology consists of 27 [[phoneme]]s: 22 [[consonant]]s and 5 [[vowel]]s.

===Phonological differences from Spanish===
As exemplified in the Sources section above, much of the phonology of Judaeo-Spanish is similar to that of standard modern Spanish. Here are some exceptions:
* It is claimed that unlike all other non-creole varieties of Spanish, Judaeo-Spanish does not contrast the trill {{IPA|/r/}} and the tap/flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Variation and Change in Spanish|last=Penny|first=Ralph|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0 521 60450 8|location=|pages=179–189|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that claim is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Travis G. Bradley and Ann Marie Delforge, ''Phonological Retention and Innovation in the Judeo-Spanish of Istanbul'' in ''Selected Proceedings of the 8th Hispanic Linguistics'' Symposium, ed. Timothy L. Face and Carol A. Klee, 73-88. 2006. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Spanish {{IPA|/nue-/}} is {{IPA|/mue-/}} in some dialects of Judaeo-Spanish: ''nuevo, nuestro → muevo, muestro.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The Judaeo-Spanish phoneme inventory includes separate {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}}: ''jurnal'' {{IPA|/ʒuɾˈnal/}} ''('newspaper')'' vs ''jugar/djugar'' {{IPA|/d͡ʒuˈgar/}} ''('to play')''. Neither phoneme is used in modern Spanish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* There is a tendency to drop [s] at the end of a word or syllable, as in [[Andalusian Spanish#Phonological features|Andalusian Spanish]]: ''Dios'' -&gt; ''Dio'' (God), ''amargasteis'' -&gt; ''amargátex/amargatesh'' (you have embittered). The form ''Dió'', however, is usually explained as an example of [[folk etymology]]: taking the ''s'' as a plural ending (which it is not) and attributing it to Christian [[Trinity|trinitarianism]]. Thus, removing the ''s'' produced a more clearly monotheistic word for God. The noun ''dio'' does not exist as a word in any other form of Spanish.

==Morphology==
Judaeo-Spanish is distinguished from other Spanish dialects by the presence of the following features:
* Judaeo-Spanish  maintains the second-person [[pronouns]] ''tú/tu'' (informal singular), ''vos'' (formal singular) and ''vosotros/vozotros'' (plural); the third-person ''él/ella/ellos/ellas / el/eya/eyos/eyas'' are also used in the formal register.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Spanish pronouns ''usted'' and ''ustedes'' do not exist.
* In verbs, the [[preterite]] indicates that an action taken once in the past was also completed at some point in the past. That is as opposed to the [[imperfect]], which refers to any continuous, habitual, unfinished or repetitive past action. Thus, "I ate falafel yesterday" would use the first-person preterite form of eat, ''comí''/''komí'' but "When I lived in Izmir, I ran five miles every evening" would use the first-person imperfect form, ''corría''/''koria''. Though some of the morphology has changed, usage is just as in normative Spanish.
* In general, Judaeo-Spanish uses the Spanish plural morpheme /-(e)s/. The Hebrew plural endings ''/-im/'' and ''/-ot/'' are used with Hebrew loanwords, as well as with a few words from Spanish: ''ladrón/ladron'' (thief): ''ladrones, ladronimm; ''hermano/ermano'' (brother): ''hermanos/hermanim / ermanos/ermanim.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Spanish-Ladino/Grammar/Ladino-Noun.htm#Formation%20of%20the%20Plural|title=Judeo-Spanish: Noun|last=Batzarov|first=Zdravko|website=www.orbilat.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some loaned feminine nouns ending in -á can take either the Spanish or Hebrew plural: ''quehilá/keilá'' (synagogue): ''quehilás/quehilot / keilas/keilot.'' 
* Judaeo-Spanish contains more gendering cases than standard Spanish, prominently in adjectives, (''grande/-a, inferior/-ra'') as well as in nouns (''vozas, fuentas'') and in the interrogative ''qualo/quala / kualo/kuala.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Syntax ==
Judaeo-Spanish follows Spanish for most of its [[syntax]]. (That is not true of the written calque language involving word-for-word translations from Hebrew, which some scholars refer to as Ladino, as described above.) Like Spanish, it generally follows a subject–verb–object [[word order]], has a [[morphosyntactic alignment|nominative-accusative alignment]], and is considered a [[fusional language|fusional]] or [[inflection|inflected]] language.

==Orthography==
[[File:Rashiscript.PNG|thumb|The [[Rashi script]], originally used to print the language]]

The following systems of writing Judaeo-Spanish have been used or proposed.
* Traditionally, especially in Ladino religious texts, Judaeo-Spanish was printed in [[Hebrew writing]] (especially in [[Rashi script]]), a practice that was very common, possibly almost universal, until the 19th century. That was called ''[[aljamiado]]'', by analogy with the equivalent use of the [[Arabic script]].  It occasionally persists, especially in religious use. Everyday written records of the language used [[Solitreo]], a semi-cursive script similar to Rashi script that shifted to square letter for Hebrew/Aramaic words. Solitreo is clearly different from the Ashkenazi Cursive Hebrew used today in Israel, but it is also related to Rashi script. (A comparative table is provided in the article on [[Cursive Hebrew]].) Hebrew writing of the language freely uses [[matres lectionis]]: final -a is written with {{script|Hebr|[[he (letter)|ה]]}} (''heh'') and {{script|Hebr|[[vav (letter)|ו]]}} (''waw'') can represent {{IPA|/o/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}. Both s ({{IPA|/s/}}) and x ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}) are generally written with {{script|Hebr|[[shin (letter)|ש]]}}, as {{script|Hebr|[[samech|ס]]}} is generally reserved for c before e or i and ç. However, borrowed Hebrew words retain their Hebrew spelling, without vowels.
* The [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Cyrillic script]] were used in the past,&lt;ref&gt;''Verba Hispanica'' X: [http://hispanismo.cervantes.es/documentos/smidX.pdf Los problemas del estudio de la lengua sefardí] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407074136/http://hispanismo.cervantes.es/documentos/smidX.pdf |date= 7 April 2008}}, Katja Šmid, Ljubljana, pages 113–124: ''Es interesante el hecho que en Bulgaria se imprimieron unas pocas publicaciones en alfabeto cirílico búlgaro y en Grecia en alfabeto griego. [...] Nezirović (1992: 128) anota que también en Bosnia se ha encontrado un documento en que la lengua sefardí está escrita en alfabeto cirilico''. The Nezirović reference is: Nezirović, M., ''Jevrejsko-Španjolska književnost''. Institut za književnost, Svjetlost, Sarajevo, Bosnia 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is rare or nonexistent nowadays.
* In Turkey, Judaeo-Spanish is most commonly written in the [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish variant]] of the [[Latin alphabet]]. That may be the most widespread system in use today, as following the decimation of Sephardic communities throughout much of Europe (particularly in Greece and the [[Balkans]]) during the [[Holocaust]], the greatest proportion of speakers remaining were Turkish Jews. However, the Judaeo-Spanish page of the Turkish Jewish newspaper [[Şalom]] now uses the Israeli system.
* The Israeli [[Autoridad Nasionala del Ladino]] promotes a [[phonetic transcription]] in the [[Latin alphabet]], without making any concessions to Spanish orthography, and uses the transcription in its publication [[Aki Yerushalayim]]. The songs ''Non komo muestro Dio'' and ''Por una ninya'', [[#Songs|below]], and the text in the [[#Samples|sample]] paragraph, below, are written using the system.
* Works published in Spain usually adopt the standard orthography of modern Spanish to make them easier for modern Spanish-speaking peoples to read.&lt;ref&gt;See preface by [[Iacob M Hassán]] to Romero, ''Coplas Sefardíes'', Cordoba, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The editions often use diacritics to show where the Judaeo-Spanish pronunciation differs from modern Spanish.
* Perhaps more conservative and less popular, others, including Pablo Carvajal Valdés suggest for Judaeo-Spanish to adopt the orthography that was used at the time of the Expulsion.

===''Aki Yerushalayim'' orthography===
''[[Aki Yerushalayim]]'' magazine, owned by [[Autoridad Nasionala del Ladino]], promotes the following orthography:

*Loanwords and foreign names retain their original spelling, and ''q'' or ''w'' would be used only for such words.

==History==
In the medieval [[Iberian peninsula]], now Spain and Portugal, Jews spoke a variety of Romance dialects. Following the 1490s expulsion from Spain [[expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|and Portugal]], most the Iberian Jews resettled in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Jews in the Ottoman [[Balkans]], Turkey, [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]] (especially [[Morocco]]) developed their own Romance dialects, with some influence from Hebrew and other languages, which became what is now known as Judaeo-Spanish. Later on, many Portuguese Jews also escaped to France, Italy, the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] and [[England]], establishing small groups in those nations as well, but these spoke early modern Spanish or Portuguese rather than Judaeo-Spanish.

[[Jews in the Middle Ages]] were instrumental in the development of Spanish into a [[prestige language]]. Erudite Jews translated Arabic and Hebrew works, often translated earlier from Greek, into Spanish. Christians [[Translations into Latin (c. 1050-c.1250)|translated them again into Latin]] for transmission to Europe.

Until recent times, the language was widely spoken throughout the Balkans, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa, as Judaeo-Spanish had been brought there by the Jewish refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/quickladino.html "Ladinoikonunita: A quick explanation of Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish)]. Sephardicstudies.org. Retrieved on 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contact among Jews of different regions and languages, including [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] developed a unified dialect, differing in some aspects from the Spanish norm that was forming simultaneously in Spain, but some of the mixing may have already occurred in exile rather than in the Iberian Peninsula. The language was known as ''Yahudice'' (Jewish language) in the Ottoman Empire. In the late 18th century, Ottoman poet Enderunlu Fazıl ([[Fazyl bin Tahir Enderuni]]) wrote in his ''[[Zenanname]]'': "Castilians speak the Jewish language but they are not Jews."

The closeness and mutual comprehensibility between Judaeo-Spanish and Spanish favoured trade among Sephardim, often relatives, from the Ottoman Empire to the Netherlands and the ''[[converso]]s'' of the Iberian Peninsula.

Over time, a corpus of literature, both liturgical and secular, developed. Early literature was limited to translations from Hebrew. At the end of the 17th century, Hebrew was disappearing as the vehicle for rabbinic instruction. Thus, a literature appeared in the 18th century, such as [[Me'am Lo'ez]] and poetry collections. By the end of the 19th century, the Sephardim in the Ottoman Empire studied in schools of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]. French became the language for foreign relations, as it did for [[Maronite]]s, and Judaeo-Spanish drew from French for neologisms. New. secular genres appeared, with more than 300 journals, history, theatre, biographies.

Given the relative isolation of many communities, a number of regional dialects of Judaeo-Spanish appeared, many with only limited mutual comprehensibility, largely because of the adoption of large numbers of loanwords from the surrounding populations, including, depending on the location of the community, from Greek, Turkish, Arabic and, in the [[Balkans]], [[Slavic languages]], especially [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]]. The borrowing in many Judaeo-Spanish dialects is so heavy that up to 30% of their vocabulary is of non-Spanish origin. Some words also passed from Judaeo-Spanish into neighbouring languages. For example, the word ''palavra'' "word" ([[Vulgar Latin vocabulary|Vulgar Latin]] = "parabola"; Greek = "parabole"), passed into Turkish, Greek and Romanian&lt;ref name="DER"&gt;''[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=palavra&amp;source=12 palavră]'' in the ''[[Dicționarul etimologic român]]'', [[Alexandru Ciorănescu]], [[Universidad de la Laguna]], [[Tenerife]], 1958–1966: ''Cuvînt introdus probabil prin. iud. sp'': "Word introduced probably through Judaeo-Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; with the meaning "bunk, hokum, humbug, bullshit" in Turkish and Romanian and "big talk, boastful talk" in Greek (compare the English word "palaver").

Judaeo-Spanish was the common language of [[Salonika]] during the Ottoman period. The city became part of Greece in 1912 and was subsequently renamed Thessaloniki. Despite the [[Great Fire of Thessaloniki]], economic oppression by Greek authorities and mass settlement of Christian refugees, the language remained widely spoken in Salonika until the deportation of 50,000 Salonikan Jews in the Holocaust during the [[Second World War]]. According to the 1928 census, the language had 62,999 native speakers in Greece. The figure drops down to 53,094 native speakers in 1940, but 21,094 citizens "usually" spoke the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/studies/guide/thema_c6/04.html Συγκριτικός πίνακας των στοιχείων των απογραφών του 1928, 1940 ΚΑΙ 1951 σχετικά με τις ομιλούμενες γλώσσες στην Ελλάδα.] – Μεινοτικές γλώσσες στην Ελλάδα
Κωνσταντίνος Τσιτσελίκης (2001), Πύλη για την Ελληνική Γλώσσα&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaeo-Spanish was also a language used in ''[[Donmeh]]'' rites (''Dönme'' being a Turkish word for "convert" to refer to adepts of [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatai Tsevi]] converting to Islam in the Ottoman Empire). An example is ''Sabbatai Tsevi esperamos a ti''. Today, the religious practices and the ritual use of Judaeo-Spanish seems confined to elderly generations.

The Castilian colonisation of Northern Africa favoured the role of polyglot Sephards, who bridged between Spanish -colonizers and Arab and Berber speakers.

From the 17th to the 19th centuries, Judaeo-Spanish was the predominant Jewish language in the Holy Land, but its dialect was different in some respects from the one in Greece and Turkey. Some families have lived in Jerusalem for centuries and preserve Judaeo-Spanish for cultural and folklore purposes although they now use Hebrew in everyday life.

An often-told Sephardic anecdote from [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] has it that as a Spanish consulate was opened in [[Sarajevo]] in the [[interwar period]], two Sephardic women passed by. Upon hearing a Catholic priest who was speaking Spanish, they thought that his language meant that he was Jewish.&lt;ref name="Papo"&gt;[http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/90/papo90.htm Eliezer Papo: From the Wailing Wall (in Bosnian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the number of speakers declined sharply: entire communities were murdered in the Holocaust, and the remaining speakers, many of whom emigrated to Israel, adopted Hebrew. The governments of the new [[nation-state]]s encouraged instruction in the official languages. At the same time, Judaeo-Spanish aroused the interest of philologists, as it conserved language and literature from before the standardisation of Spanish.

Judaeo-Spanish is in a serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly [[aliyah|''olim'']] (immigrants to Israel), who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. Nevertheless, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardic communities, especially in music. In addition, Sephardic communities in several Latin American countries still use Judaeo-Spanish. There, an additional danger is assimilation to modern Spanish.

''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' showed an episode, titled "[[A Murderer Among Us]]", with references to the language. Films partially or totally in Judaeo-Spanish include Mexican film [[Novia que te vea (film)|''Novia que te vea'']] (directed by [[Guita Schyfter]]), [[The House on Chelouche Street]], and [[Every Time We Say Goodbye (film)|''Every Time We Say Goodbye'']].

Efforts have been made to gather and publish modern Judaeo-Spanish fables and folktales. In 2001, the [[Jewish Publication Society]] published the first English translation of Judaeo-Spanish folktales, collected by Matilda Koén-Sarano, ''Folktales of Joha, Jewish Trickster: The Misadventures of the Guileful Sephardic Prankster.'' A survivor of [[Auschwitz]], Moshe Ha'elyon, issued his translation into Ladino of the ancient Greek epic [[The Odyssey]] in 2012, in his 87th year, and he is now translating the sister epic, the [[Iliad]], into his mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Nir Hasson, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/holocaust-survivor-revives-jewish-dialect-by-translating-greek-epic-1.417423 ''Holocaust survivor revives Jewish dialect by translating Greek epic,''] at [[Haaretz]], 9 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language was initially spoken by the [[Sephardic Jews in India|Sephardic Jewish community in India]], but was later replaced with [[Judeo-Malayalam]].

==Literature==
The earliest Judaeo-Spanish books were religious in nature, mostly created to maintain religious knowledge for exiles who could not read Hebrew; the first of the known texts is ''Dinim de shehitah i bedikah (The Rules of Ritual Slaughter and Inspection of Animals;'' Istanbul, 1510).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Ladino Culture: Press, Belles Lettres, and Theater in the Late Ottoman Empire|last=Borovaya|first=Olga|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2012|isbn=978 0 253 35672 7|location=|pages=7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts continued to be focussed on philosophical and religious themes, including a large body of rabbinic writings, until the first half of the 19th century. The largest output of secular Judaeo-Spanish literature occurred during the latter half of the 19th and the early 20th centuries in the Ottoman Empire. The earliest and most abundant form of secular text was the periodical press: between 1845 and 1939, Ottoman Sephardim published around 300 individual periodical titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Ladino Culture: Press, Belles Lettres, and Theater in the Late Ottoman Empire|last=Borovaya|first=Olga|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2012|isbn=978 0 253 35672 7|location=|pages=24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of periodicals gave rise to serialised novels: many of them were rewrites of existing foreign novels into Judaeo-Spanish. Unlike the previous scholarly literature, they were intended for a broader audience of educated men and less-educated women alike. They covered a wider range of less weighty content, at times censored to be appropriate for family readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Ladino Culture: Press, Belles Lettres, and Theater in the Late Ottoman Empire|last=Borovaya|first=Olga|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2012|isbn=978 0 253 35672 7|location=|pages=144|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular literature expanded to include love stories and adventure stories, both of which had been absent from Judaeo-Spanish literary canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Ladino Culture: Press, Belles Lettres, and Theater in the Late Ottoman Empire|last=Borovaya|first=Olga|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2012|isbn=978 0 253 35672 7|location=|pages=191|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary corpus mesnwhile also expanded to include theatrical plays, poems and other minor genres.

==Religious use==
The Jewish communities of [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia-Herzegovina, and [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], still chant part of the Sabbath Prayers (''Mizmor David'') in Judaeo-Spanish. The Sephardic Synagogue Ezra Bessaroth in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States, was formed by Jews from Turkey and the Greek island of [[Rhodes]], and it uses the language in some portions of its [[Shabbat]] services. The [[Siddur]] is called Zehut Yosef and was written by Hazzan Isaac Azose.

At Congregation Etz Ahaim of [[Highland Park, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://etzahaim.org Etz Ahaim home page]&lt;/ref&gt; a congregation founded by Sephardic Jews from [[History of the Jews in Thessaloniki|Salonika]], a reader chants the [[Aramaic]] prayer ''B'rikh Shemay'' in Judaeo-Spanish before he takes out the [[Torah]] on [[Shabbat]]. That is known as ''Bendichu su Nombre'' in Judaeo-Spanish. Additionally, at the end of Shabbat services, the entire congregation sings the well-known Hebrew hymn ''[[Ein Keloheinu]],'' which is ''Non Como Muestro Dio'' in Judaeo-Spanish.

''Non Como Muestro Dio'' is also included, alongside ''Ein Keloheinu'', in ''[[Mishkan T'filah]]'', the 2007 [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] prayerbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Frishman|editor1-first=Elyse D.|title=Mishkan T'filah : a Reform siddur: services for Shabbat|date=2007|publisher=Central Conference of American Rabbis|location=New York|isbn=0-88123-104-5|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] translated some scholarly religious texts, including ''[[Me'am Loez]]'' into Hebrew, English or both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americansephardifederation.org/sub/events/exhibition-rare_book_levy.asp &gt; Events &gt; Exhibitions &gt; Rare Book Library Collection Restoration Project – Ladino].

In Spain, the [[Spanish Royal Academy]] (RAE) in 2017 announced plans to create a Judaeo-Spanish branch in Israel in addition to 23 existing academies, in various Spanish-speaking countries, that are associated in the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]. Its stated purpose is to preserve Judaeo-Spanish. The move was seen as another step to make up for the Expulsion, following the [[Sephardi Jews#Spanish citizenship by Iberian Sephardic descent|offer of Spanish citizenship to Sephardim]] who had some connection with Spain.&lt;ref name=rae/&gt;

===Songs===
Folklorists have been collecting ''romances'' and other folk songs, some dating from before the expulsion. Many religious songs in Judeo-Spanish are translations of Hebrew, usually with a different tune. For example, here is ''[[Ein Keloheinu]]'' in Judeo-Spanish:

:Non komo muestro Dio,
:Non komo muestro Sinyor,
:Non komo muestro Rey,
:Non komo muestro Salvador.
:''etc.''

Other songs relate to secular themes such as love:

Anachronistically, Abraham—who in the Bible is the very first Hebrew and the ancestor of all who followed, hence his appellation "Avinu" (Our Father)—is in the Judeo-Spanish song born already in the "djudería" (modern Spanish: ''judería''), the Jewish quarter. This makes Terach and his wife into Hebrews, as are the parents of other babies killed by Nimrod. In essence, unlike its Biblical model, the song is about a Hebrew community persecuted by a cruel king and witnessing the birth of a miraculous saviour—a subject of obvious interest and attraction to the Jewish people who composed and sang it in [[Medieval Spain]].

The song attributes to Abraham elements that are from the story of [[Moses]]'s birth, the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them, the 'holy light' in the Jewish area, as well as from the careers of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] who emerged unscathed from the fiery furnace. [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]] is thus made to conflate the role and attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings:[[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Pharaoh]].

==Modern singers==
[[Jennifer Charles]] and [[Oren Bloedow]] from the New York-based band [[Elysian Fields (band)|Elysian Fields]] released a CD in 2001 called La Mar Enfortuna, which featured modern versions of traditional Sephardic songs, many sung by Charles in Judeo-Spanish. The American singer Tanja Solnik has released several award-winning albums that feature songs in the languages: ''From Generation to Generation: A Legacy of Lullabies'' and ''Lullabies and Love Songs''. There are a number of groups in Turkey that sing in Judeo-Spanish, notably ''Janet – Jak Esim Ensemble'', ''Sefarad'', ''Los Pasharos Sefaradis'' and the children's chorus ''Las Estreyikas d'Estambol''. There is a Brazilian-born singer of Sephardic origins,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Fortuna (Brazilian singer)|Fortuna]], who researches and plays Judeo-Spanish music.

The Jewish Bosnian-American musician [[Flory Jagoda]] recorded two CDs of music taught to her by her grandmother, a Sephardic folk singer, among a larger discography.

The cantor [http://www.ramontasat.com Dr. Ramón Tasat], who learned Judeo-Spanish at his grandmother's knee in [[Buenos Aires]], has recorded many songs in the language, with three of his CDs focusing primarily on that music.

The Israeli singer [[Yasmin Levy]] has also brought a new interpretation to the traditional songs by incorporating more "modern" sounds of Andalusian [[Flamenco]]. Her work revitalising Sephardi music has earned Levy the [[Anna Lindh Memorial Fund|Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation Award]] for promoting cross-cultural dialogue between musicians from three cultures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title =2008 Event Media Release – Yasmin Levy
 | publisher=Sydney Opera House
 | accessdate = 2008-08-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Yasmin Levy's own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I am proud to combine the two cultures of Ladino and flamenco, while mixing in Middle Eastern influences. I am embarking on a 500 years old musical journey, taking Ladino to Andalusia and mixing it with flamenco, the style that still bears the musical memories of the old Moorish and Jewish-Spanish world with the sound of the Arab world. In a way it is a ‘musical reconciliation’ of history.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notable music groups performing in Judeo-Spanish include [[Voice of the Turtle]], [[Oren Bloedow]] and [[Jennifer Charles]]' "La Mar Enfortuna" and [[Vanya Green]], who was awarded a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] for her research and performance of this music. She was recently selected as one of the top ten world music artists by the We are Listening International World of Music Awards for her interpretations of the music.

Robin Greenstein, a New York-based musician, received a federal CETA grant in the 1980s to collect and perform Sephardic Ladino Music under the guidance of the American Jewish Congress. Her mentor was Joe Elias, noted Sephardic singer from Brooklyn.  She recorded residents of the Sephardic Home for the Aged, a nursing home in [[Coney Island, New York]], singing songs from their childhood. The voices recorded included Victoria Hazan, a well known Sephardic singer who recorded many 78's in Judaeo-Spanish and Turkish from the 1930s and 1940s. Two Judaeo-Spanish songs can be found on her "Songs of the Season" holiday CD, released in 2010 on Windy Records.

German band [[In Extremo]] also recorded a version of the above-mentioned song Avram Avinu.

'''Koreans in Malaysia''' numbered 12,690 individuals {{asof|2015|lc=on}}, making them the 22nd-largest community of [[Korean diaspora|overseas Koreans]], and the 5th-largest in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT"/&gt;

==Migration history==
The history of Koreans in Malaysia goes back almost half a century; [[Malaysia – South Korea relations|Malaysia and South Korea]] established [[diplomatic relations]] in 1960, and in the following decade, when Malaysia faced a shortage of doctors, a number of foreign doctors, including Koreans and Filipinos, were authorised to practise in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=1970|last=Henderson|first=John William|title=Area Handbook for Malaysia|publisher=American University|oclc=154312|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernama"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ariffin|first=Roslan|date=8 March 2007|accessdate=4 May 2007|title=Najib Dijangka Kukuhkan Hubungan Dua Hala M'sia-Korea Selatan (Najib plans strong Malaysia-South Korea bilateral relations)|work=Bernama|url=http://bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/bm/news.php?id=250285|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102907/http://bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/bm/news.php?id=250285|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some construction workers, pilots, and sailors were also sent to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Immigrant Entrepreneurs: Koreans in Los Angeles, 1965–1982|first=Edna|last=Bonacich |author2=Light, Ivan|publisher=University of California Press|location=United States|pages=104|year=1991|isbn=0-520-07656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography and distribution==
[[File:Korean shop at Singgah Mata Street, Kota Kinabalu.jpg|thumb|left|Korean shop at Singgah Mata Street, [[Kota Kinabalu]], Sabah.]]
The Korean community in Malaysia consist mostly of migrants working in [[List of South Korean companies|South Korean companies]], as well as an increasing number of [[international student]]s.&lt;ref name="Yonhap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20070131/480100000020070131080009E3.html|title=Malaysia emerging as destination for Korean students seeking global education|last=Kim|first=Hyun|work=Yonhap News|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=4 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070331120512/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20070131/480100000020070131080009E3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of retirees coming under the [[Malaysia My Second Home]] immigration programme has also been increasing.&lt;ref name="Phoon"/&gt; Most Korean residents are concentrated in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Selangor]], especially in [[Ampang Jaya|Ampang]], where a [[Koreatown]] is beginning to sprout.&lt;ref name="Rhee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhee|first=Hyun Ah|title=Koreans find green pastures in Ampang|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/rentakini/61135|work=Malaysiakini|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=4 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070124232654/http://www.malaysiakini.com/rentakini/61135 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korean Wave|popularity of Korean dramas]] in Malaysia has meant an increasingly friendly reception for Korean migrants by local people.&lt;ref name="Yonhap"/&gt; Real estate investment is another factor drawing Koreans to migrate to Malaysia, due to the taxes imposed on people who own more than two properties in Korea; Malaysia is the second most popular market for overseas real estate investment by Koreans, after the United States.&lt;ref name="Phoon"/&gt;

Around 200,000 South Korean tourists came to Malaysia in 2006; [[Kota Kinabalu]] was their most popular destination.&lt;ref name="Bernama"/&gt; About 1,800 to 2,000 Koreans reside in [[Sabah]], most of them in Kota Kinabalu.&lt;ref name="NewSabahTimes"/&gt; Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal project in [[Kimanis]], Papar has brought South Korean employees of [[Samsung Engineering]] to work and live there until the terminal completion in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.samsungengineering.co.kr/eng/sustain/PressReleasesView.jsp?tb2_seq=308&amp;category=14|title=Samsung Engineering officially signs the Sabah Oil &amp; Gas Terminal Project|publisher=Samsung Engineering|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also some North Koreans working in Sarawak in the mine industry.&lt;ref name="nk1"/&gt; This was revealed after [[2014 Selantik coal mine explosion|a tragedy]] that killed one and injuring seven others North Koreans in 2014.&lt;ref name="nk2"/&gt; By September 2017, the state Immigration Department has confirmed there is no more North Koreans working in Sarawak with the [[coal mine]] also had stopped their operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/09/282406/all-north-koreans-sarawak-have-been-sent-back|title=All North Koreans in Sarawak have been sent back|author=Adib Povera|publisher=New Straits Times|date=21 September 2017|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Roughly 2,000 of the Koreans in Malaysia are students; Malaysia's multicultural environment offers them the chance to practise English as well as study other languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Malay language|Malay]]; they describe the educational environment as being more relaxed than in Korea. [[Christianity in Korea|Korean churches]] form an important part of their social life.&lt;ref name="TheStar2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheStar"/&gt; Their parents also prefer Malaysia to other countries for several reasons. The low cost of living and [[education in Malaysia]] is a major pull factor; Parents also believe Malaysia offers a better environment for English study than neighbouring countries, as prevalence of [[Islam in Malaysia]] means that the nightlife is less of a distraction. A representative from one [[Seoul]] company which helps to arrange overseas study for local students estimated that 90% of Korean students going to [[Southeast Asia]] choose Malaysia as their destination. However, some [[international school]]s have stopped accepting Korean students because they have become too large a proportion of their student bodies.&lt;ref name="Yonhap"/&gt; In many cases, mothers come to Malaysia with their young school-age children, while the breadwinning father remains behind in South Korea and sends money to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/409393/1/.html|periodical=Channel News Asia|title=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: Weakening Korean won forces South Koreans to give up overseas plans|last=Lim|first=Yun-suk|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia's first officially registered weekend school for Korean nationals, the Malaysia Korean School, was established on 7 December 1974; it had 26 teachers and enrolled 148 students {{As of|2006|lc=on}}. It was located on [[Jalan Ampang]] in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=731&amp;page=7&amp;key=2|title=Overseas Korean Educational Institutions|chapter=재말레이시아한인학교|publisher=International Institute for Education Development, Republic of Korea|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108134903/http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=731&amp;page=7&amp;key=2|archivedate=8 January 2008|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day school for Korean families, the [[Korean School of Malaysia]], opened in [[Cyberjaya]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2016/05/27/6/0302000000AEN20160527006200315F.html|title=Malaysia's first Korean school to open in September |publisher=''[[Yonhap News]]''|date=2016-05-27|accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laiuse Romani''' was a [[Romani language|Romani]] variety spoken in [[Estonia]]. It was a [[mixed language]] based on Romani and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romani people]] first appeared to Estonia in the 17th century. According to rumors, they were first part of Swedish King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]'s Romani orchestra which he, after spending a winter in [[Laiuse Castle|Laiuse]], left behind. In 1841 all of the 44 Estonian Romani were collected and settled around [[Laiuse]] Parish. Their main stop was [[Raaduvere]] village, but they also lived in [[Tähkvere]], [[Jõgeva]] and its precincts. Before the [[Second World War]] there was 60 Romani in Laiuse.&lt;ref name=eestigiid&gt;{{cite web|title=Laiuse mustlased|url=http://www.eestigiid.ee/?SCat=7&amp;CatID=4&amp;ItemID=1560|publisher=eestigiid.ee|accessdate=23 September 2011|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laiuse Romani became [[language death|extinct]] in the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War II|German occupation]], when all its speakers were killed by the Nazis during the [[Porajmos]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m10"/&gt;

==Linguistic features==
Laiuse Romani shares a number of linguistic features with [[Kalo Finnish Romani language|Finnish Kalo]],&lt;ref name="m10"&gt;Matras, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of [[velar consonant]]s before [[front vowel]]s&lt;ref&gt;Matras, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and initial [[devoicing]].&lt;ref&gt;Matras, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Laz people}}
The '''Laz people''' or '''Lazi''' ({{lang-lzz|Lazi, ლაზი}}; {{lang-ka|ლაზი, lazi; or ჭანი, ch'ani}}; {{lang-tr|Laz}}) are an indigenous [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]-speaking [[ethnic group]]&lt;ref name="ethno"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires|author=[[James S. Olson]]|publisher=Greenwood|year=1994|editors=Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabiting the [[Black Sea]] coastal regions of [[Black Sea Region|Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Minorsky, V. "Laz." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E . Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the total population of the Laz people today vary drastically, with numbers as low as 45,000 to as high as 1.6 million people, with the majority living in northeast Turkey. The Laz speak the [[Laz language]], a member of the same Kartvelian [[language family]] as [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Svan language|Svan]], and [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalby |first=A. |year=2002 |title=Language in Danger; The Loss of Linguistic Diversity and the Threat to Our Future |publisher=Columbia University Press|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BRAUND, D., Georgia in antiquity: a history of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC – AD 562, Oxford University Press, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The Laz language is classified as endangered by [[UNESCO]], with an estimated 130,000 to 150,000 speakers in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1056.html |title=World Language Atlas |publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of the Laz people are cited by many classical authors from [[Scylax of Caryanda|Scylax]] to [[Procopius]] and [[Agathias]], but the Laz ({{lang-el|Λαζοί|}}) themselves are cited by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] around the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, NH 6.4.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braund (1994), p. 157, fn. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnonym "Laz" is unhesitatingly linked to a [[Svan language|Svan]] toponym La-zan (i.e. La = territorial prefix + [[Zan languages|Zan]]).

By the 6th century, the Colchians of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] were known as the [[Zans|Tzanni]] ({{lang-grc|Τζάννοι}}), at the same time when the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] state of Lazica (or [[Lazica|Egrisi]] in Georgian sources) existed on the [[Rioni River|Phasis valley]] basin. According to Procopius, the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] subdued Tzanni in the 520s and converted them to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Procopius]] ''Bell. Pers''. i. 15, ''Bell. Goth''. iv. 2, ''de Aed.'' iii. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ancient [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]], [[Poti|Phasis]], was lost by the Byzantine Empire, [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] became the [[Metropolitan bishop]] of Lazica, since then the name Lazi appears the general Greek name for the southern Colchian tribes ({{lang-el|Τζανοί|Tzanoi}}) lying outside of the direct control of the Lazic Kingdom.

The Pontic Lazi, which were incorporated within the [[Byzantine Empire]], and differed from the Caucasian Lazi, or [[Mingrelians|Megrelians]], have retained the old name "Lazi" till today.

== Origins ==
The Laz are ethnically a branch of the [[Georgians]]. Many modern theories suggest that the ancestors of the Laz-[[Mingrelians]] constituted the dominant ethnic and cultural presence in the south-eastern [[Black Sea]] region in antiquity, and hence played a significant role in the ethnogenesis of the modern Georgians.&lt;ref&gt;Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States, James Minahan, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Toumanoff, Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Laz people}}

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Colchis and Iberia, VI-III centuries B.C..jpg|left|thumb|Ancient Georgian states of [[Colchis]] and [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]], 500–400 BC]]
In the 13th century [[Common Era|BC]], the Kingdom of [[Colchis]] was formed as a result of the increasing consolidation of the tribes inhabiting the region, which covered modern western Georgia and [[Turkey]]'s north-eastern provinces of [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]] and [[Rize Province|Rize]]. In 8th century, several Greek [[Colonies in antiquity|trading colonies]] were established along the shores of the [[Black Sea]].[[File:MÖ_6._yüzyıla_ait_gümüş_Kolkhis_sikkesi.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M%C3%96_6._y%C3%BCzy%C4%B1la_ait_g%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9F_Kolkhis_sikkesi.jpg|right|thumb|220x220px|[[Colchis|Colchian]] silver coin, 6th century BC.]]By the 6th century BC, the tribes living in the southern Colchis ([[Macrones]], [[Mushki|Moschi]], [[Marres]] etc.) were incorporated into the [[nineteenth Satrapy]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]], however following of Alexander's death a number of separate kingdoms were established in [[Anatolia]], including [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], in the corner of the south-eastern [[Black Sea]], ruled by [[Mithridates I of Pontus|Mithridates]]. The very small number of Hellenistic Greek inscriptions that have been found anywhere in Pontus suggest that [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] did not substantially penetrate beyond the coastal cities and the court.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pontus&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the brilliant [[Mithridatic Wars|Roman campaigns]] led by the generals [[Pompey]] and [[Lucullus]], the kingdom of Pontus was completely destroyed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and all its territory, including Colchis, was incorporated into the Roman Empire. The former southern provinces of Colchis were reorganized into the [[Roman province]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus Polemoniacus]], while the northern Cholchis became the Roman province of [[Lazica|Lazicum]]. By the mid-3rd century, the Lazi tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of [[Lazica]].

[[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colonization]] was restricted to the coast, and in later ages [[Roman Empire|Roman control]] remained likewise only nominal over the tribes of the interior.&lt;ref name="Talbert1226"&gt;{{harvnb|Talbert|2000|p=1226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal regions, however, belonged to the Roman province of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus Polemoniacus]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Lazica in Late Antiquity.svg|left|thumb|The kingdom of Lazica in Late Antiquity|220x220px]]
During the reign of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] ({{Circa}} 527–565) the warlike tribes of the interior Pontus, called [[Sanni|Sannoi]] or [[Macrones|Tzannoi]], the ancestors of modern Laz people, were subdued, [[Christianization|Christianized]] and brought to central rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2000|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Locals began to have closer contact with the Greeks and acquired various [[Culture of Greece|Hellenic]] cultural traits, including in some cases the language.
[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|Map of the Caucasus &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; 740]]
From 542 to 562, Lazica was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires, culminating in the [[Lazic War]]. Emperor [[Heraclius]]'s offensive in 628 AD brought victory over the Persians and ensured Roman predominance in Lazica until the invasion and conquest of the Caucasus by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arabs]] in the second half of the 7th century.

In the 7th century Lazica fell to the [[Arab rule in Georgia|Muslim conquest]], however in the 8th century combined Lazic and [[Abasgoi|Abasgian]] forces successfully repelled the Arab occupation. In 780 Lazica was incorporated to [[kingdom of Abkhazia]] via a dynastic union, the latter led the unification of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian monarchy]] in the 11th century, thus ousting the Pontic Lazs from western Georgia; thereafter, the Lazs lived under nominal Byzantine suzerainty in the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Chaldia]], with its capital at [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], governed by the native semi-autonomous rulers, like the [[Gabras]] family.&lt;ref name="Hewsen47"&gt;Hewsen, 47&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 10th century [[Arabs|Arab]] geographer [[Abu'l-Fida|Abul Feda]] city of Trebizond was regarded as being largely a Lazian port. Following the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] invasion, there has been continuous influx of [[Armenians]] resulting partial armenization of the local Tzan population and formation of new [[Hemshin peoples|Hemshin]] identity.&lt;ref&gt;Simonian. "Hamshen Before Hemshin", pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trebizond1300.png|thumb|Map of the [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond Empire]] in Anatolia, AD 1300.]]
With the [[Georgian expedition to Chaldia|Georgian intervention in Chaldia]] and [[Fourth Crusade|collapse of Byzantine Empire]] in 1204, [[Empire of Trebizond]] was established along the southwestern coast of the Black Sea, populated by a large Lazian-speaking population.&lt;ref name="Mikaberidze, A. (2015).2"&gt;Mikaberidze, A. (2015). Historical dictionary of Georgia. 2nd ed. Lanham, MD, United States: ROWMAN &amp; LITTLEFIELD, p.634.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eastern part of the same empire, an autonomous coastal theme of [[Lazia (Pontus)|Greater Lazia]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;Thys-Şenocak, Lucienne. ''Ottoman Women Builders''. Aldershot, England: Ashgate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine authors, such as [[George Pachymeres|Pachymeres]], and to some extent Trapezuntines such as [[John Lazaropoulos|Lazaropoulos]] and [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], regarded the Trapezuntian Empire as being no more than a Lazian border state.&lt;ref&gt;Bryer 1967, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Greek in higher culture, the rural areas of Trebizond empire appear to have been predominantly Laz in ethnic composition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/laz Encyclopedia of World Cultures, Laz]&lt;/ref&gt; Laz family names, with [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] terminations, are noticeable in the records of the mediaeval empire of Trebizond, and it is perhaps not too venturesome to suggest that the [[Trapezuntine Civil War|antagonism]] between the "town-party" and the "country-party," which existed in the politics of "the Empire," was in fact a national antagonism of Laz against Greek.

In 1282, [[Siege of Trebizond (1282)|kingdom of Imereti besieged Trebizond]], however after the failed attempt to take the city, the Georgians occupied several provinces and all the Trebizontine province of Lazia threw off its allegiance to the king of the 'Iberian' and 'Lazian' tribes and united itself with the Georgian [[Kingdom of Imereti]].

=== Early Modern era ===
{{further|Hellenization of Laz people}}[[File:Sanjak of Lazistan, Ottoman Anatolia, 1914.png|thumb|[[Lazistan Sanjak|Sanjak of Lazistan]], Ottoman Anatolia, 1914|250x250px|left]]Laz populated area was often contested by different Georgian principalities, however through [[Battle of Murjakheti]] (1535), [[Principality of Guria]] finally ensured control over it, until 1547, when it was conquered by resurgent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces and reorganized into the [[Lazistan Sanjak|Lazistan sanjak]] as part of [[eyalet]] of [[Trebizond Eyalet|Trabzon]].

After the Ottoman [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|conquest of Trebizond Empire]] and later [[Ottoman invasion of Guria]] in 1547, Ottomans fought for three centuries to [[Three Hundred Laz Martyrs|destroy]] the Christian-Georgian consciousness of the Laz people. Local orthodox inhabitants, once subordinated to the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], had to obey [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Part of the native population were target of the Ottoman [[Islamization]] policy and gradually converted to [[Islam]], while the second part of the people who remained orthodox subordinated to the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]], thus gradually becoming [[Pontic Greeks|Greeks]], the process known as [[Hellenization of Laz people]]. Lazs who were under the control of Constantinople, soon lost their language and self-identity as they became Greeks and learned Greek, especially [[Pontic Greek|Pontic dialect]] of [[Greek language]], although native language was preserved by Lazs who had become Muslims.

Not only the [[Pasha]]s (governors) of Trabzon until the 19th century, but real authority in many of the ''[[Kaza|cazas]]'' (districts) of each sanjak by the mid-17th century lay in the hands of relatively independent native Laz [[derebey]]s ("valley-lords"), or feudal chiefs who exercised absolute authority in their own districts, carried on petty warfare with each other, did not owe allegiance to a superior and never paid contributions to the sultan. This state of insubordination was not really broken until the assertion of Ottoman authority during the reforms of the [[Osman Nuri Pasha|Osman Pasha]] in 1850s.

In 1547, Ottomans built coastal fortress of [[Gonio Fortress|Gonia]], an important Ottoman outpost in southwestern Georgia,&lt;ref name="Vakh"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dspace.nplg.gov.ge/bitstream/1234/3067/1/Istoria_Carstva_Gruzinskogo.pdf|last=Bagrationi|first=Vakhushti|publisher=Metsniereba|year=1976|editor=Nakashidze, N.T.|location=Tbilisi|pages=133–135|language=ru|script-title=ru:История Царства Грузинского|trans-title=History of the Kingdom of Georgia|authorlink=Prince Vakhushti of Kartli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Church|first=Kenneth|title=From dynastic principality to imperial district: the incorporation of Guria into the Russian Empire to 1856|date=2001|publisher=University of Michigan|type=Ph.D.|pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as capital of Lazistan; then [[Batumi|Batum]] until it was acquired by the Russians in 1878, throughout the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], thereafter, [[Rize]] became the capital of the sanjak. The Muslim Lazs living near the war zones in [[Batum Oblast|Batumi Oblast]] were subjected to ethnic cleansing; many Lazes living in Batumi fled to the Ottoman Empire, settling along the southern Black Sea coast to the east of [[Samsun]] and [[Marmara Region|Marmara region]].
[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor, 1910.]]
Around 1914 Ottoman policy towards the Christian population shifted; state policy was since focused to the forceful migration of Christian [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] and Laz population living in coastal areas, close to the [[Caucasus Campaign|Turkish-Russian front]] to the Anatolian hinterland. In the 1920s Christian population of the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] were expelled to [[Greece]].

In 1917, after the [[Russian Revolution]], Lazs became citizents of [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], and eventually became [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] in 1921. Simultaneously, a [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|treaty of friendship]] was signed in Moscow between [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]], whereby southern portions of former [[Batum Oblast|Batumi oblast]] - later known as [[Artvin]], was awarded to Turkey, which renounced its claims to Batumi.

The autonomous Lazistan sanjak existed until the end of the empire in 1923. the designation of the term of Lazistan was officially banned in 1926, by the [[Kemalism|Kemalists]].&lt;ref name="Thys-Şenocak, Lucienne 2006"&gt;Thys-Şenocak, Lucienne. Ottoman Women Builders. Aldershot, England: Ashgate, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazistan was divided between [[Rize Province|Rize]] and Artvin provinces.

=== Modern ===
Most Laz people today live in Turkey, but the Laz minority group has no official status in Turkey. The number of the Laz speakers is decreasing, and is now limited chiefly to the Rize and Artvin areas.

==== Self-identification ====
Over time the Laz living on either side of the frontier have developed different conceptions of what it means to be Laz. Today, most of those living in Turkey do not consider themselves Turkish, but uphold their Laz identity as a separate one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chai-khana.org/en/the-laz-two-tales-of-one-people Chai-khana.org; ''The Laz: Two Tales of One People'' , Irakli Dzneladze]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Laz identity in Georgia has largely merged with a Georgian identity, and the meaning of "Laz" is seen as merely a regional category.&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, V. "Laz." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E . Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010.,&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, in Turkey, the term Laz is a 'folk' definition for people of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds originating from the [[Black Sea Region]]. Officially, the Laz people are not recognized as a minority. Thus, many Turks do not even know about their diverse existence and falsely call the inhabitants of the Black Sea coast as the "Lazlar". Within the last decade more and more intellectual Laz people realized that the disappearance of their language would lead to the disappearance of their identity and tried to preserve their inherited culture through political empowerment, linguistic education, and music and poetry.

== Population and geographical distribution ==
{{further|Laz people in Turkey}}
The total population of the Laz today is only estimated, with numbers ranging widely. The majority of Laz live in Turkey, where the national census does not record ethnic data on minor populations.&lt;ref name="kutscher"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Silvia Kutscher|year=2008|title=The language of the Laz in Turkey: Contact-induced language change or gradual loss?|url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/allgemeine_sprachwissenschaft/dozenten-unterlagen/kutscher/kutscher_langloss_trkl.pdf|journal=Turkic Languages|volume=12|issue=1|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=Due to a lack of census information on minorities (aside from a small number of exceptions such as the Greek or Armenian populations), the actual number of Laz living in Turkey can only be estimated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Area ===

The majority of the Laz today live in an area they call ''Laziǩa, Lazistan, Lazeti'' or ''Lazona'' name of the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Laz people in modern northeast Turkey and southwest Georgia. Geographically, Lazistan consists of a series of narrow, rugged valleys extending northward from the crest of the [[Pontic Mountains|Pontic Alps]] ({{lang-tr|Anadolu Dağları}}), which separate it from the [[Çoruh River|Çoruh]] Valley, and stretches east-west along the southern shore of the [[Black Sea]]. Lazistan is a virtually a forbidden term in Turkey.{{efn-ua|"Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law (Law No. 3713 amended by Law No. 4126) reads, “No one may engage in
written and oral propaganda aimed at disrupting the indivisible integrity of the State of the Turkish Republic,
country, and nation. [… ] Those who engage in such deeds will be sentenced to from one to three years in prison
and given a heavy fine… ”. This article means that those who orally or in print make use of words such as
Lazistan or Kurdistan risk prosecution."}} the name was considered to be an 'unpatriotic' invention of ancien regime.&lt;ref name="Thys-Şenocak, Lucienne 2006" /&gt;

Laz ancestral lands are not well-defined and there is no official geographic definition for the boundaries of Lazistan. However, the following provinces are usually included:
* [[Adjara]] region in Georgia
* [[Artvin Province|Artvin]] province in Turkey
* [[Rize Province|Rize]] province in Turkey
* [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]] province in Turkey

=== Economy ===
Historically, Lazistan was known for producing [[hazelnut]]s.&lt;ref name="Prothero52"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11768/view/1/52/|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|publisher=H.M.

Stationery Office|year=1920|location=London|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Laz economy was based on agriculture—carried out with some difficulty in the steep mountain regions and also on the breeding of sheep, goats, and cattle. Orchards were tended and bees were kept, and the food supply was augmented by hunting. The Laz are good sailors and also practise agriculture rice, maize, tobacco and fruit-trees. The only industries were smelting, celebrated since ancient times, and the cutting of timber used for shipbuilding.

==Culture==
Over the past 20 years, there has been an upsurge of cultural activities aiming at revitalizing the Laz language, education and tradition. [[Kâzım Koyuncu]], who in 1998 became the first Laz musician to gain mainstream success, contributed significantly to the identity of the Laz people, especially among their youth.&lt;ref name="90s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bianet.org/bianet/siyaset/161339-90-lar-laz-kultur-ve-kimlik-hareketinin-dogusu|title=90’lar: Laz Kültür ve Kimlik Hareketinin Doğuşu|author=Ismail Güney Yılmaz|date=7 January 2015|publisher=Lazebura|language=tr|trans-title=1990s: The Birth of the Laz Culture and Identity Movement|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laz Cultural Institute was founded in 1993 and the Laz Culture Association in 2008, and a Laz cultural festival was established in [[Gemlik]].&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-01.pdf|title=Национальный состав населения|trans-title=2010 Census: Ethnic composition of the population|publisher=[[Russian Federal State Statistics Service]]  |accessdate=31 January 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lazca.org/yazarlar/kamil-aksoylu-toroci/188-laz-kulturu-hareket-93-surecnden-laz-ensttusune.html |title=Laz Kültürü Hareketi̇ 93 Süreci̇nden Laz Ensti̇tüsüne  |publisher=Lazca.org|author=Kâmil Aksoylu |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2015 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laz community successfully lobbied Turkey's Education Ministry to offer Laz-language instruction in schools around the Black Sea region. In 2013, the Education Ministry added Laz as a four-year elective course for secondary students, beginning in the fifth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/lazuri-classes-to-begin-in-secondary-schools-in-turkey.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=54429 |title=Lazuri classes to begin in secondary schools in Turkey  |agency=Anadolou |date=14 September 2013  |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{further|Laz language}}[[File:Kartvelian_languages.svg|thumb|250x250px|Distribution of the [[Kartvelian languages]].|right]]Lazuri is a complex and morphologically rich tongue belonging to the South Caucasian language family whose other members are Mingrelian, Svanetian, and Georgian. The Laz language does not have a written history, thus Turkish and Georgian serve as the main literary languages for the Laz people. Their folk literature has been transmitted orally and has not been systematically recorded. The first attempts at establishing a distinct Laz cultural identity and creating a literary language based on the [[Arabic alphabet]] was made by Faik Efendisi in the 1870s, but he was soon imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities, while most of his works were destroyed. During a relative cultural autonomy granted to the minorities in the 1930s, the written Laz literature—based on the Laz script—emerged in [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Georgia]], strongly dominated by Soviet ideology. The poet Mustafa Baniṣi spearheaded this short-lived movement, but an official standard form of the tongue was never established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le6/le6-0292.htm|title=Лазская литература|author=Iksander Tsitashi|work=Литературная энциклопедия (Encyclopedia of Literature)|year=1939|location=Moscow|language=ru|trans-title=Laz literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several attempts have been made to render the pieces of native literature in the Turkish and Georgian alphabets. A few native poets in Turkey such as Raşid Hilmi and Pehlivanoğlu have appeared later in the 20th century.

=== Religion ===
One of the chief tribes of ancient kingdom of [[Colchis]], the Laz were converted to [[Christianity]] while living under the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Georgia]]. [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], which was the only diocese established far in the past, [[Giresun|Cerasous]] and [[Rize|Rizaion]] in [[Lazia (Pontus)|Lazia]], both formed as upgraded bishoprics. All three dioceses survived the Ottoman conquest (1461) and generally operated until the 17th century, when the dioceses of Cerasous and Rizaion were abolished. The diocese of Rizaion and the bishopric of [[Of, Turkey|Of]] were abolished at the time due to the [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of the Lazs.

=== Mythology ===
[[File:Château de Versailles, salon de Diane, Jason et les Argonautes débarquant en Colchide, Charles de La Fosse.jpg|thumb|[[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] arriving at Colchis. [[Argonautica]] tells the myth of their voyage to retrieve the [[Golden Fleece]]. This painting is located in the [[Palace of Versailles]].|250x250px]]
Famous for its saga and myths and bounded by the Black Sea and the Caucasian Mountains, the ancient region of Colchis spreads out from West Georgia to Northeast Turkey. The famous tale in Greek mythology of the [[Golden Fleece]] in which Jason and the [[Argonauts]] stole the Golden Fleece from King [[Aeëtes|Aeetes]], with the help of his daughter [[Medea]], has brought Colchis into the history books.

=== Festival ===
[[Kolkhoba]] is an ancient Laz festival. It is held at the end of August or at the beginning of September in [[Sarpi, Georgia|Sarpi village]], [[Khelvachauri Municipality|Khelvachauri District]]. Festival has revived the former lifestyle of Lazeti residents and moments of human relations typical to the times of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Colchis]] related to the [[Argonauts]] journey to Colchis. During the celebration of Kolkhoba theater performances are followed by a variety of activities and it is considered one of the main public festivals.

=== Music ===
The national instruments include [[Tulum (bagpipe)|guda]] (bagpipe), [[kemenche]] (spike fiddle), [[zurna]] (oboe), and [[doli (musical instrument)|doli]] (drum). In the 1990s and 2000s, the [[folk-rock]] musician [[Kâzım Koyuncu]] attained to significant popularity in Turkey and toured Georgia. Koyuncu, who died of cancer in 2005, was also an activist for the Laz people and has become a cultural hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Berghahn Books| isbn = 978-0-85745-769-1| last1 = Hake| first1 = Sabine| last2 = Mennel| first2 = Barbara| title = Turkish German Cinema in the New Millennium: Sites, Sounds, and Screens| date = 2012-10-01 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itVXmVfBz08C&amp;pg=PA204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dance ===
[[File:Verbreitungskarte der türkischen Volkstänze.png|thumb|250x250px|Extension and distribution of [[folk dance]]s in [[Turkey]].]]
The Laz are noted for their folk dances, called the [[Horon (dance)|Horon]] dance of the Black Sea, originally of pagan worship which was to become a sacred ritual dance. There are many different types of this dance in different regions. Horon is related to those performed by the [[Adjarians|Ajarians]] known as [[Khorumi]]. These may be solemn and precise, performed by lines of men, with carefully executed footwork, or extremely vigorous with the men dancing erect with hands linked, making short rapid movements with their feet, punctuated by dropping to a crouch. The women's dances are graceful but more swift in movement than those encountered in Georgia. In Greece such dances are still associated with the [[Pontic Greeks]] who emigrated from this region after 1922.

=== Traditional clothing ===
[[File:Le courageux Pir-aga Moustafa-reize avec sa compagnie..jpg|thumb|244x244px|Postcard of Laz soldiers dressed in national clothes (Trabzon, Turkey).]]
The traditional Laz men's costume consists of a peculiar bandanalike kerchief covering the entire head above the eyes, knotted on the side and hanging down to the shoulder and the upper back; a snug-fitting jacket of coarse brown homespun with loose sleeves; and baggy dark brown woolen trousers tucked into slim, knee-high leather boots. The women's costume was similar to the wide-skirted princess gown found throughout Georgia but worn with a similar kerchief to that of the men and with a rich scarf tied around the hips. Laz men crafted excellent homemade rifles and even while at the plow were usually seen bristling with arms: rifle, pistol, powder horn, cartridge belts across the chest, a dagger at the hip, and a coil of rope for trussing captives.

=== Cuisine ===
Laz cuisine specialities include:
* ''[[Kuymak|Mıhlama]] ''– a filling corn meal, butter, and cheese fondue;
* ''[[Anchovy|Hamsi pilavı]] ''– spiced rice enclosed in fried Black Sea anchovies;
* ''[[Kuru fasulye]] – ''white beans in a tomato sauce;
* ''[[Börek|Laz böreği]] ''– a custard filled ''baklava ''like dessert;
* ''[[Pita|Karadeniz pidesi]] ''– an elongated and closed form of the popular pide dish.

=== Discrimination ===
[[File:Renamed place names in Turkey.png|thumb|302x302px|Percentage of geographical name changes in Turkey from 1916 onwards]] [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]], the leader of the early decades of the Republic, aimed to create a nation state ({{lang-tr|Ulus}}) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of [[Rize]] until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with ''Der Grosse Weltatlas'', a map published in [[Leipzig]]).

Cultural assimilation into the Turkish culture has been high, and Laz identity was oppressed during the days of Ottoman and Soviet Rule. One of the pivotal moments was in 1992, when the book ''Laz History'' (''Lazların tarihi'') was published. The authors had failed to have it published in 1964.&lt;ref name="90s" /&gt;

The '''Longuda''' are a West African ethnic group living in Adamawa and Gombe States in northeastern [[Nigeria]]. They are the only known matriarchal tribe in Nigeria. The Longuda consider [[matrilineal]] descent in many aspects of their [[social organisation]] more important than the [[patrilineal]] descent. [[Clan]] membership may even be counted on the mother line. This custom is not found with their other neighbors or in other tribes of [[Nigeria]]. 

The [[Longuda language]] is a branch of [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]].

== History and geography ==

The Longuda rulers default to the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] style. The seat of the traditional ruler is in [[Guyuk, Nigeria|Guyuk]], [[Adamawa State]]. According to oral tradition, the Longuda parted from the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] in [[Borno State]].

== Cuisine ==
[[File:Guineacorn.jpg|thumb|Guinea Corn (''[[Sorghum bicolor]]'')]]
Traditionally, the [[staple crop]] of the Longuda is Guinea Corn (''[[Sorghum bicolor]]''). This used to be grounded on stone hand mill and cooked into a thick paste, ''"tuwo"'', then eaten with vegetable soup. Today, however, [[rice]], [[maize]], and [[millet]] form part of the staple of the Longuda. Guinea Corn still remains the dominant crop grown by the Longuda.

== Marriage ==

The Longuda are primarily [[polygamous]]. The different dialects of the Longuda people perform [[marriage]] rites differently. Traditionally, a young man courting a woman invited his friends on the night he wished to take her as his bride, without her prior knowledge. The man and his friends would abduct the woman to his cottage, often a forceful act. Once the woman spent a night in his cottage, his family and hers considered them married. The [[bride price]] was usually paid afterwards. This [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]], which usually took place in the night, was not without resistance. The other young men in the woman's neighborhood would attempt to come to her rescue, and a free-for-all fight would ensue. The intending groom and his company usually had to win the duel in order to take the bride-to-be.

However, in recent times, the influence of [[Christianity]] and [[cultural assimilation]] of neighboring societies have altered this practice. A watered-down version of this is still widely used. In this case, a man asks a woman for her consent, the woman agrees, and on an arranged night, the groom's friends and bride's friends secretly picks her and her clothing up from her parents' house, goes over to spend the night in the groom's uncle's house, leaving behind a token at the position where they used to sit during courtship and that seals the union. Taking her clothes along with her is her indication to everyone that she has agreed to marry the man.

'''Maldivians''' ( ދިވެހިން, ''divehin''), also called '''Maldive Islanders''',&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/ |title=maldives-ethnography.com |publisher=maldives-ethnography.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a nation and [[ethnic group]] native to the historic region of the [[Maldive Islands]] comprising what is now the [[Maldives|Republic of Maldives]] and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union Territory of Lakshadweep]], India. All Maldivians share the same culture and speak the [[Maldivian language]] which is a member of the southern group of [[Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref name="Cain"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cain|first= B.D. |title= Dhivehi (Maldivian): A Synchronic and Diachronic Study (PhD dissertation)|publisher= Cornell University |year= 2000 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ethnographic and linguistic purposes as well as geo-political reasons, anthropologists divide the Maldivian people into 3 subgroups:&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt;
* '''The main group of Maldivians''', numbering more than 250,000. This is the group inhabiting the numerous atolls stretching from [[Haa Alif Atoll|Ihavandhippolhu]] (Haa Alif) to [[Haddhunmathi]] (Laamu) in [[Maldives]]. They constitute over 70% of the total population of all Maldivians. In a larger scale, the third group also comes under this group. From this group comes the standard dialect of Maldivian language which is spoken in the Maldives capital Male' along with the central atolls. Slightly differing variants which are very closely related to the former are spoken in rest of the islands from the far north of Maldives down to Laamu Atoll.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt;
* '''The southern group of Maldivians''', living in the three southernmost atolls of the equatorial zone ([[Huvadhu]], [[Fuvahmulah]] and [[Addu Atoll|Addu]] [[atoll]]s) in [[Maldives]]. This group numbers approximately 60,000 and constitute about 20% of the total population of all Maldivians. The earliest known settlements have been found in this region. According to researchers, this group of Maldivians have the closest proximity to the original Maldivian people in terms of linguistics as well as ethnicity.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt; Each of the 3 atolls of this region speak their own distinctive forms of the Maldivian language (''Huvadhu bas'', ''Mulaku bas'', ''Addu bas''), which are much different from the rest and as researchers suggest having a closer affinity to what may have been the original.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zu5GpDby9H0C&amp;pg=PA1799&amp;dq=suvadivians#v=onepage&amp;q=suvadivians&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the stateless nations. 4. S – Z – James Minahan – Google Books |isbn=9780313323843 |last1=Minahan |first1=James |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The people of Minicoy (Malikun) – Mahls''', numbering about 10,000. The island of Minicoy lies in the northern end of the atoll chain inhabited by Maldivians and is the northernmost group of the Maldivian people. They are only about 3% of the total amount of Maldivians. Although the people of Minicoy are identical to the main group of Maldivians from the first group in terms of ethnicity and linguistics and in a larger scale comes under that group, the day to day politics of [[Minicoy]] and after on the secession of the island from Maldivian rule and affiliating with the Indian government, thus acquiring a non-Maldivian citizenship has made this group to be labelled as one among the subgroups of Maldivians. Due to reasons such as politics, having to live in great isolation from the remaining Maldivian people, the Minicoians are steadily undergoing a process of acculturation. This group has its own dialect (called ''Maliku bas or Mahl'') which retains some features of an older Maldivian, and shows [[Malayalam]] influences as well. Still, the dialect is mutually intelligible with the standard Maldivian dialect and is more related to the slighter variants of northern Maldives from the first group.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt;

==Myths and legends==
{{cleanup|section|date=April 2010}}
There is no historical evidence about the origin of Maldivians; there is also no indication that there was any negrito or other aboriginal population, such as the Andamanese. No archaeology has been conducted to investigate the prehistory of the islands. There is, however, a [[Tamil–Malayalam languages|Tamil–Malayalam]] substratum, in addition to other later cultural influences in the islands.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bR0hIC0Xhb0C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=Giraavaru+people#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Countries and Territories of the World|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maloney"&gt;{{cite book |last= Maloney|first= C. |title= People of the Maldive Islands|publisher= Orient Longman Ltd, Madras |year= 1980 |isbn= 978-0-86131-158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bengali people|Bengali]], [[Odia people|Odia]] and [[Sinhalese people]] have had trading connections to Dhivehi people in the past.

Conjectures have been made by scholars who argue that the ancestors of Maldivian people arrived to the [[Maldives]] from [[Northwestern India|North West]] and [[West India]], from [[Kalibangan]] between 2500 and 1700 BC&lt;ref name="mathaaran"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they formed a distinct ethnic group around the 6th century BC.

===Myths of origin===
According to [[Maldivian folklore]] the main myths of origin are reflecting the dependence of the Maldivians on the [[coconut]] tree and the [[tuna]] fish.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Romero-Frias, (2012) ''Folk tales of the Maldives'', NIAS Press, {{ISBN|978-87-7694-104-8}}, {{ISBN|978-87-7694-105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A legend says that the first inhabitants of the Maldives died in great numbers, but a great sorcerer or ''fandita'' man made [[coconut tree]]s grow out of the skulls of the buried corpses of the first settlers. Therefore, the coconut tree is said to have an anthropomorphic origin according to Maldive lore for this reason. The word naashi (coconut shell) is also the word used for skull in Dhivehi language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The coconut tree occupies a central place in the present-day [[Emblem of Maldives|Maldive national emblem]].

The [[skipjack tuna|tuna fish]] is said to have been brought to the Maldivian waters by a mythical seafarer (''maalimi'') called Bodu Niyami Kalēfanu who went close to the Dagas (the [[Kalpavriksha|mythical tree]] at the end of the world) to bring this valuable fish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

====Legend of the first settlers====
One of the earliest people who settled in the Maldives were from the [[Malabar Coast]] of [[India]] and northwestern shores of [[Sri Lanka]], and are of [[Tamils]] and [[Malayali]]s ancestry
, which is clear through strong [[Tamil–Malayalam languages|Tamil–Malayalam]] substratum in language and culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Giraavaru people]] are considered as one of the earliest settlers.They were technologically advanced people, building sailing boats called dhonis.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F4Gv4NV0ry0C&amp;q=tamil+maldives&amp;dq=tamil+maldives|title=The Maldives|last=Ellis|first=Kirsten|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Passport Books|isbn=9780844296944|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These people used words such as ''varam'' for the islands in which they lived. Examples given in the old manuscript are: ''Noḷivaram'', ''Kuruhinnavaram'', and ''Girāvaram''.  Many of the old terms used by Maldivian fishermen come from the Dravidian languages, leading one to the assumption that these terms were brought by people from southern coastal India in ancient times. Historical records show that in the southern and central atolls of the Maldives, occupations such as farming and weaving were important in the early days.

A short time after the arrival of the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] and the introduction of the Hindu religion, a prince of India is said to have arrived in the Maldives. This is the period calculated earlier from oral tradition, and the story also corresponds to that from the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' chronicle of Sri Lanka, about the king's son who was exiled from his country and arrived in Lanka, one of his ships losing its way and arriving in the Maldives.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  In the Maldivian legend, the prince who arrived in the Maldives, was the son of ''Brahmaditiya'', king of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (Brahmadatta, King of Kalinga at the time of Buddha's death c. 500 – 350 BC), a kingdom on the south-east of India (modern Orissa). King Brahmaditiya was displeased with his son and sent him to Dheeva Maari (Maldives). The name of this prince was ''Sri Soorudasaruna''.
Sri Soorudasaruna established a kingdom of the Adeetha Vansha Dynasty (Solar Dynasty) in Dhiva Maari, a short period before the reign of [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka]] in India. This would place the establishment of the first kingdom in the Maldives circa the 4th century BC. The tradition then states that [[Ashoka|Emperor Ashoka]] established his kingdom in Pataliputra in India, and that his people went preaching the religion and teachings of Buddha to a place called [[Bairat]], to the west of Pataliputra. A group of people came to the Maldives from Bairat in order to teach the religion of Buddha. These people are said to have arrived in these islands during Ashoka's reign, probably when he sent Buddhist missionaries to all the neighbouring countries, in the 3rd century BC. At the time the Buddhist missionaries arrived in the Maldives, the country was called Dheeva Mahl. 
Around the 2nd century AD there was an  influx of Arab traders who travelled and stopped by at the Maldives en route to the Far East – their first record of the Maldives islands, which they called Mahal Dibiyat, is from the Arab travellers. Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells, an international currency of the early ages. The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority. It must have been an almost magical land at the time – forget money growing on trees, in the Maldives it was washed up on the shore! Mahal Dibiyat is the name given to the islands by medieval Arab travellers. 
Abu Al Barakat, a North African Arab, is credited with converting the Maldivians to Islam in 1153.

===Legend of the first ruling dynasty===
The myth of the origin of the ruling dynasty is the story of a prince named Koimala. In the Muslim traditions recorded in the ''Lōmāfānu'' and ''Rādavaḷi'' chronicles all the pre-Muslim royalty are represented by a king, whose successor was converted to Islam. The name Koimala Kalo is also suggestive: ''koi'' or ''koyi'' in [[Maldivian language]] means son, lad or prince (derived from [[Malayalam]] ''koya'', son, prince, master, cf. the Dravidian root ''kō'', king). The component ''malā'' may or may not be derived from ''māla'' as in Māla-dīv, but, if so, the name would mean 'prince of the Maldives'. The term ''kalō'' is a common word of man, used as a term of endearment. The title of former Maldivian kings was ''kattiri bovana mahaa radun'', 'Kattiri' (ކައްތިރި) meaning [[Kshatriya]] in [[Maldivian language]].

One oral tradition says that the [[Giraavaru people]] are the indigenous people of the Maldives who were in the islands before Koimala arrived.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They are of [[Tamils|Tamil]] origin, and the earliest island community of the Maldives; their presence predates Buddhism and the arrival of Indo-Aryans in the archipelago.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This may be the reason that the Dhivehi kinship system is partly of Dravidian origin, and bears evidence of some matriliny, like the [[Nair|Nayar]] and other matrilineal groups of [[Kerala]]. Some of the kinship terms are clearly derived from [[Malayalam]].

Five versions of the myth are given here and their significance in terms of culture history explained.&lt;ref name="Maloney" /&gt;

* 1. The following version was recorded by Bell in 1922:
Once upon a time, when the Maldives were still sparsely inhabited, a prince of royal birth named Koimala, who had married the daughter of the king of Ceylon, made a voyage with her in two vessels from Srendib [Sri Lanka] Island. Reaching the Maldives they were becalmed and rested a while at Rasgetheemu island in North Maalhosmadulu Atoll.

The Maldive Islanders, learning that the two chief visitors were of Ceylon Royal descent invited them to remain; and ultimately proclaimed Koimala their king at Rasgetheemu, the original 'King's Island'.

Subsequently, Koimala and his spouse migrated thence to Male' and settled there with the consent of the aborigines of Giraavaru Island, then the most important community of Male' Atoll.

The two ships were dispatched to Lanka, and brought over other people of 'the Lion Race' ([[Sinhalese people|Sinhalas]]).

To Koimala and his queen was born a male child who was called Kalaminja. He reigned as a Buddhist for twelve years, and was then converted to Islam, ruling for thirteen years more before finally departing for [[Mecca]].

This ruler's daughter married the chief minister and reigned as a nominal Sultana. She gave birth to a son also called Kalaminja, who, in turn, married a lady of the country.

From them the subsequent rulers of the Maldives were descended.

* 2. According to this version, which Maloney heard in Male', Koimala's parents came from India, not Sri Lanka: The Indian king was angry with his son, and sent him off with his wife in two boats; they had 700 soldiers. They came to Rasgetheemu in Raa Atoll, and when he became king there, people called that island Rasgetheemu "King's Landing". Then the king and queen came to Male', and Koimala was born from that Indian couple.
* 3. The following variant Maloney heard in Noon Atoll: "... When Koimala and his wife came, there were already people here. Because she was a princess of royal lineage, people asked her husband to rule. Koimala sent ships to Sri Lanka and brought back more people. It is said that a beautiful woman named Malakamana from the Maldives was one of the early people who settled Sri Lanka."
* 4. A myth Maloney heard in Manadhoo, Noon Atoll, is, in condensed form, as follows:
One day, while a hunter king of Sri Lanka was hunting, he caught a man-beast in his net. The man-beast couldn't walk, so the king taught him to do it. The man-beast then married the king's daughter, but he made political trouble in Sri Lanka, so was forced to leave. He and the princess arrived in Rasgetheemu and they lived there for some time, where the locals there asked them to rule them.

* 5. Another version Maloney heard in Hulhumeedhoo, Addu Atoll, in the far south of the country, is as follows:
There was a king of India who was a hunter. Once, while out hunting with a net, he saw a creature which is like a human, but which walked on all fours, and which disturbed the people. This creature would also take hunters' nets and steal their prey, so the king couldn't get any catch. The king considered how he might capture this creature. He made big weights for his net, which no ordinary human could lift, and which would prevent the creature from taking the hunting net. One day, the king, with the help of many men, put the net over the creature, which could not get out because of the large stone weights. The king took the creature to the palace and looked after him well, and because he knew no language, the king taught him language, which took a long time. The creature started helping the king by showing him treasures in the forest, and the king came to respect him.

The king had a daughter who fell in love with this creature (in an alternate version, the king forced his daughter to marry the creature). The king, being angry, put the couple on a ship and sent them off into exile. Their ship came to Laam (Hadummati) Atoll (towards the south), where the exiled pair saw a crow which cried. They thought the crow was not a good omen, and it was therefore undesirable to land there, so they went on to Male'. They settled in what is now Sultan Park (site of the former palace) and started a kingdom.

After fifteen years, a jinni began to come from the ocean every once a month and disturbed the people... (from here follows the story of the saint who came and dispelled the ''jinni'' and caused all the people to become converted to Islam from Buddhism and Hinduism).

====Gujaratis====
Maloney says Gujarat, with its indented coastline and its proximity to the old navigation routes of the Mesopotamian and Indus civilisations, has apparently maintained a tradition of navigation over the past 4000 years. Certainly the earliest Buddhist literature indicates active seafaring from its ports. It was from Gujarat that North Indian civilisation impinged upon the Maldives and Sri Lanka. From Gujarat, North Indian civilisation also expanded to Java and other parts of South-east Asia. The export of this civilisation to all coasts of South Asia and South-east Asia began about 500 B.C., but during the Mauryan period and the diffusion of Buddhism, sea traffic in the Bay of Bengal supplemented and, to some extent, surpassed that originating along the coasts of Western India. The long story of the cultural and economic expansion of North Indian civilisation by sea cannot be told here.

Three ''Jataka'' tales cited above seem to refer to the Maldives, particularly the comment that exiles from Bharukaccha went to a thousand islands [Laccadive and Maldive islands] where they found standing room, and that these were near an island named for coconuts [Kerala]. This suggests that not only did seafarers emanating from Bharukaccha and Suppara visit the Maldives, but Gujaratis actually settled there in pre-Buddhist times. The other Jataka tales suggest that ships from Gujarat going to South-east Asia stopped in the Maldives, and that merchants in search of treasures sailed in several seas called – maala (or maara).

The Maldives might well have been settled parallel with the arrival of Indo-Aryan speakers in Sri Lanka, as suggested in the above interpretations of the Sri Lanka myths and the Koimala story.

Mariners from the north-western coasts of the peninsula, from the time they commenced sailing to southern India, must have on occasion been blown over to the Maldives—unmanned canoes and rafts from Kerala even now get wafted there from time to time – and the dangers of shipwreck vividly described in several of the ''Jātakas'' might have arisen from contact with some of the thousands of reefs in the Maldives, which sailors have long dreaded. It may be, therefore, that shipwrecked Gujaratis, as well as exiles, were early settlers on the islands of the Laccadive-Maldives archipelago.

==Geographic distribution==

===Maldives===
All Maldivians are native to the historic region of the [[Maldive Islands]] comprising what is now the [[Republic of Maldives]] and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India. The secession of Minicoy from Maldivian rule and affiliating with the Indian government gradually led to the emergence of a Maldivian population of Indian citizenship who came to be known as Mahls.

According to figures 100% of the Maldivian population are ethnic Maldivians excluding the foreigners in the country. Being the heartland of Maldivian people, more than 97% of all Maldivians are from the Maldives. For all the Maldivian communities across the world (including the people of Minicoy) their origin lies in the Maldives. The Maldivian community of the Maldives consist of the two major groups from the three subgroups of Maldivians: The main group of Maldivians and the southern group of Maldivians (also known as Suvadivians) respectively.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt;

====Southern group of Maldivians====
As a result of some political activities which occurred in the South during the early 1960s, the term ''Suvadivian'' has been adopted by some authors to refer to the southern group of Maldivians. From 1959 to 1963 there was a short-lived breakaway government named [[United Suvadive Republic]] which was formed by the Southerners, from which the name originated though there are no such native names. The names Suvadive and Suvadivian suggest that the origin of the names lye in the ancient name for the three southernmost atolls of Huvadhu, Fuvahmulah and Addu which was Suvadiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maldivesculture.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=127&amp;Itemid=58 |title=Chapter 2 – Maldivians and their history |publisher=Maldives Culture |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suvadivians, living in the three southernmost atolls of the equatorial zone ([[Huvadhu]], [[Fuvahmulah]] and [[Addu Atoll|Addu]] atolls) number approximately 60,000 and constitute about 20% of the total population of Maldivians.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt; According to researchers, this group of Maldivians have the closest proximity to the original Maldivian people in terms of linguistics as well as on ethnic grounds. The reason behind this suggested by researchers and proven from historical records is that there were less interference from the outside world to this group. Unlike the other group of Maldivians, this group was not affected by the Portuguese rule in the Maldives as it does not exceed the Suvadiva channel. Also there were no interference from traders and travellers as much as in the case of the other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Each of the 3 atolls of the Suvadiva region speak their own distinctive forms of the [[Maldivian language]] (''Huvadhu bas'', ''Mulaku bas'' and ''Addu bas''), which are much different from the rest and as suggested by researchers, having a closer affinity to what may have been the original.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt; Thus, the native features of the original Maldivian people are preserved in this group greater than any other group of Maldivians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Main group of Maldivians====
Unlike the southern minority, this group of Maldivians were subject to foreign intercourse. There were numerous occasions of reported interference from outsiders such as traders, travellers, etc... Also, the Portuguese rule and many other factors pushed this group into a state that imported materials got mixed into their linguistics as well as ethnic background to a large extent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===India===
The secession of Minicoy from Maldivian rule and affiliating with the Indian government gradually led to the emergence of a Maldivian population holding Indian citizenship. This group of Maldivians consist of the people of Minicoy and migrant communities from Minicoy across India and elsewhere. Except for the people from Minicoy, there is no community of ethnic Maldivians with Indian citizenship. This group of Maldivians are officially referred as [[Mahls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O2n4sFGDEMYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=mahls+lakshadweep#v=onepage&amp;q=mahls%20lakshadweep&amp;f=false |title=Language in South Asia – Google Books |date=27 March 2008|isbn=9781139465502 |last1=Kachru |first1=Braj B. |last2=Kachru |first2=Yamuna |last3=Sridhar |first3=S. N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people locally identify themselves as ''Malikun''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KekpH3it1ssJ:lt-lt.facebook.com/topic.php%3Fuid%3D79485165421%26topic%3D14136+Maliku+India+aa+eku+othumun+Malikun+nah+maa+faidhaa+bodu&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=mv ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahls make up the third subgroup of Maldivians.

====People of Minicoy (Malikun) – Mahls====
{{Main|Mahls}}
''Mahls'' are the third subgroup of Maldivians centred in the island of [[Minicoy]] making up the only community of ethnic Maldivians in India. This group has its own dialect (called ''Maliku bas or Mahl'') which retains some features of archaic [[Maldivian language]], and shows Malayalam influences as well. Still, the dialect is mutually intelligible with the standard dialect of Maldivian and is more related to the slighter variants of northern Maldives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In case of linguistics and ethnic grounds, this group of Maldivians are identical to the main group of Maldivians in the Maldives. However, the secession of Minicoy from Maldivian rule and gradually becoming part of India, thus becoming the only group of ethnic Maldivians with a non-Maldivian citizenship made anthropologists to label the Mahls among the subgroups. The isolation of this group from the rest of the Maldivians and the acculturation process which the Mahls are undergoing as a result of this as well as the change in nationality is one of the reasons for separation of this group from the main group of Maldivians. The origin of this group like any other group of Maldivians lie in the Maldives. The story of the ''Tivarun'', the linguistics of the people in Minicoy and many other factors prove this side of the story.

Mahls are the only community of ethnic Maldivians (excluding migrant communities) outside the [[Republic of Maldives]]. They make up about 3% of the total population of all Maldivians.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt;

Most Mahls live in their native land of [[Minicoy|Maliku (Minicoy)]]. Mahls are 15.67% of the total population of Lakshadweep emerging as a separate ethnic group among the rest of the population. All Mahl communities in India emerged from Minicoy.

There are Mahl communities (migrant communities from Minicoy) in other parts of India too. A number of Mahls have settled in the districts of [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]], [[Malappuram]], [[Ernakulam]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram|Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum)]] in the southern state of [[Kerala]]. The ancestors of present Mahl communities in Kerala migrated from Minicoy and settled there in the 17th century, when the islands of [[Lakshadweep]] came under the rule of [[Ali Raja]]hs/Arakkal Bheevi of [[Kannur]].

Since 1957, this group of Maldivians in Minicoy are totally off-limits for their Maldivian counterparts in the Maldives. The direct transport between Minicoy and the Maldives was forbidden by the Indian government. Thus, this Indian group of Maldivians are steadily undergoing a process of acculturation owing to lack of contact with the remaining Maldivian people and pressure to use other languages such as Malayalam, English and Hindi. This proves to have a big influence upon the culture, linguistics and other day-to-day affairs of this group of Maldivians.&lt;ref name="maldives-ethnography.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/minicoy_holhification.shtml |title=Maldives Royal Family Official Website: MALIKU: THE FADING GLORY OF A LONELY QUEEN? |publisher=Maldivesroyalfamily.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigrant communities===
A significant number of Maldivian emigrant communities can be found in several countries. The emigrant communities could only be located from the Maldivian side as it is only the Maldivians who are all of the same ethnicity unlike India where the presence of thousands of cultures and ethnicities make the records more stringent on this matter. Since ethnic Maldivians of Minicoy are only no more than 0.0015% of the total population of India compared to 100% for their counterparts in the Maldives, it is only from the Maldivian embassies across the world that this information could be gathered.

====Sri Lanka====
{{Main|Maldivians in Sri Lanka}}
There are approximately 10,000 people of Maldivian ethnicity living in Sri Lanka, as of 2006.

In 1899, Professor John Stanley Gardiner visited Maldives, during which time; he collected anthropometrical data of a number of Maldivians from many islands. Analysis of this data by Dr. Wynfrid Duckworth, suggested that there were three major sources of immigration into the country. These are:
* The peninsula of Hindustan with Ceylon,
* The coast of Arabia and possibly of Africa,
* The western shores of the Malay Peninsula, and the islands of the Malaya  Archipelago.
(Duckworth 1912: 8–30).&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dhivehi Observer |url=http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/history/papers/First_Dhivehin_1708200612.htm |title=The First Dhivehin by Naseema Mohamed – Maldives :: Maldives News :: Dhivehi Observer :: Peoples Press  |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706080953/http://www.dhivehiobserver.com/history/papers/First_Dhivehin_1708200612.htm |archivedate=6 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a Maldivian NGO, Society for Health Education, conducted a study on the mutations of [[thalassaemia]] found in the Maldives. This study showed one mutation that probably originated in the [[Middle East]], another mutation which could have been derived from Portuguese or Algerians, and another which probably originated from [[South Asia]] and Malays. The observations are consistent with the historical records of Maldives, showing that early travellers from India, Indonesia, North Africa, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf areas, settled in the Maldives. (Firdous ''et al.'' 1998:148,149). Thalassaemia is the commonest genetically transmitted blood disease found in Maldives, and the results of this study suggest that many of the people now living in Maldives had ancestors who came from the above-mentioned countries.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

Anthropological studies as well as ethnographic and linguistic researches suggest that in terms of ancestry Maldivians share similar genes principally with the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalas]] of Sri Lanka as well as northern Indian populations, such as [[Marathis]], [[Konkanis]] and [[Gujaratis]] with traces of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]], southern Indian and North African genes in the population.&lt;ref name="Maloney"/&gt;

In 2013, genetic study about the Maldivian population by department of Human Genetics, Liden University, which was published online on the ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' has revealed very interesting facts about the genetic origin of Maldivian people.
The research studied autosomal DNA-, mitochondrial DNA-, and Y-chromosomal DNA markers in a representative sample of 141 unrelated Maldivians, with 119 from six major settlements. The researchers  found a total of 63 different mtDNA haplotypes that could be allocated to 29 [[mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup|mtDNA]]s, mostly within the [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M]], [[Haplogroup R (mtDNA)|R]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]] clades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maldives-ancestry.blogspot.com/2013/05/maldivian-ancestry-in-light-of-genetics.html|title=Ancestry of Maldivian Islanders in Light of Population Genetics: Maldivian Ancestry in light of Genetics|first=Rod|last=Mod|date=24 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found 66 different Y-STR haplotypes in 10 [[Y chromosome]] haplogroups, predominantly [[Haplogroup R1a1|R1a1]], [[Haplogroup R2a (Y-DNA)|R2]], [[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|L]] and [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2]].&lt;ref name="Pijpe"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeroen Pijpe, Alex de Voogt, Mannis van Oven, Peter Henneman, Kristiaan J. van der Gaag, Manfred Kayser &amp; Peter de Knijff |year=2013 |title=Indian Ocean crossroads: human genetic origin and population structure in the Maldives |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |volume=151 |issue=1 |pages=58–67 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22256 |pmid=23526367 |pmc=3652038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that their new genetic data agree with the commonly reported Maldivian ancestry in [[South Asia]], but furthermore suggest multiple, independent immigration events and asymmetrical migration of females and males across the archipelago.&lt;ref name="Pijpe"/&gt;

The genetic study confirmed that the most likely origin of the Maldivian population is in [[South Asia]] with possible gene flow from the [[Middle East]]. Also it has pointed out that the [[Maldivian language|Dhivehi]] language of the Maldives being the southernmost [[Indo-Aryan language|Indo-Aryan]] language, and sharing of specific haplogroups with [[Indo-Aryan language|Indo-Aryan]] populations mostly from [[India]] and from [[Sri Lanka]], could point to a common origin of these populations.&lt;ref name="Pijpe"/&gt;

==Culture==
===Language and literature===
Maldivians have strong feelings towards the [[Maldivian language]]. It has historically been, and to large extent still is, central to the Maldivian identity. Unlike the other languages of South India, it is an [[Indo-European language]], while other South Indian languages are Dravidian languages. However the language shows some influences of neighbouring [[Dravidian languages]] on it, and have a number of loanwords from Dravidian vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E28DDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Giraavaru+people#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dhivehi: The Language of the Maldives|last=Gnanadesikan|first=Amalia E.|date=2017-01-28|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9781614512349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The Maldivians are primarily [[Muslim]]s, adhering to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] school of thought.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/Maldives.html |title=Culture of Maldives – history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social |publisher=Everyculture.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Maldives which is the heartland of Maldivians and home for more than 97% of the Maldivian people, the national religion is [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="un.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.int/maldives/emble.htm#– |title=Maldives Mission to the United Nations |publisher=Un.int |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606135502/http://www.un.int/maldives/emble.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is the country's state religion as well as the backbone of the society with daily life in the country being regulated according to the tenets of Islam and government regulations too being based on the regulations of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (Shari'a).&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"/&gt; The law of the country prohibits the practice of any other religion by the country's citizens.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"/&gt; In general all Maldivians from the island of Minicoy too are [[Sunni Muslims]]. There may be a few Maldivians who do not follow Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south+asia-10644685 | work=BBC News | title=Maldives atheist who felt persecuted 'hangs himself' | date=15 July 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824005603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south+asia-10644685 | archivedate=24 August 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the public expression of such beliefs is virtually non-existent in Maldivian societies.

Even though most of the Maldivians are very religious, ancient beliefs survived until recently: for example, the islanders feared [[jinn]]is (evil spirits) which were believed to come from the sea, land and sky. These were blamed for everything that cannot be explained by religion or science. Today, these kind of beliefs are on the verge of vanishing completely from Maldivian communities and can only be observed rarely.

===Visual art and architecture===

Most traditional Maldivian art is influenced by Perso-Arabic tradition in some form and usually centres on Islam, since almost all the Maldivians are Muslims. The skill of visual art and architecture among the Maldivians is centered in the Maldives since the people of Minicoy are mainly sailors.

Various fine art practices exist in the Maldives at present. Primary among them is drawing and painting. Sculpture and crafts that overlap with art making also exist in the country. However, due to various limitations, they have not flourished as art forms. Painting and drawing also exist in similar circumstances. Lack of avenues in which to exhibit, and lack of arts education and training, combined with a growing understanding that these arts are best served in the tourist souvenir trade, has hampered a healthy development of these arts.
However, with the establishment of private galleries and with various exhibitions organized by the government and the artists themselves, in the last 15 years, the awareness that painting can be an expressive art form apart from also being a lucrative commercial activity has provided encouragement for several young Maldivians to pursue painting, and to an extent sculpture and other public and commercial art forms. Renewed interest in these arts have also led to various individuals to pursue on their own whatever education they can obtain, whether through distance learning courses from foreign universities, or via books and magazines. In addition, privately funded students have also been obtaining arts education and training at undergraduate and graduate levels in international universities.
More indirectly, artists also get the opportunity to meet foreign artists through the tourism trade when foreign artists visit the country as tourists. This provides the much needed contact with artists that is so necessary to the development of any art form.
Until recently, fine arts in the Maldives have been usually defined as the various crafts and skills of craft making. These include the use of locally found materials to produce decorative and functional objects such as mats, hand held or displayed objects, etc. The present situation of the arts has come about because of a lack of critical and theoretical interpretation and a lack of dialogue and discourse in an organized, sustained or documented form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artgallery.gov.mv/exhibitions/15/ |title=Text from the catalog 'Maldives Contemporary 2005', published by the National Art Gallery, Maldives |publisher=Artgallery.gov.mv |date=19 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts===
The traditional Maldivian performing arts have Indian and even African roots.

===Martial arts===
Martial arts among Maldivians are known as ''hevikamuge kulhivaruthak'', while ''gulhamathi hifun'' is traditional wrestling among Maldivians.

===Festivals===
Most of the Maldivian festivals are related to Islam, however there are some festivals which belongs to old Maldivian traditions, like kite flying festival. Naming a newborn child, ''Mauloodhu'' (a prayer accompanied with festive meal), Eid festival and circumcision of male child are few events that take place where the taste of rich cultural 'cocktail' can be experienced.

A traditional meal called ''Keyn'' is prepared for the above ''Mauloodhus'' consisting of a number of courses. A single Keyn would serve 10 – 12 people and includes rice, curries, salads, grilled fish, coconut cream, coconut syrup, bananas, puddings and other delights.

Keyn is set out in a very large wooden dish called a ''Malaafaiy''. The outside of this dish is placed within the dish and small individual plates are filled with curries, salads, and other items and set around the rice. This would be covered with the lid and wrapped in a white cloth and tied at the top. At the meal times this would be carried into the ''Mauloodh Haruge'' (dining hall specially made for this event) and placed on straw mats for service. Individual plates and other food items in individual dishes are placed as well. Beverages are individually set in glasses. Water is served in a ceramic jug. Food is consumed using the fingers of the right hand. At the end of the meal hand is washed using a copper jug into a copper basin. 10 December is marked as ''Kandu Rōdi duvas'' and 14 April as ''Gamu Rōdi duvas'' on which date Maldivian language day is marked from 2011 onwards.

===Dress===
Traditionally Maldivian men wear a Mundu with a shirt, it is very similar to that of [[Malayali]] people. Maldivian women wear a red-top called a Libaas and a long black skirt.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Maldivian cuisine}}

Rice, the major staple food in most Maldivian households, is usually cooked and served with ''Garudiya'' (Tuna Fish soup). Here are some of the speciality cuisines.

'''''Bocholhi'''''

Made of rice flour, coconut – semi-firm (grated) and coconut palm syrup by mixing all the ingredients until freed from lump and cooked over a moderate heat until the mixture is thickened.

'''''Godhan Furhu Boa Folhi'''''

Made of flour, coconut – semi-hard (blended to a smooth paste), eggs, coconut cream, jasmine water, coconut palm syrup, cinnamon powder, cardamom powder and oil by mixing all the ingredients apart from the oil together. Cooked over a moderate heat and once the top of the pancake dries up, turned over and cooked.

'''''Han’dulu Aurus'''''

Made of rice (soaked overnight), washed and blended to a smooth paste), coconut palm syrup, Jasmine water and jasmine flowers by placing all the ingredients apart from the flowers in a thick-bottomed pan and cooked over a moderate heat by stirring constantly to avoid the mixture getting stuck to the bottom. Wrapped entirely with banana leaf and placed jasmine flowers over the sweets. This sweet will keep for two to three months without spoiling.

'
'''''Han’dulu Furhu Kubus'''''

Made of Patna Rice (soaked overnight, washed and blended to a smooth paste), coconut – semi-firm (grated), coconut palm syrup, caster sugar, banana leaf by cooking over a moderate heat the grated coconut, palm sugar and caster sugar until the mixture has thickened. Removed from heat and allowed cooling and added in the blended rice and kneaded thoroughly and combined all the ingredients well. Divided the mixture into eight portions and placed each portion on a banana leaf and wrapped entirely to seal and wrapped a second banana leaf around it and secured well.

Dug a suitable hole in the ground in which all the wrapped dough pieces could be placed neatly. Placed coconut fibres and coconut shells and burned them in the dug hole and removed the charcoals.

Placed banana leaves within the hole and placed the wrapped dough in the heated hole and placed neatly one against another.

Covered the dough parcels placed in the hole with another large piece of banana leaf and covered the leaf with two-inch white sand. Placed the charcoals and coconut fibres and coconut shells over it and burned the coconut fibres and shells for half an hour.

Left the cooked kubus parcels overnight in the hole. In the morning scraped off the burnt ashes and charcoals aside and the sand covering the banana leaf and slowly lifted the wrapped kubus parcels.

'''''Hukkaru'''''

Made of coconut palm syrup by boiling the syrup over a moderate heat and cooked by stirring continuously until it starts to thicken. Removed from heat and whisked until frothy and cooled.

[[File:MalikuBonda.jpg|thumb|[[Minicoy|Maliku]] Bonda (Bondi)]]
'''''Huni Folhi'''''

Made of Patna Rice flour, coconut – semi-hard (grated), coconut palm syrup by cooking all the ingredients over a moderate heat in a thick-bottomed pan stirring continuously.

When the mixture starts to come loose from the side of the pan removed from heat and taken a tablespoonful of the cooked mixture, spread on a cork wood leaf. Smoked and dried the leaves spread with the sweet over the fireplace.

'''''Karukuri Banbukeyo'''''

Made of fried bread fruit (crushed coarsely), coconut palm syrup, jasmine water by bringing the syrup and the jasmine water to boil and cooked it over a moderate heat until it comes to ribbon stage. Added in the crushed breadfruit into the sugar and coated well. Removed from heat, allowed cooling and kept in an airtight container.

'''''Karukuri Ala'''''

Made of fried taro (crushed coarsely), coconut palm syrup and jasmine water by boiling the syrup and the jasmine water and cooked it over a moderate heat until it comes to ribbon stage. Added in the crushed taro in to the sugar and coated well. Removed from heat, allowed cooling and kept in an airtight container.

'''''Kulhi Bis Fathafolhi'''''

Made of Patna Rice flour, coconut (grated), Rihaakuru, Rihaakuru Bondi (blended), eggs, onion (sliced thinly), curry leaves (chopped), cherry pepper, juice of two limes, ginger, salt to season and oil by crushing the onion, curry leaves, cherry pepper, ginger with salt. Added and mixed the rice flour and coconut to make sandy texture. Formed a bay in the center of the rice mixture and add in the eggs and Rihaakuru and Rihaakuru Bondi. Mixed/kneaded the dough and divided the dough into 15&amp;nbsp;gram balls. Spread each ball to about ¼ inch thickness. Cut using a round cutter of 3 – inch diameter and pre-heated oil.

'''''Meeraa'''''

Made of coconut sap (collected at noon) by boiling the sap over a moderate heat and cooked by stirring continuously until it comes to ribbon stage. Removed from heat, greased a large tray and taken a spoonful of the cooked thickened syrup and placed it over the greased sheet in strings.

'''''Thela Kubus'''''

Made of Patna Rice flour, coconut palm syrup, eggs and coconut oil by whisking the egg and the syrup and added in the rice flour and beaten further. Poured a table spoonful of the mixture into the oil and deep-fried until golden.

'''''Thelli Keyo'''''

Made of plantain (peeled and cut length-wise) and oil by frying the bananas until crisped. Drained on absorbent kitchen paper and kept airtight container.

'''''Veli Hakuru'''''

Made of coconut palm syrup by boiling the syrup over a moderate heat and cooked by stirring continuously until it starts to crystallise. Removed from heat, allowed cooling and put into jars and seal well.

===Maldivian names===
A generation ago, most Maldivian people were not commonly known by their birth names. Instead they were called by an alternative name such as Dohuttu, Lahuttu, Tutteedi, Kudamaniku, or Don Goma. The rationale behind this practice was that if the evil spirits did not know one's real name, one would be free from their spells.&lt;ref name="Maldives Royal Family"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/maldives_name.shtml
 | title = Maldive Names
 | publisher = Maldives Royal Family
 | accessdate = 2009-12-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However ancient Maldivian naming system is similar to that of Gujaratis and Marathas. Even now some people follow that system. For example, the first name of historian Mohamed Ibrahim Lutfy is "Mohamed;" "Ibrahim" is his father's name, and "Lutfy" is the family name.

Frequent Maldivian family names include Bee, Beefan, Boo, Didi, Fan, Fulhu, Kader, Kalaminja, Kalinga, Kalo, Kavah, Kavya, Koi, Koya, Manik, Manika, Manike, Manikfan, Naha, Raha, Rana, Tarkan, Thakhan, Thakur, Thakurfan, Veer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=1|title=The President's Office - Home|website=www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22664">The instance that marked the shift in the whole of [[Arabic literature]] can be attributed to the contact that took place between the Arab World and the West during the 19th and early 20th century. This contact resulted with the gradual replacement of Classical Arabic forms with the Western ones, as exemplified in plays, novels, and short stories. Although the exact date in which this reformation occurred is not known, the process is usually referred to as the Arabic ''[[Al-Nahda|nahda]]'' (revival or renaissance)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Arabic Literature|last=Starkey|first=Paul|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=UK|pages=23, 25, 42, 46, 68|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development that Arabic Literature witnessed by the end of the 19th century was not merely in the form of reformation; both Germanos Farhat (1732) and al-Allusi in [[Iraq]] had previously attempted to inflict some development on literature in the 18th century. On the other hand, '''modern Arabic literature''' fully appeared through the interdependence between two important movements: the revival of the classical Arabic tradition and the translation of foreign literature. Advocates of the former movement began their work at the onset of the 19th century to resist the decline Arabic literature and its styles were facing. High quality traditional literary models were thus disseminated and imitated to create new literary models. Meanwhile, proponents of the translation movement, included authors such as [[Ibrahim al-Yaziji]] (1871) from the Levant, [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]] (1893) from Egypt, and [[Shukri al-Alusi|Mahmoud Shukri al-Alusi]] (1923) from Iraq. Both Mubarak and al-Yaziji wrote the [[Maqama]]t (lengthy literary works of rhymed prose) "Alam Eddin" and "Majma' al-Bahrain" [Where Two Seas Meet] respectively, while al-Alusi wrote "Balaghat al-Arab" [The Eloquence of Arabs]. Other factors including journalism and the literature of the diaspora helped in the shaping and development of the Arabic literature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al-Mauso'a al-Arabiya al-Muyassarah [Simplified Arabic Encyclopedia]|last=Ghirbal|first=Mohammed|publisher=Franklin Institution for Publishing|year=1965|isbn=|location=Egypt|pages=161–167|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation activities  ==
The translation movement began on the hands of [[Egypt|Egypt's]] Governor [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] while forming his army. He fostered the movement by importing the first printer in 1828 A.D. to Egypt (the second printer was brought later to [[Syria]]). Among the most prominent translators during that time was [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi|Rif'a Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]], who translated many scientific books for the army's use. Al-Tahtawi's influence is mostly recognized, however, in his "Talkhis al-Ibriz" or 'Paris's Profile',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/mlac/arabic/staff/display/?id=2769|title=An Imam in Paris: Al-Tahtawi's Visit to France (1826–31)|last=Newman|first=Daniel|publisher=Saqi Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-86356-346-1|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he documented his visit to Paris. This book, written in a rather modern style, is an account of the political and social conditions in France during that time. Al-Tahtawi was also the translator of the first literary novel into Arabic '[[Les Aventures de Télémaque|Tilimak]]' by French writer [[François Fénelon|Fenelon]]. However, the mark al-Tahtawi left on the literary reformation was witnessed later via his different contributions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Most of the early novels to have been translated into Arabic were of French works. Famous works including [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo|Le Comte de Monte Cristo]]'', [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Five Weeks in a Balloon|Cinq Semaines en Ballon]], and many others from different genres, were readily translated and Arabized, and found a large readership through their circulation in journals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Modern Arabic Literature|last=Badawi|first=Muhammad Mustafa|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=91–93, 248|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools that were established in Beirut and Tunisia for authorship and translation affected, and were in turn influenced by, the direct impact of missionaries in Lebanon. These missionaries were led by [[Butrus al-Bustani]] (1883), [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq|Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq]] (1887), [[Ibrahim al-Yaziji]] (1906), and, from Tunisia, [[Mohamed Bayram II|Mohamed Bayram]] (1889). All of these missionaries helped in the establishment of Arabic journalism, which was the main force (second to the revival of traditional Arabic literature and the translation movement) in initiating the new literary movement. In Egypt, journalism, first aided by intellectuals from the [[Levant]], and later becoming a genuine Egyptian force, was considered the pivotal ingredient that polished new literary styles and helped in the dissemination of ideas and opinions. It was the natural and organic atmosphere for the development of modern Arabic literature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Journalism ===

In the final thirty years of the 19th century, the growth of journalism helped in the emergence of notable figures in literature. It also created a comprehensive image of the stages of the development of the literary prose genres-excluding poetry- until the [[World War I|First World War.]] On the pages of the newspapers and journals came the powerful classical prose of [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1905), and the nationalist-laden expressive prose of [[Saad Zaghloul]] in [[al-Waqa'i' al-Masriyya]] [Egyptian Affairs] newspaper. We also saw Muhammad al-Muwailihi's rhythmic prose (1930), [[Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti|al-Manfaluti']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s sweet romantic prose (1924), as well as the works of [[Jurji Zaydan]] (1914), Yagob Sarrof (1927), and [[Qasim Amin]] (1908) that relied on uniform ideas and lucid expressions to perform social-educational purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As for romantic valor ([[Hamasah]]), such as the works of [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] (1908) and Wali Eddin Yakun (1921), it first appeared in journals. Other forms of literary genres such as sardonic narratives mixed with colloquialisms, as in the works of [[Yaqub Sanu]] (1912) and Abdullah al-Nadim (1896), gained their socio-literary power from appearing in journals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===

From the American diaspora emerged the new Pen League of authors like [[Kahlil Gibran|Gibran]] (1931) and [[Ameen Rihani|al-Rihani]] (1940). The works produced by members of this league quickly spread through the Middle East, as new currents in modern Arabic prose took shape.  Gibran, for instance, not only published works in both Arabic and English, but attempted to self-translate some of his works, such as his collection entitled Sand and Foam (1926).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le Gassick|first=Trevor|year=1970|title=Modern Arabic Prose Literature: An Introduction|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED044689|journal=Michigan Univ. , Ann Arbor|volume=|pages=116|via=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation movement also revived on the hands of the literary figures of the league. Although the Pen's translation did not directly affect the development of modern literature (unlike the translations of al-Manfaluti and Othman Jalal); translation, as that undertaken during [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] and [[Al-Jahiz|al-Jahiz's]] time, did, nevertheless, help in finding the true literary essence in both Arabic and foreign literature. Without translation, regardless of its quality, modern Arabic literature would not have reached different horizons.

Translation also influenced the Arabic repertoire of imageries and ideas. Most importantly, it introduced new literary genres, such as novels, plays, short stories, articles, etc. The first effect of translation was in the adaptations of foreign plays. It began with Maroun al-Naqqash's (1855) adaptation of [[Moliere]], and Najib Haddad's (1866) translations of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. However, the most successful attempts in the adaptations of foreign dramas were on  the hands of  Muhammad Othman Jalal (1898), who adapted from Molière, and Arabized the novel "[[Paul et Virginie|Paul and Virginie]]" . Despite all these efforts, the play, as a distinct literary genre, did not reach its full popularity until the 20th Century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== New Literary Genres ==

=== Novels ===
Arabic literature was not entirely lacking of narrative prose. There existed many lengthy works of literature such as '[[Kitab al-Aghani]]' [The Book of Songs] by [[al-Isfahani]], 'Qisas al-anbiya'a' [The Stories of Prophets] by [[al-Tha'alibi]], as well as the eloquent [[maqama]]. This latter work, characterized by its embellishing rhythmic prose style, is thought to be the invention of [[Badi' al-Zaman al-Hamadani|al-Hamadani]]'s (1008).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The realization of the novel underwent extensive efforts to reach its full, complete form. The first attempts in writing novels were on the hands of [[Jurji Zaydan]] in his historical novel 'Sukot' [Silence], and [[Farah Antun]]'s (1922) experimentation in the analytical novel. Other writers benefited from the foreign repertoire in discussing social and political matters. Non-fiction Arabic books were hence written to reflect new current concerns as well as the authors' thoughts and convictions. This is clearly present  in the writings of [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi|al-Kawakibi]] (1093) in 'Taba'i al-Istibdad wa-Masari' al-Isti'bad' (The Nature of Despotism) and 'Umm al-Qura', as well as [[Qasim Amin]]'s 'Tahrir al-Mar'a' [The Liberation of the Woman]. Authors like [[Aisha Taymur]] (1902) and [[Malak Hifni Nasif]] (1918) were also inspired by the foreign cultures but maintained-along with Qasim Amin- an Islamic and didactic spirit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Poetry, on the other hand, was not affected by foreign models until First World War, and remained in its ridged form that was prevalent since the age of decadence. Nonetheless, poetry was slightly affected by some of the nationalistic issues and debates taking place across the Arab World. Famous poets of the period included [[Mahmoud Samy El Baroudy|Samy el-Baroudy]] (1904), [[Ahmed Shawqi]] (1932), and [[Hafez Ibrahim]] (1932) from Egypt. These poets differed in their styles, sense of solidarity, and the degree of involvement in nationalist events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, their names are usually associated with the rise of the neo-classical movement in poetry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Ibrahim al-Mazini]] (1949) was probably among the most prominent authors who employed his style in the production of new literary themes, when he wrote his successful social novel "Ibrahim al-Kateb" [Ibrahim the Writer], which was  essentially a description of current social norms. Since then, the novel flourished through the contributions of many authors like: [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] in 'Awdat erroh' [The return of the Spirit]  (1933),  followed by [[Abbās al-Aqqād|al-Aqqad]]'s "Sara" (1933), Taymour's 'Nida'a al-Majhoul' [The Call of the Unknown] (1939), while [[Muhammad Farid Abu Hadid|Farid Abu Hadid]] wrote the all-Arabic novel 'Ibnat al-Muluk' [The Daughter of Kings]. The success this novel attained later supported Zaydan in his own endeavors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As for the psycho-analytical novel, it was introduced by [[Taha Hussein]] for the first time in his autobiographical novel 'Al-Ayyam' [the Days] (1926). This novel was one of the greatest works of modern Arabic literature with its themes, style and depiction of life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Social themes ===
Social themes along with reformations in the field of poetry were not greatly affected despite the attempts some poets such as [[Khalil Mutran]] to inflict some changes on the genre. Other attempts were made by [[Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi|al-Zahawi]] (1936) and [[Maarouf Al Rasafi|al-Rasafi]] (1954) in Iraq, though with little or no implications. This can be due to the fact that poetry in Iraq did not suffer the same decline as it did in Egypt and the Levant, which were under unstable political circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the war, modern Arabic literature changed dramatically. Topics such as modernity and social change, and people's interests and doubts, all became the center of the new themes of literature. The first to have undertaken this change are the disciples of [[Muhammad Abduh|Mohammad Abduh]], who were advocates of liberated and innovative thought. These students eventually governed 'al-Jaridah' [The Newspaper] and 'al-Siyasah [The Politics], two newspapers which were jointly edited by Lutfy Asyyed and [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]]. These newspapers also proliferated the new literary genres of novels, stories, articles and plays. One of the first successful realizations of these genres was Haykal's novel 'Zaynab' (1914) which demonstrated the difficulty of wielding Arabic rhetoric in writing the social novel. Mohammad Taymour (1921) tried to overcome these difficulties with his novel 'Ma taraho al-Oyon' [What the eyes see], a task that was supported by his brother's (Mahmoud Taymour) efforts. Many others including Issa Obeid, Shahata Obeid, and Taher Lasheen contributed to the novel, yet were never able to reach the elevated stylistic and linguistic abilities of the Taymour brothers in their portrayal of a realistic and vivid life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Short stories and articles  ===
Authors in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the American Diaspora all tired their hands out in writing  many short stories. However, it was the article, of all genres, that had undergone profound development and change. The reason for that is due to the rise of and the attention journals and newspapers received since the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|1919 revolution]]. The articles changed in style and form and were tailored towards discussing various topics, including social and political issues, literature, religion, etc. It eventually reached the elevated level of its foreign counterpart. Among the important topics discussed in articles were the reformation of the Arabic culture and its comparison with foreign traditions and civilizations, including Latin and Greek traditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As for the writers of the 'article', they included [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Abbās al-Aqqād|al-Aqqad]], advocates of innovation of style; the conservative [[Rashid Rida]] (1935) who wrote for al-Manar Magazine; as well as Farid Wajdi and [[Mostafa Saadeq Al-Rafe'ie|Mostafa Saadeq al-Rafe'ie]] (1937). From Syria, there was [[Muhammad Kurd Ali]] (1952), and from Lebanon and the Diaspora we had [[Mikha'il Na'ima]] (1889). Whether they were supporters of innovative or traditional styles, these authors played an important role in reforming old and new notions of both extreme ends; they founded a balance between the two directions after an extensive filtration of ideas and opinions. In addition, these authors influenced the following current of thought which promoted scientific reasoning in the process of writing the article. Later on, social criticism, which had already become an active element in the article, found its place in the novel. For example, this could be seen clearly in the novels of [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]], Husayn Fawzi's 'The Modern Sindibad", as well as in the works of [[Naguib Mahfouz]], Hassan Kamil, and many more. Subsequent to that, the novel took a turn in realism, disregarded style, and promoted many political currents, particularly after the [[World War II|Second world War]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Plays ===
As is the case with other literary genres, the first accounts of plays during that period were in the form of translations and adaptations of Western works. Gradually, however, the stage, particularly in Egypt, reached its full potency as Egyptian dramatist began writing plays that reflected the current socio-political situation of the country and its people. A major theme that was recurrent in most of the plays was the West-East struggle; an issue that seemed to have both coincided and aggravated the search for an Egyptian national identity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The shift towards realism that took place in writing the novel extended to the play. Dramatic plays, particularly in Egypt, flourished immensely, and subsequently dominated the rest of the Arab world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that reals, Mahmoud Taymour was the first to experiment with the social realist play, but it did not reach its full potency except on the hands of [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]], who mastered motifs and mental representations, utilized Pharaonic, Islamic, and Western myths, and wrote remarkable cognitive plays such as 'Ahl al-Kahf' [the People of the Cave], and 'Scheherazade'. He also wrote social plays including  'al-Sultan al-Ha'er' [the Bewildered Sultan]. [[Ahmed Shawqi|Shawqi]]'s contributions to the poetic theater, taken up later by [[Aziz Abaza]], are noticeable for their dealing with historical and classical themes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The employment of colloquial Arabic within the dialogues of the plays was a central issue in studying Arab litterateurs and their motives behind such act. The issue, however, was not as prominent in novels and stories as it was in plays. Nevertheless, al-Hakim and Taymour both tried to utilize colloquialisms in dialogues in both novels and stories, yet their success did not stop the debate that had risen as a result. In fact, it led Taymour to refrain from using colloquialisms in his writings, and he rewrote his previous works by replacing any colloquialisms with Modern Standard Arabic. Despite many efforts to create a distinct colloquial literature, particularly in Lebanon, all attempts failed. Reaching a necessary compromise between the two was done by simplifying the Standard form and elevating the status of the colloquial. However, judgments of this issue and its implications are yet to be explored, although some argue that the use of colloquialism in  Arabic drama is a direct result from the interaction with the Western forms of literary production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Both the spread of education and of Standard Arabic offered solutions for the instability the Arabic status was facing. Some of these solutions were due to the journal article as it created a new form of prose, characterized by precision and an ability to portray reality in a way that surpassed eloquent prose, where meaning in the latter is not definite, and gives the sense of the older era of Arabia. Through this new variety of language, the modern author was now able to find in the Standard form of Arabic many specific expressions that allowed him to portray reality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Poetry ===
Poetry made way for prose, particularly after the war. While the influence of Western literature accelerated the production of innovative literary prose in Arabic, poetry was slower in liberating itself from classical poetic forms and creating new rhythms and melodic moods. As classical Arabic poetry held an important position in the literary heritage of the Arabs, it is not surprising that the first attempts in renewing the poetic forms would be by a re-employment of these traditional forms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Insofar as [[Suleyman al-Boustani]]'s (1925) attempt in introducing new forms by a rather mediocre translation of the Iliad into Arabic, the role it played was weaker than to be mentioned in the movement towards reformation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Nationalist poetry was an important element in the progression of modern verse, whose doyen is Tunisian poet [[Aboul-Qacem Echebbi]] (1934). Echebbi succeeded in using traditional models and imageries to present new and powerful reflections of the current time. Others tried to create psychological effects by playing with rhymes and old structures. Gradually, classical poetic forms were replaced by newer forms. The guiding force behind that change is due to literary schools of thought such as al-Diwan Group, led mainly by poets [[Abbās al-Aqqād|al-Aqqad]], [[Ibrahim al-Mazini|al-Mazini]], and [[Abdel Rahman Shokry]] (influenced by neo-romanticism); School of Northern Diaspora, known as the Pen League, that include [[Elia Abu Madi]]; and the School of Southern Diaspora, known as the Andalusian League, that included Rashid Salim al-Khoury and Fawzi Ma'louf. Members of all these schools called for a change in the poetic production. They also advocated liberating poetry from classical forms, as well as a call for sincerity of emotions, self-inspiration, and portrayal of direct feelings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The result of these efforts was a powerful Romantic poetry ([[Ghazal]]). The pioneers of this type of poetry were the members of the Apollo Group. Led by [[Ahmed Zaki Abu Shadi]] (1955), and competing against the New School of [[Khalil Mutran|Mutran]] in Egypt, and Abu Shabaka's in Lebanon, the Diwan Poets, and the Leagues, the Apollo Group was more liberated and largely influenced by Western [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Apollo Group's contributions to the new, unrestricted forms of poetry is largely manifested in the periodical '''Apollo''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', a magazine that fostered and proliferated both traditional and innovative styles of poetry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While al-Aqqad and other poets in Iraq remained faithful to classical forms of poetry, others, including poet [[Abdel Rahman Shokry]], the Northern Diaspora School, and the Apollo Group, all diverted greatly from these traditional forms. In fact, the argument that existed between the proponents of Classical poetry who favored the single-rhyme and meter poem, and those advocated the free verse poem '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''shi'r hurr''' remains till this day. A few years later, the prose poem appeared in the 1970s. Writers of this hybrid form were [[Ameen Rihani|Ameen al-Rihani]], Onsy Al-Hajj, and Shawqi Abi Shaqra (Lebanon), Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, Tawfiq Al-Sayegh, Ezz Eddin al-Munasira (Palestine), [[Muhammad al-Maghut]] (Syria), [[Sargon Boulus]], Fadil Al-Azzawi, Mu'ayyid al-Rawi (Iraq). Al-Rawi is notably recognized for liberating poetry from rhythm and metre, and replacing that with inner music, while maintaining the original imageries, creating in this way a new genre in Arabic poetry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">The '''Moyale clashes''' were a series of [[ethnic violence|ethnic clashes]] between [[Borana Oromo people|Borana]] and [[Garre]] communities in July 2012 in the area of [[Moyale]], Ethiopia, on the border with Kenya. The fighting appeared to be caused by a long-standing dispute over land possession,&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; exacerbated by recent drought conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/07/201272815020266178.html |title=Many killed in Ethiopia ethnic clashes |date=28 July 2012  |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clashes began around 25 July and continued for the next three days. Armed militias reportedly took positions in villages, at which point the fighting spread into Moyale itself.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Businesses were shut in Moyale on both sides of the border, and homes in the villages of Chamuki and Shawabarre were reported to have been burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000062792&amp;story_title=12-killed-as-communities-clash-at-border |title=12 killed as communities clash at border |author=Liban Golicha |date=28 July 2012 |publisher=Homex Kenya |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July, the [[United Nations]] reported that at least twenty people had been killed in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opride.com/oromsis/news/horn-of-africa/3597-ambush-in-ethiopia-s-moyale-town-leaves-scores-dead |title=Ambush in Ethiopia's Moyale town leaves scores dead |date=27 July 2012 |publisher=OPride.com |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July, the [[Kenya Red Cross Society]] (KRCS) announced that more than 20,000 people had fled into Kenya to escape the fighting. Because of lack of shelter on the Kenyan side of the border, many were sleeping in the open or under tarpaulins provided by the organization.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19028609 |title=Ethiopia: 20,000 flee Moyale clashes - Red Cross |date=28 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July, the Ethiopian government stated that the police had made arrests and the situation was "under control". However, as of that date, the displaced people remained on the Kenyan side of the border, causing the KRCS to issue an urgent plea for humanitarian assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/07/201273075846287757.html |title=Ethiopia erupts in deadly ethnic violence |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is no doubt that had he succeeded in his attempt to enter Syria he would have joined IS and that he would have fought for them. He eventually admitted that this had been his plan and he admitted that he wanted to fight in what he believes is a holy war against the western oppressors. He is described by his mother as "meek, mild and easily influenced", but following his conversion he grew increasingly distant from his immediate family. He started to watch IS videos and listening to lectures about jihad."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">'''Paul William Hampel''' is the fictitious name of a man accused by the [[Canadian government]] of being a [[Russia]]n [[spy]] masquerading as a Canadian citizen. He was arrested on November 14, 2006 at [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]] at about 6 p.m. just prior to boarding a plane departing Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061116/montreal_arrest_061116/20061116?hub=CTVNewsAt11 |title=CTV News &amp;#124; Top Stories - Breaking News - Top News Headlines |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201224652/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061116/montreal_arrest_061116/20061116%3Fhub%3DCTVNewsAt11 |archivedate=2006-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was arrested, he had in his possession a fraudulent [[Ontario]] birth certificate, [[C$]]7,800 in five currencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/cdn-spies.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710153349/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/cdn-spies.html |date=July 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a shortwave radio, index cards with detailed notes about [[History of Canada|Canadian history]], two digital cameras, three cell phones and five cell phone sim cards, some of them password-protected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/04/america/NA_GEN_Canada_Espionage_Arrest.php ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was detained under a [[security certificate]], signed by Public Safety Minister [[Stockwell Day]] and Immigration Minister [[Monte Solberg]].  According to the ''[[National Post]]'', the certificate asserts that the individual "was a foreign national engaged in espionage, a member of an espionage organisation and 'a danger to the security of Canada.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20773241-23109,00.html |title=Get out of jail free card from Palaszczuk |publisher=News.com.au\accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, he is suspected of being an elite agent in the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]], Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a5b0a856-dcc9-4a6e-b8e6-593842ad5a1b "Judge scolds spying suspect's lawyers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091606/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a5b0a856-dcc9-4a6e-b8e6-593842ad5a1b |date=2012-11-05 }}, ''The National Post'', 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A Federal Court judge has found the certificate reasonable and ordered ''Hampel'' to be expelled from Canada.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-12-04-canada-spy_x.htm "Russian spy to be expelled from Canada"], ''USA Today'', 4 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to speed up the deportation, Federal Court Justice Pierre Blais made a deal with the accused to seal the man's real name because of concerns for the safety of his family.  In exchange, Hampel will not contest deportation to his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1165272611050&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;StarSource=RSS "Ottawa to deport Russian 'agent'"], ''The Toronto Star'', 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Hampel has admitted through his lawyer "that he is not Paul William Hampel, that he is a Russian citizen, born on October 21, 1961, and that he has no legal status in Canada."  He does not admit to being a spy.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

Hampel started an "emerging markets" consultancy in Dublin, Ireland, but the business was stagnant in recent years.  In 1997, Hampel set up in Dublin a company called Emerging Markets Research and Consulting Limited, and put one million dollars of capital into the company; however, the company never filed any returns.  The company formed part of a business empire that Hampel controlled, and which operated in [[Sark]], [[Belgrade]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmedianews.com/News/nirelandnews.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1164300054&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=39&amp; "Ireland 'Russian spy training camp'"], ''Newsmedianews'', 23 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
{{See also|Ancient Libya}}
[[Pliny the Elder]] (Hist. Nat., vii 14) places the Psylli on the Syrtic coast above the [[Garamantes]], and gives Psyllikos Kolpos as an early name of the Syrtic Gulf.

According to John C. Murphy, "the Psylli were the displaced remnants of an ancient Libyan tribe that lived on the Gulf of Sidra. Conquered by the nomadic Nasamones, the Psylli became a well-known snake-charming sect."&lt;ref&gt;John C. Murphy, ''Secrets of the Snake Charmer'' {{ISBN|1450221262}}, 9781450221269 iUniversity 2010, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Psylli [[Herodotus]] described "a tribe that met with extinction" after the desert wind dried up their water holes (IV.173). &lt;!-- they marched out to do battle with it and were buried alive--&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] said that they were "almost exterminated" in a war with their neighbours, the [[Nasamones]], but the descendants of those who escaped "survive today in a few places" (VII.2.14). [[Strabo]] does not mention an unsuccessful war against either the desert wind or the [[Nasamones]] but only that the Psylli were still in existence, occupying "a barren and arid region" (XVII.3.23) below the Nasamones. Later writers, especially poets, bestowed on the Psylli a reputation as great [[snake charmers]].&lt;ref name="1911enc"/&gt;

In his ''Roman History'', [[Cassius Dio]] makes reference to the Psylli as being sought out by [[Octavian]] to draw out the snake venom with which [[Cleopatra]] had poisoned herself (LI.14). According to Dio, the Psylli were completely immune to snake bites and were all male(LI.14). [[Lucan]], speaking of the Psylli, whose peculiar property it was to be unhurt by the bite of serpents with which their country abounded, wrote:

"Of all who scorching Afric's sun endure,
None like the swarthy Psyllians are secure:
With healing gifts and privileges graced,
Well in the land of serpents were they placed:
Truce with the dreadful tyrant death they have,
And border safely on his realm the grave" (''[[Pharsalia]]'' ix. 891, trans. by Rowe)

==Customs==
{{See also|Snake venom}}

It is claimed that the Psylli employed tests by animals in order to find out if their offspring was genuine and at the same time if their wives were faithful. Infant Psylli were subjected to [[snake-bite]]s. If the infant died of the snakebite, [[illegitimacy]] was supposed to be implied.&lt;ref name="1911enc"/&gt;

'''The Public Health Act 1904''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is one of the [[Public Health Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the November 1902 issue of ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'' [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] wrote an article titled "Labourers' and Artisans' Dwellings" in which he argued that the poor conditions of working class were injurious to morality and health.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, ''Salisbury. Victorian Titan'' (Phoenix, 2000), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; "''[[Laissez-faire]]'' is an admirable doctrine but it must be applied on both sides", Salisbury argued, as Parliament had enacted new building projects (such as the [[Thames Embankment]]) which had displaced working-class people and was responsible for "packing the people tighter":

&lt;blockquote&gt;...thousands of families have only a single room to dwell in, where they sleep and eat, multiply, and die... It is difficult to exaggerate the misery which such conditions of life must cause, or the impulse they must give to vice. The depression of body and mind which they create is an almost insuperable obstacle to the action of any elevating or refining agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this article the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' argued that Salisbury had sailed into "the turbid waters of State Socialism"; the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' said his article was "State socialism pure and simple" and ''[[The Times]]'' claimed Salisbury was "in favour of state socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp. 283-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 1903 a [[Royal Commission]] on the Housing of the Working Classes was set up under the leadership of Sir [[Charles Dilke]], including Salisbury, the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], [[Henry Broadhurst]], [[George Goschen]], [[Jesse Collings]], [[Bishop of Bedford]], and [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|Richard Cross]] as members. It held 51 meetings, met twice a week in spring and summer of 1903, heard from witnesses, asked 18,000 questions, toured the slums and interviewed doctors, policemen, Poor Law Board officials, clergymen, government officials and vestry sanitary committee chairmen.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Its Report was published in December 1903 and contained a mixture of Salisbury's proposals for government loans and subsidies and the more collectivist Dilke-[[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] ideas of increasing the local councils' powers. Salisbury dissented from the majority Report because he considered it too reminiscent of Chamberlainite "expropriation" and produced his own minority Report.

==The Act==

Richard Cross, the [[Home Secretary]], introduced the Bill into the House of Commons on 23 July 1903 and Salisbury did the same in the House of Lords. The Act allowed county districts to get loans from [[HM Treasury]] on the security of the [[rates (tax)|rates]]. The [[Local Government Board]] was granted the power to force local authorities to shut down unhealthy houses, making landlords personally liable for their tenants' health, and the Act also made it illegal for landlords to let property which was below elementary sanitary standards.&lt;ref name="Roberts, p. 286"&gt;Roberts, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the act was to eliminate housing constructions in London that posed [[public health]] threats, including the spread of  [[cholera]] and [[typhus]]. Since sewage was flowing and overwhelming the streets (including permeating houses), the act sought to fix the problem.
The act required all new residential construction to include "running water and an internal drainage system." 
This act also prohibited the government to build poor-quality housing by building contractors. The act also stated that every public health authority had to have a doctor and a sanitary inspector, to ensure the other sanitation, food, and health laws were carried out.

Many factors delayed reform, however, such as the fact that to perform a cleanup, the government would need money, and this would have to come from factory owners, who were not keen to pay, and this further delayed reform. But reformers eventually helped to counteract the government's laissez-faire attitude, and a public health Act was introduced in 1904. Home Secretary Richard Cross was responsible for drafting the legislation, and received much good will from trades union groups in the consequent years for "humanising the toil of the working man".

The Act also meant that towns had to have [[Sidewalk|pavements]] and [[street lighting]].

The '''Qassab''' ({{lang-ur|قصاب}}; plural of {{lang|ur|قصائی}} ''Qasai'' from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Khasab'' (خصب), are members of a north Indian community or ''biradari''. The caste of commoners, labours and peasants.

Occasionally most Qassab caste members are referred to as the '''Kasbi caste''' and have many different surnames such as ''[[Qurayshi]]'', ''Bhatti'', ''Mughal'', ''Rajput'', ''Rajas'', ''Khokar'', etc.

==History and origin==
The community is entirely [[Sunni]], and in [[North India]] speaks [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh'' Volume XLII, edited by A. Hasan &amp; J.C. Das, page 736&lt;/ref&gt;

For their participation in [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|first war of independence]], fine Rs. 63,000 was imposed on the people of [[Rohtak]] who were mostly [[Ranghar]]s, [[Punjabi Shaikh|Shaikh]]s and Muslim Kasai.&lt;ref name=balidan1&gt;Satish Chandra Mittal, 1986, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=2RKTigrrP1cC Haryana, a Historical Perspective], p58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

===In North India===
The community remains associated with the slaughtering of animals. Apart from selling meats, they are also involved in the sale and purchase of animals, as well as trading in hides. The [[Chik (social group)|Chik]]wa of Awadh are also involved in the selling of hides. In terms of distribution, they are found throughout [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]. They are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], which marriages preferred within a small kinship circle. Most towns include distinct quarters where the community lives, such as Qureshnagar in [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh'' Volume XLII, edited by A. Hasan &amp; J.C. Das, page 741&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anjuman Quresh is an India-wide association, and is the oldest Muslim communal organization. The community belong to both the Sunni and [[Shia]] sects of [[Islam]], but the majority are Sunnis. The Chikwa speak [[Awadhi]], while the Qureshi Qassab speak Urdu.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In [[Rajasthan]], the Qassab are found in the districts of [[Ajmer District|Ajmer]], [[Jaipur District|Jaipur]], [[Nagaur district|Nagaur]], [[Jodhpur District|Jodhpur]] and Pali. The Qassab speak [[Mewari language|Mewari]] among themselves, and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] with outsiders. They have two sub-divisions, the Barakasab, who slaughter cows and buffaloes, and Chhotakasab, who slaughter goats. The Qassab have local [[caste]] associations, known as jamats, in each of their settlements, which deal with disputes within the community.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Rajasthan'' Volume XXXVIII Part Two, edited by B.K. Lavania, D.K. Samanta, S.K. Mandal and N.N. Vyas, page 501 to 504, Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bihar]], the Qassab are a class of Muslim butchers, and are generally known as Qureshis. They are found throughout [[Bihar]], and are one of the few [[Bihari Muslim]] communities that speaks Urdu. The Qassab consist of two sub-groups, the Bara Karbar, who were involved in the slaughtering of cows, and Chota Karbar, who slaughtered goats. Closely related to the Qassab are the Chik, a caste also associated with the slaughtering of goats. The Anjuman Quresh has a [[Bihar]] branch, which acts as a welfare association. They are entirely Sunni Muslims, and are fairly orthodox. They were one of the earliest groups to shift towards the [[Deobandi]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Bihar'' Volume XVI Part One, edited by S. Gopal &amp; Hetukar Jha, pages 501 to 505, Seagull Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Maharashtra===

The Qassab of [[Maharashtra]] are said to have come over from [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] to [[Amravati]], and were soldiers in the army of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], and still speak the Dakhani dialect of Urdu. They were initially divided into two groups, the Gai Kasai (cow butchers) and Baker Kasai (mutton butchers). The community is further divided into three groups, the Chaudhary, the Saudagor and Sikku. They speak the [[Dakhani]] dialect of Urdu among themselves, and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] with outsiders. The Qassab are Sunni, and strictly endogamous. They practice both [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross cousin]] and parallel cousin marriages. In [[Maharashtra]], the community are found in the cities of [[Amravati]], [[Akola]], [[Chandrapur]], [[Nagpur]], [[Pune]], [[Bhiwandi]] and [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Maharashtra'' Volume XXX  Part Two, edited by B.V. Bhanu, B.R. Bhatnagar, D.K. Bose, V.S. Kulkarni and J Sreenath, pages 766 to 769, Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the Qassab are found in the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. They have Eight major divisions, the Jutt, Qureshi, Arbi, Bhatti, Khokhar, Goraha and Suhal. The [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] Qassab claim descent from a number of [[Rajput]] tribes, such as the [[Bhatti]] or [[Khokhar]], in which an ancestor is said to have taken up the occupation of butchering. In addition to butchering, the Qassab of Punjab have been involved with cotton cleaning. The [[Penja tribe|Penja]] community is of Qaasab extraction.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Pakistan is also home to communities of Qureshi Qasab, which originate from [[Delhi]] and [[Haryana]]. They are an Urdu-speaking community found mainly in the cities of [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Multan]] and [[Faisalabad]],[[Dera Ghazi Khan, ]][[Muzaffar Garh]],[[Vehari]] Like their Indian counterparts, the Qureshi Qassab also have a caste association or anjuman. They are also called [[Sheikh Qureshi]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===In Jammu and Kashmir===
The Qassab of the Kashmir valley are known as the Ganai. But not all Ganai are butchers or Qassab. Many sociologists and anthropologists believe that the Kashmiri Ganai were originally Brahmins, and butchers of Kashmir steadily assumed the caste name "Ganai" only recently, with the advent of Islam in the 14th century. They assumed this high-sounding surname to escape the social stigma associated with the butchery profession in traditional Hindu society. Presently many butchers use the surname Ganai but only some of them are in the butchery profession.&lt;ref&gt;''Valley of Kashmir Races and Tribes'' Chapter XII, Walter R. Lawrence, pages 306 to 307, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Qassab groups, many are also involved in the buying and selling of hides, which has made the Ganai a wealthy community. The traditional caste council has been replaced by the Ganai association.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Jammu and Kashmir'' Volume XXV, edited by K.N. Pandita, S.D.S. Charak &amp; B.R. Rizvi, pages 347 to 350, Manohar 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the rest of the Indian subcontinent the Qureshis / Qurashis / Qureashis of Kashmir are high-caste Muslims whose lineage is directed towards the Sufi Saints who came from Central Asia and Arab world during the arrival of Islam in the 14th century in the Kashmir valley. The high-caste Muslims known as Qureshi of Kashmir include Masoodi, Qureshi, and Bukhari.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==The All India Jamiatul Quresh==

Like many Muslim communities in India, the Qassab have set up the All India Jamiatil Quresh, which was established in [[Meerut]] in 1927. The Jamiat was set up by Bhaiyya Rasheeduddin Ahmed , MLC ,  Landlord , a wealthy merchant and philanthropist. He has established under 3700 schools . It has a federal structure, with each state having its own chapter. Its headquarters are in Kothi Khan Bahadur ,[[Meerut]] [[Uttar Pradesh]].  Any male member of the community can take up membership. As a caste association, the Jamait campaigns on behalf of the community as well as acting as a welfare organization, and running schools and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Taleem, Tanzeen aur Tijarat: The Changing role of the AIJQ, by Zarin Ahmed, in Frontiers of Embedded Muslim Communities in India, Editor Vinod K. Jairath, Routledge 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bawarchi of Uttar Pradesh==

The Bawarchi are a sub-group within the Qassab, and get their name from the Urdu word ''bawarchi'', which means "a cook". A split from the wider Qassab community is said to have taken place when a group of [[Lucknow]] Qassab changed their occupation from butchering to cooking. There is no intermarriage now between the Bawarchi and neighbouring Qassab communities. They are still found mainly in the city of Lucknow, in the localities of Sadar, Husainganj, Fatehganj and Chowk.  The Bawarchi prefer to be known as Qureshi or Ahl-e-Quresh.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh'' Volume XLII Part One, edited by A. Hasan &amp; J.C. Das, page 220 to 223, Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bawarchi speak Urdu and belong to the Sunni sect.  They are a community of professional cooks, who historically were employed by wealthy Awadh [[taluqdar]]s. With the disappearance of their traditional patrons at the time of the independence of [[India]], the community are now employed in restaurants and hotels, and specialise in [[Awadhi cuisine]].

The Bawarchi and rakabdars of Awadh gave birth to the [[Dum Pukht|dum style of cooking]] or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030713/spectrum/main2.htm ''The Sunday Tribune'' - Spectrum - Lead Article]&lt;/ref&gt; Their spread would consist of elaborate dishes like [[kebabs]], [[korma]]s, [[biryani]], kaliya, [[Kulcha|nahari-kulchas]], zarda, sheermal, [[Roti|roomali rotis]] and [[Paratha|warqi parathas]]. The richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like [[mutton]], [[paneer]], and rich [[spices]] including [[cardamom]] and [[saffron]].

Like other Muslim artisans, many have seen a decline in their traditional occupation, and are now petty businessmen. The Bawarchi have no formal caste association, but each of their settlements contains a [[panchayat]], an informal [[caste]] association.  Each settlement panchayat is headed by a chaudhary, a post which was traditionally heredity. The panchayat deals with intra community disputes and punishes any social transgressions. Some Bawarchi are also involved with the Anjuman Quraish.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Bawarchi of Gujarat==
In [[Gujarat]], the Bawarchi are said to have been soldiers in the army of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur|Babar]], and settled in Gujarat some five centuries ago. Once in Gujarat, these soldiers changed their occupation and took up cooking, hence becoming known as Bawarchi. The Bawarchi are now found in the cities of [[Ahmedabad|Ahmadabad]], [[Surat]], and [[Baroda]], and a few villages in [[Kheda District]]. They speak a dialect which is a mixture of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and Urdu.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;''People of India Gujarat'' Volume XXII Part One, edited by R.B. Lal, S.V. Padmanabham &amp; A. Mohideen, page 147 to 149, Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most [[Gujarati Muslim]]s, the Bawarchi have a caste association, the Ahmedabad Bawarchi Jamat. The jamat acts as both a community welfare association as well as an instrument of social control. Like other Qassab sub-groups, the Gujarat Bawarchi are strictly endogamous. Most prefer marrying close kin, and practice both parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages. The Bawarchi are entirely Sunni, but also incorporate some folk beliefs.

Like most Muslim artisan castes, the Bawarchi have seen a decline in their traditional occupation, which involved being employed as cooks in wealthier Muslim families. Other were owners of caravanserais. Very few Bawarchis have taken up higher education, as the community is extremely economically marginalized. Many are now employed as daily wage labourers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The '''Raju''' are a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] caste found mostly in the Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].

==Etymology and claims of Kshatriya status==
The Raju caste, which A. Satyanarayana calls the "locally dominant landed gentry", claims [[Kshatriya]] status in the [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system despite there being "no real Kshatriya varna" in the Andhra region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Growth of Education among the Dalit-Bahujan Communities in Modern Andhra, 1893-1947 |first=A. |last=Satyanarayana |title=Education and the Disprivileged: Nineteenth and Twentieth Century India |editor-first=Sabyasachi |editor-last=Bhattacharya |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2002 |isbn=978-81-250-2192-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-jBIp3iWdEC |page=53 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The anthropologist Minna Säävälä [[Glossary|glossarises]] the present-day Rajus as a "higher caste of traditional warriors and rulers; Kshatriya",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Minna |last=Säävälä |title=Fertility and familial power relations: procreation in south India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9FwQxGqwOUC&amp;pg=PA16 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |isbn=978-0-7007-1484-1 |page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not provide an explanation or source for this description.}} They also claim descent from the ancient royal dynasties of India such as the [[Eastern Chalukyas]], [[Later Cholas|Chalukya-Cholas]], [[Vishnukundina]], [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]], [[Chagi]], [[Paricheda]] and [[Kota Vamsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A History of the Early Dynasties of Andhradesa |first=B.V |last= Krishnarao |year=1942 |publisher=V.

''Raju'' is a [[Telugu language]] variant of the [[Sanskrit]] title ''[[Raja]]'', a term for a monarch or princely ruler. Cynthia Talbot describes the term as being:
{{quote|...most often used by members of noble or princely lineages. [But it] could also designate an individual employed by a lord or prince.&lt;ref name="talbot" /&gt;}}

In medieval Andhra Pradesh, the title was used in both senses, and was very likely adopted by some secular [[Brahmin]]s, who occupied important advisory functions. The royal usage at that time was particularly prevalent in the northern coastal areas of the region. Talbot also notes that the title, and others in use at that time, do not align with the [[Vedic]] four-fold varna system and in that sense could not refer to a [[caste]].&lt;ref name="talbot"&gt;{{cite book |title=Precolonial India in practice: Society, Region and Identity in Medieval Andhra |first=Austin Cynthia |last=Talbot |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-19-513661-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C |pages=57–58 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they do appear to have conformed to
{{quote|...the existence of broad social categories based primarily on occupation. Although [the title] did not necessarily designate a distinct class, much less a bounded community, or a hereditary grouping, various sets of these titles differentiated social types marked by a common status and shared occupation.&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;{{cite book |title=Precolonial India in practice: Society, Region and Identity in Medieval Andhra |first=Austin Cynthia |last=Talbot |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-19-513661-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C |page=61 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Temple inscriptions from the period of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]], a [[South India]]n dynasty that flourished between 1175-1324 CE in the Telugu-speaking lands now in Andhra Pradesh, refer both to royal and clerical ''rajus'' as donors, together with peasant leaders called ''[[Reddy|reddies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Precolonial India in practice: Society, Region and Identity in Medieval Andhra |first=Austin Cynthia |last=Talbot |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-19-513661-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfAKljlCJq0C |pages=17, 112 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern community==

===Population===
A report published by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] in 2002, describing the Rajus of Andhra as an ex-warrior caste, noted that along with the [[Kapu (caste)|Kapu]] and [[Velama (caste)|Velama]] they were 
{{quote|...important communities with considerable political significance in the State, although in numerical terms they constitute only a small percentage of the population and spatially are confined only to small pockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caste, Class and Social Articulation In Andhra Pradesh.

'''Rolf Liebermann''' (14 September 1910 – 2 January 1999&lt;ref name="ON"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/Archive/1999/3/Departments/Obituary.html|title=The Houdini of Opera: Rolf Liebermann|journal=[[Opera News]]|author=John W. Freeman|date=March 1999|volume=63|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] composer and music administrator. He served as the Artistic Director of the [[Hamburg State Opera]] from 1959–1973 and again from 1985–1988. He was also Artistic Director of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1973–1980.

==Life==
Liebermann was born in [[Zürich]], and studied composition and conducting with [[Hermann Scherchen]] in Budapest and Vienna in the 1930s, and later with [[Wladimir Vogel]] in Basel. His compositional output involved several different musical genres, including [[Chanson#Modern chanson|chansons]], [[Classical music|classical]], and [[light music]]. His classical music often combines myriad styles and techniques, including those drawn from [[Baroque music|baroque]], [[Classical period (music)|classical]], and [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] music.

Liebermann was the director of the [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburg Staatsoper]] from 1959 to 1973, and again from 1985 to 1988.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt; During his tenure in Hamburg, he commissioned 24 new operas, including ''The Devils'' by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], ''[[Der Prinz von Homburg (opera)|Der Prinz von Homburg]]'' by [[Hans Werner Henze]], and ''[[Help, Help, the Globolinks!]]'' by [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]. In the intervening years he served as director of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1973 to 1980. He died in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,322199,00.html Tom Sutcliffe, "Fanfare of the opera" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'', 14 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

At the inaugural [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1956, Liebermann acted as the president of the jury; being responsible for moderating and finalising the results of the seven international juries judging the competition.&lt;ref&gt;John Kennedy O'Connor, ''The Eurovision Song Contest—The Official History'' (Carlton Books, 2010).{{Full citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!--Place of pub needed but, more important, the page number of the citation.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he was the head of the jury at the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1989/04_jury_1989/04_Jury_1989.html|title=Berlinale: 1989 Juries|accessdate=9 March 2011|publisher=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinhalese is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka. Sinhalese, along with [[Pali]], played a major role in the development of [[Theravada]] Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The oldest Sinhalese Prakrit inscriptions found are from the third to second century BCE following the [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka#Introduction of Buddhism|arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danesh Jain, George Cardona|title=Indo-Aryan Languages|publisher=Routledge|page=847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sinhala/1.1#History|title=Introduction ~ හැඳින්වීම - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest extant literary works date from the ninth century. The closest relative of Sinhalese is the [[Maldivian language]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
Sinhalese is of two main varieties – written and spoken. Spoken Sinhalese is easier to learn because it has lost the rigidity and formality of grammar.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Names of Sri Lanka#Sinhala}}
''Sinhala'' ({{IAST|Siṃhāla}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] term; the corresponding [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]] ([[Elu|Eḷu]]) word is ''Sīhala''.
The name is a derivation from ''{{IAST|[[:wikt:सिंह|siṃha]]}}'', the Sanskrit word for "lion"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Caldwell | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Caldwell | title=A comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages | publisher=Trübner &amp; Co. | place=London|year=1875|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''{{IAST|Siṃhāla}}'' is attested as a Sanskrit name of the island of in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''. The name is sometimes glossed as "abode of lions", and attributed to a supposed former abundance of [[lion]]s on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chinese Account of Ceylon|journal=The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China, and Australia|date=1836|volume=20|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to the chronicle ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', written in [[Pali]], Prince Vijaya and his entourage merged with two [[exotic tribes of ancient India]] present in [[Lanka]], the [[Yaksha|Yakkha]] and [[Naga people (Lanka)|Naga peoples]]. In the following centuries, there was substantial immigration from Eastern India ([[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Magadha]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/books/sinhala_history.htm |title=WWW Virtual Library Sri Lanka : Sri Lanka: A Short History of Sinhala Language |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to an admixture of features of Eastern Prakrits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Stages of historical development ===
The development of the Sinhalese language is divided into four periods:
* [[Elu|Sinhalese Prakrit]] (until 3rd century CE)
* Proto-Sinhalese (3rd–7th century CE)
* Medieval Sinhalese (7th–12th century CE)
* Modern Sinhalese (12th century&amp;nbsp;– present)

=== Phonetic development ===
The most important phonetic developments of the Sinhalese language include
* the loss of the [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] distinction (e.g. ''kanavā'' "to eat" corresponds to Sanskrit ''khādati'', Hindi ''khānā'')
* the loss of a [[vowel length]] distinction; long vowels in the modern language are due to [[loanword]]s (e.g. ''vibāgaya'' "exam" &lt; Sanskrit ''vibhāga'') and [[sandhi]], either after [[elision]] of [[Intervocalic consonant]]s (e.g. ''dānavā'' "to put" &lt; ''damanavā'') or in originally [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] words.
* the simplification of [[consonant cluster]]s and [[Gemination|geminate consonants]] into geminates and single consonants respectively (e.g. Sanskrit ''viṣṭā'' "time" &gt; Sinhalese Prakrit ''viṭṭa'' &gt; Modern Sinhalese ''viṭa'')
* development of {{IPA|/j/}} to {{IPA|/d/}} (e.g. ''däla'' "web" corresponds to Sanskrit ''jāla'')

=== Western vs. Eastern Prakrit features ===
An example for a Western feature in Sinhalese is the retention of initial {{IPA|/v/}} which developed into {{IPA|/b/}} in the Eastern languages (e.g. Sanskrit ''viṃśati'' "twenty", Sinhalese ''visi-'', Hindi ''bīs''). An example of an Eastern feature is the ending -e for masculine nominative singular (instead of Western -o) in Sinhalese Prakrit. There are several cases of vocabulary [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]], e.g. the words ''mässā'' ("fly") and ''mäkkā'' ("flea"), which both correspond to Sanskrit ''makṣikā'' but stem from two regionally different Prakrit words ''macchiā'' and ''makkhikā'' (as in [[Pali]]).

=== Pre-1815 Sinhalese literature ===
During the career of [[Christopher Reynolds (linguist)|Christopher Reynolds]] as a Sinhalese lecturer at the [[SOAS, University of London]], he extensively researched the Sinhalese language and its pre-1815 literature: the Sri Lankan government awarded him the [[Sri Lanka Ranjana]] medal for this. He wrote the 377-page ''An anthology of Sinhalese literature up to 1815'', selected by the [[UNESCO]] National Commission of Ceylon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Collection of Representative Works, Sinhalese Series'', George Allen and Unwin Limited, London 1970 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4090792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==

=== Substratum influence in Sinhalese ===
According to Geiger, Sinhalese has features that set it apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. Some of the differences can be explained by the substrate influence of the parent stock of the [[Vedda language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gair|1998|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinhalese has many words that are only found in Sinhalese, or shared between Sinhalese and Vedda and not etymologically derivable from Middle or Old Indo-Aryan. Common examples are ''kola'' for leaf in Sinhalese and Vedda, ''dola'' for pig in Vedda and offering in Sinhalese. Other common words are ''rera'' for wild duck, and ''gala'' for stones (in [[toponyms]] used throughout the island).&lt;ref name=v230&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also high frequency words denoting body parts in Sinhalese, such as ''olluva'' for head, ''kakula'' for leg, ''bella'' for neck and ''kalava'' for thighs, that are derived from pre-Sinhalese languages of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=I45&gt;{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the oldest Sinhalese grammar, ''Sidatsangarava'', written in the 13th century CE, recognised a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhalese. The grammar lists ''naramba'' (to see) and ''kolamba'' (fort or harbour) as belonging to an indigenous source. ''Kolamba'' is the source of the name of the commercial capital [[Colombo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gair|1998|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences from neighbouring languages ===
In addition to many [[List of Sinhala words of Tamil origin|Tamil loanwords]], several phonetic and grammatical features present in neighbouring [[Dravidian languages]], setting today's spoken Sinhalese apart from its Northern Indo-Aryan siblings, bear witness to the close interactions with Dravidian speakers. However, formal Sinhalese is more similar to Pali and medieval Sinhalese. Some of the features that may be traced to Dravidian influence are –
* the distinction between short e, o and long ē, ō
* the loss of aspiration
* [[Branching (linguistics)|left-branching syntax]]
* the use of the [[attributive verb]] of ''kiyana'' "to say" as a subordinating [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] with the meanings "that" and "if", e.g.:

=== Foreign influence ===
As a result of centuries of colonial rule, modern Sinhalese contains some [[List of Portuguese words in Sinhala|Portuguese]], [[List of Dutch words in Sinhala|Dutch]] and [[List of Sinhala words of English origin|English loanwords]].

=== Influences on other languages ===
[[Macanese Patois]] or Macau Creole (known as ''Patuá'' to its speakers) is a [[creole language]] derived mainly from [[Malay language|Malay]], Sinhalese, [[Cantonese]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which was originally spoken by the [[Macanese people]] of the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Macau]]. It is now spoken by a few families in Macau and in the Macanese [[diaspora]].

The language developed first mainly among the descendants of Portuguese settlers who often married women from [[Malacca]] and [[Sri Lanka]] rather than from neighbouring [[China]], so the language had strong Malay and Sinhalese influence from the beginning.

=== Numerals ===
{{main|Sinhala numerals|}}
Sinhalese shares many features common to other [[Indo-European languages]]. Shared vocabulary includes the numbers up to ten.

== Accents and dialects ==
Sinhalese spoken in the [[Southern Province, Sri Lanka|Southern Province]] ([[Galle District|Galle]], [[Matara District|Matara]] and [[Hambantota District]]s) uses several words that are not found elsewhere in the country; this is also the case for the [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|Central]] and [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North-Central Provinces]] and south-eastern region ([[Uva Province]] and the surrounding area). For native speakers all dialects are mutually intelligible, and they might not even realise that the differences are significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinhalese Language|url=http://www.alsglobal.net/languages/sinhalese.php|publisher=American Language Services|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the [[Vedda people]] resembles Sinhalese to a great extent, although it has a large number of words which cannot be traced to another language. The [[Rodiya]] use another dialect of Sinhalese. Rodiya used to be a caste in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka no longer recognizes castes.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Diglossia ==
In Sinhalese there is distinctive [[diglossia]], as in many languages of South Asia. The [[literary language]] and the [[spoken language]] differ from each other in many aspects. The written language is used for all forms of [[Literature|literary texts]] but also orally at formal occasions (public speeches, TV and radio news broadcasts, etc.), whereas the spoken language is used as the language of communication in everyday life (see also [[Sinhala slang]] and [[colloquialism]]). As a rule the literary language uses more [[Sanskrit]]-based words.

The most important difference between the two varieties is the lack of [[Inflection|inflected]] [[verb]] forms in the spoken language.

The situation is analogous to one where [[Middle English|Middle]] or even [[Old English]] would be the written language in [[Great Britain]]. The children are taught the written language at school almost like a [[foreign language]].

Sinhalese also has diverse [[slang]]. Most slang words and terms were regarded as taboo and most were frowned upon as non-scholarly. However, nowadays Sinhalese slang words and terms, even the ones with sexual references, are commonly used among younger Sri Lankans.

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Sinhalese script|Sinhalese Braille}}[[File:Ayubowan.png|thumb|{{Lang|si|ආයුබෝවන්}} (''āyubōvan'') means "welcome", literally wishing one a long life]]
The [[Sinhalese script]], ''Sinhala hodiya'', is based on the ancient [[Brahmi script]], as are most Indian scripts. The Sinhalese alphabet is closely related to [[South India]]n [[Grantha alphabet]] and [[Khmer alphabet]] taken the elements from the related [[Kadamba alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/sinhala.html|title=Ancient Scripts: Sinhala|website=www.ancientscripts.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The Sinhalese writing system is an [[abugida]], where the consonants are written with letters while the vowels are indicated with [[diacritic]]s (''pilla'') on those consonants, unlike English where both consonants and vowels are full letters, or Urdu where vowels need not be written at all. Also, when a diacritic is not used, an "inherent vowel", either {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}, is understood, depending on the position of the consonant within the word. For example, the letter ක ''k'' on its own indicates ''ka'', either {{IPA|/ka/}} or {{IPA|/kə/}}. The various vowels are written කා ''kā'', කැ ''kä'', කෑ ''kǟ'' (after the consonant), කි ''ki'', කී ''kī'' (above the consonant), කු ''ku'', කූ ''kū'' (below the consonant), කෙ ''ke'', කේ ''kē'' (before the consonant), කො ''ko'', කෝ ''kō'' (surrounding the consonant). There are also a few diacritics for consonants, such as ''r''. For simple {{IPA|/k/}} without a vowel, a vowel-cancelling diacritic ([[virama]]) called ''hal kirīma'' is used: ක් ''k''. Several of these diacritics occur in two forms, which depend on the shape of the consonant letter. Vowels also have independent letters but these are only used at the beginning of words where there is no preceding consonant to add a diacritic to.

The complete alphabet consist of 60 letters, 18 for vowels and 42 for consonants. However, only 57 (16 vowels and 41 consonants) are required for writing colloquial spoken Sinhalese (''suddha Sinhala''). The rest indicate sounds that have gotten lost in the course of linguistic change, such as the aspirates, are restricted to [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] loan words.

Sinhalese is written from left to right and the Sinhalese character set (the Sinhalese script) is only used for this one language.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The alphabetic sequence is similar to those of other Brahmic scripts:

{{block indent|''a/ā ä/ǟ i/ī u/ū [ŗ] e/ē [ai] o/ō [au] k [kh] g [g] ṅ c [ch] j [jh] [ñ] ṭ [ṭa] ṭ [ṭh] ḍ [ḍh] [ṇ] t [th] d [dh] n p [ph] b [bh] m y r l v [ś ṣ] s h [ḷ] f''}}

== Phonology ==
[[File:Sinhalese vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Sinhalese vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Perera|Jones|1919|p=5}}]]
Sinhalese has so-called [[prenasalized consonant]]s, or 'half nasal' consonants. A short [[Homorganic consonants|homorganic]] nasal occurs before a voiced stop,, it is shorter than a sequence of nasal plus stop. The nasal is syllabified with the onset of the following syllable, which means that the [[mora (linguistics)|moraic weight]] of the preceding syllable is left unchanged. For example, ''tam̆ba'' 'copper' contrasts with ''tamba'' 'boil'.

== Morphology ==

=== Nominal morphology ===
The main features marked on Sinhalese nouns are case, number, definiteness and [[animacy]].

==== Cases ====
Sinhalese distinguishes several cases. Next to the cross-linguistically rather common [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]] and [[ablative]], there are also less common cases like the [[instrumental case|instrumental]]. The exact number of these cases depends on the exact definition of cases one wishes to employ. For instance, the endings for the animate instrumental and locative cases, ''atiŋ'' and ''laᵑgə'', are also independent words meaning "with the hand" and "near" respectively, which is why they are not regarded to be actual [[Affix|''case endings'']] by some scholars. Depending on how far an independent word has progressed on a [[grammaticalisation]] path, scholars will see it as a case marker or not.

The brackets with most of the vowel length symbols indicate the optional shortening of long vowels in certain [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] syllables.

| ''men''

|}

==== Number marking ====
In Sinhalese animate nouns, the plural is marked with ''-o(ː)'', a [[Gemination|long consonant]] plus ''-u'', or with ''-la(ː)''. Most inanimates mark the plural through [[disfix]]. [[Loanword]]s from English mark the singular with ''ekə'', and do not mark the plural. This can be interpreted as a [[singulative number]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| SG || ammaː || deviyaː || horaː || pothə || reddə || kanthoːruvə || sathiyə || bus ekə || paːrə
|-
| PL || amməla(ː) || deviyo(ː) || horu || poth || redi || kanthoːru || sathi || bus || paːrəval
|-
| ''Gloss'' || ''mother(s)''|| ''god(s)''|| ''thief(ves)''|| ''book(s)''|| ''cloth(es)''|| ''office(s)''|| ''week(s)''|| ''bus(ses)''||''street(s)''
|}

On the left hand side of the table, plurals are longer than singulars. On the right hand side, it is the other way round, with the exception of paːrə "street". Note that [+animate] lexemes are mostly in the classes on the left-hand side, while [-animate] lexemes are most often in the classes on the right hand.

==== Indefinite article ====
The indefinite article is ''-ek'' for animates and ''-ak'' for inanimates. The indefinite article exists only in the singular, where its absence marks definiteness. In the plural, (in)definiteness does not receive special marking.

=== Verbal morphology ===
Sinhalese distinguishes three conjugation classes.
Spoken Sinhalese does not mark person, number or gender on the verb (literary Sinhalese does). In other words, there is no subject–verb agreement.

== Syntax ==
* Left-branching language (see [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]]), which means that determining elements are usually put in front of what they determine (see example below).
* An exception to this is formed by statements of quantity which usually stand behind what they define. Example: "the four flowers" translates to {{lang|si|මල් හතර}} {{IPA|/mal hatərə/}}, literally "flowers four". On the other hand, it can be argued that the numeral is the head in this construction, and the flowers the modifier, so that a better English rendering would be "a floral foursome"
* SOV ([[subject–object–verb]]) [[word order]], common to most left-branching languages.
* As is common in left-branching languages, it has no prepositions, only postpositions (see [[Adposition]]). Example: "under the book" translates to {{lang|si|පොත යට}} {{IPA|/potə jaʈə/}}, literally "book under".
* Sinhalese has no [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]: "I am rich" translates to {{lang|si|මම පොහොසත්}} {{IPA|/mamə poːsat/}}, literally "I rich". There are two [[existential verb]]s, which are used for [[locative predication]]s, but these verbs are not used for predications of class-membership or property-assignment, unlike English ''is''.
* There are almost no [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] as English ''that'' or ''whether'', but only [[non-finite clause]]s that are formed by the means of [[participle]]s and [[verbal adjective]]s. Example: "The man who writes books" translates to {{lang|si|පොත් ලියන මිනිසා}} {{IPA|/pot liənə miniha/}}, literally "books writing man".

== Semantics ==
There is a four-way [[deictic]] system (which is rare): There are four demonstrative [[Word stem|stems]] (see [[demonstrative pronoun]]s) {{lang|si|මේ}} {{IPA|/meː/}} "here, close to the speaker", {{lang|si|ඕ}} {{IPA|/oː/}} "there, close to the person addressed", {{lang|si|අර}} {{IPA|/arə/}} "there, close to a third person, visible" and {{lang|si|ඒ}} {{IPA|/eː/}} "there, close to a third person, not visible".

=== Discourse ===
Sinhalese is a [[pro-drop language]]: Arguments of a sentence can be omitted when they can be inferred from context. This is true for [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]—as in Italian, for instance—but also objects and other parts of the sentence can be "dropped" in Sinhalese if they can be inferred. In that sense, Sinhalese can be called a "super pro-drop language", like [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

Example: The sentence {{lang|si|කොහෙද ගියේ}} {{IPA|[koɦedə ɡie]}}, literally "where went", can mean "where did I/you/he/she/we... go".

'''Situational strength''' is defined as cues provided by environmental forces regarding the desirability of potential behaviors.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; Situational strength is said to result in psychological pressure on the individual to engage in and/or refrain from particular behaviors. A consequence of this psychological pressure to act in a certain way is the likelihood that despite an individual's [[Personality type|personality]], they will act in a certain manner. As such, when strong situations (situations where situational strength is high) exist, the relationship between personality variables (for example, [[extraversion]], risk-taking behaviors, etc...) and behaviors is reduced, because no matter what the personality of the individual is, they will act in a way dictated by the situation. When weak situations exist, there is less structure and more ambiguity with respect to what behaviors to perform.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; In sum, situations have the ability to restrict the expression of [[individual differences]] in terms of actual behaviors.

==Contrasting strong and weak situations==
An example of a strong situation is a red traffic light. Traffic rules dictate how people are supposed to act when they see a red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of a red traffic light. Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation.

In contrast, an example of a weak situation is a yellow traffic light because the most appropriate course of action is not especially well defined and norms are inconsistent. Thus, individuals who are more daring are likely to speed through the intersection on a yellow light, whereas cautious individuals are likely to stop.

==Origins and history==
Although it is difficult to formally express when situations restricting individual differences in personality began in [[psychology]], work conducted by [[Carl Rogers]] suggested that certain individual differences are mostly likely to manifest themselves in situations where there is psychological freedom and safety, compared to situations where psychological freedom and safety do not exist.&lt;ref name="rogers-1954"/&gt; Additionally, [[Stanley Milgram]] argued that psychological forces of conflict may not be brought into play under diluted conditions.&lt;ref name="milgram-1965"/&gt; However, recent conceptualization and study of situational strength can be traced back to the work of [[Walter Mischel]]. In 1968, Mischel published his classic book, ''Personality and Assessment'', where he argued that personality cannot be studied in a vacuum; instead, the complexity of human behavior and its determinants must be studied from a perspective that accounts for the simultaneous and interactive impact of individual differences and situational characteristics.&lt;ref name="mischel-1968"/&gt; It is important to note that Mischel did not imply that people show no consistencies in behavior, or that individual differences are unimportant. The major theme was rather that the trait approach to personality was not as sensitive to the influence of situations as it should have been.&lt;ref name="mischel-1999"/&gt;

In books and articles on the topic, Mischel stressed the importance of better understanding how, when, and why individual differences are most likely to be important predictors of behavior, and when they are more likely to be nullified by situational influences. Specifically, Mischel began laying the foundation for subsequent thought in this area by arguing that psychological "situations" and "treatments" are powerful to the degree that they lead all persons to construe the particular events the same way, induce uniform expectancies regarding the most appropriate response pattern, provide adequate incentives for the performance of that response pattern, and instill the skills necessary for its satisfactory construction and execution (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; He further argued that individual differences are most likely to directly affect behavior "when the situation is ambiguously structured... so that subjects are uncertain about how to categorize it and have no clear expectations about the behaviors most likely to be appropriate (normative, reinforced) in that situation" (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; Thus, he helped to lay the foundation for the general idea underlying what is now typically referred to as "situational strength" (or "situation strength").

Mischel's work led to an important shift in social scientists' thinking about the behavioral expression of personality. But, as some have recently argued, situational strength is too often viewed as being true without treating situational strength as a theoretical construct in need of conceptual development and empirical verification.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt;

==Modern conceptualization and empirical verification==
Meyer, Dalal, and Hermida argue that for theoretical understanding and practical application of situational strength to be advanced, at least three important issues must be addressed:&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Examining the nature of the situational strength. Specifically, examining if there are unique facets in situational strength.
# Examining whether these facets affect all non-ability individual differences uniformly, or if some facets affect the expression of some traits more so than others.
# If facets do in fact have differential effects on the expression of various behaviors and predictor-outcome relationships, it will be necessary to develop theory regarding the specific mechanisms through which these facet-based effects occur.

Four facets of situational strength have been identified:
# Clarity: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are available and easy to understand.
# Consistency: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are compatible with each other.
# Constraints: The extent to which an individual's freedom of decision and action is limited by forces outside his or her control.
# Consequences: The extent to which decisions or actions have important positive or negative implications for any relevant person or entity.

In an empirical study, which incorporated vote-counting [[meta-analysis]], it has been found that conceptualizations of situational strength that currently exist in psychological literature form an interaction with non-ability individual differences. Additionally, the [[effect size]] of the interaction effect was reasonably large.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;

==Implications==
Perhaps the most important implication of situational strength is that it is commonly believed to explain cross-situational variability in the criterion-related validity of non-cognitive individual differences.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mischel-1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullins-cummings-1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss-adler-1984"/&gt; This suggests that psychology should not focus on whether personality constructs predict job performance but rather about the conditions under which they predict job performance. This also shows great practical implications for personnel selection because the criterion-related validity of individual differences may vary across different occupations. For instance, Meyer, Dalal, and Bonaccio found that occupation-level situational strength moderates the conscientiousness–performance relationship, such that conscientiousness better predicts performance in characteristically weak occupations than in characteristically strong occupations.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-bonaccio-2009"/&gt;

Another important implication revolves around the idea of [[person-environment fit]]. One of the core ideas expressed in the fit literature is that a mismatch between individuals' needs and environmental supplies can have deleterious effects on performance, attitudes, and health.&lt;ref name="kristofbrown-zimmerman-johnson-2005"/&gt; Within the context of situational strength, some employees may view highly constraining environments as stifling and frustrating, whereas others may find the regimented and predictable nature of constraining environments to be comforting and relaxing. If these differences do in fact exist, this would suggest that employees' psychological reactions are partially a function of their individual differences profile and partially a function of the nature of the situation they are experiencing.

==Future directions==
Two critical aspects of situational strength can be fruitful for future study:
# It is possible that more or fewer categories of operationalizations exist. Thus, researchers should be encouraged to continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, &amp; Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant operationalizations, the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of operationalizations might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted—a task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Once the dimensional structure of situational strength has been determined, it will be possible to develop a standardized measure for use alongside traditional job analytic tools, in order "to analyze the context within which the job is embedded" (page 349).&lt;ref name="murphy-dzieweczynski-2005"/&gt; There are many potential benefits of such an instrument. First, it would allow researchers interested in examining the effects of situational strength on relevant trait-outcome relationships to do so in a way that is not only consistent across studies (which is not the case at present, as evidenced by our review of the empirical literature), but that also helps to develop a general situational strength literature—the absence of which has been noted.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt; Second, it would allow for an assessment of the relative importance of the dimensions of situational strength, helping researchers to determine which dimensions are necessary and/or sufficient to adequately understand a given interactional question.&lt;ref name="azen-budescu-2003"/&gt; Third, it would help researchers determine whether the situational strength dimensions [[interaction|interact]] with each other—and, if they do, whether these interactions are synergistic or antagonistic. Fourth, it would allow for large-scale analyses of the relative levels of situational strength that exist in diverse situations, the results of which could then be compiled into centralized databases that could help inform future practice and research.

The practice of [[Skin whitening|skin lightening]] and bleaching is a lucrative industry in Ghana, where higher value is placed upon being light skinned.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2008|title=I Like Your Colour – Skin Bleaching and Geographies of Ghana|journal=Feminist Review|issue=90|page=9|jstor=40663936|last1=Pierre|first1=Jemima|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maswana|first=Jean – Claude|year=2009|title=Perspective on Africa-China's Emerging Economic Links|url=|journal=A Center-Periphery Perspective on Africa-China's Emerging Economic Links. African &amp; Asian Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has been present since the  sixteenth century and was influenced by contemporary practices, and it is a very longstanding and controversial topic. Skin bleaching is a practice where women and men use various chemical and cosmetics products to attempt to lighten or whiten the color of the skin. These products often contain one or both of two chemicals: hydroquinone and mercury and can sometimes lead to negative physical effects, such as cancer and can cause rash and flaky skin, as well as uneven light and dark patches on the skin. Because of the health risks involved with skin lightening, Ghana has implemented legislation against the use of skin lightening products. Though the products have recently been banned, Ghanaian women can still acquire them through illegal means or use homemade skin lightening chemicals.&lt;ref name="Foluo"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2008|title=The Lighter Side of Marriage|journal=African and Asian Studies|volume=8|issue=1/2|page=125|doi=10.1163/156921009X413180|ref=Foluo|last1=Foluo|first1=J.Konadu|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pierre"&gt;{{cite book|title=The predicament of blackness postcolonial Ghana and the politics of race|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-92304-8|location=Chicago|page=101|ref=Pierre|last1=Pierre|first1=Jemima|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Light skinned is frequently marketed via billboards and posters that feature light skinned models, playing on the public perception that looking [[multiracial]] or having lighter skin makes one more attractive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some Ghanians also believe that if a lighter-skinned person is  in a position of power, that they bleached to get into that position and is bleaching to maintain it.&lt;ref name="Pierre" /&gt; Historians such as Jemima Pierre theorize that the desire for lighter colored skin stem from [[apartheid]] and the British colonization of West Africa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; White skin asserted class privilege and distinct racial privilege, prompting many Ghanians to bleach their skin to achieve a similar color.&lt;ref name="Pierre" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over time this also became a major determinant of beauty, especially among Ghanian women, and by the 1980s skin bleaching had spread throughout all socioeconomic classes of women.&lt;ref name="Foluo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lartey|first=Margaret|last2=Krampa|first2=Francis D.|last3=Abdul-Rahman|first3=Mubarak|last4=Quarcoo|first4=Naa L.|last5=Yamson|first5=Phaedra|last6=Hagan|first6=Paa G.|last7=Tettey|first7=Yao|last8=Gyasi|first8=Richard|last9=Adjei|first9=Andrew A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Use of skin-lightening products among selected urban communities in Accra, Ghana|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijd.13449/abstract|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|language=en|volume=56|issue=1|pages=32–39|doi=10.1111/ijd.13449|issn=1365-4632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a common practice among Ghanians, lower class people are often openly ridiculed for skin bleaching.

'''''South Dakota v. Dole''''', 483 U.S. 203 (1987),{{ref|citation}} was a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] considered the limitations that the Constitution places on the authority of the [[United States Congress]] when it uses its authority to influence the individual states in areas of authority normally reserved to the states. It upheld the [[constitutionality]] of a federal statute that withheld federal funds from states whose legal drinking age did not conform to federal policy.

==Background==
In 1984, the United States Congress passed the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]], which withheld 10%&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title23/html/USCODE-2011-title23.htm Title 23 of the United States Code, Highways. (HTML text, see Section 158)]&lt;/ref&gt; of federal highway funding from states that did not maintain a minimum legal drinking age of 21. [[South Dakota]], which allowed 19-year-olds to purchase (raised from 18 years old as result of NMDAA) [[Low-point beer|beer containing up to 3.2% alcohol]], challenged the law, naming [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] [[Elizabeth Dole]] as the [[defendant]].

==Decision==
The Supreme Court held 7–2 that the statute represented a valid use of Congressional authority under the [[Spending Clause]] and that the statute did not infringe upon the rights of the states. The Court established a five-point rule for considering the constitutionality of expenditure cuts of this type:

# The spending must promote "the general welfare."
# The condition must be unambiguous.
# The condition should relate "to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs."
# The condition imposed on the states must not, in itself, be unconstitutional.
# The condition must not be coercive.

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] noted that the National Minimum Drinking Age Act clearly met the first three restrictions, leaving only the latter two restrictions worthy of consideration. Rehnquist wrote that the Congress did not violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] because it merely exercised its right to control its spending. Rehnquist wrote that the Congress did not coerce the states because it cut only a small percentage of federal funding. It thus applied pressure but not irresistible pressure.

===Dissent===
Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]] and [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Brennan]] both filed dissents. O'Connor agreed that Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds and that the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-First Amendment]] gives states authority over laws relating to the consumption of alcohol. However, she wrote that the attachment of condition on the states must be "reasonably related to the expenditure of funds." She disagreed with the Court's finding that withholding federal highway funds was reasonably related to deterring drunken driving and drinking by minors and young adults. She argued that the condition was both overinclusive and underinclusive: it prevented teenagers from drinking when they are not going to drive on federal and federally funded highways, and it did not attempt to remedy the overall problem of drunken driving on federal and federally funded highways. She held the relation between the condition and spending too attenuated: "establishment of a minimum drinking age of 21 is not sufficiently related to interstate highway construction to justify so conditioning funds appropriated for that purpose."

The Tajiks are an Iranian people, speaking a variety of Persian, concentrated in the [[Oxus]] Basin, the [[Ferghana valley|Farḡāna valley]] (Tajikistan and parts of Uzbekistan) and on both banks of the upper Oxus, i.e., the [[Pamir Mountains]] (Mountain Badaḵšān, in Tajikistan) and northeastern Afghanistan and western Afghanistan (Badaḵšān, Kābol, Herat, Balkh, Mazar-i-Sharif, Ghazni and other urban regions).&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tajik-i-the-ethnonym-origins-and-application|title=TAJIK i.

In a 1996 publication, Frye explains that many "factors must be taken into account in explaining the evolution of the peoples whose remnants are the Tajiks in Central Asia" and that "the peoples of Central Asia, whether [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] or [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them."&lt;ref name=frey96&gt;{{cite book |title=The heritage of Central Asia from antiquity to the Turkish expansion |last= Frye |first=Richard Nelson |authorlink=Richard Nelson Frye |year=1996 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] |isbn=1-55876-110-1 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RSXSu1x9hwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Tajiks, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states:{{quote|The Tajiks are the direct descendants of the Iranian peoples whose continuous presence in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan is attested from the middle of the 1st millennium {{smallcaps|bc}}. The ancestors of the Tajiks constituted the core of the ancient population of Khwārezm (Khorezm) and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania (Sogdiana).  Over the course of time, the eastern Iranian dialect that was used by the ancient Tajiks eventually gave way to [[Persian language|Farsi]], a western dialect spoken in Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581047/Tajikistan/214553/History Tajikistan: History] ''Britannica Online Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'':&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The most plausible and generally accepted origin of the word is Middle Persian tāzīk ‘Arab’ (cf. New Persian tāzi), or an Iranian (Sogdian or Parthian) cognate word. The Muslim armies that [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|invaded Transoxiana]] early in the eighth century, conquering the Sogdian principalities and clashing with the [[Qarluq Turks]] (see Bregel, Atlas, Maps 8–10) consisted not only of Arabs, but also of Persian converts from Fārs and the central [[Zagros]] region (Bartol’d [Barthold], “Tadžiki,” pp. 455–57). Hence the Turks of Central Asia adopted a variant of the Iranian word, täžik, to designate their Muslim adversaries in general. For example, the rulers of the south Indian [[Chalukya dynasty]] and [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] also referred to the Arabs as "Tajika" in the 8th and 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Political History of the Chālukyas of Badami  by Durga Prasad Dikshit p.192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The First Spring: The Golden Age of India  by Abraham Eraly p.91&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century (Yusof Ḵāṣṣ-ḥājeb, Qutadḡu bilig, lines 280, 282, 3265), the [[Qarakhanid Turks]] applied this term more specifically to the Persian Muslims in the Oxus basin and Khorasan, who were variously the Turks’ rivals, models, overlords (under the [[Samanid Dynasty]]), and subjects (from [[Ghaznavid]] times on). Persian writers of the Ghaznavid, [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] and [[Atabeg|Atābak]] periods (ca. 1000–1260) adopted the term and extended its use to cover Persians in the rest of [[Greater Iran]], now under Turkish rule, as early as the poet ʿOnṣori, ca. 1025 (Dabirsiāqi, pp. 3377, 3408). Iranians soon accepted it as an ethnonym, as is shown by a Persian court official’s referring to mā tāzikān “we Tajiks” (Bayhaqi, ed. Fayyāz, p. 594). The distinction between Turk and Tajik became stereotyped to express the symbiosis and rivalry of the (ideally) nomadic military executive and the urban civil bureaucracy (Niẓām al-Molk: tāzik, pp. 146, 178–79; Fragner, “Tādjīk. 2” in EI2 10, p. 63).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', however, the oldest known usage of the word ''Tajik'' as a reference to Persians in Persian literature can be found in the writings of the Persian poet [[Rumi|Jalal ad-Din Rumi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]]/B.G. Fragner, "Tā&lt;u&gt;dj&lt;/u&gt;īk", in [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Online Edition: ''"...&amp;nbsp;In Islamic usage, [Tā&lt;u&gt;dj&lt;/u&gt;īk] eventually came to designate the Persians, as opposed to Turks [...] the oldest citation for it which Schraeder could find was in verses of &lt;u&gt;Dj&lt;/u&gt;alāl al-Dīn Rūmī ..."''&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th century Turkic-speaking poet [[Ali Sher Nawa'i|Mīr Alī Šer Navā'ī]] also used ''Tajik'' as a reference to Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Shir Nava'i ''Muhakamat al-lughatain'' tr. &amp; ed. Robert Devereaux (Leiden: Brill) 1966 p6&lt;/ref&gt;
An example for the usage of the word ''Tajik'' in Persian literature is, for example, the writing of [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'adi]]:{{quote|{{lang|fa|&lt;big&gt;'''شایَد کِه بَه پادشاه بگویند'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''ترک تو بریخت خون تاجیک'''&lt;/big&gt;}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Šâyad ki ba pâdšâh bigoyand''&lt;br /&gt;''Turke tu birext xune Tâjik''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''It's appropriate to tell the King,''&lt;br /&gt;''Your Turk shed the blood of Tajik''}}

The Tajiks are the principal ethnic group in most of [[Tajikistan]], as well as in northern and western [[Afghanistan]], though there are more Tajiks in Afghanistan than in Tajikistan. Tajiks are a substantial minority in [[Uzbekistan]], as well as in overseas communities. Historically, the ancestors of the Tajiks lived in a larger territory in Central Asia than now.

The language of the Tajiks is an eastern dialect of [[Persian language|Persian]], called [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] (derived from ''Darbārī'', "[of/from the] royal courts", in the sense of "courtly language"), or also Parsi-e Darbari. In Tajikistan, where [[Cyrillic]] script is used, it is called the [[Tajik language|Tajiki language]]. In [[Afghanistan]], unlike in [[Tajikistan]], Tajiks continue to use the [[Perso-Arabic script]], as well as in Iran. However, when the [[Soviet Union]] introduced the Latin script in 1928, and later the Cyrillic script, the Persian dialect of Tajikistan came to be considered a separate (Persian) language.{{Dubious|date=December 2014}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Since the 19th century, Tajiki has been strongly influenced by the Russian language and has incorporated many Russian language [[loan words]].&lt;ref name=eiturkloan&gt;Michael Knüppel.

[[Encyclopædia Iranica]].&lt;/ref&gt; It has also adopted fewer [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loan words than Iranian Persian, while retaining vocabulary that has fallen out of use in the latter language. In Tajikistan, in ordinary speech, also known as “zaboni kucha” (lit. "street language", as opposed to “zaboni adabi”, lit. "literary language", which is used in schools, media etc.), many urban Tajiks prefer to use Russian loanwords instead of their literary Persian analogs.

The dialects of contemporary Tajiks in present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan and of the Persians in present-day Iran are accepted to have a common origin. This is due to the fact that one of [[Greater Iran]]'s historical cultural capitals, called [[Greater Khorasan]], which included parts of modern Central Asia and much of Afghanistan and constitutes as the Tajik's ancestral homeland, played a key role in the development and propagation of Persian language and culture throughout much of [[Greater Iran]] after the Muslim conquest. Furthermore, early manuscripts of the historical Persian spoken in [[Mashhad]] during the development of Middle to New Persian show that their origins came from [[Sistan]], in present-day Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Paul, “Persian Language i: Early New Persian,”Encyclopædia Iranica, online edition, 2013, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/persian-language-1-early-new-persian (accessed on 19 November 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Lazard, “Dari,” Encyclopædia Iranica, XII/1, pp. 34–35; available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dari (accessed online at 17 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars have recorded the [[Zoroastrian]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Aryan]] pre-Islamic heritage of the Tajik people. Early temples for fire worship have been found in [[Balkh]] and [[Bactria]] and excavations in present-day Tajikistan and Uzbekistan show remnants of Zoroastrian fire temples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hLi9oJMT5B8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=tajikistan+zorastrian Lena Jonson, ''Tajikistan in the New Central Asia: Geopolitics, Great Power Rivalry and Radical Islam''] (International Library of Central Asia Studies), page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, however, the great majority of Tajiks follow [[Sunni Islam]], although small [[Twelver]] and [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]] minorities also exist in scattered pockets. Areas with large numbers of Shias include [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]], [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]] provinces in Afghanistan, the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] in Tajikistan, and [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]] in China. Some of the famous Islamic scholars were from either modern or historical East-Iranian regions lying in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and therefore can arguably be viewed as Tajiks. They include [[Abu Hanifa]],&lt;ref&gt;U. F. ʿAbd-Allāh, “ABŪ ḤANĪFA,” Encyclopædia Iranica, I/3, pp. 295–301; an updated version is available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-hanifa-noman-b (accessed on 30 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imam Bukhari]], [[Tirmidhi]], [[Abu Dawood]], [[Nasir Khusraw]] and many others. 

According to a 2009 [[U.S. State Department]] release, the population of Tajikistan is 98% Muslim, (approximately 85% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and 5% [[Shia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5775.htm |title=Background Note: Tajikistan |publisher=State.gov |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Afghanistan]], the great number of Tajiks adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The smaller number of Tajiks who may follow [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] are locally called [[Farsiwan]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The community of [[Bukharian Jews]] in Central Asia speak a dialect of Persian.

==Recent developments==

===Cultural revival===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 4 February 2009-1.jpg|thumb|[[Emomalii Rahmon]] with then [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in 2009]]
The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Civil War in Afghanistan]] both gave rise to a resurgence in Tajik nationalism across the region, including a trial to revert to the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic]] script in Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="EoIranic Tajik Persian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=John |title=TAJIK ii.

For instance, the [[President of Tajikistan]], [[Emomalii Rahmon]], dropped the Russian suffix "-ov" from his surname and directed others to adopt Tajik names when registering births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372123|title=Tajikistan restates its strategic partnership with Russia, while sending mixed signals|accessdate=2007-12-19|last= McDermott|first= Roger|date= 2007-04-25|publisher= The Jamestown Foundation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014232737/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372123 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a government announcement in October 2009, approximately 4,000 Tajik nationals have dropped "ov" and "ev" from their surnames since the start of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaplus.tj/en/news/198/58219.html |title=Some 4,000 Tajiks opt to use the traditional version of their names this year |publisher=Asiaplus.tj |date=1962-10-17 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview to Iranian news media in May 2008, Tajikistan's deputy culture minister said that Tajikistan would study the issue of switching its [[Tajik Cyrillic alphabet|Tajik alphabet]] from [[Cyrillic]] to the [[Perso-Arabic script|Persian]] script used in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] when the government feels that "the Tajik people became familiar with the Persian alphabet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=53991&amp;sectionid=351020406 "Tajikistan may consider using Persian script when the conditions are met"], interview of Tajikistan's Deputy Culture Minister with Iranian News Agency, 2 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan]] seeks to have the nation's language referred to as "Tajiki-Farsi" rather than "Tajik." The proposal has drawn criticism from Russian media since the bill seeks to remove the [[Russian language]] as the mode of interethnic communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Tajikistans_Islamic_Party_Wants_Language_Called_Tajiki_Farsi/1818766.html Tajik Islamic Party Seeks Tajiki-Farsi Designation].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the original name of the language (Farsi) was added to its official name in brackets. However, Rahmon's government renamed the language to simply 'Tajiki' in 1994. On October 2009, Tajikistan adopted the law that removes Russian as the "language for interethnic communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Tajikistan_Drops_Russian_As_Official_Language/1846118.html |title=Tajikistan Drops Russian As Official Language |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tama''' is a non-[[Arab]], African ethnic group of people who live in eastern [[Chad]] and western [[Sudan]]. They speak [[Tama language|Tama]], a [[Nilo-Saharan language]]. The population is 200,000–300,000 people and they practice [[Islam]]. Many Tama are [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] who live in permanent settlements and some raise livestock. In the [[civil war in Chad (2005–2010)]] the Tama were involved in ethnic conflicts with the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] tribe.

==Subgroups==
The Tama are made up of a number of subgroups: Abu Sharib (approximately 50,000 people),&lt;ref name="FoF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Asungor (60,000),&lt;ref name="Olson42"/&gt; Dagel,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Erenga (35,000),&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 168–9&lt;/ref&gt; Gimr (50,000),&lt;ref name="FoF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Kibet,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Marari (20,000),&lt;ref name="FoF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; Mileri (9,000),&lt;ref name="FoF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; and Tama proper.&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PA682&amp;lpg=PA682&amp;dq=tama-speaking&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uZTpFvfzta&amp;sig=9x-70XID035RH7LMqMykDAPDcfM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N0tNUP_QPI_89gTf_oDwDw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tama-speaking&amp;f=false |author= Facts On File, Incorporated |title= Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East |publisher= Infobase Publishing |year= 2009 |ISBN= 143812676X |page= 682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional home of the Tama is [[Dar Tama]].&lt;ref name="HRWp14"&gt;Human Rights Watch, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; All reside in Chad, except the Gimr and the Mileri, who live near [[Saref Omra]] and [[Kebkabiya]] in Sudan.&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 198, 396&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, due to violence between the Tama and the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]],&lt;ref name="AHRW25"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; 1,800 Tama refugees fled to [[Guéréda|Mile and Kounoungo]],&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHRW26"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations]]-sponsored refugee camps.&lt;ref name="AHRW66"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
For centuries, the Tama were governed by [[sultan]]s.&lt;ref name="Cordell"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Dennis D.

At various times they have been subjected to the sultans of [[Ouaddai Empire|Wadai]] on the west and [[Darfur]] on the east, but have always had their own sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=dar+tama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vGXzzsYcrx&amp;sig=A33kYxPHvRh39UYo_aNb5O87ods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iz5dUKD4MaPFyAHGgoCICw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dar%20tama&amp;f=false |title= A History of the Arabs in the Sudan: And Some Account of the People who Preceded Them and of the Tribes Inhabiting Darfur |volume= 1 |author= Harold Alfred MacMichael |publisher= CUP Archive |year= 1922 |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they were part of the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HQxYJWkO7EEC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=dar+tama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=antlz2adNp&amp;sig=g8npxCOVp2hTrzP5witASx2uJLQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KDVdUM32H_P7yAGp-IDYCw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dar%20tama&amp;f=false |title= The Darfur Sultanate: A History |author= Rex S.

At the time of the [[Civil war in Chad (2005–2010)|Chadian civil war]] the rebel group [[United Front for Democratic Change]] (FUC) largely consisted of Tama.&lt;ref name="HRWp11"/&gt; The Zaghawa felt the Tama supported this rebel group that opposed the Chadian government,&lt;ref name="WOW"/&gt; which was led by President [[Idriss Déby]], a member of the Zaghawa tribe,&lt;ref name="HRWp25"&gt;Human Rights Watch, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; though there was little activity of any rebel group on the community level.&lt;ref name="AHRW26"/&gt;

A 2006 robbery of a Tama man and an ensuing gunfight that caused 20 deaths and 9 serious injuries was cited as the event that triggered increased violence.&lt;ref name="AHRW28-9"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, pp. 28–9&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the Zaghawa increased the frequency and violence of their theft of Tama cattle.&lt;ref name="AHRW32"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, dozens of Tama were killed by Zaghawa militants and thousands of Tama were displaced after Zaghawa attacks on Tama villages.&lt;ref name="HRWp14"/&gt;

In August 2006, 3,300 Tama civilians fled from Dar Tama to Sudan because some Zaghawa accused a Tama man of raping one of their women.&lt;ref name="AHRW26"/&gt; In October, 1,800 refugees fled to [[Guéréda|Mile and Kounoungo]],&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHRW26"/&gt; UN-sponsored refugee camps.&lt;ref name="AHRW66"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] could not corroborate allegations of Tama attacks on Zaghawa civilians.&lt;ref name="AHRW28"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Chadian government and police did little to investigate or condemn the increasing violence.&lt;ref name="AHRW34-5"&gt;Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, pp. 34–5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox NC name|umThembu|abaThembu|isiXhosa|Thembuland|The Thembu/Tamboekie people}}
The '''Thembu people''' are one of the handful of nations and population groups that speak [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] in [[South Africa]].

The most internationally famous Thembu person was [[Nelson Mandela]], whose father was a reigning [[nobleman]] from a junior branch of the Madiba clan of kings. [[Walter Sisulu]] was also of Thembu descent from his mother's side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancestry24.com/walter-sisulu/ Walter Sisulu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616181711/http://ancestry24.com/walter-sisulu/ |date=2012-06-16 }} ''Ancestry24''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
In Xhosa, the name is ''abaThembu'', ''aba-'' being a common [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] for peoples.  The land in which they lived was historically known as [[Thembuland]].

In the 19th century, the Thembu were frequently known as the "Tamboekie" or "Tambookie" people. This name was originally the [[Khoi-San|Khoisan]] term specifically for the Thembu followers of Chief Maphasa who moved into the area west of the Great Kei River in the 1820s. Europeans however, who were often not aware of the distinction, used the term as a synonym for "Thembu" for much of the 19th century.

==History==
{{main|Thembuland}}Prior to the British conquest and incorporation of their territory, called "[[Tembuland]]" in the 19th century, the Thembu had an independent [[monarchy|kingdom]].  The [[Xhosa clan name|clan name]] of the Thembu kings is '''Madiba'''.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Recent kings, including [[Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo]], have used the surname of Dalindyebo, from the name of a 19th-century king.

After conquest, the Thembu were administered by the government of the Cape Colony as one of the Transkeian Territories, which with the exception of a few missionaries and white traders, were treated as lands reserved for African occupation.  Other peoples in the territories who had formerly had independent kingdoms included the [[Gcaleka]] branch of the Xhosa, the [[Pondo people|Mpondo]] (who split into two kingdoms late in the 19th century), the [[Bhaca people|Bhaca]] and the Xesibe.  Under apartheid the [[Transkei]] was turned into a [[bantustan]].  In the ethnic theory underpinning [[apartheid]], the Transkei was regarded as the "homeland" of the Xhosa people.  As a result, the Thembu people are often misidentified as being Xhosa.

== King ==
[[Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo]], son of [[Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo]], has reigned as Thembu king since May 1989; his [[Isibongo|praise name]] is ''Zwelibanzi''. Sabata deposed [[Kaiser Matanzima]], whom the Apartheid government had installed and who advocated against South African liberation movements.  In December 2009 King Buyelekhaya was convicted of offences including [[culpable homicide]], [[kidnapping]], [[arson]] and [[assault]]. In response he proposed secession from South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20091206081352898C719198 Troubled monarch sentenced to 15 years] ''IOL''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20091223072722238C767265 Convicted king plans independent state] ''IOL''&lt;/ref&gt; and later demanded that the government pay Dalindyebo [[South African rand|R]]&amp;nbsp;900&amp;nbsp;million and the tribe a further R&amp;nbsp;80&amp;nbsp;billion in compensation for the humiliation caused by the criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120910205654/http://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/d73b673c21fd43a8a35f7fbcd88b487c/06-01-2010-06-02/Tribe_suspends_secession_plans Tribe suspends secession plans] ''News24''&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalindyebo was imprisoned in December 2015, has since been customarily dethroned, and is expected{{by whom|date=November 2016}} to be administratively dethroned in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = In terms of laws governing traditional authorities, he also had to be administratively dethroned. This involved President Jacob Zuma withdrawing the certificate that recognised him as a king, and cutting off the benefits that went with his status. [...] Mtirara said Zuma gave Dalindyebo a chance to say something when the certificate was about to be withdrawn, but he chose to go to court instead. This meant the matter of withdrawing the king's certificate still had to be dealt with.

It is estimated that these settlers and their descendants (not including Turkish soldiers) now make up about half the population of the North.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.eu/article/cyprus-reunification-peace-nicos-anastasiades-mustafa-akinci/&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is heterogeneous in nature and is composed of various sub-groups, with varying degrees of integration.

== Sub-groups ==
Mainland Turks in Northern Cyprus are divided into two main groups: citizens and non-citizen residents.&lt;ref name=hatay5&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatay|2005|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the citizens, some have arrived in the island as a part of a settlement policy run by the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot authorities, some have migrated on their own and some have been born in the island to parents of either groups. Mete Hatay argues that only the first group has "good reason to be called settlers".&lt;ref name=hatay5/&gt;

The aforementioned sub-groups consist of several categories. The first group, citizens, can further be differentiated into skilled laborers and white-collar workers, Turkish soldiers and their close families, farmers who have settled in Cyprus and individual migrants.&lt;ref name=hatay10&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatay|2005|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-citizens can be divided into students and academic staff, tourists, workers with permits and illegitimate workers lacking permits.&lt;ref name=hatay6&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatay|2005|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers settled from Turkey between 1975 and 1977 constitute the majority of the settler population.&lt;ref name=ronen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ronen|first1=Yaël|title=Transition from Illegal Regimes under International Law|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139496179|pages=231–245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4OEHtL5xoroC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The policy of settling farmers in Cyprus began immediately after the 1974 invasion. Andrew Borowiec wrote of a Turkish announcement that 5000 agricultural workers would be settled to take up possessions left behind by the displaced Greek Cypriots.&lt;ref name=borow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borowiec|first1=Andrew|title=Cyprus: A Troubled Island|date=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=98–99|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hzEDg6-d80MC&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hatay, the first group of such settlers arrived on the island in February 1975; heavy settlement continued until 1977. These farmers originated from various regions of Turkey, including the [[Black Sea Region]] ([[Trabzon]], [[Çarşamba]], [[Samsun]]), the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean Region]] ([[Antalya]], [[Adana]], [[Mersin]]) and the [[Central Anatolia Region]] ([[Konya]]).&lt;ref name=hatay12&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatay|2005|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1975, the number of "workers" from Turkey in the island was 910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kıbrıs'ın Türk kesiminde toplam 1.010 işletme var|publisher=[[Milliyet]]|date=9 February 1975|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of settling farmers was conducted along the lines of the Agricultural Workforce Agreement signed by the [[Turkish Federated State of Cyprus]] (TFSC) and Turkey in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hacaloğlu|first1=Hilmi|last2=Tekşen|first2=Özgür|title=Kıbrıslı Türkler Türkiyelileri sevmez mi?|url=http://dergi.aljazeera.com.tr/2015/03/01/kibrisli-turkler-turkiyelileri-sevmez-mi/|publisher=Al Jazeera Turkish Journal|accessdate=28 April 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consulates of the TFSC in Turkey were actively involved in organizing the transfer of this population; announcements through the radio and [[Muhtar (title)|muhtar]]s in villages called upon farmers interested in moving to Cyprus to apply to the consulates.&lt;ref name=hatay12/&gt; Many farmers who moved to Cyprus were from parts of Turkey with harsh living conditions or had to be displaced. This was the case with the village of [[Kayalar (North Cyprus)|Kayalar]], where people from the Turkish Black Sea district of Çarşamba were moved. These people were displaced due to the flooding of their village by a dam that was built, and were given a choice between moving to Cyprus and other regions in Turkey; some chose Cyprus. Christos Ioannides argued that these people had no political motivations for this choice; interviews with some have indicated that some did not know the location of Cyprus before moving there.&lt;ref name=hatay12/&gt;

After the applications of the prospective settlers were approved, they were transported to the port of [[Mersin]] in buses specially arranged by the state. They exited Turkey using passports, one of which were issued for every family, and then took the ferry to cross the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Cyprus. Once they arrived in [[Famagusta]], they were initially accommodated briefly in empty hostels or schools, and then transferred to the Greek Cypriot villages, which were their destinations of settlement. The families were assigned houses by lot.&lt;ref name=hatay12/&gt;

The paperwork of these settlers were initially done in a way that would make them appear to be Turkish Cypriots returning to their homeland, to prevent accusations of violation of the Geneva Convention. Once the settlers arrived, Turkish Cypriot officers gathered them in the village coffeehouse, collected their personal information, and the settlers were assigned the closest Turkish Cypriot-inhabited village to their place of residence as their place of birth in their special identity cards that were subsequently produced. For example, a number of settlers in the [[Karpass Peninsula]] had the Turkish Cypriot village of [[Galateia|Mehmetçik]] as their place of birth. When asked about the policy of settlement, [[İsmet Kotak]], the Minister of Labor, Rehabilitation and Social Works of the TFSC, said that what was happening was an intense, rightful and legal return of Turkish Cypriots that had been forcefully driven out of the island. However, these special identity cards did not prove effective in achieving their mission and TFSC identity cards showing the settlers' actual place of birth were issued.&lt;ref name=sahin610&gt;{{Harvnb|Şahin|Şahin|Öztürk|2013|page=610–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
The Greek Cypriot position regarding the settlers is that the settlement violated the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], which prohibits an occupying power from willfully transferring its own population to the occupied area, and thus amounts to a war crime. Greek Cypriot politicians have thus advocated a return of all settlers to Turkey in a solution of the Cyprus dispute. However, many of the settlers have severed their ties to mainland Turkey and in the cases of return by some, they were ostracized in their places of origin. The children of the settlers also consider Cyprus to be their homeland. Thus, according to the ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights'', many have argued that the settlers cannot be forcefully expelled from the island and "most observers" agree that a solution must "balance the overall legality of the settlement program with the human rights of the settlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195334027|page=460|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&amp;pg=460&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{Cyprus peace process}}
Despite the prevalent assumption that settlers helped maintain the right-wing [[National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus)|National Unity Party]]'s (UBP) decades-long power and consecutive electoral victories, this is incorrect, as between 1976 and [[Northern Cyprus parliamentary election, 1993|1993]], the UBP received more votes in native than in settler villages. These trends were determined by the analysis of votes across several native and settler villages by the political scientist [[Mete Hatay]]. There was a political movement that was based on the representation of what they saw as the settlers' interests; this line of politics included the [[New Dawn Party]] (YDP) and [[Turkish Union Party (Northern Cyprus)|Turkish Union Party]] (TBP). The majority of the vote in settler villages were divided between these settler parties and mainstream Turkish Cypriot opposition, including the [[Communal Liberation Party]] (TKP) and the [[Republican Turkish Party]] (CTP). Between 1992, when it was founded, and the election of [[Northern Cyprus parliamentary election, 2003|2003]], which represented a shift away from it, the [[Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] (DP) received the majority of settler opposition votes. Meanwhile, between 1990 and 2003, the UBP maintained a vote share averaging at around 40% at settler villages, but this was still less than the support it received in rural areas inhabited by native Turkish Cypriots. The UBP only received more support in settler villages in 1993 and after 2003, when it lost power. Furthermore, despite the prevalent assumption that the settlers advance the political interests of Turkey, settlers have voted against the line backed by Turkey at times, notably in 1990 against the Turkey-backed UBP and Rauf Denktaş and in 2004 against the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=hatayviii&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatay|2005|pages=viii–ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a predominantly [[Muslim]] people who are the founders of the city of [[Wa, Ghana|Wa]] and the [[Kingdom of Wala]]. They speak the [[Wali language (Ghana)|Wali language]], which belongs to the [[Gur languages|Gur]] group. There are 84,800 speakers of the language as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/wlx Wali] Ethnologue, retrieved 25 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Their neighbors are the [[Birifor people|Birifor]], [[Dagaaba people|Dagaaba]], and [[Vagla people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=GH&amp;seq=10 Language Map of Ghana]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their culture is similar to other [[Gur languages|Gur]]-speaking, [[Senoufo]] and [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] groups in northern [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]]. They are known for their impressive [[Sudano-Sahelian]] style [[mosque]]s and palaces. They are ruled by their traditional ruler, the [[Wa-Na]] whose traditional residence is a mud-brick built palace in [[Wa, Ghana|Wa]].

According to the 1921 census of Ghana the Wala numbered 16,905, although it is thought that that census missed some of the small villages in the [[Wa District]]. This meant that at the time they were outnumbered in Wa District by the Dagarti. In many ways the difference between Dagarti and Wa is which side of the rebellion they were on in 1894, those who sided with the Wa-Na coming to be the Wala, and those who rebelled being considered part of the Dagarti people. The number of Dagarti was so high because the British had imposed the pre-1894 boundaries of the [[Kingdom of Wala]] as the boundaries of the District of Wa.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Wilks, ''Wa and the Wala: Islam and polity in northwestern Ghana'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bell was raised in North St. Louis County, Missouri. He is the son of a police officer father and civil servant mother. Bell is a graduate of [[Hazelwood East High School]], [[Lindenwood University]], and [[University of Missouri School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Allen | first = Ron | last2= Noble Jones | first2 = Brittany | title = Game changer: Wesley Bell ousts Bob McCulloch for prosecutor in St. Louis County | newspaper = NBC News | date = August 10, 2018 | url = https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/game-changer-wesley-bell-ousts-bob-mcculloch-prosecuting-attorney-stl-n899671 | access-date = 2018-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Career==
After graduating from law school Bell worked as a St. Louis County public defender, an adjunct law professor, and a municipal court judge. In 2015 during the [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson Uprising]] he was elected to the city council with strong support from some activists. During his time on the council he worked with Obama’s DOJ to implement the [[consent decree]] to reform the city’s criminal justice system through both police and court reform.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.votewesleybell.com/ | title = Vote Wesley Bell | date = 2018 | website = (Wesley Bell campaign website) | publisher = Friends of Wesley Bell | access-date = 2018-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Running for the county prosecutor race on a platform of [[Community policing|community based policing]], assigning [[special prosecutor]]s in homicides by police, pledging to never seek the [[death penalty]], reforming cash [[Bail|bail/bond]] and never using it for low-level offenses, expanding [[diversion program]]s and the county’s [[drug court]]s, and promoting equitable due process, he received significant support from local and national activists and advocacy groups.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news | last = Stockman | first = Farah | title = In Ferguson, a New Prosecutor ‘Gives Us Hope’ 4 Years After Shooting | newspaper = The New York Times | date = August 8, 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/ferguson-prosecutor-wesley-bell.html | access-date = 2018-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intelligencer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo"/&gt;

'''Yugoslavs''' or '''Yugoslavians''' ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: ''Jugoslaveni/''Југославени, ''Jugosloveni/''Југословени; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Југословени; [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''Jugoslovani'') is a designation that was originally designed to refer to a united [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people. It has been used in two connotations, the first in an ethnic or supra-ethnic connotation, and the second as a term for citizens of the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Cultural and political advocates of Yugoslav identity have historically ascribed the identity to be applicable to all people of South Slav heritage, including those of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]]. Attempts at uniting Bulgaria into Yugoslavia were however unsuccessful and therefore Bulgarians were not included in the panethnic identification.

Since the [[dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia]] and the establishment of South Slavic [[nation state]]s, the term ''ethnic Yugoslavs'' has been used to refer to those who exclusively view themselves as Yugoslavs with no other ethnic [[self-identification]], many of these being of mixed ancestry.

In late 19th and early 20th century, influential public intellectuals [[Jovan Cvijić]] and [[Vladimir Dvorniković]] advocated that ''Yugoslavs'', as a supra-ethnic nation, had "many tribal ethnicities, such as Croats, Serbs, and others within it".&lt;ref name=wachte&gt;{{cite book |last=Wachte |first=Andrew | title=Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation Literature and Cultural Politics in Yugoslavia |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1998 |pages=92–94 |isbn=0-8047-3181-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], the official designation for those who declared themselves simply as ''Yugoslav'' was with quotation marks, "Yugoslavs" (introduced in census 1971). The quotation marks were originally meant to distinguish Yugoslav ethnicity from Yugoslav citizenship – which was written without quotation marks. The majority of those who had once identified as ethnic "Yugoslavs" reverted to or adopted traditional ethnic and national identities. Some also decided to turn to sub-national regional identifications, especially in multi-ethnic historical regions like [[Istria]], [[Vojvodina]], or [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] (hence [[Bosnians]]). The Yugoslav designation, however, continues to be used by many, especially by the descendants of Yugoslav migrants in the United States, Canada and Australia while the country still existed.

==Background==
===Yugoslavism and Yugoslavia===
 {{main|Yugoslavism}}
Since the late 18th century, when traditional European ethnic affiliations started to mature into modern ethnic identities, there have been numerous attempts to define a common [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] ethnic identity. The word ''Yugoslav'', meaning "South Slavic", was first used by [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Enciklopedia Jugoslavije, Zagreb 1990, pp. 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern iteration of Yugoslavism was the [[Illyrian movement]] in [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburg Croatia]]. It identified South Slavs with ancient [[Illyrians]] and sought to construct a common language based on the [[Shtokavian dialect]].&lt;ref name=singleton&gt;{{cite book |last=Singleton |first=Frederick Bernard | title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |page=93 |isbn=0-521-27485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was led by [[Ljudevit Gaj]], whose [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|script]] became one of two official scripts used for the [[Serbo-Croatian language]].&lt;ref name=singleton/&gt;

Among notable supporters of Yugoslavism and a Yugoslav identity active at the beginning of the 20th century were famous sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] (1883–1962), who called Serbian folk hero [[Prince Marko]] "our Yugoslav people with its gigantic and noble heart" and wrote poetry speaking of a "Yugoslav race";&lt;ref name="Ivo Banač 1984. Pp. 204-205"&gt;Ivo Banač. ''The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics''. Cornell University Press, 1984. Pp. 204-205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jovan Cvijić]], in his article ''The Bases of Yugoslav Civilization'', developed the idea of a unified Yugoslav culture and stated that "New qualities that until now have been expressed but weakly will appear. An amalgamation of the most fertile qualities of our three tribes [Serbs, Croats, Slovenes] will come forth every more strongly, and thus will be constructed the type of single Yugoslav civilization-the final and most important goal of our country."&lt;ref name="wachte"/&gt;

On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]] shot and killed [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the Austrian throne, and his wife, in Sarajevo. Princip was a member of [[Young Bosnia]], a group whose aims included the unification of the Yugoslavs and independence from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=banac&gt;{{cite book |last=Banač |first=Ivo |title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8014-9493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[assassination in Sarajevo]] set into motion a series of [[July Crisis|fast-moving events]] that eventually escalated into [[World War I|full-scale war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/harrachmemoir.htm|title=''First World War.com'' Primary Documents: Archduke Franz Ferdinand's Assassination, 28 June 1914|date=2002-11-03|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his capture, during his trial, he stated "I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria."&lt;ref name=malcolm&gt;{{cite book |last=Malcolm |first=Noel |title=Bosnia: A Short History |publisher=New York University Press |year=1996 |page=153 |isbn=0-8147-5561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June–July 1917, the [[Yugoslav Committee]] met with the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] Government in [[Corfu]] and on 20 July the [[Corfu Declaration]] that laid the foundation for the post-war state was issued. The preamble stated that the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were "the same by blood, by language, by the feelings of their unity, by the continuity and integrity of the territory which they inhabit undivided, and by the common vital interests of their national survival and manifold development of their moral and material life." The state was created as the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], a constitutional monarchy under the [[Karađorđević dynasty]]. The term "Yugoslavs" was used to refer to all of its inhabitants, but particularly to those of South Slavic ethnicity. Some Croatian nationalists viewed the Serb plurality and Serbian royal family as hegemonic. Eventually, a conflict of interest sparked among the Yugoslav peoples. In 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] sought to resolve a deep political crisis brought on by ethnic tensions by assuming dictatorial powers in the [[6 January Dictatorship]], renaming the country "Kingdom of Yugoslavia", and officially pronouncing that there is one single Yugoslav nation with three tribes. The Yugoslav ethnic designation was thus imposed for a period of time on all South Slavs in Yugoslavia. Changes in Yugoslav politics after King Alexander's death in 1934 brought an end to this policy, but the designation continued to be used by some people.

Philosopher [[Vladimir Dvorniković]] advocated the establishment of a Yugoslav ethnicity in his 1939 book entitled "The [[Characterology]] of the Yugoslavs". His views included eugenics and cultural blending to create one, strong Yugoslav nation.&lt;ref name=wachte/&gt;

There had on three occasions been efforts to make Bulgaria a part of Yugoslavia or part of an even larger federation: through [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] during and after [[World War I]]; through [[Zveno]] during the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1934]], and through [[Georgi Dimitrov]] during and after [[World War II]], but for various reasons, each attempt turned out to be unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet Ersoy, Maciej Górny, Vangelis Kechriotis.

After liberation from [[Axis Powers]] in 1945, the new [[SFRY|socialist Yugoslavia]] became a federal country, and officially recognized and valued its ethnic diversity. Traditional ethnic identities again became the primary ethnic designations used by most inhabitants of Yugoslavia. However, many people still declared themselves as "Yugoslavs" because they wanted to express an identification with Yugoslavia as a whole, but not specifically with any of its peoples.

[[Josip Broz Tito]] expressed his desire for an undivided Yugoslav ethnicity when he stated, "I would like to live to see the day when Yugoslavia would become amalgamated into a firm community, when she would no longer be a formal community but a community of a single Yugoslav nation."&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Dawa (3–9 April 1999). "The Serbian Hegemony, Ethnic Heterogeneity and Yugoslav Break-Up". ''Economic and Political Weekly'' '''34''' (14): 835.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1971 census recorded 273,077 Yugoslav, or 1.33% of the total population. The 1981 census recorded 1,216,463 or 5.4% Yugoslavs. In the 1991 census, 5.54% (242,682) of the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared themselves to be Yugoslav.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine – Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; 4.25% of the population of the republic of [[Montenegro]] also declared themselves Yugoslav in the same census.

The Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1990 ratified a Presidency of seven members. One of the seven was to be elected amongst/by the republic's Yugoslavs, thereby introducing the Yugoslavs next to Muslims by nationality, Serbs and Croats into the Constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina although on an inferior level. However, because of the [[Bosnian War]] that erupted in 1992, this Constitution was short-lived and unrealized.

The 1981 census showed that Yugoslavs made up around 8% of the population in Croatia, this to date has been the highest percentage of ''Yugoslavs'' within Croatia's borders. The 1991 census data indicated that the number of Yugoslavs had dropped to 2% of the population in Croatia. The 2001 census in Croatia (the first since independence) registered only 176 Yugoslavs.&lt;ref name="Croatia census data"&gt;[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/croatia/about/population/ Population of Croatia 1931–2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The next census in 2011 registered 331 Yugoslavs in Croatia (0.008% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/H01_01_05/H01_01_05.html|title=Državni zavod za statistiku Republike Hrvatske|website=www.dzs.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before and after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, most Yugoslavs switched to more conventional ethnic designations. Nevertheless, the concept has survived into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (where most towns have a tiny percentage), and [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2003–2006), which kept the name "Yugoslavia" the longest, right up to February 2003.

===Organizations===
 [[File:Savez Jugoslavena logo.png|thumb|240px|Logo of the Alliance of Yugoslavs]]
The Yugoslavs of Croatia have several organizations. The "Alliance of Yugoslavs" (''Savez Jugoslavena''), established in 2010 in Zagreb, is an association aiming to unite the Yugoslavs of Croatia, regardless of religion, [[sex]], [[Political views|political]] or other views.&lt;ref name=jutarnji&gt;[http://www.jutarnji.hr/u-zagrebu-osnovan-savez-jugoslavena/654372/ U Zagrebu osnovan Savez Jugoslavena] (in Croatian). [[Jutarnji list]]. ''Portal Jutarnji.hr; 23 March 2010''&lt;/ref&gt; Its main goal is the official recognition of the Yugoslav nation in every [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] successor state: Croatia, [[Slovenia]], Serbia, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name=index&gt;[http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/u-zagrebu-osnovan-savez-jugoslavena-imamo-pravo-na-ocuvanje-bastine-jugoslavije-/482391.aspx U Zagrebu osnovan Savez Jugoslavena: Imamo pravo na očuvanje baštine Jugoslavije] (in Croatian). [[Index.hr]]. ''L.J.; 23 March 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[Yugoslavism|pro-Yugoslav]] organization advocating the recognition of the Yugoslav nation is the "Our Yugoslavia" association (''Udruženje "Naša Jugoslavija"''), which is an officially registered organization in Croatia.&lt;ref name=opendem&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/heather-mcrobie-anes-makul/yugoslavs-in-twenty-first-century-%E2%80%98erased%E2%80%99-people Yugoslavs in the twenty-first century: ‘erased’ people] [[openDemocracy.net]]. ''Anes Makul and Heather McRobie; 17 February 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; The seat of Our Yugoslavia is in the [[Istria]]n town of [[Pula]],&lt;ref name=dv&gt;[http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/21270/udruzenje-nasa-jugoslavija-osniva-klubove-jugoslavena Udruženje "Naša Jugoslavija" osniva Klubove Jugoslavena] (in Croatian). Dubrovački vjesnik. ''Silvana Fable; 25 July 2010''&lt;/ref&gt; where it was founded on 30 July 2009.&lt;ref name=rtv&gt;[http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/region/osnovano-udruzenje-nasa-jugoslavija-u-puli_140247.html Osnovano udruženje "Naša Jugoslavija" u Puli] (in Serbian).

[[Vesti online]]. ''Novi list; 27 July 2010''&lt;/ref&gt; Its main aim is the stabilisation of relations among the Yugoslav successor states. It is also active in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, its official registration as an association was denied by the Bosnian state authorities.&lt;ref name=opendem/&gt;

The probably best-known pro-Yugoslav organization in Montenegro is the "Consulate-general of the SFRY" with its headquarters in the coastal town of [[Tivat]]. Prior to the population census of 2011, Marko Perković, the president of this organization called on the Yugoslavs of Montenegro to freely declare their Yugoslav identity on the upcoming census.&lt;ref name=konzulsfrj&gt;[http://www.srbijanet.rs/vesti/drustvo/76878-perkovic-pozvao-crnogorce-da-se-izjasne-i-kao-jugosloveni.html Perković pozvao Crnogorce da se izjasne i kao Jugosloveni] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405231436/http://www.srbijanet.rs/vesti/drustvo/76878-perkovic-pozvao-crnogorce-da-se-izjasne-i-kao-jugosloveni.html |date=5 April 2011 }} (in Serbian). Srbijanet. ''03-03-2011''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
The best known example of self-declared Yugoslavs is Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] who organized resistance against Nazi Germany in Yugoslavia,&lt;ref name="ww2"&gt;[http://www.trussel.com/hf/tito.htm Tito and his People] by Howard Fast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/media_461550929/Yugoslav_Partisans_Enter_Belgrade.html Liberation of Belgrade and Yugoslavia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202045938/http://encarta.msn.com/media_461550929/Yugoslav_Partisans_Enter_Belgrade.html |date=2 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively expelled Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, co-founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and defied [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet pressure on Yugoslavia. Other people that declared as "Yugoslavs" include intellectuals, entertainers, singers and sportspersons, such as:

==Symbols==

The probably most frequently used symbol of the Yugoslavs to express their identity and to which they are most often associated with is the blue-white-red tricolor flag with a yellow-bordered red star in the flag's center,&lt;ref name=vijesti&gt;[http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/u-crnoj-gori-oko-1-000-jugoslovena-100-turaka-130-njemaca-clanak-28490 U Crnoj Gori oko 1.000 Jugoslovena, 100 Turaka, 130 Njemaca...] (in Montenegrin). [[Vijesti]]. ''Vijesti online; 12 July 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; which also served as the national [[flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] between 1945 and 1991.

Prior to World War II, the symbol of Yugoslavism was a plain tricolor flag of blue, white and red, which was also the national [[flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav state]] in the [[interwar period]].

'''Yugoslavs in Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|Југословени у Србији/Jugosloveni u Srbiji}}) refers to a community in [[Serbia]] that view themselves as ''[[Yugoslavs]]'' with no other ethnic [[self-identification]]. Additionally, there are also [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] and people of other ethnicities in Serbia who identify themselves as Yugoslavs. However, the latter group does not consider itself to be part of a Yugoslav nation, which is the way the first group identifies itself. People declaring themselves Yugoslavs are concentrated in [[Vojvodina]].

According to the 2011 census, some 23,303 people or 0.32% of the inhabitants of Serbia declared their ethnicity as Yugoslav.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Nacionalna%20pripadnost-Ethnicity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zaul''' ({{lang|gez|ዛውል}}, ''{{transl|sem|Zɐʿwəl}}'' {{IPA-gez|zaʕwəl|}}) are an [[Agaw people]] whom inhabit the [[Southern Region (Eritrea)|southern]] and [[Central Region (Eritrea)|central]] regions of [[Eritrea]], in a territory known as the [[Eritrean highlands]]. They are spread across several villages and have largely assimilated to other ethnic groups within the country.

==Overview==

Zauls were one of the Agaw subgroups that made up the ruling class during the [[Zagwe Dynasty]] (ዛጉዌ, directly translating to "Dynasty of the Agaw"). After the Solomonic dynasty succeeded the Zagwe dynasty in 1270, the Agaw were recompensed with permanent settlement in the historic district of [[Wag]]. Some of the Agaws migrated north of Ethiopia to modern-day Eritrea. The Agaw subgroups that settled in [[Eritrean highlands|Kebessa]] and [[Senhit]] are known as the Gebre TarKe, Adkeme Mliga, Liban and Zaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raka|first1=Michael Hasama|title=Zanta Eritra (tr. The Story of Eritrea)|date=1986|page=106|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Religion===

The majority of Zauls belong to the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. Others practice [[Eritrean Catholic Church|Eastern Catholicism]] and an even smaller population practice [[Protestantism]] or [[Islam]].

===Languages===

Most Zauls speak [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Tigre language|Tigre]], or [[Bilen language|Bilen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kidane|first1=Aida|title=The Zaul people|url=http://harep.org/Africa/The%20Zaul%20people(2).doc|website=The Horn of Africa Research and Knowledge Exchange Platform|publisher=Eritrean Human Rights Electronic Archive|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Agaw languages]] are spoken but used much less frequently.
