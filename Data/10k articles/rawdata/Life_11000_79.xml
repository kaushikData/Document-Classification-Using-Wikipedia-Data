==Music==

===2003-2006: Early Career===
360 made his first official appearance in 2003 on fellow Australian rapper Infallible's EP ''A Burning Ambition'', on the track "Situation Critical" along with MCs [[Hunter (rapper)|Hunter]] and Versa. The following year, he released his debut solo EP, titled ''Rarities'', in which three of its four tracks featured his rap partner and best friend [[Pez (musician)|Pez]].

In 2005, Pez and 360 released a song called "Nutcase", which 360 described as a "fuck around track [that was] written and recorded in one day. Trying to make you laugh, or cringe". 360 was featured on Sydney producers Weapon X and Ken Hell's 2006 mixtape ''Scar-Non III: Kick To The Head'' with the song "In Da Chub", a remix of [[50 Cent]]'s 2003 hit [[In da Club|"In Da Club"]].

===2007–2012: ''What You See Is What You Get'', ''Falling &amp; Flying''===
In February 2007, he signed to Soulmate Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/artists/ |title=Soulmate Records Artist Profiles |publisher=Soulmate Records |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |title=360 signs with Soulmate Records |publisher=Ground Up Hip-Hop |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921181046/http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |archivedate=21 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He released his debut album, ''What You See Is What You Get'', on 22 March 2008. An ''InTheMix'' reviewer found 360 "not only showcases his hilariously funny comedic side but demonstrates his ability to approach more serious and personal issues, producing a well rounded album".&lt;ref name="InTheMix"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | title = 360 ''What You See Is What You Get'' Album Launch | work = InTheMix | publisher = [[Sound Alliance]] | date = 12 April 2008 | accessdate = 2 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015013/http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | archive-date = 27 September 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video interview for ''Peak Street Magazine'', 360 described his musical style as a combination of "some [[pop music|pop]] influences, [[electro (music)|electro]], [[dubstep]], and unintelligent rhymes".&lt;ref name=ps-video&gt;{{cite web | last=James | first=Sam | title=360 Interview with ''Peak Street'' | url=http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131061052/http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | dead-url=yes | archive-date=31 January 2013 | work=Peak Street Magazine | accessdate=2 December 2012 | first2=Danny | last2=Haneman | first3=Aisha | last3=Glen | date=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2008, 360 released a music video of "Mamma Mia", which depicts his desire for [[Bec Hewitt]] and mocked her husband, [[Lleyton Hewitt]], which was the Video of the Week on MySpace.com's Australian hip hop page.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/song-slams-trophy-wife-bec/story-e6frf96x-1111115315578 | title=Rapper 360 makes Bec Hewitt lustful object of lyrics | publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]] ([[News Corporation]]) |work=[[Herald Sun]] | date=14 January 2008 | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/rapper-360-targets-bec-and-lleyton-hewitt-in-myspace-video/story-e6frewyr-1111115314399 | title=Rapper 360 targets Bec and Lleyton Hewitt in MySpace video | date=14 January 2008 | publisher=[[News Limited]] ([[News Corporation]]) | work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 described it as a comedic effort, "I wanted to take the piss out of them ... It's not meant to be taken too seriously she's not really my type". Management for the couple dismissed the rapper's effort as "a publicity stunt".&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

By March 2010, he remained signed with Soulmate Records, which had signed a distribution deal with [[EMI Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/soulmate-records-x-emi-partnership// |title=Soulmate Records partners with EMI |publisher=Soulmate Records | date=15 March 2010 | accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, his single, "Just Got Started" (featuring [[Pez (musician)|Pez]]), was released.&lt;ref name="iTunes10"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/just-got-started-feat.-pez/id406702982 | title = 'Just Got Started' (feat.

360's second album, ''[[Falling &amp; Flying]]'', was released on 30 September 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2011/01/13/144105_entertainment.html|title=360 is flying and falling...|publisher=[[The Cairns Post]]|date=13 January 2011|last=Kuch|first=Jesse|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reached No.&amp;nbsp;4 on the ARIA Albums Chart,&lt;ref name="AusCharts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=360 | title = Discography 360 | publisher = Australian Charts Portal.

By October 2012, ''Falling &amp; Flying'' was certified platinum by ARIA for shipments of 70,000 units,&lt;ref name="ARIA Alb Cert 2012"&gt;{{Cite certification|region=Australia|type=album|certyear=2012| accessdate = 2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was certified double platinum by July 2014.&lt;ref name="Jam"&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Jennings|title=360: Alive and Kicking|url=http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/360-alive-and-kicking|website=Rolling Stone Australia|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=2 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021113403/http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/360-alive-and-kicking|archive-date=21 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the fourth single from the album, "Boys like You" (featuring Gossling), was released, which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the Australian singles chart in February 2012.&lt;ref name="AusCharts"/&gt; The track also reached the top&amp;nbsp;40 of the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="NZCharts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://charts.org.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=360 | title = Discography 360 | publisher = New Zealand Charts Portal.

The national Australian "Flying Tour" occurred in support of the album, and 360 was supported by new Melbourne artist Bam Bam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bam Bam|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/bam-bam|website=triple j Unearthed|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–present: ''Utopia'' &amp; ''Vintage Modern''===
In June 2012, 360 revealed to national youth broadcaster [[Triple J]] that he was already working on his third album, describing the upcoming release as "quite a dark album". He described it further, "No one sees behind the scenes and there's been a lot of bad (expletive) going on in my family life and personal life". 360 hinted at a diverse production line-up for the album, saying he has "been getting a gang of beats from all different people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 readies "dark" new album|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3518538.htm|website=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video, published on 21 November 2013, served as the official press release for the launch of Forthwrite Records, a music label created by 360 and Pez. 360 then confirmed the announcement on his Facebook page the following day, stating that the label will release ''Don't Look Down'', by Pez, ''[[Utopia (360 album)|Utopia]]'', by 360, and the debut, yet untitled Forthwrite album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=360|title=22 November 2013|url=https://en-gb.facebook.com/3ree6ixty/posts/10153511253795367|website=360 on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORTHWRITE RECORDS Media Release 21 Nov 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRkQ8OvXr3A|website=FORTHWRITE on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his performance at the 2013 Sprung Hip Hop Festival, held in [[Brisbane]], Australia, 360 garnered media attention for the manner in which he introduced a new song titled "On A Planet No One Knows". According to 360, the song, which also features a vocal sample from [[Joss Whedon]] regarding gender equality, is "about racism in Australia."&lt;ref name="Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=WATCH: 360 – 'On A Planet No One Knows’|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/tv/watch-360-on-a-planet-no-one-knows/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's a lot of racist cunts in this country [Australia]. I don't know if people are proud to admit it, or what—but there is. No matter what colour or background we are, there are fuckheads in every single race. Generalising everyone is fucking ignorant and uneducated and stupid. If you're offended by this then you're probably fuckin' racist and you should fuck off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mike Hohnen|title=360 Calls Out Racist Australia During New Song At Sprung Hip Hop Festival|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/360-calls-out-racist-australia-during-new-song-at-sprung-hip-hop-festival/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2014, 360 supported the Australian tour of American rapper [[Eminem]], alongside [[Kendrick Lamar]]. 360 described the tour as a career highlight and explained to the media in January 2014 that it would be his first tour sober—he had previously struggled with drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lisa Visentin|title=360 announces tour of Australia|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/360-announces-tour-of-australia-20140527-zrpdp.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the artist's third album, ''Utopia'', on 13 June 2014, three singles were released: "Impossible", "On A Planet No One Knows" and "Sixavelli". "Impossible" is a collaboration with [[Daniel Johns]], of Australian band [[Silverchair]], and Johns also appears in the music video, in which he is a passenger in a car driven by 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Impossible (Ft Daniel Johns) Official Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU78NDpJt08|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A music video was also released for the second single and was published on the artist's YouTube channel during the week before [[Australia Day]].&lt;ref name="Plan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - ON A PLANET NO ONE KNOWS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUWJZSbGF7s|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for "Sixavelli" was directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and was published in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Sixavelli (Feat.

==Collaborations==
During the early years of his music career, 360 collaborated with Pez as part of a duo called "Forthwrite",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForthWrite - 'Guilty Conscience'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDxVFtjCxyI|website=PEZ on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a track called "The Club Song" on the 2010 album ''[[Good Gracious]]'', by producer [[M-Phazes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Gracious M-Phazes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/good-gracious/id359623656|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 also featured on Pez's 2008 single, "The Festival Song", which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;14 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart.&lt;ref name="The ARIA Report – 12 Jan 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20090120-0000/issue985.pdf | title = ARIA Report – 12th Jan 2009 | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | issue = 985 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | date = 12 January 2009 | accessdate = 2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 360 started an online musical project in the Australian hip hop scene, called "Rapper Tag", on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappertag.com:80/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712043422/http://www.rappertag.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Rapper Tag |publisher=360 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper Tag involves one person recording a portion of rap over a looped beat, and then nominating ("tagging") another person to add further rapping over the same loop. The process continued in accordance with the nomination of the next rapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3076379.htm |title=Triple J: 360 Rapper Tag Phenomenon |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.optimising.com.au/blog/interview-on-social-media-with-melbourne-rapper-360/|date=9 March 2011|author=Daniel  |title=Interview on Social Media with Melbourne Rapper 360 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian hip hop duo [[Diafrix]] collaborated with 360 for the song "I'm A Dreamer", which appears on the 2012 album ''Pocket Full Of Dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diafrix feat. 360 - I'm A Dreamer (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTRCDRkz34|website=diafrix lion on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 appeared on the self-titled debut album by Canberra producer, Ghosts in the Room, released on 14 September 2012 through Mudd Music. The album also features rappers Iron Solomon, Okwerdz and Kool G Rap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghosts in the Room Ghosts in the Room|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/ghosts-in-the-room/id537506609|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==
360 was a panel member for the 20 October 2014 edition of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) program ''[[Q&amp;A (Australian talk show)|Q&amp;A]]''. He appeared alongside [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], a particle physicist, [[Richard Gill (conductor)|Richard Gill]], renowned conductor, and [[Nalini Joshi]], a notable Australian mathematician, to discuss the topic of "passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=gregmoskovitch|title=Get The Popcorn, 360 Is A Panelist On Next Monday's Q&amp;A|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/421594/360-will-appear-next-mondays-qa.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 garnered media attention for his comments on the television program regarding racism in relation to Australia, Australian hip hop and the Australian flag. When questioned by the presenter, 360 replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Australia Day, you see dudes walking around with their tops off, and they're getting on the drink and all that. And they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck. I've seen it so many times; like, I've been in a taxi where we've pulled up because these dickheads have been walking across the road—they just start yelling at the taxi driver, like: "Get out of the country! This is not your country!" ... And they're wearing Australian flags. I've seen it so much, like, growing up ... still today, you know what I mean?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian flag represents racism: 360|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dndT4vq5CpE|website=ABC News (Australia) on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This response caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#BBCTrending: Has Australia's flag been co-opted by racists?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-29712614|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the transference of the media spotlight onto Pez, who made comments on social media following 360's appearance. In addition to a message of support for his friend and musical collaborator, Pez also wrote that he also "got a bit offended"; however, he subsequently removed the sentence "To be honest, even I got a bit offended." from his original Facebook post. As of 24 October 2014, 360 had not retracted his ''Q&amp;A'' comments and explained after the airing of the episode: "If you are not racist then you have nothing to be offended about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nastassia Baroni|title=Pez Admits To Being "Offended" By 360's 'Q&amp;A' Comments|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/pez-admits-to-being-offended-by-360s-qa-comments/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{outdated section|date=September 2016}}
At the age of 18 years, 360 contracted a disease of his right eye, a [[cornea transplant]], which "left him with fuzzy vision" in that eye.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; A July 2014 feature article in ''Rolling Stone Australia'' stated that he is "legally blind in his right eye", while his left eye is "slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus".&lt;ref name="Jam" /&gt;

On 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a [[go-kart]]ing accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists [[Bliss n Eso]]. He suffered a torn [[artery]], lacerated [[pancreas]] and a damaged [[scrotum]].&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cameron|title=Accident brings 360 perspective|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/accident-brings-360-perspective/story-e6frfn09-1226152049520|work=news.com.au| publisher = News Limited (News Corporation) | date = 29 September 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rapper, "It [scrotum] wasn't ruptured, but it was ripped open ... The first thing I checked once I woke up was I didn't need to use a colostomy bag. My sex life is intact. There's no sex appeal if you use a colostomy bag".&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

On 13 February 2012, 360 and Crystal Bale became engaged;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapper 360 Is Engaged To Crystal Bale!|url=http://www.take40.com/news/29098/rapper-360-is-engaged-to-crystal-bale!|work=take40.com|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 Is Engaged!|url=http://www.novafm.com.au/article/360-engaged|work=novafm.com.au|accessdate=18 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504133510/http://www.novafm.com.au/article/360-engaged|archive-date=4 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pair then separated on 24 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=@crystallouu|url=https://twitter.com/crystallouu/status/283034663667257345|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 degrees of separation for rapper 360 and fiancee Crystal Bale |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/degrees-of-separation-for-rapper-360-and-fiancee-crystal-bale/story-e6frewz0-1226543747857|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

360 and Bale promoted awareness of suicide and depression issues. In mid-February 2012, he posted a video clip with the following statement: "I don't usually drop serious videos, but this is something I'm passionate about spreading awareness about. Even if you hate me, this has nothing to do with music—please share this around so as many people as possible can see it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapper 360 Speaks Out About Suicide |url=http://www.take40.com/artists/5752/360/news/29226/watch:-rapper-360-speaks-out-about-suicide |work=take40.com |accessdate=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Bale posted her video, 'A Message from Crystal', which Beats Factory{{'}}s Robyn Morrison described as footage of Bale "talking about how she has been affected by suicide—multiple times ...

On 8 January 2016, 360 posted a song named ''I'm Sorry'' onto his [[Facebook]] page. It talked about his [[codeine]] addiction. His addiction resulted in him cancelling tours without notice. In the song 360 mentions how he didn't tell anyone because he felt like a burden. Because he was addicted to [[Nurofen Plus]], the pills could be bought without a prescription.&lt;ref name="imsorry1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/melbourne-rapper-360-explains-how-prescription-drugs-almost-killed-him/news-story/1c867df0f625977f7dffcc8d63d8a08d|title=Melbourne rapper 360 explains how prescription drugs almost killed him|date=11 January 2016|access-date=16 January 2016|website=[[news.com.au]]|first1=Rohan|last1=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imsorry2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/music-videos/rappers-brutally-honest-painkiller-addiction-confession/news-story/b2e5a9077fe976f15716bba1630e10ee|title=Rapper’s brutally honest painkiller addiction confession|website=[[news.com.au]]|first=Emma|last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title card of ''A Short Vision''.
]]
'''''A Short Vision''''' is a British animated film by Joan and [[Peter Foldes]] released in 1956. The film, inspired by one of Peter's poems, depicts the destruction of mankind. The film's music was composed by [[Matyas Seiber]], who composed music for ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' two years earlier.

''A Short Vision'' gained notoriety when it was shown on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on 25 May 1956. This, however, made it controversial. Due to popular demand, it was shown again on 10 June.

==Origins==
''A Short Vision'' was inspired by a poem composed by Peter Foldes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conelrad.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/short-vision-ed-sullivans-atomic-show.html|title=A SHORT VISION: Ed Sullivan’s Atomic Show Stopper|website=conelrad.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on a boat from Australia in October 1954. Peter was creative artist for the film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while his wife Joan was responsible for the [[animation stand]], the lighting and some of the animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The film was produced in the Foldes' kitchen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was funded by the [[British Film Institute|British Film Institute's Experimental Film Fund]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=BFI|title=A Short Vision (1956) {{!}} BFI National Archive|date=2009-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkhNED3-mnI|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme also funded an earlier Foldes' animation entitled ''Animated Genesis'' about a society which is under threat from a tyrant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:It itself, from A Short Vision.png|thumb|upright 1.17|''It'', itself.]]
The film opens with a shot from a bedroom window. It pans to the sky as the narrator (James McKechnie) recalls the time he looked out his window. He saw an object flying through the sky. Throughout the film the object is only referred to as ''It''. Although ''It'' was very far away and seemed to move slowly, it came swiftly and was unnoticed. When ''It'' flew over the mountain, the leopard and the deer looked up. When they saw ''It,'' the deer ran free from the leopard's claws and they both hide in fear. When ''It'' flew over the fields, the owl and the rat looked up, and the rat ran free of the owl's claws and they both hide in fear.

When ''It'' flew over the city, everyone was asleep except for their leaders and their wise men, who all looked up at ''It,'' but it was too late. ''It'' produces a mushroom cloud engulfing the city, killing and destroying the wise men, the leaders, the owl, the leopard, the rat and the deer. ''It'' also destroys the sleeping people. ''It'' then engulfs the mountain and the fields; destroying them. When it was all over, there was nothing left except a tiny flame. Then the narrator sees ''It'' flying around the flame like a moth, and then ''It'' too is destroyed. And then, the flame died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==''The Ed Sullivan Show''==
[[File:The mushroom cloud produced by It ; from A Short Vision.png|thumb|upright 1.17|The mushroom cloud produced by ''It.'']][[Ed Sullivan]] was originally in England when he saw ''A Short Vision''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and promised an American showing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sullivan said his motive was a "plea for peace".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he may have shown it because of his relationship with George K. Arthur, the person who sold ''A Short Vision'' for the television and as well as cinemas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 10 days after he saw it&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; on 27 May 1956, [[Ed Sullivan]] showed ''A Short Vision'' on his popular Sunday night show ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the first screening Sullivan told the audience to tell their children in the room to not be alarmed, because of its animated nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the film was controversial{{By whom|date=May 2018}}; hence, its popularity. Due to its popularity the film was shown again on 10 June. However, before showing it, Sullivan told parents to take children out of the room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sullivan was incorrect{{By whom|date=May 2018}} when he first said ''A Short Vision'' depicted the effects of a [[H-Bomb]] on an "animal population".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The film actually depicts the effects of a H-Bomb on humans and animals; not just animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This leads some to believe{{Who|date=May 2018}} that he did not watch the entirety of ''A Short Vision'' before airing it on his show.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''A Single Man''''' is a 2009 American [[Drama (modern genre)|drama film]] based on the [[A Single Man (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Christopher Isherwood]]. It is directed by [[Tom Ford]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] and stars [[Colin Firth]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his portrayal of George Falconer, a [[depression (mood)|depressed]] [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[British people|British]] university [[professor]] living in [[Southern California]] in 1962.

The film premiered on September 11, 2009 at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]], and went on the film festival circuit. After it screened at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival|34th Toronto International Film Festival]], [[The Weinstein Company]] picked it up for distribution in the United States and Germany. An initial [[Limited release|limited run]] in the United States commenced on December 11, 2009, to qualify it for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] with a [[Wide release|wider release]] in early 2010.&lt;ref name="Variety.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008654.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Weinsteins engage ''Single Man'' |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Michael |last=Fleming |first2=Sharon |last2=Swart |date=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
On November 30, 1962, a month after the [[Cuban missile crisis]], George Falconer is a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim, at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. He bends down to kiss his dead lover. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening.

George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley, who projects lightheartedness despite her also being miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. At times, he recalls his sixteen-year-long relationship with Jim.

During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter, who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos. That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George.

George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. While watching Kenny, George discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a voiceover explains that he has rediscovered the ability "to feel, rather than think". As he makes peace with his grief, George suffers a heart attack and dies, while envisioning Jim appearing and kissing him.

Retrieved October 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot in 21 days, according to "The Making of ''A Single Man''" on the DVD.

== Marketing controversy ==
An early theatrical poster for ''A Single Man'' featured a close-up shot of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore lying side by side, their arms and shoulders touching. This led to speculation that the work's gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film's original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley. Also deleted were a shot of George staring into a male student's eyes, while keeping a shot of George staring into the eyes of a female student, shots of George meeting hustler Carlos outside a liquor store, and shots of George and Kenny running nude into the ocean.&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/a_tale_of_two_trailers_the_de-gaying_of_a_single_man/# |title=A Tale of Two Trailers: The De-Gaying of ''A Single Man'' |work=Indiewire |date=October 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/julianne-moore-on-the-de-gaying-of-a-single-man/ |title=Julianne Moore on the De-Gaying of ''A Single Man'' |work=[[BlackBook]] |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, "I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks. You can't have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn't an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Gregg |url=http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=film&amp;article=704 |title=A singular man |work=Ebar |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Colin Firth said, "[The marketing] is deceptive. I don't think they should do that because there's nothing to sanitize. It's a beautiful story of love between two men and I see no point in hiding that. People should see it for what it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Voss |first=Brandon |url=http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/Film/Men_Behind_A_Single_Man/Colin_Firth_Singled_Out |title=Colin Firth: Singled Out |work=Advocate |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711053025/http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/Film/Men_Behind_A_Single_Man/Colin_Firth_Singled_Out/ |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvey Weinstein]] would only say, when asked about marketing a gay romance, "''Brokeback Mountain'' did pretty well. ''Midnight Cowboy'' did pretty well. If you know how to market, you can market. There's an audience for it." When pressed about the poster, Weinstein cut off the interview, saying, "I'm good. You got enough. Thank you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vilensky |first=Mike |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/11/harvey_weinstein_explains_a_si.html |title=Harvey Weinstein Explains ''A Single Man''{{'}}s Marketing, Sort of |work=NYMag.com |date=November 7, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Knegt of ''[[Indiewire]]'' suggested that The Weinstein Company "de-gayed" the trailer to better the film's chances of receiving [[Academy Award]] nominations.&lt;ref name="Indie" /&gt;

The film has received an overall positive reception from critics, with most reviews singling out Colin Firth's performance. It currently holds an 85% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 175 reviews, with the site's consensus being that "Though the costumes are beautiful and the art direction impeccable, what stands out most from this debut by fashion designer Tom Ford is the leading performance by Colin Firth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/1218217-single_man |title=''A Single Man'' (2009) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=December 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709014029/http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/1218217-single_man/ |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] has compiled an average score of 77 (generally favorable reviews) from 35 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/singleman |title=''A Single Man'' (2009) |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote "Some films aren’t revelations, exactly, but they burrow so deeply into old truths about love and loss and the mess and thrill of life, they seem new anyway"&lt;ref name="Ryll2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Alexander Ryll |year=2014 |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, ''A Single Man'' |work=Gay-Themed-Films.com |publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/films-to-watch-a-single-man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Mondello of [[NPR]] commented “An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame of A Single Man.”&lt;ref name="Ryll2014" /&gt; Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote “Everything fits perfectly, from titles to fin, but most of all Colin Firth, who dons the role of George like a fine bespoke suit.”&lt;ref name="Ryll2014" /&gt;

Critics who liked the film include ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' film critic Nathan Rabin, who gave the film an A- score, arguing that "''A Single Man'' is a film of tremendous style wedded to real substance, and rooted in "Firth's affecting lead performance as a man trying to keep it together for one last day after his world has fallen apart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/a-single-man,36227 |title=''A Single Man'' review |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |date=December 10, 2009 |work=A.

He betrays very little emotion, and certainly his thoughts cannot be read in his eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091223/REVIEWS/912239995 |title=''A Single Man'' review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">'''Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri''' was an Arab governor of [[Al-Andalus]] during two periods from 732 to 734 and from 740 to 742. 

Abd al-Malik was a very wealthy member of a noble Arab family. Spurred by critics who decried his lack of military victories, he led an expedition north to [[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]], where a Frankish or Aquitanian party had taken over after the [[Battle of Poitiers]]. Despite his failure to capture the Basque fortress, he left troops to invest it, and decided to continue his way north across the Pyrenees, where he engaged the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basques]] in skirmishes and was eventually overcome, but managed to escape back to [[Al-Andalus]].

After being deposed and incarcerated by his successor [[Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj]] or possibly the governor of [[Ifriqiya]] ("''was bound in chains''"), he made his way back to prominence in 740, when he was appointed wali (governor) of Al-Andalus again after the former´s natural death. This time he had to deal with serious Berber rebellion in North Africa, expanded now to Iberia too. The governor saw no option but to take the Syrian troops commanded by his adversary [[Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri]] as ally to quash the rebellion, so putting down the uprisings. 

However, ultimately Balj ibn Bishr had him arrested in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]] for former grievances, put him to a horrible death in 742, and had him crucified on the outskirts of the city flanked by a similarly killed pig and dog on either side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1983 | title = Early Medieval Spain | publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York|isbn= 0-312-22464-8|page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf II of Holstein''' ({{circa|1128}} &amp;ndash; 6 July 1164) was the [[Count of Schauenburg]] and [[Holstein]] from 1130 until his death, though he was briefly out of Holstein from 1137 until 1142. He succeeded his father [[Adolf I of Holstein|Adolf I]] under the regency of his mother, Hildewa.

After the death of the [[Emperor Lothair II]] (1137), the new king, [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], granted the [[Duchy of Saxony]] to [[Albert the Bear]]. Adolf was consequently deprived of Holstein because he was a [[House of Welf|Welf]] supporter and refused to recognise Albert as duke. He only received it back in 1142 when Conrad and [[Henry the Lion]] were reconciled.

In 1143, Henry and Adolf divided the rule of the conquered [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] lands to their east. Adolf received [[Wagria]] with its chief city, the castle of [[Sigberg]], built by Lothair, and Henry received [[Polabia]] with [[Ratzeburg]] as its capital. Sigberg became Adolf's chief fortress and most regular seat. Adolf promoted Christianity in his new lands, especially through the missionary work of [[Vicelinus]]. Adolf, encouraged by Lothair, promoted German colonisation of his Slavic territories, especially with colonists from not only his own lands but also from [[Westphalia]], [[Flanders]], [[Holland]], [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Utrecht]], and [[Frisia]].

In 1143 or 1144, Adolf built [[Lübeck]], the first German port on the [[Baltic Sea]]. Adolf also built the first castle (1143) in Lübeck: a [[Motte-and-bailey|wood and earth construction]]. In 1157, Lübeck was burned and rebuilt by Henry the Lion, to whom Adolf transferred it in 1159.

Adolf supported [[Sweyn III of Denmark]] against the claimant [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] in a dispute over the [[King of Denmark|Danish throne]]. Canute, with the help of [[Etheler von Dithmarschen]], attacked Holstein and burned [[Oldenburg in Holstein]], devastating the German north coast.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 1159, Adolf accompanied the [[Emperor Frederick I]] into Italy and in 1164 he aided Henry the Lion against the [[Obotrites]], dying in the [[Battle of Verchen]]. He was buried in [[Minden]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Adolf III of Holstein|Adolf III]], under the regency of his widow, Mechtild of Schwarzburg-Käfernburg.

Journalists spread gossip about her turbulent personal life and an alleged [[espionage]] role in [[World War II]].

== Early life ==
Asmahan was born to Fahd al-Atrash, a [[Syria]]n [[Druze]] from [[As-Suwayda|Suwayda]], and 'Alia al-Mundhir, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Druze from [[Hasbaya]].&lt;ref name="Enchantment 83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|1998|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father came from the Druze [[al-Atrash]] [[clan]], well known in Syria for its role in fighting against the [[French mandate of Syria|French]] occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Provence|first=Michael |title=The great Syrian revolt and the rise of Arab nationalism|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2005|edition=illustrated|pages=72|isbn=978-0-292-70680-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ej8ZMk1822sC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=sultan+al+atrash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asmahan's father supposedly served as governor of the district of [[Demirci]] in [[Turkey]], during the last days of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Asmahan's father, fled the country with his children and pregnant wife. On 25 November 1912, they embarked on a ship from [[İzmir]] to [[Beirut]], and Asmahan was born on board. She was named "Amal", meaning "hopes". She was also called "Emily", but always preferred the name "Amal". After the French came into power, the family returned to [[Jabal al-Druze (state)|Jabal al-druze]].&lt;ref name="Enchantment 83"/&gt;

Following the [[Adham Khanjar|Adham Khanjar incident]] in 1922, the al-Atrash home in [[al-Qurayya|al-Qrayya]] (a town in [[Jabal al-Druze]]) was bombed by French forces. 'Alia fled with her children to [[Damascus]] and, despite orders from Fahd, refused to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|pp=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asmahan later recalled her childhood years in Jabal al-Druze as "untouched by anything truly bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  'Alia and the three children travelled to [[Beirut]], but, after discovering that the French were searching for them there, they stopped in [[Haifa]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and travelled from there to Egypt, where she sought Political Asylum for her and her three children; they were later granted the right of Political Asylum in 1926 by the Egyptian Government, thus naturalized as Egyptian citizens.&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000 p=38-39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration to Egypt===
[[File:Aleya Al Menzer and her Children.jpg|thumb|right|'Alia and her children after arrival in Egypt]]
'Alia chose to immigrate to [[Cairo]], because 'Alia knew that Egypt's then [[nationalist]] prime minister [[Saad Zaghloul]] and her husband's relative, [[Sultan al-Atrash]] were on corresponding terms.&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000 p=38-39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|WoFmMGNOxLs|Interview with Fuad al-Atrash. Time 4:34.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to family accounts, 'Alia was permitted to enter Egypt under the sponsorship of Saad Zaghloul.  Many other Syrians and Lebanese were present in Egypt in this period.

Asmahan and her family first lived in an apartment in a humble section of Cairo. Her mother did laundry and sewing to support the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had an excellent voice, could play the [[Oud|`ud]], sang at parties and made some recordings.  Asmahan and her brothers attended a French Catholic school.  In order to receive waivers for the high cost of tuition, 'Alia registered them under the alias ''Kusah'' (meaning "courgette") rather than trying to convince school officials that members of the wealthy{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} al-Atrash family were destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|pp=41, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  'Alia received a monthly stipend from a secret benefactor rumored to be [[Charles Richard Crane|"Baron" Crane]] (of the [[King–Crane Commission]]) according to one Egyptian journalist.  This allowed her to cover the costs of her children's school's tuition, and a nicer apartment on Habib Shalabi Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|pp=42, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Musical debut===
[[File:Farid Asmahan.jpg|thumb|Asmahan and her brother Farid]]
Amal's vocal talent was discovered at an early age. Once, when her brother Farid received one of Egypt's most famous composers, Dawood Hosni, in their home, the latter overheard her singing in her room, and insisted on seeing her immediately. He then asked her to sing again. He was much impressed by the performance, and suggested the stage name of Asmahan to her.  Amal began using that name.

Asmahan rose to fame quickly: she was not even fourteen (or seventeen, since her birth date is disputed) years old when she was introduced to the public at a concert at the prestigious [[Cairo Opera House]].&lt;ref name="Images of Enchantment. p. 82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exzuhasp.html|title=University of Texas Press|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She sang and recorded songs composed by Farid Ghosn, Dawood Hosni, Mohamed El Qasabgi, and Zakariyya Ahmad.  At sixteen, Asmahan was invited by an Egyptian record company to make her first album, featuring her first song "Ya Nar Fouadi" by Farid Ghosn.

A variety of teachers advanced her vocal and musical studies.  Hosni volunteered to instruct Asmahan on how to play the [[oud]]; Qasabgi comments however on the mature level of her sight reading and musicality by the time she performed his work, some years later.  However, her brothers wanted her to marry and return to Syria.   Her cousin, Hassan al-Atrash travelled to Egypt, intending to propose to a different relative, however, once he saw Asmahan, he pursued her and she returned to Syria for at least five and half years, interrupting her musical career.

===Egypt's influence===
Since Asmahan sang in Egypt, the lyrics of her songs were written in classical Arabic and in a more colloquial Arabic, but she also sang in the Eastern dialect of Arabic. Asmahan was particularly fond of performing songs by [[Umm Kulthoum]] and [[Mohamed Abdel Wahab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Taba'i|2008|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Taba'i|2008|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked to sing about cultural patriotism and love, she sang of Egypt."&lt;ref name="Asmahan's Secrets. p. 216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since singers and studios depended on the elites, Asmahan had to sing songs on uplifting nationalist themes or in praise of the Egyptian royal family.&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000 p=13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of her career she sang in the nightclub owned by Mary Mansour.

Asmahan's older brother, Fuad, and other Druze relatives considered a career in entertainment for a girl to be disgraceful.&lt;ref name="Images of Enchantment. p. 82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For them, culturally, "Egypt was a planetary distance from the small villages of the Druze."&lt;ref name="Asmahan's Secrets. p. 54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was difficult for her relatives to accept Asmahan's integration into the heterogeneous Egyptian social scene.  The clearly defined divisions, along religious lines, of the Syrian countryside did not operate in Egypt.  During the period when she was married to her cousin, Hassan, and then later in 1941, when she remarried him and returned to Egypt  her musical career came to a standstill. When the marriage first broke up, she left for Egypt immediately, even before she had obtained the bill of divorce.&lt;ref name="Asmahan's Secrets. p. 98"/&gt; With her return to Egypt and a singing career,  she finally repudiated "respectability", leaving both her relatives and Syrian Druze society furious.  When her first film, ''Intisar al-Shabab'', was released in Syria, one young Druze shot at the screen when the character played by Asmahan appeared.&lt;ref name="Asmahan's Secrets. p. 98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asmahan, bi-national or, in contemporary parlance, trans-national by then, had become "a sophisticated ''foreigner'' to the young men in the Jabal Druze."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1933 Asmahan's cousin, [[Hassan al-Atrash]], came to Cairo and proposed marriage, requesting that Asmahan abandon her musical career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Taba'i|2008|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; She agreed on three conditions: that they live in Damascus rather than [[Jabal al-Druze]], winter in Cairo, and that she would never be required to wear the traditional [[hijab]].&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydFpAAAAMAAJ|title=Steel and Silk|first=Sami M.|last=Moubayed|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Cune Press, LLC|accessdate=5 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married and moved first to [[Ira, Syria|'Ara]] where the al-Atrash retain a large home, and then built their own home in Suwayda.  Asmahan gave birth to her daughter, Kamellia. Eventually, Asmahan missed her career and her life in Cairo;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1939, she and Hassan were divorced. In her final confrontation with her cousin at [[Mena House Oberoi|Mena House]] Hotel in [[Giza]], she told him, "I stood with you for independence and liberation, I did. But, I was created for another purpose. I prefer the work of Farid, and the work of Umm Kulthum, and of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She returned to Cairo and resumed her singing career, entering a short marriage to Egyptian director [[Ahmed Badrkhan]].

In 1941 she returned to Syria in a dramatic and secret journey under the auspices of the British.  Hassan agreed to meet with her, and used the occasion to successfully entreat her to remarry him.  During the time they were married, she twice attempted suicide.  Tabloid newspapers suggested that this was so that she could obtain a second divorce from Hassan; however it seemed he actually agreed due to her visits to Jerusalem where wild rumours attached to her behaviour and overspending. Her third and final marriage was to the Egyptian director [[Ahmed Salem]], supposedly to facilitate her return to Egypt over impositions by government authorities.  It is unclear how that would occur, however, and she had an ongoing studio contract in Egypt. Asmahan was close friends with the al Othman family and met with them when she travelled to Haifa, Palestine, when they helped her.
Also in 1941, Asmahan met Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Egypt's most distinguished singer and composer, and starred with him in his operetta ''Magnun Layla'' ("''Besotted with Layla''").&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/933/ee2.htm  Baraka, Mohamed.  Al-Ahram Weekly. Issue #933. 2009-02-05.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725070959/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/933/ee2.htm |date=July 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel Wahab introduced her to the journalist, Mohamed al-Taba'i, who suggests that she was in love with him, but the tone of his writing indicates that he was in love with her, but did not respect her.  He suggests she had affairs or at least an ongoing relationship with the royal chamberlain [[Ahmed Hassanein|Ahmed Pasha Hassanein]] but this might be exaggerated.  Her brothers, Fuad and Farid, were no longer able to monitor her movements.&lt;ref name="Enchantment 83"/&gt;  Her brother was a noted gambler; she and her friends also partied, smoked, drank and gambled.  She became very ill for a period, but recordings show that her voice did not suffer.

Asmahan was proud of her family background,&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000 p=13"/&gt; and always mentioned her father and his cousin, [[Sultan al-Atrash]], to clarify her ancestry — once saying to al-Taba'i, after he had just insulted her, "Don't you know who I am? Why I am the daughter of Fahd al-Atrash and cousin to the Amir al-Atrash and the Druze revolutionary hero Sultan al-Atrash.&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000 p=37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Taba'i|2008|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asmahan was not a first cousin of Hassan's, but referred to him as "ibn 'ammi" to the Egyptians, in fact, she was his second cousin, twice removed (by generation).&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000 p=37"/&gt;

== Vocal characteristics ==
{{Original research section|date=July 2009}}
[[File:Asmahan photo.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Asmahan]]
Asmahan's noted wide vocal range included [[contralto]] and dramatic [[mezzo-soprano]] (as one can hear in her rendition of "Ya Tuyur" where she reaches a high A with ease and brio). Asmahan's voice has been compared to Fairuz and Sabah. However, as she began her career more than two decades earlier, she had not in fact, adopted the Italian singing technique known as [[bel canto]], but rather learned singing from many admirable models of her own period and in Egypt where a much more diverse group of singers performed, and at a time when Arabic singing utilized both nasal and chest resonance.

Asmahan's voice was powerful, but also agile.  She generally sang in her chest register but could use her head register and sing in a very controlled tone.  It is not incorrect to say that she was the first or one of the first Arabic singers to use the classical western technique, also very few performers are able to alternate two different styles of interpretation and technique in one song (western and arab).&lt;ref name="Zuhur"&gt;Zuhur&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in World War II ==
In 1941, during [[World War II]], Asmahan returned to the [[French Mandate of Syria]] (Syria, then under the rule of [[Vichy France]]) at the request of the British and the Free French.  She was on a secret mission to notify her people in Jabal al-Druze that the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Free French forces]] would be invading [[Syria]] through their territory, and to convince them they should not fight.  The British and Free French had promised the independence of Syria and Lebanon to all inhabitants on the date of the invasion.  The [[Druze]] agreed, even though some groups did not receive word in time and fought the invading forces.  After the Allies secured [[Syria]] during the [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria-Lebanon Campaign]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited Syria.  When the Allies failed to carry out their promise for Syrian independence, Asmahan tried to contact the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] in Turkey, but was stopped at the border and sent to Lebanon. It was also possible that Asmahan needed money because her husband had cut off her expenses, so she may have tried to reach the Germans simply to obtain funds.&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000"/&gt;

Asmahan told Mohamed al-Taba'i that she was to receive the sum of £40,000 from the British for her services to the allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Taba'i|2008|pp=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[al-Raida]]'', Beirut University College, Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cSAqAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=asmahan+nazli&amp;dq=asmahan+nazli p.42.]&lt;/ref&gt;  General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s representative in Cairo was General [[Georges Catroux]].  Catroux's délégué in Damascus, Colonel Collet, stated that the British gave money to Asmahan (and to other Druze men, in his presence) and sent her to the Jabal to secure the support of the Druze before the Allies' invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NvPEnnpsnwC|title=Syria's Quest for Independence, 1939-1945|first=Salma Mardam|last=Bey|date=1 September 1997|publisher=Ithaca|accessdate=5 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same information is stated by [[Edward Spears]] in his memoirs.&lt;ref name="Zuhur"/&gt;

== Death ==
On 14 July 1944, a car carrying Asmahan and a female friend crashed and went into a canal at the side of the road, after the driver lost control near the city of [[Mansoura]], Egypt.&lt;ref name="Zuhur 2000"/&gt; The car was a two-door model and the women were sitting in the backseat.  They were presumed to be rendered unconscious and subsequently drowned. The driver, however, managed to escape.

These circumstances gave rise to many suspicions, rumours and conspiracy theories.   British intelligence, for example, after many reports circulated claiming she had been working for them, was accused of having got rid of her after she had attempted to meet with German agents. The German [[Gestapo]] was also accused of murdering her for the help she had given the British. Her husband at the time had fought violently with her, and her family's honour had been besmirched by the many rumours.

Asmahan was buried in Egypt in accordance with her wishes&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zuhur|2000|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; as, years later, were her two brothers, Fouad and [[Farid al-Atrash]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalarabicmusic.com/fareed_al_atrach.htm Classical Arabic Music Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912032423/http://www.classicalarabicmusic.com/fareed_al_atrach.htm |date=2010-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Fustat|Fustat plain]] in Cairo, which she and brother Farid, along with Egyptian crooner [[Abdel Halim Hafez]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/943/ee1.htm Baraka, Mohamed.  Al-Ahram Newspaper Article.

== Legacy ==
The [[Egyptian Media Production City]] and a private investor jointly produced a television series depicting the life (and death) of Asmahan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thawra.alwehda.gov.sy/_print_veiw.asp?FileName=45775321720080802231457|title=صحيفة الثورة|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arabic series debuted during the month of Ramadan in 2008. Asmahan was played by Syrian actress [[Sulaf Fawakherji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/|title=Homepage|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 2015, Google celebrated Asmahan's 103rd birthday using a Google doodle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asmahan’s 103rd Birthday|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/asmahans-103rd-birthday|website=Google|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became the first victim of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in August 1966, when she was beaten to death with wooden sticks by her students, who were led by [[Song Binbin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,483023,00.html The Chinese Cultural Revolution; Remembering Mao's Victims] 05/15/2007 Spiegel&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her death, Bian had been the party leader at the school, but was denounced as a "counter-revolutionary revisionist" by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]

A documentary about her, ''[[Though I am Gone]]'', was released in 2006. [[Song Binbin]], the student leader who beat Bian to death, was sent to the United States to study on government sponsorship and invited back to Beijing Normal University as a prominent alumni. Song's father was the mayor of Beijing and a high member of the Chinese Communist Party. She has openly and widely spoken about her successful academic career, much before any formal or informal apology came forward.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18867">'''Capital punishment in the [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippines]]''' has a varied history and is currently suspended as of 2006.  Capital punishment was legal after independence and increased in use under the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] regime.  After the fall of Marcos, there was a moratorium on capital punishment from 1987 to 1999, followed by a resumption in executions from 1999 to 2006, and followed - in turn - by a law ending the practice. 

Filipinos have mixed opinions about the [[death penalty]], with many opposing it on religious and humanitarian grounds, while advocates see it as a way of deterring crimes.

==Spanish and American periods==
[[Image:Garrote Execution - 1901.png|thumb|A 1901 execution at the Old [[Bilibid Prison]], [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]
During [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonial rule]], the most common methods of execution were death by [[firing squad]] (especially for treason/military crimes, usually reserved for independence fighters) and [[garrotte]] (a notable case would be the [[Gomburza]]). [[Death by hanging]] was another popular method.

A prominent example is the [[National hero of the Philippines|national hero]], [[José Rizal]], who was executed by firing squad on the morning of December 30, 1896, in the [[Rizal Park|park that now bears his name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean |first=John |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3337273.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; From Our Own Correspondent &amp;#124; Philippines 'restores' death penalty |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-12-21 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, the [[electric chair]] ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]: ''silla eléctrica''; [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''silya eléktrika'') was introduced by the [[United States]]' colonial [[Insular Government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galvin|first=Anthony|title=Old Sparky: The Electric Chair and the History of the Death Penalty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZduLDAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-5107-1135-8|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ZduLDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT158&amp;dq=%22in+1926,+the+US+authorities+introduced+the+electric+chair%22 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the Philippines the only other country to employ this method. The last colonial-era execution took place under [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]] in February 1932. There were no executions under [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the first [[President of the Philippines|President]] of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://malacanang.gov.ph/255-the-sesquicentennial-of-dr-jose-rizals-birth-an-introduction/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709000009/http://malacanang.gov.ph/255-the-sesquicentennial-of-dr-jose-rizals-birth-an-introduction/ |date=July 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1946-1986==
The capital crimes after regaining full sovereignty in July 1946 were murder, [[rape]] and treason. However, no executions took place until April 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19500427&amp;id=_L4hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Dp0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3164,3276454|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Julio Gullien was executed for attempting to assassinate President [[Manuel Roxas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19500426&amp;id=N7MyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4OsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4710,2584768] {{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable cases includes Marciál "Baby" Ama, electrocuted at the age of 16 on October 4, 1961, for murders committed while in prison for lesser charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dokumentaryonijuantagalog.weebly.com/history-of-public-enemy.html |title=History of Public Enemy |publisher=Dokumentaryonijuantagalog.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ama notably became the subject of the popular 1976 film, ''[[Bitayin si... Baby Ama!]]'' (Execute Baby Ama!).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88uWuJGJd_Q |title=Bitayin si... Baby Ama!

A former powerful Governor of [[Negros Occidental]] Rafael Lacson and 22 of his allies, condemned to die in August 1954 for the murder of a political opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820089-2,00.html |title=The Philippines: Justice for the Governor |publisher=Time |date=1954-09-06 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Lacson was never executed. 
 
In total, 51 people were electrocuted up to 1961. Execution numbers climbed under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who was himself sentenced to death in 1939 for the murder of [[Julio Nalundasan]]—the political rival of his father, [[Mariano Marcos|Mariano]]; the young Ferdinand was acquitted on appeal. A notorious triple execution took place in May 1972, when Jaime José, Basilio Pineda and Edgardo Aquino were electrocuted for the 1967 abduction and [[gang-rape]] of young actress [[Maggie dela Riva]]. The state ordered that the executions be broadcast on national television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video48.blogspot.com/2008/07/may-17-1972-maggie-de-la-riva-rape-case.html|title=Video 48: May 17, 1972: The Maggie de la Riva Rape Case, Part 3: 3 Die in Chair at Muntinlupa|first=Video|last=48|date=22 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Marcos regime, [[drug trafficking]] also became punishable by death by firing squad, such as the case with Lim Seng, whose execution in January 15, 1973, was also ordered broadcast on national television. Future President and then Chief of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] Gen. [[Fidel V. Ramos]] was present at the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/letterstotheeditor/view/20090112-182765/Lim-Sengs-execution |title=Lim Seng’s execution |publisher=Opinion.inquirer.net |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2014-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234548/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/letterstotheeditor/view/20090112-182765/Lim-Sengs-execution |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric chair was used until 1976, when execution by firing squad eventually replaced it as the sole method of execution. Under Marcos' 20-year authoritarian rule, however, [[desaparecidos|countless more people]] were summarily executed, tortured or simply disappeared for opposition to his rule. {{POV statement|date=October 2012}}l

After Marcos [[People Power Revolution|was deposed]] in 1986, the newly drafted [[1987 Constitution]] prohibited the death penalty but allowed the Congress to reinstate it "hereafter" for "heinous crimes"; making the Philippines the first Asian country to abolish capital punishment.

==Reinstatement and moratorium==
[[File:NBPtoday.jpg|thumb|[[New Bilibid Prison]] held male death row inmates]]
President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] promised during his campaign that he would support the re-introduction of the death penalty in response to increasing crime rates. The new law, drafted by Ramos, restored capital punishment. This law provided the use of the electric chair until the [[gas chamber]] (chosen by the government to replace electrocution) could be used.

Executions resumed in 1999, starting with [[Leo Echegaray]], who was put to death by [[lethal injection]] under Ramos' successor, [[Joseph Estrada]], marking the first execution after the reinstatement of the death penalty. The next execution saw an embarrassing mishap when President Estrada decided to grant a last-minute reprieve, but failed to get through to the prison authorities in time to stop the execution. Following on a personal appeal by his spiritual advisor, Bishop Teodoro Bacani, Estrada called a moratorium in 2000 to honor the [[Great Jubilee|bimillenial anniversary of Christ's birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act53/001/2000/en/ |title=Download Documents &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Executions were resumed a year later.

Estrada's successor, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], was a vocal opponent of the death penalty and also approved a moratorium, but later permitted executions and denied [[pardon]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When the Philippines had the death penalty, male inmates condemned to death were held at [[New Bilibid Prison]] and female inmates condemned to death were held at [[Correctional Institution for Women (Mandaluyong)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Araneta, Sandy|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/137465/1020-death-convicts-await-execution|title=1,020 death convicts await execution |publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=2001-10-22|accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death chamber for inmates to be electrocuted was in Building 14, within the Maximum Security Compound of New Bilibid. The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Museum previously served as the lethal injection chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Torres-Tupas, Tetch|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/705324/doj-drawing-list-of-inmates-to-occupy-death-chamber-turned-prison|title=DOJ drawing list of inmates to occupy death chamber-turned-prison|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=2015-07-15|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second suspension==
[[File:PhilippineEmbarkationCard.jpg|thumb|An old embarkation card (erroneously) warning visitors of the death penalty for drug trafficking. The caveat has since been removed from subsequent versions.]]
On 15 April 2006, the sentences of 1,230 [[death row]] inmates were commuted to [[life imprisonment]], in what [[Amnesty International]] believes to be the "largest ever commutation of death sentences".&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International Philippinesl, April 19, 2006 [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa35/003/2006/en/ Philippines: Largest ever commutation of death sentences] &lt;/ref&gt;

Capital punishment was again suspended via [[Republic Act]] No. 9346, which was signed by President Arroyo on 24 June 2006. The bill followed a vote held in [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] earlier that month which overwhelmingly supported the abolition of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, Jamie. June 6, 2006 [http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/06/philippines-congress-votes-to-end.php Philippines Congress votes to end capital punishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621033136/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/06/philippines-congress-votes-to-end.php |date=2006-06-21 }}, ''The Jurist''&lt;/ref&gt; The penalties of [[life imprisonment]] and ''[[reclusion perpetua]]'' (detention of indefinite length, usually for at least 30 years) replaced the death penalty.&lt;!--[http://www.pinoylaw.com/trivia.htm] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sun Star Cebu. 25 June 2006.

===Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights===
The Philippines subsequently signed the [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The Optional Protocol commits its members to the abolition of the death penalty within their borders.

It was signed on 20 Sep 2006 and ratified on 20 Nov 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-12&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights].&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2016, after the justice committee of the Philippine House of Representatives approved a draft measure on the reimposition of the death sentence, [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein]], the UN Commissioner for Human Rights released an open letter addressed to the Philippine Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate saying, "International law does not permit a State that has ratified or acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to denounce it or withdraw from it”. Zaid asserted that because there is no “denunciation clause” in the protocol “thereby guaranteeing the permanent non-reintroduction of the death penalty by States that ratified the Protocol.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/150445/un-ph-will-violate-intl-pact-restores-death-penalty|title=Violation of Optional Protocole if Death Penalty Restored|date=December 8, 2016|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
President Arroyo controversially pardoned many prisoners during her presidency, including a 2009 pardon for all remaining felons convicted for the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|1983 assassination]] of former Senator and opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20090304-192228/10-Aquino-Galman-convicts-free-finally |title=10 Aquino-Galman convicts free finally |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106105009/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20090304-192228/10-Aquino-Galman-convicts-free-finally |archivedate=2015-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for reintroduction of capital punishment==
During the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], presidential candidate and frontrunner, [[Davao City]] mayor [[Rodrigo Duterte]], campaigned to restore the death penalty in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lacorte|first1=Germelina|title=Duterte wants death penalty back|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/750698/duterte-wants-death-penalty-back|accessdate=May 16, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nawal|first1=Allan|last2=Manlupig|first2=Karlos|title=Duterte says he would revive death penalty|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/696527/duterte-says-he-would-revive-death-penalty|accessdate=May 16, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nawal|first1=Allan|title=Duterte wants to restore death penalty for plunder|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/713451/duterte-wants-to-restore-death-penalty-for-plunder|accessdate=May 16, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the "Yes or No" segment of the [[PiliPinas Debates 2016 – Visayas leg|second presidential debate]] on March 20, 2016, Duterte and Senator [[Grace Poe]] were the only candidates who said "Yes" when asked about the restoration of the death penalty in the country, favoring the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geronimo|first1=Gee Y.|title=Cebu debate: Duterte, Poe favor return of death penalty|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/126523-presidential-debate-duterte-poe-death-penalty|accessdate=May 16, 2016|work=[[Rappler]]|date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duterte, who won the election in May 2016, supports restoration of the death penalty by hanging.&lt;ref name=cnn20160518 /&gt; It has been reported that he wants capital punishment for criminals involved in  [[drug-related crime|illegal drug]]s, gun-for-hire syndicates and those who commit "heinous crimes" such as [[rape]], [[robbery]] or car theft where the victim is murdered,&lt;ref name=cnn20160518&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andolong|first1=Ina|title=Duterte wants to restore dh penalty by hanging|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/05/16/Duterte-death-penalty-by-hanging.html|accessdate=May 16, 2016|work=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Poe has stated that the capital punishment should apply to criminals convicted of "drugs and multiple crimes where involved people can no longer be rehabilitated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poe defends stand on death penalty|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/03/21/1565250/poe-defends-stand-death-penalty|accessdate=May 16, 2016|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duterte has theatrically vowed "to litter Manila Bay with the bodies of criminals."&lt;ref name="2016HouseBill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/851505/house-justice-committee-approves-death-penalty-bill|title=House Justice committee approves death penalty bill|first=DJ|last=Yap|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the bill to resume capital punishment for certain "heinous offenses" swiftly passed out of Committee in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]; it passed the full House of Representatives in February 2017.&lt;ref name="dpnythouse"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/asia/philippines-death-penalty.html?_r=0 Philippines Moves Closer to Reinstating Death Penalty]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the law reinstating the death penalty stalled in the Senate in April 2017, where it did not appear to have enough votes to pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/04/27/1694350/death-penalty-dead-senate-drilon Death penalty dead in Senate — Drilon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/collapse-death-penalty-bill-senate-hailed/324323/ Collapse of death penalty bill in the Senate hailed]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 poll, 67% of Filipinos supported the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/894552/pulse-asia-most-filipinos-still-support-death-penalty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The Philippines was the only country aside from the [[United States]] that used the [[electric chair]], due to its being introduced during the US colonial period. Until its first abolition in 1987, the country reverted to using [[death by firing squad]].

After re-introduction of the death penalty in 1993, the country switched to [[lethal injection]] as its sole method of execution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2983">'''Carlos Henrique de Senna Fernandes Basto''' (27 March 1890 – 31 August 1944), also known as '''Charles Henrique de Basto''', was a Portuguese businessman and member of the Hong Kong [[Sanitary Board]].

Basto was born in [[Sé, Macau]] to José Maria de Castro e Basto and his wife, Casimira de Sena Fernandes Basto. His family was prominent among the Portuguese community in Hong Kong and Macau. He was educated in England,&lt;ref name="1911 census"&gt;''1911 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; marrying Ellen Mary Cooper in London in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H De S F Basto ''England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837-1915''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was partner of the architect firm, Little, Adams &amp; Wood.&lt;ref name="juror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/s1927/2350.pdf|title=Jurors List for 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later quit the company, formed his own firm Blackmore, Basto &amp; Shank, and bought his previous firm's office on the top floor of the York Building on [[Chater Road]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of Transfer|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/G1936/230889.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was uncontested elected to the Sanitary Board in October 1932 during the period when his younger brother, the incumbent [[R. A. de Castro Basto]], left Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1932/189082.pdf|title=The Hongkong Government Gazette|date=28 October 1932|number=685|page=767}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated by Carlos Augusto de Roza and Rev. W. Walton Rogers of [[St. Andrew's Church (Kowloon)|St. Andrew's Church]]. He was also the honorary consul for Bolivia in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ONE NOMINATION FOR BOARD.|date=27 October 1932|page=7|newspaper=The China Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerome''' "'''Chef'''" '''McElroy''' is a cartoon character on the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[South Park]]'' who was voiced by [[Isaac Hayes]]. A cafeteria worker at the local [[elementary school]] in the town of South Park, [[Colorado]], Chef is generally portrayed as more level-headed than the other adult residents of the town, and sympathetic to the children. His guidance is often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists&amp;nbsp;— [[Eric Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]&amp;nbsp;— as he is usually the only adult whom they consistently trusted. To an inadvertent fault, he frequently gives inappropriate advice, usually in the [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] form of a lascivious [[soul music|soul song]].

Chef was inspired by Hayes and other popular soul singers of the [[1970s in music|1970s]], as well as an actual dining hall worker encountered by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] while he attended the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://collegeprowler.com/book/university-of-colorado/| title=University of Colorado Students Tell It Like It Is| publisher=collegeprowler.com| access-date=2009-02-28| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220140029/http://collegeprowler.com/book/university-of-colorado/| archivedate=2009-02-20| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chef played a less prominent role as the series progressed beyond its earlier seasons, and the character was retired at the beginning of the tenth season in "[[The Return of Chef]]" following the controversial departure of Hayes.

==Character==
In tradition with the show's [[Cutout animation|animation style]], Chef is composed of simple geometrical shapes, and is animated with use of a computer, though he is given the impression of being a [[construction paper]] cutout composition animated through the use of [[stop motion]], which was the technique used to animate the "[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|Spirit of Christmas]]" shorts and the show's [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|first episode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.everwonder.com/david/southpark/animationsp.html| title=The Method Behind the Madness of South Park| publisher=everwonder.com| accessdate=2009-01-28| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202143812/http://www.everwonder.com/david/southpark/animationsp.html| archivedate=2009-02-02| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chef is an overweight [[African American]] with a beard who usually wore blue pants and a red shirt. He frequently dons a traditional [[Toque#Culinary use|chef's hat]] and white [[apron]] on which the word "CHEF" is printed in black, even when he is not at work.

Until [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Token Black|Token Black]] and his family were given a more notable role starting in the show's [[South Park (season 4)|fourth season]], Chef was portrayed as the only black resident in all of South Park. Parker and co-creator [[Matt Stone]] initially planned to have one of themselves voice the character, fearing that their ideal candidates of Hayes, [[Lou Rawls]], and [[Barry White]] would never agree to voice the character because the duo had admittedly and purposefully created him as a "stereotype" to reflect what they felt was the perception most inhabitants of less-diverse mountainous Colorado towns had of black people.&lt;ref name="ytchef"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCsAcY6qgA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=341593B5C14FDCCE&amp;index=3 |title=Trey Parker and Matt Stone interview (2000) pt 4/5 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211172736/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCsAcY6qgA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=341593B5C14FDCCE&amp;index=3 |archivedate=December 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=1055 |title=FAQ Archives |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719165217/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=1055 |archivedate=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=2780 |title=FAQ Archives |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719165222/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=2780 |archivedate=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hayes agreed to voice the character due in part to the audacity of some of the show's early scripts.&lt;ref name="ytchef"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUZ89b0B6pQ&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=341593B5C14FDCCE&amp;index=6 |title=Goin' down to South Park |work=[[Viacom]] |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206080933/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUZ89b0B6pQ&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=341593B5C14FDCCE&amp;index=6 |archivedate=December 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chef (usually kindheartedly, though not always) referred to most people in town with the pejorative "[[Cracker (pejorative)|crackers]]", including the children.

Chef, after abandoning his musical aspirations, moved to South Park with plans to open his own restaurant.&lt;ref name="dirtyslut"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-02-25 |season=1 |number=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, he had befriended several famous recording artists in the music industry, including [[Elton John]] and [[Meat Loaf]], helping them to launch their successful careers.&lt;ref name="chefaid"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Chef Aid]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-10-07 |season=2 |number=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite failing at yet another dream, Chef made his way onto the South Park City Council, representing Public Safety. In addition to dispensing advice to the children and a few of the adult townsfolk, Chef speaks out against what he feels are outrageous ideas. For example, he opposes the rampant prescription of [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]] in the episode "[[Timmy 2000]]",&lt;ref name="timmy"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Timmy 2000]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2000-04-19 |season=4 |number=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he objects to the town's acceptance of [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] committing purposefully flamboyant [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] acts in front of schoolchildren in "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]".&lt;ref name="deathcamp"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]] |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2002-11-20 |season=6 |number=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", he briefly converts to [[Islam]] and adopted the name "Abdul Mohammed Jabar Rauf Kareem Ali" when he demanded that South Park change its official flag because it depicted the town's racist past.&lt;ref name="nanners"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Chef Goes Nanners]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2000-07-05 |season=4 |number=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several other occasions, Chef helped save South Park (and in a few other instances, the entire world) from potential disasters.&lt;ref name="pinkeye"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Pinkeye (South Park)|Pinkeye]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1997-10-29 |season=1 |number=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mecha"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Mecha-Streisand]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-02-18 |season=1 |number=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starvin"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1997-11-19 |season=1 |number=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ithits"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[It Hits the Fan]] |url= |series=South Park|credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2001-06-20 |season=5 |number=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cancelled"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Cancelled (South Park)|Cancelled]] |url= |series=South Park|credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2003-03-19 |season=7 |number=704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hippie"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Die Hippie, Die]]|url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2005-03-16 |season=9 |number=902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chef is also known for frequently engaging in [[casual sex]], a habit he often expresses through song. He drives a 1980s [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] [[station wagon]] with a [[vanity plate]] that reads "LUV CHEF". He is often seen accompanied by numerous young women when at home or on vacation, and is even revealed to have had a [[Casual sex#One-night stand|one-night stand]] with [[Kathie Lee Gifford]].&lt;ref name="beefcake"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Weight Gain 4000]]|url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1997-08-27 |season=1 |number=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He once resorted to [[male prostitution]] in an effort to raise money to pay legal fees, and had sex with nearly every woman in South Park before having to stop due to exhaustion.&lt;ref name="chefaid"/&gt; In "[[The Succubus (South Park)|The Succubus]]", Chef briefly becomes an office worker and took up [[monogamy]] after meeting a woman named Veronica. The two were engaged to be married until it was revealed that Veronica was actually a [[succubus]].&lt;ref name="succubus"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Succubus (South Park)|The Succubus]]|url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1999-04-21 |season=3 |number=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[South Park (video game)|''South Park'' video game]], the children can seek Chef's advice at one of the many buildings labelled "Chef's Shack O' Love", which is implied to be a [[brothel]], complete with a naked woman in Chef's bed.

Chef's parents, [[List of minor characters on South Park#Nellie and Thomas McElroy|Nellie and Thomas McElroy]], live in [[Scotland]]. The couple have made two major appearances in the episodes "[[The Succubus (South Park)|The Succubus]]" and "[[The Biggest Douche in the Universe]]", and made a brief cameo in a town Christmas celebration in "[[Red Sleigh Down]]". They were not seen at Chef's funeral in "The Return of Chef".

Chef is known to have run a [[game show|quiz show]] called ''Chef's Luv Shack'', as is apparent in the [[Chef's Luv Shack|video game of the same name]].

==Relationship with the children==
Chef endearingly calls the boys "the children" or just "children" (even when addressing one individually), and, unless he is preoccupied with a female companion, is usually willing to assist them with whatever help they need. He is consistently the only adult in town who the boys held in high regard, and they view him as their friend.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Return of Chef]]|url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2006-03-22 |season=10 |number=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also visibly saddened his presence in their lives is threatened.&lt;ref name="succubus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="return"/&gt; In addition to being fans of his food (especially his trademark [[Salisbury steak]]), the boys often heartily anticipate encountering Chef when waiting in the school lunch line, so that they can explain whatever dilemma is affecting them, usually after their traditional greeting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Chef''': Hello there, children!&lt;br&gt;
'''The boys''' [in unison]: Hey Chef!&lt;br&gt;
'''Chef''': How's it goin'?&lt;br&gt;
'''The boys''' [one or in unison]: Bad.&lt;br&gt;
'''Chef''': Why "bad"?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The boys sometimes take it upon themselves to travel to Chef's house individually to seek his advice on all manners of their problems, specifically relationships. He usually gives advice in the form of a soul song, which usually winds up being about sex, whether or not sex was relevant to the topic at hand. Hearing the songs would often leave the boys even more confused and with no further understanding of what they initially inquire about. In earlier seasons, Chef is often approached by the children when they are unfamiliar with a term that pertains to adult matters, such as "lesbian" or "prostitute". This happens so often that it eventually aggravates Chef, who pleads with them to stop asking questions he feels are not appropriate for him to answer. Despite this, the children continue asking these questions, much to his chagrin. An absent-minded Chef sometimes answers anyway, not realizing his lapse until the damage had been done. Chef acknowledges that doing this had repeatedly gotten him in trouble with his boss, [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Principal Victoria|Principal Victoria]].&lt;ref name="fatcamp"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Fat Camp (South Park)|Fat Camp]]|url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2000-12-06 |season=4 |number=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{main article|Chef Aid|Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chocolate Salty Balls}}
[[File:Chocolate Salty Balls.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of Chef's [[1998 in music|1998]] hit [[Single (music)|single]], "[[Chocolate Salty Balls]]"]]
In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef also sings about things relevant to what has transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] style he had utilized during his own music career. Within the show, Chef is the original composer of these songs, including "[[Chef Aid|Stinky Britches]]", which was depicted as having been covered by [[Alanis Morissette]] without proper credit to Chef. When Chef is left with legal debt after losing a court case to have himself credited as the song's original writer, several bands and artists (guest starring as themselves) hold a concert dubbed "Chef Aid", a parody of [[Live Aid]], to raise the funds.&lt;ref name="chefaid"/&gt; The episode inspired a real-life [[album]], ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]'', released in [[1998 in music|1998]], which featured guest stars from the episode such as [[Elton John]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The album includes many of the full-length versions of the songs Chef had performed in the show's first two seasons; "[[Chocolate Salty Balls]]" was released as a single, and reached #1 in both the [[record charts]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=26989|title=Chartstats.com|author=|date=|website=www.chartstats.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011000146/http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=26989|archivedate=11 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series progressed and Chef's role became more intermittent, his spontaneous outbursts into song became less of a show standard.

Parker and Stone originally planned to have Chef sing a song in every single episode but abandoned the idea after finding it too challenging and fearing writing too many songs would make them less funny, similar to their rationale for dispensing with [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]'s episodic deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Weight Gain 4000"|medium=Audio commentary |publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departure of Isaac Hayes==
{{see also|South Park controversies}}
{{wikinews|Isaac Hayes quits South Park over Scientology episode}}

On January 4, 2006, Hayes defended ''South Park's'' style of controversial humor to ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' and XM's ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' show, going so far as to note that although he was not pleased with the show's depiction of the [[Church of Scientology]], of which he was a member, he "understood what Matt and Trey are doing." However, on March 13, 2006, nearly two months after suffering a [[stroke]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/MYSA102706_WK_hayes_1db37cb_html7971.html Hayes has put stroke, 'South Park' behind him] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720002541/http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/MYSA102706_WK_hayes_1db37cb_html7971.html |date=2009-07-20 }}, MySanAntonio.com, October 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes was reported to have quit ''South Park'' over objections to the show's attitudes toward and depiction of various religions, claiming that the show had crossed the line from satire into intolerance.

Despite the content of the official press release, there remains considerable speculation about the motivations behind his departure. Parker and Stone assert that he quit due to the controversial episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]", and its treatment of [[Scientology]]. Stone commented in a manner that suggested that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on ''South Park'': "[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/tv/article/Isaac-Hayes-quits-South-Park-1198284.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Isaac Hayes Quits 'South Park' | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032631/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/tv/article/Isaac-Hayes-quits-South-Park-1198284.php | archivedate=2015-11-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] reporter Roger Friedman suggested that, because he was still suffering from the effects of his stroke, Hayes was hospitalized and not in a position to make a rational decision to leave the show. Friedman also reported that Hayes left the show because of the external pressure forced by his fellow Scientologists, the decision was not voluntary, and the original press release announcing his departure was put out by someone who was not authorized to represent him.&lt;ref name="Friedman-March2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188463,00.html|work=|publisher=Fox News|author=Roger Friedman|date=March 20, 2006|title=Chef’s Quitting Controversy|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016174852/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188463,00.html#|archivedate=2006-10-16|df=|access-date=2006-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 oral history of ''South Park'' in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Isaac Hayes III]] confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes' entourage while Hayes was unable to make such decisions on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ryan|title=Holy Shit, 'South Park' Is 20!

==Retirement==
[[Image:Darthchef.png|thumb|left|"Darth" Chef]]
Nine days after Hayes's departure from production, the controversy was satirized in the show's Season 10 premiere "[[The Return of Chef]]". For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot,&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526757/20060321/index.jhtml?headlines=true|title='South Park' Cooks Up Plan For Chef In Season Premiere|work=[[MTV]]|date=March 21, 2006|accessdate=2009-04-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116093945/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526757/20060321/index.jhtml?headlines=true|archivedate=November 16, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves Chef's leaving South Park to join the "Super Adventure Club", which eventually brainwashes Chef until he had the mindset of a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]. The organization combines outdoor activities with [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation]], an act they perceive as justified because of their beliefs.

After the boys are unable to convince Chef to come back to South Park, a [[rope bridge]] Chef is walking across is struck by [[lightning]]. He falls to a violent death, culminating with his mutilation at the hands of a [[grizzly bear]] and a [[mountain lion]] and finally discharged [[fecal matter]] (a reference to the episode "[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]", in which Cartman claims that the relaxation of the bowel muscles confirms that a person is really dead).&lt;ref name="wallmart"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]] |url= |series=[[South Park]] |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2004-11-03 |season=8 |number=809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Park holds a memorial service for him (Canadian comedians [[Terrance and Phillip]] even attend, despite having never met the man themselves), in which Kyle gives a eulogy stating, "We shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us, we should be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains", a deliberate parallel with Hayes' departure from the show in favor of Scientology.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt;

Mimicking a scene from the finale of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', Chef's body is secretly collected by the Super Adventure Club, who managed to revive him as a [[cyborg]] — identified on the show's official website as "Darth Chef" (a parody of'' [[Star Wars]]' ''[[Darth Vader]]). He is fitted with a suit and mask like those of Vader, except with the helmet taking on the appearance of Chef's trademark hat, and wields a red, glowing [[spatula]], parodying Vader's red [[lightsaber]]. Darth Chef's voice was provided by British comedian and filmmaker [[Peter Serafinowicz]], who voiced [[Darth Maul]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. Darth Chef has not made an appearance in subsequent episodes, but has appeared with other characters in the background of the ''South Park'' opening sequence, and is mentioned in the episode "[[Stunning and Brave]]", when PC Principal says the kids drove him to kill himself, which is not true.&lt;ref name="return"/&gt;

Chef is alluded to after his death in the season 10 episode "[[Hell on Earth 2006]]" where, during Satan's party, there are multiple scenes in which a Caucasian male dressed as Chef can be seen in the background. He is also referenced in the season 14 episode "[[Crème Fraiche (South Park)|Crème Fraiche]]" when Randy becomes the new chef at school and greets the kids with Chef's trademark lines. Isaac Hayes himself died on August 10, 2008, two years after his departure from ''South Park''.

Chef makes an appearance in the 2014 video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' as the reanimated [[Nazi]] [[Zombie]] penultimate boss later in the game. Once again, voice clips of Isaac Hayes as Chef are recycled from past episodes with the exception of recorded speech clips from [[Adolf Hitler]]. During his battle with the player and the other boys, Chef will express remorse by saying things like "I'm sorry, boys" and "what have I done?" While there were vague references to the Super Adventure Club and his death, there were no references to the Darth Chef suit.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Dorothy Mae Kilgallen''' (July 3, 1913 – November 8, 1965) was an American journalist and television game show panelist. After spending two semesters at the [[College of New Rochelle]], she started her career shortly before her 18th birthday as a reporter for the [[Hearst Corporation]]'s ''New York Evening Journal''. In 1938, she began her newspaper column "The Voice of Broadway", which eventually was syndicated to more than 140 papers.&lt;ref name=biograph/&gt;&lt;ref name=sourcebook/&gt; In 1950, she became a regular panelist on the television game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'', continuing in the role until her death.

Kilgallen's columns featured mostly show business news and gossip, but ventured into other topics, such as politics and [[organized crime]]. She wrote front-page articles on the [[Sam Sheppard]] trial and later the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].

==Early life and career==
Kilgallen was born in Chicago, the daughter of newspaper reporter James Lawrence Kilgallen (1888–1982)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and his wife, Mae Ahern (1888–1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gingrich| first=Arnold| title=Article| journal=[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]| publisher=David A. Smart| year=1936| pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name=biograph&gt;{{cite book| last=Riley| first=Sam G.| title=Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| date=November 6, 1995| pages=157| isbn=978-0-31-329192-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy had a sister, Eleanor (1919–2014), who was six years her junior. The family moved to various regions of the United States until 1920, when the [[International News Service]] hired James Kilgallen as a roving correspondent based in New York City.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lynn |first=Frank |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/23/obituaries/james-l-kilgallen-dies-at-94-a-reporter-for-over-75-years.html |title=James L. Kilgallen Dies at 94; A Reporter for Over 75 Years |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 23, 1982 |accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family settled in Brooklyn, New York. Kilgallen was a student at Erasmus Hall High School. After completing two semesters at [[College of New Rochelle|The College of New Rochelle]], Kilgallen dropped out to take a job as a reporter for the ''New York Evening Journal''. The newspaper was owned and operated by the [[Hearst Corporation]], which also owned International News Service, her father's employer.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Liebenson |first=Donald |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-05-04/features/0305040380_1_upi-story-jack-james-korean-war/3 |title=Upi R.i.p. |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=May 4, 2003 |accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Kilgallen competed with two other New York newspaper reporters in a race around the world using only means of transportation available to the general public. She was the only woman to compete in the contest and came in second. She described the event in her book ''Girl Around The World'', which is credited as the story idea for the 1937 movie ''[[Fly-Away Baby]]'' starring [[Glenda Farrell]] as a character partly inspired by Kilgallen.&lt;ref name=sourcebook&gt;{{cite book| last=Signorielli| first=Nancy| title=Women in Communication: A Biographical Sourcebook| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| date=November 4, 1996| page=245| isbn=978-0-31-329164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1938, Kilgallen began writing a daily column, the "Voice of Broadway," for Hearst's ''New York Journal-American'', which the corporation created by merging the ''Evening Journal'' with the ''American''. The column, which she wrote until her death in 1965, featured mostly New York show business news and gossip, but also ventured into other topics such as politics and organized crime. The column eventually was syndicated to 146 newspapers via [[King Features Syndicate]].&lt;ref name=biograph/&gt;&lt;ref name=sourcebook/&gt; Its success motivated Kilgallen to move her parents and Eleanor from Brooklyn to Manhattan, where she continued to live with them until she got married.

On April 6, 1940, Kilgallen married [[Richard Kollmar]], a musical comedy actor and singer who had starred in the Broadway show ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' and was performing, at the time of their wedding, in the Broadway cast of ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Arnaz| first=Desi| title=A Book| publisher=William Morrow, Inc.| year=1976| pages=86–91| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrALAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3ACPJWWOevA4UC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kilgallen |isbn=978-0-68-800342-5 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children, Jill (born 1941), Richard "Dickie" (b. 1943), and Kerry Kollmar (b. 1954),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/names/kerry_kollmar My Heritage web site with Kerry Kollmar's date of birth]&lt;/ref&gt; and remained married until Kilgallen's death.&lt;ref name=mass/&gt;

Early in their marriage, both Kilgallen and Kollmar launched careers in network radio, Kilgallen with her radio program ''Voice of Broadway'', which was broadcast on CBS during World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Kilgallen Renewed| url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-03-07.o.pdf| accessdate=February 11, 2015| newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=March 7, 1942| page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kollmar with a long stint in the nationally syndicated crime drama in which he played [[Boston Blackie]].

Beginning in April 1945, Kilgallen and Kollmar co-hosted a [[WOR (AM)|WOR-AM]] radio talk show, ''Breakfast With Dorothy and Dick'', from their 16-room apartment at 640 Park Avenue. The show followed them when they bought a neo-Georgian brownstone at 45 East 68th Street in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen, Dorothy. "The Voice of Broadway", ''New York Journal-American'' (May 30, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; The radio program, like Kilgallen's newspaper column, mixed entertainment with serious issues. Kilgallen and Kollmar continued doing the show from their home until 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Suskin| first=Steven| title=Second Act Trouble: Behind the Scenes at Broadway's Big Musical Bombs| publisher=Hal Leonard| year=2006| pages=243| isbn=1-55783-631-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; long after the terminations of other radio shows on which each had worked without the other.

Kilgallen was among the notables on the guest list of those who attended the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Kilgallen became a panelist on the American television game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' in 1950 (its first broadcast), which was telecast from New York City on the CBS television network until 1967. She remained on the show for 15 years (until her death).

==Controversy==

===Sinatra feud===
Though Kilgallen and [[Frank Sinatra]] were fairly good friends for several years and were photographed rehearsing in a radio studio for a 1948 broadcast, they had a falling out after she wrote a multipart 1956 front-page feature story titled "The Frank Sinatra Story." In addition to the ''New York Journal-American,'' Hearst-owned newspapers across the United States ran the story.&lt;ref name="Kelley"&gt;{{cite book| title=His Way: Frank Sinatra, the Unauthorized Biography| author-link=Kitty Kelley| first=Kitty| last=Kelley| year=1986| isbn=978-0-553-05137-7| pages=256–257| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EnbzfyWuuL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:yf29uep-5F4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX89ytsejZAhWp24MKHfSmDiQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter Sinatra made derogatory comments about Kilgallen's physical appearance to his audiences at nightclubs in New York and Las Vegas,&lt;ref name="Kelley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=McNally| first=Karen| title=When Frankie Went to Hollywood: Frank Sinatra and American Male Identity| publisher=University of Illinois Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erZCCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=When+Frankie+Went+to+Hollywood:+Frank+Sinatra+and+American+Male+Identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwten2sejZAhUD0YMKHRLEC9cQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kilgallen&amp;f=false| date=March 6, 2008| pages=101, 197| isbn=978-0-25-207542-1| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Fong-Torres| first=Ben| title=Becoming Almost Famous: My Back Pages in Music, Writing, and Life| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxbAbxLOBT8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Becoming+Almost+Famous:+My+Back+Pages+in+Music,+Writing,+and+Life%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZxJz_sujZAhVp2oMKHZ2BDTsQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kilgallen&amp;f=false| publisher=Backbeat Books| date=May 1, 2006| page=153| subscription=yes| isbn=978-0-87-930880-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he stopped short of mentioning her name on television or during interviews for magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref name="Kelley"/&gt;

===Sam Sheppard murder trial===
Kilgallen covered the 1954 murder trial of [[Sam Sheppard]], a doctor (whose specialty was [[osteopathic medicine|osteopathic]] [[neurosurgery]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/590#.VG1GS0bTnow| title=Dr. Sam Sheppard| publisher=Cleveland Historical| last=Smith| first=Victoria| date=April 18, 2017| accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was convicted of bludgeoning his wife to death at their home in the Cleveland suburb of [[Bay Village, Ohio|Bay Village]].

The ''New York Journal-American'' carried the banner front-page headline that she was "astounded" by the guilty verdict because of what she argued were serious flaws in the prosecution's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Sheppard Guilty; Dorothy Kilgallen Astounded By Verdict| last=Kilgallen| first=Dorothy| date=December 22, 1954| newspaper=New York Journal-American| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Cleveland jury's guilty verdict in December 1954, Kilgallen's sharp criticism of it was controversial and a Cleveland newspaper dropped her column in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=1st Officer At Sheppard Murder Holds To View| last=Feagler| first=Dick| date=December 9, 1998| newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]| location=Cleveland| page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Facts On Sheppard Don't Bother Some| last=Dirck| first=Joe| date=December 13, 1998| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| pages=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book| last=Pollack| first=Jack Harrison| title=Dr. Sam: An American Tragedy| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_nXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Dr.+Sam%3A+An+American+Tragedy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kilgallen| publisher=Avon| year=1975| pages=152–157| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her articles and columns in 1954 did not reveal all she had witnessed in the [[Cuyahoga County]] [[Court of Common Pleas]]. Nine years after the verdict and sentence, and after the judge had died, she claimed at an event held at the [[Overseas Press Club]] in New York, that the judge had told her before the start of jury selection that Sheppard was "guilty as hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19541219&amp;id=47xHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ToAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5799,2015386&amp;hl=en| title=Stunned Sam Sentenced to Life In Wife's Murder| newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]]| agency=[[United Press International|United Press]]| date=December 22, 1954| accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Sam Sheppard: Some 35-year-old questions| date=August 8, 1989| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Attorney [[F. Lee Bailey]], who was working on a [[habeas corpus]] petition for his client Sheppard, attended the Overseas Press Club event, heard what Kilgallen told the crowd, and then asked her privately if she would help him.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaileyOnSheppardAndKilgallen"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Bailey| first1=F Lee| last2=Aronson| first2=Harvey| title=The Defense Never Rests| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ncpAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+Defense+Never+Rests&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kilgallen| accessdate=March 12, 2016| publisher=Signet| isbn=978-0-45-112640-5| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Some days later," as Bailey wrote in his memoir ''The Defense Never Rests'',&lt;ref name="BaileyOnSheppardAndKilgallen"/&gt; "we obtained a deposition from Dorothy that was inserted into the petition submitted to" [[Carl Andrew Weinman]], judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]]. Bailey also included in the habeas corpus petition a statement from Edward Murray, who had worked in 1954 as a court clerk at the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Similar to Kilgallen's statement, Murray's statement indicated that [[Edward J. Blythin]], the original Sheppard judge, had declared Sheppard guilty even before the grand jury indicted him on August 17, 1954.&lt;ref name="BaileyOnSheppardAndKilgallen"/&gt;

In July 1964, four months after the Overseas Press Club event where Kilgallen broke her silence about the deceased Judge Blythin, Judge Weinman of the federal court granted Bailey's ''habeas corpus'' petition, Sam Sheppard was released from prison amid much newspaper publicity, and Sheppard met Kilgallen at a "late-night champagne party" (as described by Bailey in ''The Defense Never Rests'') in Cleveland.&lt;ref name="BaileyOnSheppardAndKilgallen"/&gt; After Kilgallen's death, Sheppard was retried and acquitted.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaileyOnSheppardAndKilgallen"/&gt;

===Defense of criminal defendant Lenny Bruce===
In 1964, Kilgallen was one of four witnesses who testified for the defense of comedian [[Lenny Bruce]], during his trial on obscenity charges in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/brucetrial.html| title=The People v Lenny Bruce: Excerpts from the Cafe Au Go Go Trial| first=Doug| last=Linder| publisher=Famous Trials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kilgallen and the Kennedy assassination===
Kilgallen was publicly skeptical of the conclusions of the [[Warren Commission]]'s report into the assassination of President Kennedy and wrote several newspaper articles on the subject.&lt;ref name=WCcritic&gt;{{cite news| last=Harrison| first=Ken| url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2015/nov/10/stringers-justice-newspaper-woman-dead-1965/#| title=Justice sought for newspaper woman dead since 1965| work=[[San Diego Reader]]| date=November 10, 2015| accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Jack Ruby| url=http://www.harveyandlee.net/Ruby/Ruby.html| quote=''Journalist Dorothy Kilgallen wrote in the New York Journal American (June 6, 1964): "It is known that 10 persons have signed sworn depositions to the Warren Commission that they knew Oswald and Ruby to have been acquainted."| last=Armstrong| first=John| accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Editorial: Earl Warren's 'Lost Cause'| url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Assassination%20Clippings%20Folders/Ruby/Item%20312.pdf| date=August 29, 1964| location=New York City| newspaper=[[National Guardian]]| quote=''In the 'Journal American' it filled several pages over three days and was accompanied by revealing commentary by Miss Kilgallen who has reported on the assassination inquiry with a most unusual zeal.

And, she might have added, fascinating for what was not asked of Ruby by the Chief Justice.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained a copy of [[Jack Ruby]]'s testimony to the [[Warren Commission]], which she published in August 1964 on the front pages of the ''Journal American'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Journal American]]'' August 18–20, 1964 front pages&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Philadelphia Inquirer'',&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Inquirer'' August 19–21, 1964 front pages&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'',&lt;ref&gt;''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' August 19–21, 1964 front pages&lt;/ref&gt; and other newspapers. Most of that testimony did not become officially available to the public until the commission released its 26 volumes of hearings and exhibits in November 1964, around the time of the first anniversary of the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rosenbaum| first=Ron| date=November 1983| title=Pieces of the Puzzle| journal=[[Texas Monthly]]| page=156| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=release+26+volumes+november+1964&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pAyVUVw811&amp;sig=O-NI2BNMLJXn2KUrPXykafp0dcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yTs8T4GWIKGciALc9IiaAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=release%2026%20volumes%20november%201964&amp;f=false| accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On November 8, 1965, Kilgallen was found dead on the third floor of her five-story Manhattan townhouse. Her death was determined to have been caused by a fatal combination of alcohol and [[barbiturates]]. The autopsy ruled out a heart attack,&lt;ref name=APcause&gt;{{cite news| title=Miss Kilgallen Death Ascribed to Mixture of Alcohol, Barbiturates| date=November 16, 1965| agency=[[Associated Press]]| newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a possibility that her father James Kilgallen—who was still working as a newspaper reporter at age 77—had raised when other reporters had interviewed him immediately after the discovery of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dorothy Kilgallen Dead| date=November 8, 1965| newspaper=New York Journal-American| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, Kilgallen's parents, husband, and children were among nearly 2,600 people in attendance at her funeral Mass, held at [[Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (Manhattan)|St. Vincent Ferrer]], her church. Among those attending were [[John Charles Daly|John Daly]], [[Arlene Francis]], [[Bennett Cerf]], [[Steve Allen]], [[Ed Sullivan]], film producer [[Joseph E.

On the following Sunday night telecast of ''What's My Line?'', seen live on November 14, ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' regular panelist [[Kitty Carlisle]], who had been a guest panelist on three previous episodes of ''What's My Line?'', temporarily filled in for Kilgallen. She said on-camera that although she was occupying Kilgallen's seat, "no one could ever possibly take her place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tv.com/shows/whats-my-line/episode-665-97669| title=What's My Line Episode #665: Episode Cast &amp; Crew| publisher=[[TV.com]]| accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Kilgallen has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref name=LATimesStarWalk&gt;{{cite web| title=Hollywood Star Walk: Dorothy Kilgallen| url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/dorothy-kilgallen| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=November 9, 1965| accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce list her as one of the 500 people who were chosen to receive the first stars on the walk of fame. The stars were installed on sidewalks in 1960 and 1961, several years before she died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/| title=About Hollywood Star Walk| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceremonies were not held for those who received stars prior to December 1968. During that month, [[Richard Zanuck]] became the first to be honored with a ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/| title=About Hollywood Star Walk|newspaper=Los Angeles Times| accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kilgallen was friendly with [[Theo Wilson]], an acclaimed newspaper reporter of murder trials. In Wilson's 1996 memoir, she wrote that Kilgallen's career was often overlooked during her lifetime and was forgotten after her death.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Part of being a good reporter is to be anonymous, to stay out of the story so that you can better watch and study and listen to the principals. She couldn't do that, mostly because people wouldn't let her. She'd walk into a trial and the prosecutor would ask for her autograph for his wife or the judge would send out greetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyipQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Headline%20Justice%3A%20Inside%20the%20Courtroom%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Country%27s%20Most%20Controversial%20Trials&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions| title=Headline Justice: Inside the Courtroom – The Country's Most Controversial Trials| publisher=Basic Books| accessdate=March 13, 2017| date=December 10, 1996| isbn=978-1-56-025108-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Zamacois y Zabala''' (2 July 1841 in [[Bilbao]] - 12 January 1871 in [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Academicism|Academic]] painter who specialized in small-scale canvases. He was the father of French writer [[Miguel Zamacoïs]], and brother of the writer [[Niceto de Zamacois]], the singer [[Elisa Zamacois]] and the actor [[Ricardo Zamacois]], and also uncle of the writer [[Eduardo Zamacois]].

== Biography ==
Eduardo María Zamacois y Zabala was born in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]]. Son of Miguel Antonio de Zamacois y Berreteaga, and his second wife, Ruperta María del Pilar de Zabala y Arauco. His father was the founder and director of the Santiago de Vizcaya School of Humanities.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://carmenthyssenmalaga.org/en/artista/78 Brief biography] @ the [[Carmen Thyssen Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; His relatives included numerous artists: writers,  actors and musicians. Of family of Basque ancestry, their surname originated in [[Hasparren]], France, where their surname was spelled "Samacoys" at 18th century.

[[File:EDUARDO ZAMACOIS Y ZABALA - La Visita Inoportuna (Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, c. 1868. Óleo sobre tabla, 23 x 29.5 cm).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Inopportune Visit]]
He received a thorough education, which included drawing classes with a local artist named Joaquín Balaca (c.1820-?). Later, when his father's school closed, the family moved to Madrid and, in 1856, he was enrolled at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], where he studied with [[Federico de Madrazo]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/zamacois-zabala-eduardo/?no_cache=1 Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, on Madrazo's recommendation, he went to Paris and attended the classes of [[Charles Gleyre]] in preparation for applying to the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Ècole des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; His application there was denied, so he turned to the workshops of [[Ernest Meissonier]], where he found a position.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;
[[File:Zamacois y Zabala 001.jpg|thumb|250px|The French Occupation]]
A skillful business negotiator, he strove to gain access to as many European exhibitions as possible. Success came quickly. In 1861, he was commissioned to create decorative paintings in the quarters of the future king, [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] at the [[Palacio Real de Madrid]]. This work won him a grant from the {{ill|Diputación Foral de Vizcaya|es}}, which enabled him to continue his studies.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; In 1862 and 1864, he was awarded medals at the [[National Exhibition of Fine Arts (Spain)|National Exhibition of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

He was married in Paris in 1865, to Louise Marie Héloise Perrin, whom he had met at the home of his friend, [[Jehan Georges Vibert]]. They had two children: [[Miguel Zamacoïs|Miguel Louis Pascual]], who became a well-known journalist and playwright, and a posthumous daughter, Marie Hélène, (who married the painter, [[Jean Alfred Marioton]]). 

In 1866, he became good friends with the painter, [[Marià Fortuny]],&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; who did a portrait etching of him. During a trip to Rome, Zamacois also posed as a toreador for Fortuny's painting, ''[[The Spanish Wedding]]''. Later, he contacted his friend, {{ill|Adolphe Goupil|fr}}, and put him in touch with Fortuny, which resulted in an exclusive contract with [[Goupil &amp; Cie]]; a turning point in Fortuny's career.

In 1870, he was awarded the Gold Medal at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] for his painting, ''The Education of a Prince''.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; After a showing in London, one of his paintings was purchased by [[Charles Dickens]].

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] created difficulties that eventually forced him to return to Madrid. His arrival there coincided with the official coronation of King [[Amadeus I of Spain|Amadeus I]], and he attended the ceremonies. It was an unusually cold winter and he became ill the following day. He died there suddenly, aged 29, of what was described as "gangrenous angina" (possibly [[Diphtheria]]).&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;

In 1878, he was awarded a posthumous diploma by the Ècole des Beaux-Arts and a major retrospective at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]]. Goupil &amp; Cie also published a large volume of photographs of his major works.

'''Engineering''' is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and [[empirical evidence]] to the [[innovation]], [[design]], [[construction]], operation and [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] of [[structure]]s, [[machine]]s, [[material]]s, devices, [[system]]s, [[process]]es, and [[organization]]s for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized [[List of engineering branches|fields of engineering]], each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of [[applied mathematics]], [[applied science]], and types of application. See [[glossary of engineering]].

The term ''engineering'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', meaning "cleverness" and  ''ingeniare'', meaning "to contrive, devise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IAENG|url=http://www.iaeng.org/about_IAENG.html|website=iaeng.org|publisher=International Association of Engineers|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley.

The term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1390 when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') referred to "a constructor of military engines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]
The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], [[Teotihuacán]], the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djosèr]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]–[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] or [[epicyclic gearing]], two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [[gear train]]s of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as [[robotics]] and [[automotive engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century Military technology] Quote: "The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th." and "But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century. It was first heard of in the context of Sicilian warfare against Carthage in the time of Dionysius I of Syracuse."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[trireme]], the [[ballista]] and the [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[trebuchet]] was developed.

===Renaissance era===
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

===Modern era===
The science of [[classical mechanics]], sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |last=Musson |author2=Robinso|year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815-1860 |last=Taylor|first= George Rogers|year=1969 |publisher =|location=

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of [[civil engineering]]. He was an English [[civil engineer]] responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, [[canal]]s, [[harbour]]s, and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomn steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine.  The sequence of events began with the invention the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who  built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707.  [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]].  [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Rhys | authorlink = | title = Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times| publisher = Ayer Publishing| year = 1936 | location =| page = 66 | isbn = 978-0-8369-2167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron merchant [[Thomas Newcomen]], who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century.  The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical.  The [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.  [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.  With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New steel making processes, such as the [[Bessemer process]] and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.

[[File:The world's first iron bridge.jpg|thumb|253px|The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges.  This bridge was made of [[cast iron]], which was soon displaced by less brittle [[wrought iron]] as a structural material]]

One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the  first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century.  These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position.  Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of "engineer" for the first time with a count of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-504605-2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875.  In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, [[mining]], mechanical and electrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907.  Germany established technical universities earlier.&lt;ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| edition =| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

Only a decade after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society – 1962 – Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

===Chemical engineering===
{{Main|Chemical engineering}}
[[Chemical engineering]] is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of [[commodity chemicals]], [[specialty chemicals]], [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[microfabrication]], [[fermentation]], and [[Biotechnology|biomolecule production]].

===Civil engineering===
{{Main|Civil engineering}}
[[Civil engineering]] is the design and construction of public and private works, such as [[infrastructure]] ([[airports]], [[roads]], [[railways]], water supply, and treatment etc.), [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |accessdate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archivedate=16 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/what-is-civil-engineering|title=What is Civil Engineering|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including [[structural engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[surveying]]. It is traditionally considered to be separate from [[military engineering]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica|url =https://www.britannica.com/technology/civil-engineering|title = Civil Engineering|last = Watson|first = J. Garth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical engineering===
{{Main|Electrical engineering}}
[[Electrical engineering]] is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[Broadcast engineering]], [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].

===Mechanical engineering===
{{Main|Mechanical engineering}}
[[Mechanical engineering]] is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, [[vibration isolation]] equipment, [[manufacturing]], and [[mechatronics]].

===Other branches===
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}
Beyond these "Big 4", a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],&lt;ref&gt;Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-2121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–48|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

A general methodology and [[epistemology]] of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.

According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what she produces, but rather how she goes about it.&lt;ref name="Discussion of The Method"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-515599-0|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem solving===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.

Usually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.{{Citation needed|reason=Kindly provide citation. Usually safety factor is considered to be a part of an efficient design.|date=October 2017}}

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;

The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archivedate=2006-10-06|deadurl =yes|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name="EMI"&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring.  This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archivedate=2014-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an "image crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career.  Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{quote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Canada, many engineers wear the [[Iron Ring]] as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Medicine and biology===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"/&gt; He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

[[File:GFP Mice 01.jpg|thumb|right|Genetically engineered mice expressing [[green fluorescent protein]], which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [[wild-type]].]]
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [[brain implant]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref name="Boston U"&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Bioe/BioeMcGe.htm Ethical Assessment of Implantable Brain Chips. Ellen M. McGee and G.Q. Maguire, Jr. from Boston University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE foreign parts"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2188/27125/01204814.pdf?arnumber=1204814 IEEE technical paper: Foreign parts (electronic body implants).by Evans-Pughe, C. quote from summary: Feeling threatened by cyborgs?]&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[bionics]] and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name="IME"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and [[empirical]] knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"&gt;[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational or mathematical modelling and experimentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011033/http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf |date=2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"/&gt;

===Art===

There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]] (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Engineering).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering: Professor uses the fine arts to broaden students' engineering perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT World:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ MIT World:The Art of Engineering: Inventor James Dyson on the Art of Engineering: quote: A member of the British Design Council, James Dyson has been designing products since graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1970.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232213/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas at Dallas"&gt;[http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ University of Texas at Dallas:  The Institute for Interactive Arts and Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], for instance, held an exhibition about the art of [[NASA]]'s aerospace design.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/nasa/overview.html Aerospace Design: The Art of Engineering from NASA's Aeronautical Research]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Maillart]]'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.&lt;ref name="Princeton U"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/137.html Princeton U: Robert Maillart's Bridges: The Art of Engineering: quote: no doubt that Maillart was fully conscious of the aesthetic implications&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of South Florida]], an engineering professor, through a grant with the [[National Science Foundation]], has developed a course that connects art and engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chief engineer"&gt;[http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm quote:..the tools of artists and the perspective of engineers..] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180822/http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"&gt;Bjerklie, David.  "The Art of Renaissance Engineering."  ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59.  Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician." (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew U"&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business Engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.

'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]]. The word was coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logia'', "study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aghe.org/resources/gerontology-geriatrics-descriptions|title=Gerontology/Geriatrics Definitions|last=Confluence|website=www.aghe.org|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.&lt;ref name=Hooyman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=978-0205763139 |edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=Howell87&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ammar |first1= S |year= 1998 |title= Vesalius |journal= Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |volume= 4 |page= 48 |url= http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar |title=Ibn al-Jazzār, Abū Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid (d. 979/369) |work=Islamic Medical Manuscripts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and causes of [[Death|mortality]]&lt;ref name="Al Jazzar"&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html |title=Specialized literature |work=Islamic culture and medical arts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of aged humans, and the [[life expectancy]], tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. [[Élie Metchnikoff]] coined the term "gerontology" {{circa}} 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging &amp;ndash; the [[National Institute on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Institute on Aging|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/about|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; programs in gerontology at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and as past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Beth|title=In memoriam: James E.

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden &amp;ndash; the term ''geroscience'' emerged in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4036419|year=2014|author1=Burch|first1=J.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid [[aging population|population aging]] in the next several decades.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie A. Werner |title=The Older Population: 2010 |year=2010 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf |id=C2010BR-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and [[Canada]] will be aged 65 years and older by 2025.  Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;  Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Population |chapterurl=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008_Documents/Population.aspx |title=2008 Older Americans : Key indicators of Well-Being |year=2008 |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/Data_2008.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010.  However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Geriatric Social Work |publisher=Boston University |url=http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073154/http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geriatric Social Work Initiative |url=http://www.gswi.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

=== Geographic distribution of older adults ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

== Biogerontology ==
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]
{{Main|Theories of aging}}
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms.  Conservative biogerontologists such as [[Leonard Hayflick]] have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts G |title=Leonard Hayflick and the limits of ageing |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |page=2075 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21684371 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60908-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as [[James Vaupel]] have predicted that in industrialized countries, life expectancies will reach 100 for children born after the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Christensen2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christensen|first1=L|last2=Doblhammer|first2=K|last3=Rau|first3=G|last4=Vaupel|first4=JW|title=Ageing populations: the challenges ahead|journal=Lancet|date=2009|volume=374|issue=9696|pages=1196–1208|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)61460-4|pmid=19801098|pmc=2810516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some surveyed biogerontologists have predicted life expectancies of two or more centuries.&lt;ref name=Richel2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richel|first1=Theo|title=Will human life expectancy quadruple in the next hundred years? Sixty gerontologists say public debate on life extension is necessary|journal=J Anti-Aging Med|date=December 2003|volume=6|issue=4|pages=309–314|doi=10.1089/109454503323028902|pmid=15142432}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Aubrey de Grey]] offering the "tentative timeframe" that with adequate funding of research to develop interventions in aging such as [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]], "we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about 25 to 30 years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people from dying of aging at any age", leading to life expectancies of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=deGreyRae2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Grey|first1=Aubrey D. N. J.|last2=Rae|first2=Michael|authorlink1=Aubrey de Grey|title=Ending Aging|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312367077|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] through science.&lt;ref name="Lithgow2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lithgow|first1=Gordon J.|authorlink1=Gordon J. Lithgow|title=Origins of Geroscience|journal=Public Policy &amp; Aging Report|date=1 September 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/ppar/23.4.10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.

There are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. |last2=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic theories ===
Stochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the "wear and tear" theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460–466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576|url=http://www.diseaseamonth.com/article/S0011-5029(15)00146-7/abstract|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wear and tear theory====

Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt; An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.

==== Free radical theory ====
[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage. The [[free-radical theory of aging]] proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boniewska-Bernacka|first=Ewa|date=2016|title=Selected Theories of Ageing|url=https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11286/Boniewska.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Higher School's Pulse|volume=10|pages=36–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenn|first=Rebecca|author2=Gilbert, DL, Nye, SW, Dwyer, P, and Fenn WO|title=Oxygen poisoning and x-irradiation: a mechanism in common|journal=Science|date=7 May 1954|volume=119|issue=3097|pages=623–626|pmid=13156638|bibcode=1954Sci...119..623G|doi=10.1126/science.119.3097.623 |last3=Nye|first3=Sylvanus W.|last4=Dwyer|first4=Peter|last5=Fenn|first5=Wallace O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but came to prominence in 1956, when [[Denham Harman]] proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harman|first=D|title=The aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=November 1981|volume=78|issue=11|pages=7124–7128|pmid=6947277 |pmc=349208|doi=10.1073/pnas.78.11.7124 |bibcode=1981PNAS...78.7124H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Bruce N|author2=MK Shigenaga |author3=TM Hagen |title=Oxidants, antioxidants, and the degenerative diseases of aging |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |date=September 1993 |volume=90 |issue=17|pages=7915–7922 |pmid=8367443|pmc=47258|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.7915A|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.17.7915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckman|first=KB|author2=Ames BN|title=The free radial theory of aging matures|journal=Physiol Rev|date=April 1998|volume=78|issue=2|pages=547–581|pmid=9562038 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

==== DNA damage theory ====

DNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124–1140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30–45|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul–Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1–2|pages=12–22|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-linking theory====

The cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic ===
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=

=== General imbalance ===
General imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;

====Immunological theory====

The immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

=== Social theories of aging ===
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&amp;pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S. M. |editor3-last=Dittmann-Kohli |editor3-first=F. |editor4-last=Westerhof |editor4-first=G. |title=Ageing in Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C |year=2007 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-0020-1 |pages=68–84 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.&lt;ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"&gt;VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
theory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally 
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),&lt;ref name=life&gt;Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as
well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need
to be reconceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 }}&lt;br&gt;Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,&lt;ref name=Dennefer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14614120 |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America. Policies and perspectives on environment and aging|year=2016|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-3-319-21418-4|page=284|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowles, Graham D. |author2=Bernard, Miriam|title=Environmental Gerontology: Making Meaningful Places in Old Age|year=2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826108135|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheidt, Rick J. |author2=Schwarz, Benyamin|title=Environmental Gerontology. What Now?|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-62616-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahl, H-W. |author2=Scheidt, R.J. |author3=Windley, P.G. |title=Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Focus on Aging context: Socio-Physical Environments|year=2004|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826117342|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of environmental gerontology indicate that older people prefer to age in their immediate environment, whereas spatial experience and place attachment are important for understanding the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrews, GJ.  |author2=Phillips, DR.|title=Ageing and Place: Perspectives, Policy, Practice|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415481656|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the [[natural environment]] (such as natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 |issue=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

== Jurisprudential gerontology ==
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as "geriatric jurisprudence") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201–17|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335324|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193–6|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''giant panda''' (''[[Ailuropoda]] melanoleuca'', literally "black and white cat-foot"; {{zh|s=大熊猫|p=dà xióng māo}}, literally "big bear cat"),&lt;ref name="Scheff Duncan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheff|first=Duncan|title=Giant Pandas|edition=illustrated|series=Animals of the rain forest|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|isbn=0-7398-5529-8|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''panda bear''' or simply '''panda''', is a [[bear]]&lt;ref name="Lindburg, Donald G.; Baragona, Karen 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lindburg, Donald G. |author2=Baragona, Karen |title=Giant Pandas: Biology and Conservation |publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=0-520-23867-2|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; native to south central [[China]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated [[red panda]]. Though it belongs to the order [[Carnivora]], the giant panda's diet is over 99% [[bamboo]].&lt;ref&gt;Quote: "Bamboo forms 99 percent of a panda's diet", "more than 99 percent of their diet is bamboo": p. 63 of {{harvnb|Lumpkin|Seidensticker|2007}} (as seen in the 2002 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, [[shrub|shrub leaves]], oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/mammals/giant-panda/ |title=Giant Panda |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC |accessdate=8 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107032418/http://animal.discovery.com/mammals/giant-panda/ |archivedate=7 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GiantPandas/PandaFacts/default.cfm|title=Giant Pandas|publisher=National Zoological Park|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in [[Sichuan]], but also in neighbouring [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheff|first=Duncan|title=Giant Pandas|edition=illustrated|series=Animals of the rain forest|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|isbn=0-7398-5529-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of farming, [[deforestation]], and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

While the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] has often served as China's [[national symbol]], internationally the giant panda appears at least as commonly.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example since 1982 issuing [[Chinese Gold Panda|gold panda bullion]] coins or as one of the five [[Fuwa]] mascots of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]].

==Taxonomy==
===Classification===
For many decades, the precise [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and [[raccoon]]s.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Online"/&gt; However, [[genetics#molecular|molecular studies]] indicate the giant panda is a true [[bear]], part of the family Ursidae.&lt;ref name="Lindburg, Donald G.; Baragona, Karen 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Nash, Wildt, Bush &amp; Benveniste, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v317/n6033/abs/317140a0.html A molecular solution to the riddle of the giant panda's phylogeny], ''Nature'' Page 317, and pages 140 – 144 (12 September 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago)&lt;ref name="krause2008"/&gt; from the main [[Ursidae|ursine]] stock; since it is the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids.&lt;ref name = "Yu2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yu |first1=Li |last2=Li |first2=Yi-Wei |last3=Ryder |first3=Oliver A. |last4=Zhang |first4=Ya-Ping |title=Analysis of complete mitochondrial genome sequences increases phylogenetic resolution of bears (Ursidae), a mammalian family that experienced rapid speciation| journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |date=2007 |volume=7 |issue=198 |pages=198 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-198 |url=http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-7-198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krause2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Krause | first=J. | author2=Unger, T. | author3=Noçon, A. | author4=Malaspinas, A. | author5=Kolokotronis, S. | author6=Stiller, M. | author7=Soibelzon, L. | author8=Spriggs, H. | author9=Dear, P.

Despite the shared name, habitat type, and diet, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the ''pseudo thumb'' (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and [[red panda]] are only distantly related.

===Etymology===
The word ''panda'' was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word ''panda'' has been found.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. ''panda'' n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The closest candidate is the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word ''ponya,'' possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda. Until 1901, when it was erroneously stated to be related to the red panda, the giant panda was known as "black and white cat-footed animal" (''Ailuropus melanoleucus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Zoological Society|title=Animal Kingdom, Volumes 90–91|date=1987|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baby Pandas.JPG|thumb|Panda cubs]]
In many older encyclopedic sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" originally referred to the lesser-known [[red panda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/ailufulg.htm|title=Animal Info – Red Panda}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus necessitating the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441032/giant-panda |title=giant panda (mammal) -- Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515123427/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441032/giant-panda |archive-date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and simply "panda" for the [[Ailuridae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda |title=panda (mammal, Ailurus species) -- Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515120439/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda |archive-date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the popular usage of the word "panda".

Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as ''huāxióng'' ({{lang|zh|花熊}} "spotted bear") and ''zhúxióng'' ({{lang|zh|竹熊}} "bamboo bear").&lt;ref name="huayuqiao.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huayuqiao.org/articles/yaodehuai/yaodh08.htm|title= Discussion about the Chinese name for giant panda (in Chinese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular names in China today is ''dàxióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|大熊貓}} literally "giant bear cat"), or simply ''xióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|熊貓}} "bear cat"). The name ''xióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|熊貓}} "bear cat") was originally used to describe the [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens''), but since giant panda was thought to be closely related to red panda, ''dàxióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|大熊貓}}) was named relatively.&lt;ref name="huayuqiao.org"/&gt;

In [[Taiwan]], another popular name for panda is the inverted ''dàmāoxióng'' ({{lang|zh|大貓熊}} "giant cat bear"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings.&lt;ref name="huayuqiao.org"/&gt; This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in [[Tainan]] painted a [[sun bear]] black and white and created the  [[Tainan fake panda incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government Information Office will now use ''dàxióngmāo'' as the proper name (in Chinese)|url=http://udndata.com/ndapp/Story2007?no=31&amp;page=4&amp;udndbid=udndata&amp;SearchString=v9%2B6tSu6tb%2FfK6TptME%2BPTE5NTEwMTAxK6TptME8PTIwMDAwMTAx&amp;sharepage=10&amp;select=0&amp;kind=2&amp;article_date=1990-08-09&amp;news_id=100993201&amp;showUserSearch=+%3Cstrong%3E%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B1%7A%A5%48%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E%BF%DF%BA%B5%2B%BA%B5%BF%DF%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3E%3D19510101%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3C%3D20000101%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%A6%40%B7%6A%B4%4D%A8%EC%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E68%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B5%A7%B8%EA%AE%C6%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fstrong%3E&amp;firstFatherCateID=&amp;collectCateNewsPage=1|date=1990-08-09|newspaper=聯合報}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="bear cat" or "cat bear" (in Chinese)|url=http://udndata.com/ndapp/Story2007?no=307&amp;page=31&amp;udndbid=udndata&amp;SearchString=tsKl1bq1L7q1v98vv9%2B6tSuk6bTBPj0xOTg3MTIwMSuk6bTBPD0xOTg4MTIzMQ%3D%3D&amp;sharepage=10&amp;select=1&amp;kind=2&amp;article_date=1987-12-29&amp;news_id=103310434&amp;showUserSearch=+%3Cstrong%3E%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B1%7A%A5%48%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E%B6%C2%A5%D5%BA%B5%2F%BA%B5%BF%DF%2F%BF%DF%BA%B5%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3E%3D19871201%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3C%3D19881231%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%A6%40%B7%6A%B4%4D%A8%EC%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E317%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B5%A7%B8%EA%AE%C6%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fstrong%3E&amp;firstFatherCateID=&amp;collectCateNewsPage=1|date=1987-12-29|newspaper=聯合報}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white.

Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are [[adaptation]]s to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist [[Russell Ciochon]] observed: "[much] like the vegetarian [[gorilla]], the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo."&lt;ref name = Johnson/&gt; Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw.&lt;ref name = Johnson/&gt; Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.

The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2-2.4 mya with the emergence of ''A. microta''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=C|last2=Ciochon|first2=R.

Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as ''[[Fargesia dracocephala]]''&lt;ref name=chinaflora&gt;{{Cite book| last =Li| first =De-Zhu; Guo, Zhenhua; Stapleton, Chris | contribution =Fargesia dracocephala | year =2007| title =Flora of China| editor-last =Wu| editor-first =Z.

Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lrrd.cipav.org.co/lrrd4/2/dolberg.htm|title=Progress in the utilization of urea-ammonia treated crop residues: biological and socio-economic aspects of animal production and application of the technology on small farms|last=Dolberg|first=Frands|date=1 August 1992|publisher=University of Arhus|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth, and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lumpkin|Seidensticker|2007|pp=63–64}} (page numbers as per the 2002 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits, and analysed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas and during breeding season the pandas would trek back down to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pandas roam to find better bamboo|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/07/pandas-roam-to-find-better-bamboo|accessdate=17 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predators===
Although adult giant pandas have few natural predators other than humans, young cubs are vulnerable to attacks by [[snow leopard]]s, [[yellow-throated marten]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Predator of giant panda|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/giant_panda/panda/kung_fu_panda_enemies_defences/|publisher=WWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; eagles, feral dogs, and the [[Asian black bear]]. Sub-adults weighing up to {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} may be vulnerable to predation by [[Chiense leopard|leopard]]s.&lt;ref name="Schaller et al., 1985"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schaller, G.B., Jinchu, H., Wenshi, P., and Jing, Z. |year=1985 |title=The giant pandas of Wolong |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
The giant panda is a [[terrestrial animal]] and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the [[Qin Mountains|Qinling Mountains]] and in the hilly province of [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/pandacentral/htm/learn_about_giant_panda/panda_q_a/panda_behavior_habitat.htm |title=Panda behavior &amp; habitat |publisher=World Wildlife Federation China |accessdate=16 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607110445/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/pandacentral/htm/learn_about_giant_panda/panda_q_a/panda_behavior_habitat.htm |archivedate=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giant pandas are generally solitary.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GiantPandas/PandaFacts/default.cfm|title=Giant Panda|publisher=National Zoological Park|accessdate=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dudley|first=Karen|title=Giant Pandas|edition=illustrated|series=Untamed world|year=1997|publisher=Weigl Educational Publishers|isbn=0-919879-87-X|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandas were thought to fall into the [[crepuscular]] category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, pandas do not need to fear predators like other herbivores. They can therefore be active at any time of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2015/08/pandas-live-different-rhythm Pandas Live by a Different Rhythm] published on 08/07/2015 by  Michigan State Univ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandas communicate through vocalization and scent marking such as clawing trees or [[spraying (animal behavior)|spraying urine]].&lt;ref name=wwf1/&gt; They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not [[hibernation|hibernate]], which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures.&lt;ref name="AnimalInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/ailumela.htm|title=Animal Info – Giant Panda|publisher=Animal Info|author=Paul Massicot|date=13 February 2007|accessdate=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandas rely primarily on [[spatial memory]] rather than [[visual memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan04/pandas.html|title=Understanding the giant panda| author=Deborah Smith Bailey|volume=35 |issue=1 |date=January 2004 |publisher=American Psychological Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans, presumably out of irritation rather than aggression.&lt;ref name=attack&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenager hospitalized after panda attack in Chinese zoo|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304249,00.html|publisher=Fox News/Associated Press|date=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=attack2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7743748.stm |title=Panda attacks man in Chinese zoo|publisher=BBC News |date=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=attack3&gt;{{cite news|title=Giant panda in China bites third victim|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/01/09/panda.attack/index.html|publisher=CNN News|date=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Chengdu-pandas-d18.jpg|thumb|right|A giant panda cub. At birth, the giant panda typically weighs 100 to 200 grams ({{frac|3|1|2}} to 7&amp;nbsp;oz) and measures {{convert|15|to|17|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/ailumela.htm#Early|title=Animal Info – Giant Panda|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by [[artificial insemination]], as they seemed to lose their interest in [[mating]] once they were captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National Zoo's Giant Panda Undergoes Artificial Insemination |url=http://www.nbc4.com/news/15643501/detail.html |work=[[NBC]] |agency=Associated Press |date= 19 March 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them [[Panda pornography|videos of giant pandas mating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Narunart |last=Prapanya |title='Panda porn' to encourage mating |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/01/25/panda.passion/index.html |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |date= 25 January 2006 |accessdate=13 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and giving the males [[sildenafil]] (commonly known by name Viagra).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pandas unexcited by Viagra |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2246588.stm |publisher=BBC News |date= 9 September 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the [[American black bear]], a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.&lt;ref name="pandasinc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

Giant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giant Panda Reproduction |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/kits/pandas/nzp_panda_reproduction.pdf |work=National Zoological Park |accessdate=13 April 2008 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527204441/http://newsdesk.si.edu/kits/pandas/nzp_panda_reproduction.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into [[estrus]], which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year.&lt;ref name=reproduction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4panda.com/panda/pandatips/reproduction.htm |title=Giant Panda Reproduction |accessdate=14 April 2008 |last=Kleiman |first=Devra G |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807161537/http://www.4panda.com/panda/pandatips/reproduction.htm |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. [[sexual intercourse|Copulation]] time is short, ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. The [[gestation]] period ranges from 95 to 160 days.&lt;ref name=reproduction/&gt;

Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Ruane23Aug&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/giant-panda-preparing-to-give-birth-national-zoo-says/2015/08/22/bba0fd2c-4804-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html |title= National Zoo’s giant panda Mei Xiang gives birth to two cubs hours apart |first1=Michael E. |last1=Ruane |first2=Elizabeth |last2=Koh |first3=Martin |last3=Weil |work=The Washington Post |date=23 August 2015 |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild.

For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black. A slight pink color may appear on cub's fur, as a result of a [[chemical reaction]] between the fur and its mother's [[saliva]]. A month after birth, the color pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Online"/&gt; mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months,&lt;ref name="Sept Exam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/videos/panda-update-september-cub-exam.html|title=Panda Update: September Cub Exam|date=4 May 2006|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC|accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;pounds) at one year, and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.

In July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm.&lt;ref name="Baby panda born from frozen sperm"/&gt; The cub was born at 07:41 on 23 July that year in [[Sichuan]] as the third cub of You You, an 11-year-old.&lt;ref name="Baby panda born from frozen sperm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="World's 1st giant panda born from frozen sperm in SW China"/&gt;&lt;ref name="First panda cub born using frozen sperm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0725/1224251307368.html|title=First panda cub born using frozen sperm|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2009|work=The Irish Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique for freezing the sperm in [[liquid nitrogen]] was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the problem of lessening giant panda semen availability, which had led to inbreeding.&lt;ref name="First panda cub born using frozen sperm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="China announces first panda from frozen sperm"/&gt; Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species.&lt;ref name="Baby panda born from frozen sperm"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8168491.stm|title=Baby panda born from frozen sperm|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2009|publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World's 1st giant panda born from frozen sperm in SW China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/24/content_11766726.htm|title=World's 1st giant panda born from frozen sperm in SW China|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2009|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226013440/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/24/content_11766726.htm|archivedate=26 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and [[Mexico City]] will now be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas.&lt;ref name="China announces first panda from frozen sperm"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-07-24-panda_N.htm|title=China announces first panda from frozen sperm|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=24 January 2011|work=USA TODAY|first=Tini|last=Tran}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, a rare birth of panda triplets was announced in China; it was the fourth of such births ever reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rare-panda-triplets-born-in-china-1.2734071|title=Rare panda triplets born in China|date=12 August 2014|work=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the [[Empress Dowager Bo]] was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in [[history of China|Ancient China]], pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control [[menses]] as described in the [[Qin Dynasty]] encyclopedia ''[[Erya]]''.&lt;ref name="Schaller 1993 61"&gt;{{harvnb|Schaller|1993|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creature named ''mo'' (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda.&lt;ref name="Schaller 1993 61"/&gt; The dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' ([[Eastern Han Dynasty]]) says that the ''mo'', from [[Shu (state)|Shu]] (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinese.dsturgeon.net/text.pl?node=26160&amp;if=en&amp;searchu=%E8%B2%98#n32614 Shuowen Jiezi, Chapter 10, radical 豸]: "貘：似熊而黃黑色，出蜀中" ("''Mo'': like bear, but yellow-and-black, comes from [[Shu (state)|Shu]]").&lt;/ref&gt; although the older ''[[Erya]]'' describes ''mo'' simply as a "white leopard".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinese.dsturgeon.net/text.pl?node=39144&amp;if=en Erya, Chapter "釋獸" ("About animals")]: "貘，白豹" (''Mo'', white leopard).&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature ''[[pixiu]]'' (貔貅) as referring to the giant panda is also common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kepu.net.cn/english/giantpanda/giantpanda_know/200409230028.html China Giant Panda Museum: Historical Records in Ancient China].

During the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]] (early 15th century), his relative from [[Kaifeng]] sent him a captured ''[[zouyu]]'' ([[:zh:騶虞|騶虞]]), and another ''zouyu'' was sighted in [[Shandong]]. ''Zouyu'' is a legendary "righteous" animal, which, similarly to a ''[[qilin]]'', only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a [[tiger]], but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a [[white tiger]] with black spots.

The comparative obscurity of the giant panda throughout most of China's history is illustrated by the fact that, despite there being a number of depictions of bears in [[Chinese art]] starting from its most ancient times, and the bamboo being one of the favorite subjects for Chinese painters, there are no known pre-20th-century artistic representations of giant pandas.

===Western discovery===
The West first learned of the giant panda on 11 March 1869, when the French [[missionary]] [[Armand David]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Online"/&gt; received a skin from a hunter. The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda is the German zoologist [[Hugo Weigold]], who purchased a cub in 1916. [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], became the first Westerners to shoot a panda, on an expedition funded by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in the 1920s. In 1936, [[Ruth Harkness]] became the first Westerner to bring back a live giant panda, a cub named [[Su Lin (1930s giant panda)|Su Lin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=DA | last=Watson | title=The Panda Lady: Ruth Harkness (Part 1) |url=http://femexplorers.com/full_article.php?article_id=17 | publisher=Female explorers|accessdate=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went to live at the [[Brookfield Zoo]] in Chicago. In 1938, five giant pandas were sent to London.&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite web | title = Giant Pandas Through Singapore. Rare Animals from Wilds of China.

===Panda diplomacy===
{{main|Panda diplomacy}}
Gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between the PRC and the West. This practice has been termed "panda diplomacy".

By 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, the PRC began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of the PRC. Since 1998, because of a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] [[lawsuit]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] only allows a US [[zoo]] to import a panda if the zoo can ensure the PRC will channel more than half of its loan fee into [[conservation movement|conservation]] efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.

In May 2005, the PRC offered a breeding pair to [[Taiwan]]. The issue became embroiled in [[cross-Strait relations]] – both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered "domestic" or "international", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/45901/ China's Panda Politics]. [[Newsweek]]. 15 October 2007. Retrieved 23 May 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010223523/http://www.newsweek.com/id/45901/ |date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names [[Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan]] (from ''tuanyuan'', meaning "reunion", i.e. "reunification"). PRC's offer was initially rejected by [[Chen Shui-bian]], then President of Taiwan. However, when [[Ma Ying-jeou]] assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/23/china-taiwan-pandas China sends panda peace offering]. [[The Guardian]]. 28 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofuel===

Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating [[biofuels]] from bamboo and other plant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/09/130910-panda-poop-might-help-turn-plants-into-fuel |title=Panda Poop Might Help Turn Plants Into Fuel |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The giant panda is a [[vulnerable species]], threatened by continued [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Renqiang|last2=Xu|first2=Ming|last3=Wong|first3=Michelle Hang Gi|title=Climate change threatens giant panda protection in the 21st century|journal=Biological Conservation|date=February 2015|volume=182|pages=93–101|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.037}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name="Britannica Earth"/&gt; Its range is currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern [[Myanmar]], and northern [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

The giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat, and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the [[Chinese economic reform]], demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the [[underground economy|black market]], acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.

[[File:Panda Cub from Wolong, Sichuan, China.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup of a seven-month-old panda cub]]

Though the [[Wolong National Nature Reserve]] was set up by the PRC government in 1958 to save the declining panda population, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline, and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a [[rare species]].

In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes [[DNA]] from panda [[Feces|droppings]], scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.&lt;ref name="Britannica Earth"/&gt; In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998.&lt;ref name="BBC_06-07" /&gt; As the species has been reclassified to "vulnerable" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the [[State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China|State Forestry Administration of China]] announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/195/content-902929.html The Panda is still endangered species, and the conservation efforts still need to be reinforced] ''State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China'' (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] designation. The [[Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries]], located in the southwest province of [[Sichuan]] and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5174854.stm Pandas gain world heritage status] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060718-072442-2033r Panda sanctuaries now World Heritage sites] ''United Press International''&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. [[Chris Packham]] has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is "pointless" because "there is not enough habitat left to sustain them".&lt;ref name="Packham"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/6216775/Chris-Packham-Giant-pandas-should-be-allowed-to-die-out.html Chris Packham: 'Giant pandas should be allowed to die out']. [[Telegraph.co.uk]]. 22 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Packham argues that the money spent on pandas would be better spent elsewhere,&lt;ref name="Packham"/&gt; and has said he would "eat the last panda if I could have all the money we have spent on panda conservation put back on the table for me to do more sensible things with",&lt;ref name="Packham2"&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22730796-30417,00.html Beyond cute and cuddly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116040347/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22730796-30417,00.html |date=16 January 2009 }}. [[The Australian]]. 10 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; though he has apologized for upsetting people who like pandas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/09/23/bear-raid-115875-21693846/ |title=TV Packham says sorry for 'ditch pandas' blast |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229234817/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/09/23/bear-raid-115875-21693846/ |archivedate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out, "The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century."&lt;ref name="Packham2"/&gt; However, a 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an [[umbrella species]] as the preservation of their habitat also helps other [[endemic species]] in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pimm, Stuart L. |author2=Li, Binbin V. |year=2015|title=China's endemic vertebrates sheltering under the protective umbrella of the giant panda|journal=Conservation Biology|doi=10.1111/cobi.12618|volume=30|issue=2 |pages=329–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Earthwatch Institute]], a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called "On the Trail of Giant Panda". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthwatch.org/exped/zhang.html |title=Earthwatch: On the Trail of Giant Panda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In zoos===
{{Main|Giant pandas around the world|List of giant pandas}}
{{category see also|Individual giant pandas}}

Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the [[Western Han Dynasty]] in China, where the writer [[Sima Xiangru]] noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital [[Chang'an]] (present [[Xi'an]]). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller pg.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chi Chi (giant panda)|Chi Chi]] at the [[London Zoo]] became very popular. This influenced the [[World Wildlife Fund]] to use a panda as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/giantpanda/panda.html |title=Giant Panda: Overview |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref name=nytimesgoodman&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/national/12panda.html|title=Eats Shoots, Leaves and Much of Zoos' Budgets|last=Goodman|first=Brenda|date=12 February 2006|accessdate=9 August 2010|location=Atlanta|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than that of the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1&amp;nbsp;million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20081213-9999-1n13panda.html|title=Zoo negotiates lower price to rent bears from China|publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|date=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last contract, with the [[Memphis Zoo]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], ended in 2013.&lt;ref name=nytimesgoodman /&gt;

=== Reference in medicine ===
The [[Face of the Giant Panda Sign]] is an [[MRI]] sign in patients with [[Wilson's disease]], named for the midbrain's resemblance to a giant panda's face.

=== In cryptozoology ===

[[Cryptozoologist]]s use Giant Pandas as an example of an animal recently discovered by science. For example, Guy Edwards writes, "The Giant Panda was once as mythical and elusive as Bigfoot."&lt;ref name=Edwards2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Guy|title=Panda discovered in 1927 was once as elusive as Bigfoot|url=http://www.bigfootlunchclub.com/2009/11/panda-discovered-in-1927-was-once-as.html|website=www.bigfootlunchclub.com|publisher=Bigfoot Lunch Club|accessdate=11 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311175110/http://www.bigfootlunchclub.com/2009/11/panda-discovered-in-1927-was-once-as.html|archivedate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that there are "many animals that symbolize the search for Bigfoot is not over."&lt;ref name=Edwards2009/&gt;

[[Skeptical]] cryptozoologist [[Joe Nickell]], notes that since Giant Pandas were known to local people, they qualify as [[cryptids]].&lt;ref name=Nickell2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickell|first1=Joe |authorlink=Joe Nickell |title=The Giant Panda: Discovered in the Land of Myth |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=January 2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=12–14 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike [[Bigfoot]], pandas specimens were quickly obtained after [[Armand David]] learned of them. Also, fossil evidence shows that pandas were once widespread, including the two million year old skull of ''[[Ailuropoda microta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remains Of Earliest Giant Panda Discovered|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070618174710.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=11 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311182107/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070618174710.htm|archivedate=11 March 2018|language=en|date=June 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guilt-free consumption''' (GFC) is a pattern of [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]] based on the minimization of the sense of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] which consumers incur when purchasing products or commercial services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trendwatching.com/trends/guiltfreeconsumption/|title=Guilt-Free Consumption|last=Izzo|first=John|date=November 2013|website=trendwatching.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[ethical consumerism]], and the following availability of information about the ethicality of products, can be understood as the driving force of guilt free consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this sense, the feeling of guilt experienced by consumers is fostered by their knowledge of the potential consequences of their choices. The tension between consumers' values and the awareness that their actions may run counter to those same values, manifests itself as a potent, nagging guilt.

Consumers are therefore induced to prefer those companies which are able to offer sustainable practices and products in order to minimize their sense of guiltiness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/john-izzo/guilt-free-consumption_b_6140182.html|title=Businesses Need To Start Focusing on 'Guilt-Free' Consumption To Get Ahead.|last=Izzo|first=John|date=11 November 2014|website=Huff Post|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of concern ==
GFC is concerned with three main dimensions&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in which the sense of guilt arises: 
* self: guilt about one's impact on oneself or on their family, e.g. people worrying about their physical and mental well-being.   
* society and nature: guilt about social impact, including damages directly and indirectly caused to other people (and other living creatures), e.g. people worrying about poor working conditions, sub-poverty wages and exploitation.
* planet: guilt about environmental impact e.g. people worrying about wasteful packaging, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, rainforest destruction. 
However, there is a fourth dimension that mainly affect newly minted urban consumers: the so-called "cultural-guilt";&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the feeling of culpability caused by the split between global and traditional consumption, e.g. people worrying about the abandoning of their identity in favor of [[globalization]] (globalized culture of consumerism).

A totally guilt free consumption is almost impossible to achieve, since products or servicing reducing guilt on one dimension, might foster the same negative feeling on an other; as a consequence GFC aims at the minimization of guilt rather than striving for a complete deletion.

== Guilt and the divided self ==
Guilt arises when individuals fail in meeting their own personal self-standards or when a conflict among what the theory of discrepancy calls "selves", emerges.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peloza|first=John|date=January 2013|title=Good and Guilt-Free: The Role of Self-Accountability in Influencing Preferences for Products with Ethical Attributes.|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=77|pages=104–119|doi=10.1509/jm.11.0454|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[self-discrepancy theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Tory|date=1987|title=Self-Discrepancy. A Theory Relating Self and Affect.|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/higgins/papers/HIGGINS=PSYCH%20REVIEW%201987.pdf|journal=American Psychological Association|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are a number of "selves" guiding and shaping one's behavior:
* the actual self - the present self that one is.
* the ideal self - the self toward which one strives and aspires to be.
* the ought self - the self toward which a sense of duty or responsibility is perceived and felt.
Guilt can be associated with failure to meet social expectations, thus self-standards can be heavily influenced by social norms which lead to the juxtaposition between one's own judgement of one's behavior and others' judgements of one's behavior. However, individuals are eventually motivated to meet self-standards regardless to others's judgement since social norms become easily internalized through socialization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The level of private self characterizing guilt leads to the definition of it as the negative emotional state associated with possible objection to one's actions, inaction, circumstances or intentions.

Consumers are therefore torn between the awareness of their potentially negative impact, and their willingness to enjoying the whole process of consumption. GFC can be understood as a minimization of the feeling of guilt without necessarily aiming at zero impact condition.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

This unachievable freedom from negative emotional states, can be seen in the light of the psychological nature of human beings as characterized by a very heterogeneous mix of status, among which the genuine pleasure derived from consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globescan.com/98-press-releases-2013/291-two-and-a-half-billion-aspirational-consumers-mark-shift-in-sustainable-consumption.html|title=From Obligation To Desire: 2.5 Billion Aspiration Consumers Mark Shift in Sustainable Consumption.|last=|first=|date=October 2013|website=Globescan|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that consumers feel the need to satisfy this sort of hedonism, makes it impossible for them to completely stop their damaging consumption patterns; as a consequences companies want to actively reduce the dichotomy by acting as mediator between the various selves.

== Guilt and buyer's remorse ==
GFC can be seen as a way to prevent [[buyer's remorse]], although the latter is a post-purchase dissonance mainly associated with monetary concerns.

The distinction between the two phenomena comes from the fact that buyer's remorse involves the negative feelings emerging after an excessively expensive product or service, while GFC embraces three different areas of concern. Moreover, buyer's remorse arises after the purchase is accomplished and companies can actively try to alleviate it through money back guarantees,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Darren W.|date=October 2003|title=The Nature of Self-Reported Guilt in Consumption Contexts|jstor=40216496|journal=Marketing Letters 14|volume=14|issue=3|pages=159–171|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the sense of guiltiness involving GFC is minimized at the root when firms engage themselves in more responsible production and distribution processes.

== GFC in luxury goods ==
GFC has been influencing luxury market since even wealthiest consumers are becoming suspicious with regard to brands promoting fancy lifestyle.

Wealthy consumers indeed seem more and more influenced by the so-called "existential guilt", a particular sense of guilt individuals may even experience if they feel they benefit from unjustified privileges relative to others or if they accept some responsibility for social ills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shame and guilt in interpersonal relationships.|last=Tangney|first=June Price|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=114–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, affluent consumers are putting global and social considerations as their first priority, strengthening  the shift from conspicuous consumption to more conscientious buying habits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One popular way in which luxury brands are approaching and exploiting guilt-free consumption, is the attenuation of consumers' sense of guilt, hopefully followed by some sort of "license to indulge" in the desired product or service, through the promotion of charity organizations partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-12-luxury-charity-partnerships-retail-sales-holiday.html|title=Luxury-charity partnerships can help promote retail sales this holiday season|last=|first=|date=14 December 2015|website=phys.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies' involvement ==
GFC's trend affected the way in which companies engage themselves in the creation of value through products, services,  production processes and social initiatives. This tendency, aimed at supporting a more conscious and guiltless pattern of consumption, begun even before GFC's full development.

[[The Body Shop]] anticipated the trend by joining environmental and human rights campaigns, for example inviting people to wash up empty bottles of products and having them refilled at the shop. Other examples of the British firm's involvement in social causes are its minimal packaging policy and the project aimed at helping disadvantages communities through Community Trade program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Promotional reflexivity: irony, de-fethisation and moralziation in the bodyshop promotional rhetoric.|last=Sassatelli|first=Roberta|publisher=I libri di Emil|year=2010|isbn=978-88-96026-29-8|location=Bologna|pages=229–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, there has been fuller engagement of firms in helping consumers minimizing their sense of guilt. In some cases companies focused on absolving one of the three areas of concern related to guilt-free consumption, but it is not always clear to which areas a particular strategy can be linked to since the three dimensions are often overlapping.
* Guilt free consumption implementation in the first area of concern.
The strategy implemented by [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]] can be understood in the light of the first class of GFC areas of concern: the personal self. In 2013 Burger King launched Satisfires, a line of fries with 40% of fat and 30% of calories less than McDonald's equivalent. Meanwhile, McDonald's announced a global partnership with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation in order to provide consumers with healthier meals: side-salad, fruit or vegetables as substitute for fried. Furthermore, the company decided that at least 70% of the food prepared and sold by a specific store of McDonald's, had to come from that same country in which the store was located.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Guilt-free consumption's implementation in the second area of concern. 
In the Netherlands, a new generation of mobile phones, by the local firm [[Fairphone]], provided smartphones which are manufactured without using minerals and with a special care of workers' welfare. This type of strategy fits the second area of concern related to GFC, therefore involving society and nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Guilt-free consumption's implementation in the third area of concern.
Miya's Sushi, a sushi restaurant chain in Connecticut, went beyond simply avoiding offering endangered fish species in its menu, it provided delicacies made with invasive species that were damaging the local habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These two cases can be linked to the third dimension of GFC regarding the planet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Gyeong Dae-seung''' ([[Hangul]]: 경대승, [[Hanja]]: 慶大升) (1154 – 4 August 1183) was the third major military dictators who ruled during the late period of the [[Goryeo]]. Unlike his predecessors, General Gyeong was determined to fix the Goryeo's problems and help the people prosper. His popularity with the people aroused the jealousy of King [[Myeongjong of Goryeo]].{{cn|date=January 2012}} His military dictatorship over Goryeo signified a brief period of peace within the war-ravaged kingdom.

== Background ==
General Gyeong Dae-seung was born to Gyeong Jin into the [[Cheongju]] Gyeong clan in the year 1154. At the time of his birth, the warrior-class of the nation was highly undermined and deprived of the luxuries that its civilian and scholar counterparts were able to see excessively. The young Gyeong began his military training at the age of 15, and served under the regimes of both [[Yi Ui-bang]] and [[Jeong Jung-bu]]. When his father died, he took charge of his household and began helping the poor, and made the decision of using the private army that his father had built.

== Dictator ==
In 1179, the young General Gyeong led a revolt against the current-reigning dictator Jeong Jung-bu, killing his son and son-in-law in the process of overthrowing any trace of the regime. At the age of 26, Gyeong had overthrown the powerful Jeong military regime and had become the undisputed military dictator of Goryeo. The greatest help to Gyeong was his lifelong friend General Kim Ja-Gyuk, who wanted to put Gyeong on the Imperial throne. Gyeong did not allow such things to overcome his original purpose for taking power. Gyeong Dae-seung became very popular among the people and received the name, "Righteous, young general."{{cn|date=January 2012}} Emperor Myeongjong became jealous of Gyeong's popularity and power, and rejected the young general as merely another bloodthirsty barbaric warrior who was greedy for power.{{cn|date=January 2012}} Despite efforts to restore peace, Gyeong was faced with assassination attempts, the most notable being an attempt by his friend Kim Ja-Gyuk to poison him.{{cn|date=January 2012}} This attempt failed and Gyeong was military dictator over Goryeo for five years until he became ill (possibly tuberculosis) that eventually killed him.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

== Death and aftermath ==
Gyeong Dae-seung died in August 1183. With the death of Gyeong, Yi Ui-bang's former lieutenant [[Yi Ui-min]] returned to [[Kaesong]] and took power over Goryeo, undoing Gyeong's legacy.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

'''HMS ''C33''''' was one of 38 [[British C-class submarine|C-class submarine]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century. The boat survived the First World War and was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1920.

==Design and description==
The C-class boats of the 1907–08 and subsequent Naval Programmes were modified to improve their speed, both above and below the surface. The submarine had a length of {{convert|142|ft|3|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13|ft|7|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|290|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|320|LT|t}} submerged. The C-class submarines had a crew of two officers and fourteen [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 12-cylinder&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[petrol engine]] that drove one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged the propeller was driven by a {{convert|300|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]].&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt; They could reach {{convert|13|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the C class had a range of {{convert|910|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapters 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as they would have to remove an equal weight of fuel in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
HMS ''C33'' was built by [[Chatham Dockyard|HM Dockyard Chatham]]. She was laid down on 29 March 1909 and was commissioned on 13 August 1910. ''C33'' was involved in the [[U-Boat]] trap tactic. The tactic was to use a decoy trawler to tow a submarine. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack the U-boat. The tactic was partly successful, but it was abandoned after the loss of two C class submarines. In both cases, all the crew were lost.

''C33'' was one of the two C class submarines lost while employing this tactic. She was [[Naval mine|mine]]d off [[Great Yarmouth]] while operating with the armed trawler ''Malta'' on 4 August 1915.

'''''Hadlow''''' was a 374-ton merchant sailing ship built in 1814 at [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[British North America]]. She made two voyages [[convicts in Australia|transporting convicts]] from England and Ireland to Australia. She plied between England, India and Sierra Leone before being lost with all hands in 1823.

==Construction==
''Hadlow'' was built for W. Parker &amp; Co.; she was a two-deck [[full-rigged ship]] with a [[Copper sheathing|coppered]] hull, she was assessed at around 374 tons (bm). Her port of registry was London.&lt;ref name=LR1821&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/lloydsregisters89unkngoog#page/n239/mode/2up |journal=Lloyd's Register |title=The Register of Shipping for the Year 1821. |year=1821 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadlow18/&gt;

In July 1818, ''Hadlow'' was fitted for the [[convicts in Australia|transportation of convicts]] at [[Deptford Dockyard]], [[Kent]]. Her guard of a lieutenant and 32 troops of the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot|48th Regiment of Foot]] embarked on 17 July, along with six women and four children. She sailed to [[Woolwich]], Kent on 30 July and took 50 male convicts from the [[prison hulk]] [[HMS Zeeland (1796)|''Justitia'']] on 1 August.

He began acting in the theatre company [[Bungakuza]] and later co-founded Gekidan Kumo (劇団雲; Theatre Company Gekidan) in 1963. Nishimoto then joined [[Theatre Company Subaru]] in 1976. He provided the voice of [[Snufkin]] in the television adaptions of ''[[Moomin]]'', a book series and comic strip by [[Tove Jansson]]. Nishimoto was also known for dubbing the Japanese language versions of many Disney films. He died of an aortic dissection in 2015, aged 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moomin's Snufkin Voice Actor Hiroyuki Nishimoto Passes Away|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-04-21/moomin-snufkin-voice-actor-hiroyuki-nishimoto-passes-away/.87338|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Anime News Network|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joule Unlimited''', formerly known as Joule Biotechnologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/04/28/cambridge_firm_set_to_plow_30m_into_nonfossil_fuel_production/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Erin | last=Ailworth | title=$30M Is Feeding A Quest For Nonfossil Fuels | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a producer of alternative energy technologies based in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]]. The company developed a process to generate hydrocarbon-based fuel by combining non-fresh water, nutrients, [[cyanobacteria]], [[carbon dioxide]], and sunlight.  After ten years of operation and building a demonstration plant in New Mexico, the company shut down in August 2017. The company shut down after management was unable to raise money, which the CEO attributed to [[Hillary Clinton]] losing the 2016 Presidential election. &lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/22/exclusive-podestas-green-company-forced-to-close-because-hillary-lost-the-election/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology claims==

The company claimed it would be able to produce more than 20,000 gallons of fuel per acre per year (19,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·a).&lt;ref name=wsj11&gt;{{cite news|last=TOTTY|first=MICHAEL|title=A Faster Path to Biofuels|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204524604576610703305792650?mod=WSJ_WSJ_News_JOURNALREPORTS7_2|accessdate=11 December 2011|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helioculture uses photosynthetic organisms, but is otherwise distinct from the process that makes [[Algae fuel|fuel from algae]]. Oils made from algae usually have to be refined into fuel following a batch process, but helioculture produces fuel directly - either ethanol or hydrocarbons - that do not need refining.  The Helioculture process also does not produce biomass.  This process is enabled by the discovery of unique genes coding for enzymatic mechanisms that enable the direct synthesis of both alkane, olefin, ethanol, and other key molecules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/06/03/portrait-of-a-transformative-technology-joule-unlimited/ Portrait of a Transformative Technology: Joule Unlimited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810211453/http://biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2010/06/03/portrait-of-a-transformative-technology-joule-unlimited/ |date=2010-08-10 }}, Biofuels Digest, June 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Helioculture allows for [[brackish water]] or [[graywater]], nonindustrial waste water from sources such as baths and washing machines,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE56Q5P520090727 U.S. company hopes to make fuel from sunlight, CO2], Reuters, July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to be used, while traditional biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol require fresh water.

Joule Unlimited claimed that its product would have been cost competitive with crude oil at $50 a barrel ($310/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The company also stated that its product could supply all of the transportation fuel for the United States from an area the size of the [[Texas panhandle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/business/23073/ A Biofuel Process to Replace All Fossil Fuels], technologyreview.com, July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Joule Unlimited did not reveal the name of the organism that it used, although it acknowledged that the company had modified the organism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2009/07/27/carbon_dioxide_sun_and_secret_ingredient_are_firms_fuel_recipe/ Carbon dioxide, sun, and secret ingredient are firm’s fuel recipe], Boston Globe, July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In September, 2010, Joule received a patent for genetically altered bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/science/earth/14fuel.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=joule%20unlimited&amp;st=cse Biotech Company to Patent Fuel-Secreting Bacterium], New York Times, September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Joule Unlimited was founded in 2007 within Flagship VentureLabs by Noubar Afeyan and [[David Berry (inventor)|David Berry]]. In addition to its founders, Joule's Board of Directors included [[Graham Allison]], [[Anatoly Chubais]], Stelios Papadopoulos, Caroline Dorsa, and [[Ruben Vardanian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jouleunlimited.com/board-directors-0]&lt;/ref&gt;  Joule's Scientific Advisory Board includes synthetic biologists [[George M.

'''Julius Briganticus''' (died AD 69) was a [[Batavians|Batavian]] who commanded [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalry in the [[Roman Army]]. He was the son of the sister of [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], the leader of the [[Batavian rebellion]], who apparently hated his nephew. The ''nomen'' Julius indicates he was a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]. The ''cognomen'' Briganticus perhaps suggests he, or his father, gained distinction fighting against the [[Brigantes]] of northern [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

In 69, during the civil wars of the [[Year of Four Emperors]], Briganticus initially fought for [[Otho]] but surrendered to [[Vitellius]]'s forces after the battle of [[Piacenza|Placentia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[Wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#22|2.22]]&lt;/ref&gt; He later commanded a picked squad of cavalry that had been formed by Vitellius but went over to [[Vespasian]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[Wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#70|4.70]]&lt;/ref&gt; He died fighting for the Romans under [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] against his uncle during the Batavian revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[Wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 5#21|5.21]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Khap''' is a community organisation representing a clan or a group of related clans. They are found mostly in northern India, particularly among the [[Jat people]] of [[Western Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Haryana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/hindi/india/2009/08/090805_honourkill_expert_as.shtml  क्या है खाप पंचायत, क्यों है उसका दबदबा?, Atul Sagar, BBC 5 August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; although historically the term has also been used among other communities. A '''Khap Panchayat''' is an assembly of Khap elders, and a '''Sarv Khap''' is an assembly of many Khap Panchayats like [[Dahiya Khap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryanas-biggest-khap-panchayat-scripts-history-allows-inter-caste-marriages/articleshow/34016585.cms |title=Haryana’s biggest khap panchayat scripts history, allows inter-caste marriages |first=Manveer |last=Saini |date=21 April 2014 |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1965_17/51/the_jats_of_northern_indiatheir_traditional_political_systemii.pdf |title=The Jats of Northern India Their Traditional Political System — II |first=M. C. |last=Pradhan |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=18 December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Khaps are not affiliated with the formally elected government bodies and is instead concerned with the affairs of the Khap it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samaylive.com/editorial/262627/khap-deleted-conditional-ban-on-interracial-marriages.html   खाप पंचायतों का हृदय परिवर्तन! अंजलि सिन्हा, Sahara Samay, 26 Apr 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not affiliated with the democratically elected local assemblies that are also termed [[Panchayati raj (India)|Panchayat]]. A Khap Panchayat has no official government recognition or authority, but can exert significant social influence within the community it represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaur |first=Ravinder |url=https://www.academia.edu/671328/Khap_panchayats_sex_ratio_and_female_agency |title=Khap panchayats, sex ratio and female agency &amp;#124; Ravinder Kaur |publisher=Academia.edu |date=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baliyan Khap]] as led by [[Mahendra Singh Tikait]] until 2011 is one that has gained particular media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/muzaffarnagar-riots-a-jat-family-protected-70-muslims-in-fugna-village/1/309827.html |title=Muzaffarnagar riots: A Jat family protected 70 Muslims in Fugna village |work=India Today |date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Khaps evolved as tribal and village administrations. One of the terms used to denote the [[republic]]{{clarify|reason=what republic? surely not the Republic of India?|date=August 2016}} was the ''Khap''. Others were [[Pal (government)|Pal]], [[Janapada]], and [[Ganasangha]]. The Khap consisted a unit of 84 villages. The individual villages were governed by an elected council, known as the ''[[Panchayat]]''. A unit of seven villages was called a ''Thamba'' and 12 Thambas formed the Khap unit of 84 villages, though Khaps of 12 and 24 villages existed. Their elected leaders would determine which units would be represented at the Khap level.{{cn|date=September 2016}} The ''Sarv Khap'' (or ''All Khap'') Panchayat (Council) represented all the Khaps. The individual Khaps would elect leaders who would send delegates to represent their Khaps at the Sarv Khap. It was a political organisation, composed of all the clans, communities, and castes in the region.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

These Khaps are found from Northwest India down to [[Maharastra]], [[Chennai]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Malwa]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Sindh]], [[Multan]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], and [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

== Decisions on social issues ==

The Khap Panchayats frequently make pronouncements on social issues, such as abortion, alcohol abuse, dowry, and to promote education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/Khap-Panchayats-Root-for-Educated-Leaders/2015/08/16/article2976237.ece | title=Khap Panchayats Root for Educated Leaders | first=Harpreet | last=Bajwa | newspaper=New Indian Express | date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; specially among girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryana-khaps-launch-campaign-for-girls-education/articleshow/36459145.cms | title=Haryana khaps launch campaign for girls' education | first=Sukhbir | last=Siwach | date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, one Khap Panchayat leader in Haryana blamed the eating of [[chow mein]], a non-traditional food, for the rise in [[rape in India]], while another suggested that the age of marriage should be dropped from 18 to 16 because being married would make young women less susceptible to rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryana-khap-blames-consumption-of-chowmein-for-rapes/articleshow/16829882.cms |title=Haryana khap blames consumption of chowmein for rapes |first=Manveer |last=Saini |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Telegraph |location=Calcutta |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1121008/jsp/nation/story_16065635.jsp#.V9djldFVK1E |title=Khap duo: Marry at 16 to check rape |date=8 October 2012 |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Khap in Haryana is the Satrol Khap, which allowed inter-caste marriage in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryanas-biggest-khap-panchayat-scripts-history-allows-inter-caste-marriages/articleshow/34016585.cms |title=Haryana's Biggest Khap Creates history |date=11 April 2014 |first=Manvir |last=Saini |work=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing the marriage is not within the same [[gotra]], village, or neighbouring villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://img.zeenews.com/hindi/news/india/700-yr-old-khap-ban-on-inter-caste-marriages-off/207500 | title=खाप पंचायत का ऐतिहासिक फैसला, अंतर्जातीय शादी को दी हरी झंडी | publisher=Zee News | date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 Sarv Khap meeting launched a "Save daughters, educate daughter" movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dainiktribuneonline.com/2015/05/%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%93-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A2%E0%A4%BC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%93-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D/ बेटी बचाओ, बेटी पढ़ाओ मुद्दे पर सर्वखाप महापंचायत, May - 17 - 2015 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisions of the patriarchal Khap Panchayats have often been associated with the practice of [[honour killing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marital Separation and Lethal Domestic Violence |first1=Desmond |last1=Ellis |first2=Noreen |last2=Stuckless |first3=Carrie |last3=Smith |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-31752-213-3 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=swrwBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In recent times, the Khap system has attracted criticism from groups, citing the stark prejudice that such groups allegedly hold against others. The [[All India Democratic Women's Association]] has reported cases where the Khaps are alleged to have initiated threats of murder and violence to couples who marry outside of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2125/stories/20041217002304200.htm |title=Caste terror |author=T.K. Rajalakshmi |work=frontline |volume=21 |issue=25 |date=4–17 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Opinion/Sunday_Specials/Panchayats_turn_into_kangaroo_courts/rssarticleshow/2351247.cms |title=Panchayats turn into kangaroo courts |date=9 September 2007 |author=Rohit Mullick &amp; Neelam Raaj |work=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of India]] has declared Khap Panchayats to be illegal because they often decree or encourage honour killings or other institutionalised atrocities against boys and girls of different castes and religions who wish to get married or have married.&lt;ref name="Venkatesan"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1710337.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |first=J. |last=Venkatesan |title=Stamp out khap panchayats: court |date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|This is wholly illegal and has to be ruthlessly stamped out. There is nothing honourable in honour killing or other atrocities and, in fact, it is nothing but barbaric and shameful murder. Other atrocities in respect of the personal lives of people committed by brutal, feudal-minded persons deserve harsh punishment. Only this way can we stamp out such acts of barbarism and feudal mentality. Moreover, these acts take the law into their own hands, and amount to kangaroo courts, which are wholly illegal.&lt;ref name="Venkatesan" /&gt;}}

In a 2012 report to the Supreme Court, Raju Ramachandaran, a Senior Advocate appointed by the Court to assist it in [[public interest litigation]] actions against Khap Panchayats, called for the arrest of "self styled" decision makers and for proactive action by the police to protect the fundamental rights of the people. He also asked for the recommendations to be converted into directions applicable to all [[states and union territories of India]] until a law is enacted by the [[Parliament of India|national parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Rein-in-khaps-prevent-honour-killings-SC-panel/Article1-890134.aspx |title= Rein in khaps, prevent honour killings: SC panel |date= 17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unofficial caste ==
There are sources that describe the Khap as unofficial caste system where the panchayat dominates all other members of the group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=India Diversity|last=David|first=Hilda|last2=Jarman|first2=Francis|publisher=Om Books International|year=2017|isbn=9789386316974|location=|pages=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the function of traditional caste and family systems, this Indian traditional institution engages in dispute resolution and the regulation of members' behavior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenging The Rules(s) of Law: Colonialism, Criminology and Human Rights in India|last=Kannabiran|first=Kalpana|last2=Singh|first2=Ranbir|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9780761936657|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group uses violence to maintain a rigid structure that controls members particularly, women, [[Dalit|Dalits]], [[Muslim|Muslims]], and youths. The panchayats aggressively push tradition and outlook in which caste divisions are desirable while violence towards lower castes is normal and acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An important Khap ethos involves the commitment - for the good of the community - to work with one's body, heart and soul under the leadership of its leaders, who are believed to have high moral superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Readings in Indian Sociology: Volume IX: Culture and Society|last=Visvanathan|first=Susan|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2013|isbn=9788132113904|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, these leaders are afforded the right to demand a member's life.

Despite the criticisms against this institution, it remains popular in some parts of India because, in its benign form, it resolves disputes and achieves social order with less time and resources. Sometimes, the Indian government avoids a direct confrontation with the panchayat especially in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Krvna Osveta''' ({{lang-sr|Крвна освета}}, '''''[[Blood feud]]''''') is a [[law]] of [[Feud|vendetta]] in [[Montenegro]] and [[Herzegovina]], practised by [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Albanians of Montenegro|Albanian families]] throughout history since medieval times. It is an oath of revenge for vendetta, meaning that the person must take revenge on whomever killed his relative by killing the murderer or one of the murderer's close relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Zora Latinovic, ''Krvna Osveta'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice started in [[the Balkans]] in the 15th century, under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule and the law decreased in the 19th century, when the Balkan countries slowly got their independence from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="glas-javnosti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2005/07/29/srpski/F05072802.shtml |title=glas-javnosti |publisher=arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Ottoman [[Serbian lands|Serbian principalities]], [[blood money (term)|blood money]] (''Vražda'') was paid, one half went to the Serbian Orthodox Church, while the other to the victim's family. Stefan Uroš (1240–1272) talks about the Vražda in his works. After Ottoman conquest of [[Serbia]], self-governing clans often feuded with each other. Families in Serbia abandoned the tradition as the bigger threats to family integrity was ethnic Albanians and Turks rather than of their own ethnic group.

When a family member has been killed, the perpetrator's family&lt;sup&gt;(Bratstva)&lt;/sup&gt; has a "Blood debt" (''krvni dug'') which can only be removed when the victim's family (an appointed member, ''osvetnik'') has had their revenge by killing the aggressor or any member of the murderer's family (Often a close male kinsman, preferably the brother, killing of children was not encouraged). Only then has the family of the victim received peace (However, the blood feud continues if a relative decides to revenge, disregardless of who started).&lt;ref name="BF" /&gt; However, killing in your own house is the worst action, representing unmorality, which is a great shame in Montenegrin and Albanian cultures. If a criminal was murdered, it often did not result in a feud as criminality was negative in the eyes of society, but in some cases the criminal's family went on to kill serdars and other high ranked people.

*In Montenegro, the feuds were predominantly among [[Montenegrins]] and [[Albanians of Montenegro|ethnic Albanians]] themselves.
*In Herzegovina (currently a region of both Montenegro and [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]]) [[Montenegrins]] had feuds with each other. A neutral region was Grahovo and Vučja Zuba (triangle of [[Boka Kotorska]], [[Montenegro]] and Herzegovina) where blood feuds were not recorded.
*In [[Old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) If a Serb had a weak family, he could be protected by an Albanian bratstva from other [[Albanians]] in exchange for anything from [[weapons]] or [[folk attire]] [[textile|material]] (Serbs had rich textile art in the southern Serbian regions)

The Osveta is not limited to males, females that have their husbands or relatives killed could take on the ''blood debt'', an instance is recorded from the [[Bjelopavlići (clan)|Bjelopavlići clan]], where a widow took out revenge for the murder of her husband.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;{{Google books |id=oq4B2WGT9mYC |title=Blood Revenge: The Enactment and Management of Conflict in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a bratstva finds and captures a thief or murderer (in connection to the bratstva) they could go to the person's house or relatives and tell them that their relative is a murderer or thief and end with something like "If we kill him, we are not to be held for" If the relatives answers "Do what you like with him" -the bratstva, if they kill the captive, they don't have a blood debt to his relatives because they settled his fate.

The blood feuds resulted in major instability in Montenegro, Kosovo and diaspora of Montenegrins in later centuries. In [[Kosovo]], most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the early 1990s in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017" /&gt;

This article contains '''Lists of Palestinian [[suicide attacks]]''' carried out by Palestinian individuals and militant groups. The international community considers the use of indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations&lt;ref name=rwkckb07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurz|first=Robert W.|author2=Charles K.

The first suicide attack was carried out in 1989 and the attacks stopped in 2008. The high point was in 2002 during the [[Second Intifada]]. A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during the Second Intifada (September 2000 through August 2005) found that 39.9 percent of the suicide attacks were carried out by [[Hamas]], 26.4 percent by [[Fatah]], 25.7 percent by the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] (PIJ), 5.4 percent by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and 2.7 percent by other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/benmelech/files/JEP_0807.pdf Human Capital and the Productivity of Suicide Bombers pdf] [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] Volume 21, Number 3, Summer 2007.

''The criteria used for this list: successful deliberate attacks committed by Palestinian militant groups against civilians and security forces, in which the perpetrators intended to die during the attack.''

*'''''Bold''' indicates attacks resulting in over 10 deaths''.
*'''''&lt;u&gt;Bold Underscored&lt;/u&gt;''' indicates attacks resulting in over 20 deaths''.
*'''The perpetrator(s) are not included in the death tolls''' noted in this list.

[[File:RELIGIONES.png|thumb|Religious symbols in clock-wise order from top: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Bahá'í Faith]],  [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]],  [[Slavic neopaganism]], [[Celtic polytheism]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Heathenism (Germanic paganism)]], [[Semitic neopaganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Kemetism]] (Egyptian paganism), [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism (Greek paganism)]], [[Italo-Roman neopaganism]].]]
While [[religion]] is hard to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who defined it as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."&lt;ref&gt;(Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;}} A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category."&lt;ref&gt;(Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[sacred history|sacred histories]] that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the universe. They tend to derive [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s, or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]]. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com|title=World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''religion'' is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[faith]]" or "belief system", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized [[religious behaviour|behaviours]], including [[clergy|clerical hierarchies]], a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [[local church|congregations]] of [[laity]], regular meetings or services for the purposes of [[veneration]] of a [[deity]] or for [[prayer]], [[shrine|holy places]] (either natural or architectural) or [[religious text]]s. Certain religions also have a [[sacred language]] often used in [[liturgy|liturgical]] services. The practice of a religion may also include [[sermon]]s, commemoration of the activities of a [[god]] or gods, [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[rite]]s, [[ceremonies]], [[worship]], [[initiation]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[marriage]]s, [[meditation]], [[invocation]], [[mediumship]], [[religious music|music]], [[religious art|art]], [[sacred dance|dance]], [[Community service|public service]] or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] [[phenomena]] such as [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[near-death experience]]s and [[reincarnation]], along with many other [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parapsych.org/base/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iands.org/about-ndes/key-nde-facts.html|title=Key Facts about Near-Death Experiences|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics [[Religious studies|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories: [[major religious groups|world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], international faiths; [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and [[new religious movement]]s, which refers to recently developed faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06.&lt;/ref&gt; One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and thus religion, as a concept, has been [[Reification (fallacy)|applied inappropriately]] to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.{{further information|Prehistoric religion|History of religion}}

On the evening of Friday, 12 November 1976, MacRae left Inverness and headed south on the A9. At ten o'clock that evening a train driver reported a car ablaze on a lay-by adjacent to the A9 trunk road at Dalmagarry. The bodies have never been found, though traces of blood matching Renee and Andrew's blood type were discovered in the boot of the burnt out car. Attention focused on the nearby Dalmagarry quarry, where a senior member of the police believed they were buried. A 2004 excavation of the area found nothing of interest, however a local farmer has opined that the bodies could be buried under the A9, which was in the middle of a major programme of upgrading at the time of the disappearance. The farmer called for the road to be excavated at the spot where a radar survey he commissioned found "anomalies".&lt;ref&gt;Roass, David.

Her throat had been slashed and she had been raped. Earlier that day, Farrow had been shopping with her mother, and had bought a new pair of shoes and a coat. She then went to her partner's fruit stall before returning home by car.

| 8 December 1984 || Lisa Hession || [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Greater Manchester]] || 14-year-old Lisa Hession was attacked, sexually assaulted and strangled to death on Saturday 8 December 1984, as she walked home alone from a party. Her body was discovered just before midnight in Rugby Road, Leigh, 200 yards from the family home. Her mother, Christine, reported her missing when she failed to return home, but within a very short space of time, she received a call from the police to make her way to Leigh Infirmary and identify her daughter's body. Hession's clothing had been disturbed (suggesting a sexual motive), and she also had marks around her neck and a black eye. The case went cold, but advances in DNA technology allowed the swabbing of men in the Leigh and Wigan area to take place in 2011. However, nobody has been charged with the murder. Hession's mother died in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leighjournal.co.uk/news/11644523.30_years_on_and_still_no_justice_for_murdered_schoolgirl/|title=30 years on and still no justice for murdered schoolgirl|website=leighjournal.co.uk|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meditation''' is a practice where an individual uses a technique - such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity - to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.&lt;ref name=walsh06/&gt;{{rp|228–9}}&lt;ref name=cahn06/&gt;{{rp|180}}&lt;ref name=jevning92/&gt;{{rp|415}}&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;

Meditation has been practiced since [[history of meditation|antiquity]] in numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its origins to other cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life.

Meditation may be used with the aim of reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and increasing peace, perception,&lt;ref&gt;[https://hackspirit.com/dalai-lama-reveals-practice-meditation-properly/ For the 14th Dalai Lama the aim of meditation is "''to maintain a very full state of alertness and mindfulness, and then try to see the natural state of your consciousness.''"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-concept]], and [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm|title=Meditation: In Depth|website=NCCIH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goyal"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4142584|year=2014|author1=Goyal|first1=M|title=Meditation Programs for Psychological Stress and Well-being: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=3|pages=357–368|last2=Singh|first2=S|last3=Sibinga|first3=E.

==Etymology==
The English ''meditation'' is derived from the [[Latin languages|Latin]] ''[[:wikt:meditatio|meditatio]]'', from a verb ''[[:wikt:meditor|meditari]]'', meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder".&lt;ref&gt;''An universal etymological English dictionary'' 1773, London, by Nathan Bailey {{ISBN|1-00-237787-0}}. Note: from the 1773 edition on Google books, not earlier editions.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--why on earth would you cite a 1773 dictionary to establish a straightforward Latin loan??--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Old Testament]], ''hāgâ'' (Hebrew: ''הגה'') means to sigh or murmur, and also, to meditate.&lt;ref&gt;Terje Stordalen, "Ancient Hebrew Meditative Recitation", in Halvor Eifring (ed.), ''Meditation in Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Cultural Histories'', 2013, {{ISBN|978-1441122148}} pages 17-31&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek, ''hāgâ'' became the Greek ''melete''. The Latin Bible then translated ''hāgâ''/''melete'' into ''meditatio''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|0-8091-3660-0}} page 88&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of the term ''meditatio'' as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to the 12th-century monk [[Guigo II]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oblate Life'' by Gervase Holdaway, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8146-3176-2}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition within specific contexts more precise meanings are not uncommonly given the word "meditation".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--- UNCLEAR IF EXAMPLES ARE NEEDED... ERRING ON THE SIDE OF INCLUSION... ---&gt;Besides Lectio and Yoga, examples include [[Herbert Benson]]'s (1975) ''Relaxation Response'' {{ISBN|0-380-00676-6}}, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]'s (1990) ''Full Catastrophe Living'' {{ISBN|0-385-29897-8}}, and [[Eknath Easwaran]]'s (1978) ''[[Passage Meditation]]'' {{ISBN|978-1-58638-026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "meditation" is sometimes the translation of ''meditatio'' in Latin. ''Meditatio'' is the second of four steps of ''[[Lectio Divina]]'', an ancient form of Christian prayer. "Meditation" also refers to the seventh of the eight limbs of [[Yoga]] in [[Patanjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'', a step called ''dhyāna'' in Sanskrit. Meditation refers to a mental or spiritual ''state'' that may be attained by such practices,&lt;ref name=feurstein06/&gt; and also refers to the ''practice'' of that state.

Apart from its historical usage, the term ''meditation'' was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as ''dhyāna'' [[Dhyana in Hinduism|in Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] and  which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''dhyai'', meaning to contemplate or meditate.&lt;ref name=feurstein06&gt;[[Georg Feuerstein|Feuerstein, Georg]].

Issue 1. 2006. {{ISSN|1051-127X}}, {{OCLC|21878732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The verb root "dhyai" is listed as referring to "contemplate, meditate on" and "dhyāna" is listed as referring to "meditation; religious contemplation" on page 134 of {{Cite book |title=A practical Sanskrit dictionary with transliteration, accentuation and etymological analysis throughout |last=Macdonell |first=Arthur Anthony |authorlink=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |date=1971 |origyear=Reprinted from 1929 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |isbn=|page=|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "meditation" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic [[Sufism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The healing power of sufi meditation |last1=Mirahmadi |first1=Sayyid Nurjan |first2=Muhammad Nazim Adil al-Haqqani |last2=Naqshbandi |first3=Muhammad Hisham |last3=Kabbani |first4=Hedieh |last4=Mirahmadi |date=2005 |publisher=Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order of America |location=Fenton, MI |isbn=978-1-930409-26-2 |page=|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip057/2005001975.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other traditions such as Jewish [[Kabbalah]] and Christian [[Hesychasm]].&lt;ref name=goleman88&gt;{{Cite book |title=The meditative mind: The varieties of meditative experience |last=Goleman |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Goleman |year=1988 |publisher=Tarcher |location=New York |isbn=978-0-87477-833-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An edited book about "meditation" published in 2003, for example, included chapter contributions by authors describing Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions.&lt;ref name=shear06&gt;{{Cite book |title=The experience of meditation: Experts introduce the major traditions |editor=Jonathan Shear |year=2006 |publisher=Paragon House |location=St. Paul, MN |isbn=978-1-55778-857-3 |pages=|doi=|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip066/2005037743.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stein03&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Joel Stein |year=2003 |title=Just say Om |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=162 |issue=5 |pages=48–56 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005349,00.html |doi=|pmid=}} In the print edition (pp. 54-55), the "Through the Ages" box describes "Christian Meditation", "Cabalistic (Jewish) Meditation", "Muslim Meditation", and others.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have noted that "the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage" is parallel to the term "contemplation" in Christianity,&lt;ref name=kristeller10&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jean L.

==Definitions==

In popular usage, the word "meditation" and the phrase "meditative practice" are often used imprecisely to designate broadly similar practices, or sets of practices, that are found across many cultures and traditions.&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;&lt;ref name=carroll05&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Mary Carroll |year=2005 |title=Divine therapy: Teaching reflective and meditative practices |journal=Teaching Theology and Religion |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=232–238 |url=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9647.2005.00249.x |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions in the Oxford and Cambridge living dictionaries and Merriam-Webster include both the original Latin meaning of "think[ing] deeply about (something),"&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; as the popular usage of "to focus one's mind for a period of time,"&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meditate|title=meditate - Definition of meditate in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the act of giving your attention to only one thing,"&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meditation|title=meditation Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "to engage in mental exercise (such as concentration on one's breathing or repetition of a mantra) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness."&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meditate|title=Definition of meditate|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|language=en|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered meditation can include almost any practice that trains the attention or teaches calm or compassion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~lutz/Meditation_Neuroscience_2005_AL_JDD_RJD_2.pdf|title=Lutz A., Dunne J.D., Davidson R.J.

Bond et al. (2009), based on views common to seven experts trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (clinical or Eastern-derived,&lt;!---cite review noting almost all research has examined eastern-derived or clinical practices---&gt;) forms of meditation,&lt;ref&gt;"members were chosen on the basis of their publication record of research on the therapeutic use of meditation, their knowledge of and training in traditional or clinically developed meditation techniques, and their affiliation with universities and research centers.. Each member had specific expertise and training in at least one of the following meditation practices: [[kundalini yoga]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], relaxation response, [[mindfulness-based stress reduction]], and [[vipassana]] meditation" (Bond, Ospina et al., 2009, p. 131); their views were combined using "the [[Delphi method|Delphi technique]]... a method of eliciting and refining group judgments to address complex problems with a high level of uncertainty" (p. 131).&lt;/ref&gt; identified

The practitioner of meditation attempts to get beyond the reflexive, "thinking" mind&lt;ref name=oknondiscursive&gt;This does not mean that all meditation seeks to take a person beyond ''all'' thought processes, only those processes that are sometimes referred to as "discursive" or "logical" (see Shapiro, 1982/1984; Bond, Ospina, et al., 2009; Appendix B, pp. 279-282 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called "discursive thinking"&lt;ref name=shapiro82discursive&gt;An influential definition by Shapiro (1982) states that "''meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought''" (p. 6, italics in original); the term "discursive thought" has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought ({{cite book |title=Reading neoplatonism : Non-discursive thinking in the texts of plotinus, proclus, and damascius

(2009)&amp;nbsp;– see fuller discussion elsewhere on this page -- report that 7 expert scholars who had studied different traditions of meditation agreed that an "essential" component of meditation "Involves logic relaxation: not 'to intend' to analyze the possible psychophysical effects, not 'to intend' to judge the possible results, not 'to intend' to create any type of expectation regarding the process" (p. 134, Table 4). In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an "essential" component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely "important but not essential" (p. 234, Table 4). (This same result is presented in Table B1 in Ospina, Bond, et al., 2007, p. 281)&lt;/ref&gt;) This may be to achieve a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. In this article the terms "meditative practice" and "meditation" are mostly used in this broad sense. However, in some contexts more specialized meanings of "meditation" may be intended.

===Separation of technique from tradition===
Some of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been the difficulty in recognizing the particularities of the many various traditions.&lt;ref name="intro to consciousness" /&gt; There may be differences between the theories of one tradition of meditation as to what it means to practice meditation.&lt;ref name="Dunne @ Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Dunne's speech |url=http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171057/http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |archivedate=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the various traditions themselves, which have grown up a great distance apart from each other, may be even starker.&lt;ref name="Dunne @ Stanford"/&gt; Taylor noted that to refer only to meditation from a particular faith (e.g., "Hindu" or "Buddhist")

{{quote|''...is not enough, since the cultural traditions from which a particular kind of meditation comes are quite different and even within a single tradition differ in complex ways. The specific name of a school of thought or a teacher or the title of a specific text is often quite important for identifying a particular type of meditation.''&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|2}}
}}

Ornstein noted that ''"Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief."''&lt;ref name=ornstein72&gt;Robert Ornstein (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, ''On the Psychology of Meditation''. New York: Viking. LCCN 76149720&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} This means that, for instance, while monks engage in meditation as a part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices. These meditative practices sometimes have similarities (often noticed by Westerners), for instance concentration on the breath is practiced in Zen, Tibetan and Theravadan contexts, and these similarities or "typologies" are noted here.

==Forms of meditation==

===Focused vs open monitoring meditation===
In the West, meditation techniques have sometimes been thought of in two broad categories: focused (or concentrative) meditation and open monitoring (or [[mindfulness]]) meditation.&lt;ref name=lutz08/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object, breathing, image, or words. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves non-reactive monitoring of the content of experience from moment to moment.''&lt;ref name=lutz08&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lutz |first1=Antoine |last2=Slagter |first2=Heleen A. |last3=Dunne |first3=John D. |last4=Davidson |first4=Richard J. |title=Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=April 2008 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=163–169 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.01.005 |pmid=18329323 |pmc=2693206 |quote=The term ‘meditation’ refers to a broad variety of practices...In order to narrow the explanandum to a more tractable scope, this article uses Buddhist contemplative techniques and their clinical secular derivatives as a paradigmatic framework (see e.g., 9,10 or 7,9 for reviews including other types of techniques, such as Yoga and Transcendental Meditation). Among the wide range of practices within the Buddhist tradition, we will further narrow this review to two common styles of meditation, FA and OM (see box 1–box 2), that are often combined, whether in a single session or over the course of practitioner's training. These styles are found with some variation in several meditation traditions, including Zen, Vipassanā and Tibetan Buddhism (e.g. 7,15,16)....The first style, FA meditation, entails voluntary focusing attention on a chosen object in a sustained fashion. The second style, OM meditation, involves non-reactively monitoring the content of experience from moment to moment, primarily as a means to recognize the nature of emotional and cognitive patterns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Direction of mental attention... A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called ''concentrative meditation''), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called ''mindfulness meditation''), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness.''&lt;ref name=bond09/&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref&gt;The full quote from Bond, Ospina et al. (2009, p. 130) reads: "The differences and similarities among these techniques is often explained in the Western meditation literature in terms of the direction of mental attention (Koshikawa &amp; Ichii, 1996; Naranjo, 1971; Orenstein, 1971): A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called ''concentrative meditation''), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called ''mindfulness meditation''), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness (Orenstein, 1971)."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Focused attention methods====
These include [[Anapanasati|paying attention to the breath]], to an idea or feeling (such as [[Mettā|mettā (loving-kindness)]]), or to a [[mantra]] (such as in [[Transcendental Meditation|transcendental meditation]]), and single point meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bcnJAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bhagavad+gita#v=snippet&amp;q=pointedness&amp;f=false|title=The Bhagavad Gita: (Classics of Indian Spirituality)|first=Eknath|last=Easwaran|date=10 September 2018|publisher=Nilgiri Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781586380199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Single-pointed concentration ([[samadhi]]) is a meditative power that is useful in either of these two types of meditation. However, in order to develop samadhi itself we must cultivate principally concentration meditation. In terms of practice, this means that we must choose an object of concentration and then meditate single-pointedly on it every day until the power of samadhi is attained." {{cite web|url=https://www.lamayeshe.com/article/developing-single-pointed-concentration|title=Developing Single-pointed Concentration|first=|last=lywa|date=2 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open monitoring methods====
These include [[mindfulness]],  [[shikantaza]] and other awareness states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meditation-research.org.uk/2013/07/advanced-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-practice-raises-body-temperature-part-2/|title=Site is under maintenance|website=meditation-research.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No thought===
In these methods, "''the practitioner is fully alert, aware, and in control of their faculties but does not experience any unwanted thought activity.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/350674/|title=Quality of Life and Functional Health Status of Long-Term Meditators|first1=Ramesh|last1=Manocha|first2=Deborah|last2=Black|first3=Leigh|last3=Wilson|date=10 September 2018|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=2012|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2012/350674|pmid=22611427|pmc=3352577}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the common meditative approaches of being detached from, and non-judgmental of, thoughts, but not of aiming for thoughts to cease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmaseed.org/teacher/387/ "''There might be a depth of meditation where thinking ceases. This is a refined, refreshing and nourishing state of consciousness. But it is not the goal.''" Kirsten Kratz, "Calm and kindness" talk, Gaia House, 03/2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sahaja Yoga#Sahaja meditation and associated research|meditation practice of the Sahaja yoga spiritual movement]], the focus is on thoughts ceasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sahajayogaarmenia.wordpress.com/meditation-armenia/|title=Meditation|date=21 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luminosity (Vajrayana)|Clear light yoga]] also aims at a state of no mental content, as does the no thought (wu nian) state taught by [[Huineng#No-thought and meditation|Huineng]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/huineng/#SSH4aiii|title=Huineng (Hui-neng) (638—713)|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2018|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the teaching of [[Yaoshan Weiyan]].

===Automatic self-transcending===
One proposal is that [[transcendental meditation]] and possibly other techniques be grouped as an 'automatic self-transcending' set of techniques.&lt;ref name="Travis, F. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Fred Travis|author2=Jonathan Shear|year=2010|title=Focused attention, open monitoring and automatic self-transcending: Categories to organize meditations from Vedic, Buddhist and Chinese traditions|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1110–8|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.01.007|pmid=20167507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other typologies===
Other typologies include dividing meditation into concentrative, generative, receptive and reflective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/customs/meditation_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Buddhism: Meditation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation practice==

===Common practice timings===
The [[transcendental meditation technique]] recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/business-meditation-executives-meditate_n_3528731|title=The Daily Habit Of These Outrageously Successful People|date=5 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some techniques suggest less time,&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt; especially when starting meditation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mindfulness#Meditation method]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Davidson|Richie Davidson]] has quoted research saying benefits can be achieved with a practice of only 8 minutes per day.&lt;ref name="abcnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/neuroscientist-richie-davidson-dalai-lama-gave-total-wake/story?id=40859233|title=Neuroscientist Says Dalai Lama Gave Him 'a Total Wake-Up Call'|first=A.

Whilst positions such as the [[Lotus position|full-lotus]], half-lotus, [[Cross-legged|Burmese]], [[Seiza]], and [[kneeling]] positions are popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, other postures such as sitting, supine (lying), and standing are also used. Meditation is also sometimes done while walking, known as [[kinhin]], or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as [[Samu (Zen)|samu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ng |first1=Teng-Kuan |title=Pedestrian Dharma: Slowness and Seeing in Tsai Ming-Liang's Walker |journal=Religions |date=2018 |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=200 |doi=10.3390/rel9070200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of prayer beads===
Some ancient religions of the world have a tradition of using [[prayer beads]] as tools in devotional meditation.&lt;ref name=Binz3 &gt;''Mysteries of the Rosary'' by Stephen J. Binz 2005 {{ISBN|1-58595-519-1}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sach &gt;''The everything Buddhism book'' by Jacky Sach 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-58062-884-6}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see ''Beads of Faith: Pathways to Meditation and Spirituality Using Rosaries, Prayer Beads, and Sacred Words'' by Gray Henry, Susannah Marriott 2008 {{ISBN|1-887752-95-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most prayer beads and Christian [[Rosary based prayers|rosaries]] consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread.&lt;ref name=Binz3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sach /&gt; The [[Rosary|Roman Catholic rosary]] is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. The Hindu [[japa mala]] has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhist prayer beads]].&lt;ref name=Vishnu &gt;''Meditation and Mantras'' by Vishnu Devananda 1999 {{ISBN|81-208-1615-3}} pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Each bead is counted once as a person recites a [[mantra]] until the person has gone all the way around the mala.&lt;ref name=Vishnu /&gt; The Muslim [[misbaha]] has 99 beads.

===Possible benefits of supporting meditation practice with a narrative===
[[Richard Davidson|Richie Davidson]] has expressed the view that having a narrative can help maintenance of daily practice.&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt; For instance he himself [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostrates]] to the teachings, and meditates "not primarily for my benefit, but for the benefit of others."&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt;

==Religious and spiritual meditation==

===Indian religions===

====Jainism====
{{Main|Jain meditation}}
[[File:Mahaveer swami.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahavira]] in meditative posture]]
In [[Jainism]], meditation has been a core spiritual practice, one that Jains believe people have undertaken since the teaching of the [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabha]].&lt;ref name="Acharya Tulsi"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Acharya Tulsi Key |title=Bhagwan Mahavira |publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India |year=1995 |chapter=01.01 Traditions of shramanas |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251 |accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Jainism"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Sadhvi Vishrut Vibha Key |title=Introduction to Jainism |publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India |year=2007 |chapter=1 History and Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are all shown in meditative postures in the images or idols.

Jain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as salvation-path. It has three important parts called the ''[[Ratnatraya]]'' "Three Jewels": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct.&lt;ref name="Ratna traya"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Acharya Mahapragya |title=Jain Yog |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |chapter=Foreword |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, take the soul to complete freedom.&lt;ref name="blessings"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Acharya Tulsi |title=Sambodhi |publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh |chapter=blessings |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to ''Dharmya Dhyana'' and ''Shukla Dhyana''.

There exists a number of meditation techniques such as ''pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna'', etc. In ''padāstha dhyāna'' one focuses on [[Mantra]].&lt;ref name="HN4U"/&gt; A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether [[Digambar]]a or [[Svetambara]], practice mantra. Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. [[Yogasana]] and ''Pranayama'' has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama&amp;nbsp;– breathing exercises&amp;nbsp;– are performed to strengthen the five ''Pranas'' or vital energy.&lt;ref name="yoga"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dr. Rudi Jansma |author2=Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key |title=Introduction To Jainism |publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India |year=2006 |chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2) |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogasana and ''Pranayama'' balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.&lt;ref name="yogic kriya"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Muni Kishan Lal Key |title=Preksha Dhyana: Yogic Exercises |publisher=Jain Vishva Bharati |year=2007 |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=71578 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemplation is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In ''agnya vichāya'', one contemplates on seven facts&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of ''karmas'', and the final accomplishment of liberation. In ''apaya vichāya'', one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In ''vipaka vichāya'', one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of ''karma''. In ''sansathan vichāya'', one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.&lt;ref name="HN4U"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dr. Rudi Jansma |author2=Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key |title=Introduction To Jainism |publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India |year=2006 |chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2) |url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251 |accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acharya [[Mahapragya]] formulated [[Preksha meditation]] in the 1970s and presented a well-organised system of meditation. [[Asana]] and ''Pranayama'', meditation, contemplation, mantra and therapy are its integral parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preksha.com/ |title=Preksha Meditation |publisher=Preksha International |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Preksha meditation centers came into existence around the world and numerous meditations camps are being organized to impart training in it.

[[File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bodhidharma]] practicing [[zazen]].]]
Buddhist meditation refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of [[Buddhism]]. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]s pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation "includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim." Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: "To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]...." A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: "'''Meditation'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are "of a more preparatory nature" (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bhāvanā'' literally means "development" as in "mental development." For the association of this term with "meditation," see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in "The Greater Exhortation to Rahula" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|ānāpānassatiṃ, rāhula, bhāvanaṃ bhāvehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: "Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bhāvana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing]]." (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''jhāna''/''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2005.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), entry for "jhāna&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;"]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word "zen" from [[Sanskrit]] "dhyāna". [[Pāli Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:
: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as "altered states of consciousness". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed "meditations" ([Skt.:] ''dhyāna'' / [Pali:] ''jhāna'') or "concentrations" (''[[samādhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[vipassana]]''.

Buddhist meditation techniques have become increasingly popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up for a variety of reasons. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; that are used across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Theravāda]] tradition alone, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], "there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and by whatever name&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; are found in all the major Buddhist traditions" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: "The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s" (p. 227).&lt;/ref&gt; Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of contemporary school-specific "classics" include, from the Theravada tradition, Nyanaponika (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial tradition, and also the Tibetan tradition,&lt;ref name="Ray2004"&gt;Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:
:* "serenity" or "tranquility" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;
:* "insight" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern "formations" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).&lt;ref&gt;These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the "Four Kinds of Persons Sutta" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269–70, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]) which is the quality of mind that can "clearly see" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen various withing the Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Ray2004"/&gt; In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267-68, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]]. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the [[Western world]] paralleled the spread of [[Buddhism in the West]]. Buddhist meditation has also influenced Western Psychology, especially through the work of [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] who founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx|title=Mindfulness-Based Programs|website=University of Massachusetts Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'') and related meditative practices has in turn led to several [[Mindfulness#Therapy programs|mindfulness based therapies]].

====Hinduism====
{{See also|Dhyana in Hinduism|Yoga}}

There are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt;

=====Traditional=====
[[File:Sant Jñāneśvar.jpg|thumb|Sant Jñāneśvar]]
In pre-modern and traditional [[Hinduism|Hindu religions]], ''Yoga'' and ''Dhyana'' are done to realize union of one's eternal self or [[soul]], one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]. In some Hindu traditions, such as [[Advaita Vedanta]] this is equated with the omnipresent and [[nondualism|non-dual]] [[Brahman]]. In others, such as the dualistic [[Yoga (philosophy)|the Yoga school]] and [[Samkhya]], the Self is referred to as [[Purusha]], a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event is referred to as [[moksha]], vimukti or [[kaivalya]].

The earliest clear references to meditation in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] literature are in the middle [[Upanishads]] and the [[Mahabharata]], the latter of which includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51. The earliest reference is actually in the Mokshadharma, which dates to the early Buddhist period.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Katha Upanishad describes yoga, including meditation. On meditation in this and other post-Buddhist Hindu literature see Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gavin Flood]], the earlier [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] refers to meditation when it states that "having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (''ātman'') within oneself".&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Flood | first=Gavin | year=1996 | title=An Introduction to Hinduism| publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=94–95 |location=Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-43878-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is [[Patañjali]]'s [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]] (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines eight limbs leading to [[kaivalya]] ("aloneness"). These are ethical discipline ([[yamas]]), rules ([[niyamas]]), physical postures ([[āsanas]]), breath control ([[prāṇāyama]]), withdrawal from the senses ([[pratyāhāra]]), one-pointedness of mind ([[dhāraṇā]]), meditation ([[Dhyāna in Hinduism|dhyāna]]), and finally [[samādhi]].

Later developments in Hind meditation include the compilation of [[Hatha Yoga]] (forceful yoga) compendiums like the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the development of [[Bhakti yoga]] as a major form of meditation and [[Tantra]]. Another important Hindu yoga text is the [[Yoga Yajnavalkya]], which makes use of [[Hatha Yoga]] and Vedanta Philosophy.

In the sixth chapter of Bhāvārthadipikā&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Jnaneshvari |last=Shri |first=Jnaneshvar |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1978 |isbn=978-0887064883 |location=New York |pages=114–152 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita by Sri Jñāneśvar ([[Dnyaneshwar]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/nathasiddhas/jnanesvar-and-nivritti-nath |title=Jnanesvar and Nivritti Nath - The Great Natha Siddhas |date= |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; meditation in [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|yoga]] is described as a state caused by the spontaneous awakening of the sacred energy [[Kundalini]] (not Prana or Chi), which creates a connection of the individual soul Ātman with universal Spirit - Paramātman.

====Taoism====
{{Main|Daoist meditation}}
[[File:Stage1.gif|thumb|upright| "Gathering the Light", Taoist meditation from ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'']]
Taoist or Daoist meditation has a long history, and has developed various techniques including concentration, visualization, ''[[qi]]'' cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations. Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]] beginning around the 5th century, and later had influence upon [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts]].

Livia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Daoist meditation: "concentrative", "insight", and "visualization".&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia (2008), "Meditation and visualization," in ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'', ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ding'' [[wikt:定|定]] (literally means "decide; settle; stabilize") refers to "deep concentration", "intent contemplation", or "perfect absorption". ''Guan'' [[wikt:觀|觀]] (lit. "watch; observe; view") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) Daoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassanā]]'' "insight" or "wisdom" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:存|存]] (lit. "exist; be present; survive") has a sense of "to cause to exist; to make present" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Daoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within his/her body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 仙/仚/僊, "immortality".

The (late 4th century BCE) ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' essay ''[[Neiye]]'' "Inward training" is the oldest received writing on the subject of ''[[qi]]'' cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques.&lt;ref name='Cambridge'&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Harper | first1=Donald | first2=Michael | last2=Loewe | first3=Edward L. | last3=Shaughnessy| title=The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC| publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2007 | origyear=First published in 1999 | location=Cambridge, U.K. | page=880 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cHA7Ey0-pbEC&amp;dq=cambridge++history+of+ancient+china&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=| isbn=978-0-521-47030-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called "revolving the vital breath": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly."&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Harold D. (1999), ''Original Tao: Inward Training (''Nei-yeh'') and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism'', Columbia University Press, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' records ''[[zuowang]]'' or "sitting forgetting" meditation. [[Confucius]] asked his disciple [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]] to explain what "sit and forget" means: "I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare."&lt;ref&gt;Mair, Victor H., tr. (1994), ''Wandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu'', Bantam Books, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daoist meditation practices are central to [[Chinese martial arts]] (and some [[Japanese martial arts]]), especially the ''qi''-related ''[[neijia]]'' "internal martial arts". Some well-known examples are ''[[Tao Yin|daoyin]]'' "guiding and pulling", ''[[qigong]]'' "life-energy exercises", ''[[neigong]]'' "internal exercises", ''[[neidan]]'' "internal alchemy", and ''[[taijiquan]]'' "great ultimate boxing", which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts "movement in stillness" referring to energetic visualization of ''qi'' circulation in ''qigong'' and ''[[zuochan]]'' "seated meditation",&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt; versus "stillness in movement" referring to a state of meditative calm in ''taijiquan'' forms.

====Bahá'í Faith====
In the teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], meditation along with [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]] are both primary tools for spiritual development&lt;ref name="bahai-meditation"&gt;{{cite web | title=Prayer, Meditation, and Fasting | accessdate=2011-07-01 | url=http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-7.html | publisher=Bahá'í International Community | year=2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805130355/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-7.html | archive-date=2011-08-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mainly refer to one's reflection on the words of God.&lt;ref name="Smith-meditation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Meditation |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[prayer]] and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God,&lt;ref name="Smith-prayer"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Prayer |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.&lt;ref name="Smith-meditation"/&gt;

The [[Bahá'í teachings]] note that the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power,&lt;ref name="Smith-meditation"/&gt; more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |editor=Hornby, Helen |year=1983 |title=Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India |isbn=978-81-85091-46-4 |url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance | page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form.&lt;ref name="bahai-meditation" /&gt; However, he specifically did state that Bahá'ís should read a passage of the [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it.

====Judaism====
{{Main|Jewish meditation}}

There is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices that go back thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Verman1 &gt;''The history and varieties of Jewish meditation'' by Mark Verman 1997 {{ISBN|978-1-56821-522-8}} page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, L. (1976) ''Jewish Mystical Testimonies'', Jerusalem, Keter Publishing House Jerusalem Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Torah]], the patriarch [[Isaac]] is described as going ''"לשוח"'' (''lasuach'') in the field—a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:63).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978) ''Meditation and the Bible'', Maine, Samuel Weiser Inc., p 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there are indications throughout the [[Tanakh]] (the Hebrew [[Bible]]) that meditation was used by the prophets.&lt;ref name=Verman45 &gt;''The history and varieties of Jewish meditation'' by Mark Verman 1997 {{ISBN|978-1-56821-522-8}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Testament]], there are two [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words for meditation: ''hāgâ'' ({{lang-he|הגה}}), which means ''to sigh'' or ''murmur'', but also ''to meditate'', and ''sîḥâ'' ({{lang-he|שיחה}}), which means ''to muse'', or ''rehearse in one's mind''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, A. 1985"&gt;Kaplan, A. (1985) ''Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide,'' New York Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some meditative traditions have been encouraged in the school of Judaism known as [[Kabbalah]], and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholem|first1=Gershom Gerhard|title=Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism|date=1961|publisher=Schocken Books|isbn=9780805210422|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD2y4wMOlAoC&amp;pg=PA34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1982) ''Meditation and Kabbalah'', Maine, Samuel Weiser, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt, D.C. (1996) ''The Essential Kabbalah: The Heart of Jewish Mysticism'', San Francisco, HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Kaplan]] has argued that, for the Kabbalist, the ultimate purpose of meditative practice is to understand and cleave to the Divine.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, A. 1985"/&gt; Classic methods include the mental visualisation of the supernal realms the soul navigates through to achieve certain ends. One of the best known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the [[Merkabah]], from the root /R-K-B/ meaning "chariot" (of God).&lt;ref name="Kaplan, A. 1985"/&gt;

Meditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called ''"[[hitbodedut]]"'' (''התבודדות'', alternatively transliterated as "hisbodedus"), and is explained in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]], [[Hasidic]], and [[Mussar Movement|Mussar]] writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslav]]. The word derives from the Hebrew word "boded" (בודד), meaning the state of being alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978) op cit p2&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hasidic system is the [[Habad]] method of "hisbonenus", related to the [[Sephirah]] of "Binah", Hebrew for understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, (1982) op cit, p13&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.

[[Christian meditation]] is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation for Beginners'' by Thomas Zanzig, Marilyn Kielbasa 2000, {{ISBN|0-88489-361-8}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The word meditation comes from the Latin word ''meditari'', which means to concentrate. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a [[biblical]] scene involving [[Jesus]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Christian spirituality'' by F. Antonisamy, 2000 {{ISBN|81-7109-429-5}} pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rosary]] is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatima.org/it/essentials/whatucando/potetefare.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601223011/http://www.fatima.org/it/essentials/whatucando/potetefare.asp |archive-date=2017-06-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theholyrosary.org/|title=The Holy Rosary|website=www.theholyrosary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyolapress.com/our-catholic-faith/prayer/personal-prayer-life/different-ways-to-pray/the-rosary-as-a-tool-for-meditation-by-liz-kelly|title=The Rosary as a Tool for Meditation by Liz Kelly|website=www.loyolapress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of [[God the Father]] in the Bible contrasts with depictions of [[Krishna]] or [[Brahman]] in Indian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations do not rely on the repeated use of [[mantra]]s, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 {{ISBN|90-04-12654-6}} page 488&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'', the [[Catholic Church]] warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm EWTN: [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] ''Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation'' (in English), October 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, in ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the [[New Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/08/local/me-relignewage8/2 Los Angeles Times, February 8, 2003, ''New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm|title=Vatican sounds New Age alert|date=4 February 2003|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html|title=PRESENTATIONS OF HOLY SEE'S DOCUMENT ON NEW AGE|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal [[prayer]], but is more structured than the multiple layers of [[contemplation]] in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''Simple Ways to Pray'' by Emilie Griffin 2005 {{ISBN|0-7425-5084-2}} page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] in 2007 the [[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality]] in the [[Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim]] was founded by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg]]. In and by the centre different kinds of [[church service]]s are offered like for example with elements such as [[expressionist dance]], moreover days of exercises of [[Christian mysticism]], [[contemplation|contemplative]] prayer, [[Meditation music#Christian meditation music|meditative singing]], meditation courses, [[Zen]]-meditation courses, days of reflection, [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|spiritual exercises]] and [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]]&lt;ref name="HK-Program"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://meditationszentrum.bistumlimburg.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Bereiche/meditationszentrum.bistum-limburg.de/Programm_2016_2017.pdf| publisher=Heilig Kreuz – Zentrum für christliche Meditation und Spiritualität| title=Heilig Kreuz – Zentrum für christliche Meditation und Spiritualität – Programm September 2016 bis Juli 2017| format=PDF| language=German | date=14 June 2016| accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early studies on states of consciousness conducted by Roland Fischer &lt;ref&gt;Roland Fischer (1971), A Cartography of the Ecstatic and Meditative States. In Science, Vol 174 Num 4012 26 November 1971&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of mystical experience description in the writings of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]]. In her autobiography she describes that, at the peak of a praying experience "... the soul neither hears nor sees nor feels. While it lasts, none of the senses perceives or knows what is taking place".&lt;ref&gt;Saint Teresa, The Life of Saint Teresa, J. M. Cohen, Transl. (Penquin, Baltimore, 1957), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to the fourth stage described by Saint Teresa, "Devotion of Ecstasy", where the consciousness of being in the body disappears, as an effect of deep transcendent meditation in prayer.

====Islam====
{{Main|Sufi|Muraqaba|Sema|Dhikr#Sufi view}}

[[Salah]] is a mandatory act of devotion performed by Muslims five times per day. The body goes through sets of different postures, as the mind attains a level of concentration called ''khushu'''.

A second optional type of meditation, called [[dhikr]], meaning remembering and mentioning God, is interpreted in different meditative techniques in [[Sufism]] or Islamic mysticism.&lt;ref name="Prayer page 147-149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Education' page 63"/&gt; This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with ''fikr'' (thinking) which leads to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Sainthood and revelatory discourse'' by David Emmanuel Singh 2003 {{ISBN|81-7214-728-7}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.&lt;ref name="Spiritual Psychology' page 109"/&gt;

Numerous [[Sufism|Sufi traditions]] place emphasis upon a meditative procedure which comes from the cognitive aspect to one of the two principal approaches to be found in the [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist traditions]]: that of the [[samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]] technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused [[introspection]]. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where [[muraqaba]] takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a [[Persian language|Persian]] term that means "concentration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0533316489224010 |title=Book Reviews |journal=Group Analysis |volume=22 |issue=4 |page=434 |year=2016 |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Kedar Nath }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tafakkur'' or ''tadabbur'' in Sufism literally means ''reflection upon the [[universe]]'': this is considered to permit access to a form of [[cognitive]] and [[emotion]]al development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] awakens and liberates both [[heart]] and [[intellect]], permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the [[infinity|infinite]]. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Khalifa | first=Rashad | title=Quran: The Final Testament | publisher=Universal Unity | year=2001 | page=536 | isbn=978-1-881893-05-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pagan and occult religions====
Religions and religious movements which use magic, such as [[Wicca]], [[Thelema]], [[Neopaganism]], [[occultism]] etc., often require their adherents to meditate as a preliminary to the magical work. This is because magic is often thought to require a particular state of mind in order to make contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.

===Modern spirituality===

Mantra meditation, with the use of a [[japa mala]] and especially with focus on the [[Hare Krishna maha-mantra]], is a central practice of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] faith tradition and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular [[New Religious Movements]] include the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], [[Vedanta Society]], [[Divine Light Mission]], [[Chinmaya Mission]], [[Rajneesh|Osho]], Sahaja Yoga, [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Kalki Bhagavan|Oneness University]], [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[Vihangam Yoga]].

====New Age====
{{Main|New Age}}
New Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, [[yoga]], Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the [[counterculture of the 1960s|social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s]], when many of the [[baby boomers|youth of the day]] rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html Time Magazine, ''Youth: The Hippies'' Friday, Jul. 07, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;
New Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=George | last=Barnia | title=The Index of Leading Spiritual Indicators | publisher=Word Publishing | location=Dallas TX | year=1996 | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/newage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of [[samadhi]], as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=John | last=Lash | title=The Seeker's Handbook: The Complete Guide to Spiritual Pathfinding | publisher=Harmony Books | location=New York | year=1990 | page=320 | isbn=978-0-517-57797-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindfulness==

Over the past 20 years, mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs have been used to assist people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy.&lt;ref&gt;"In the last 20 years, mindfulness has become the focus of considerable attention for a large community of clinicians and, to a lesser extent, empirical psychology." - [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~perlman/0903-EmoPaper/BishopMindfulnessDefinition2004.pdf Mindfulness: A Proposed Operation Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], who founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program]] in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.'&lt;ref name=kz1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jon Kabat-Zinn |author2=Elizabeth Wheeler |author3=Timothy Light |author4=Anne Skillings |author5=Mark J.

==Secular applications==

As stated by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], a US government entity within the National Institutes of Health that advocates various forms of [[Alternative Medicine]], ''"Meditation may be practiced for many reasons, such as to increase calmness and physical relaxation, to improve psychological balance, to cope with illness, or to enhance overall health and well-being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm |title=Meditation: An Introduction |publisher=[[NCCIH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Meditation techniques have also been used by Western theories of counseling and [[psychotherapy]]. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses.

[[Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation]] was developed by American physician [[Edmund Jacobson]] in the early 1920s. In this practice one tenses and then relaxes muscle groups in a sequential pattern whilst concentrating on how they feel. The method has been seen to help people with many conditions, especially extreme anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Progressive muscle relaxation]] from where these two references were taken showing that this method reduces extreme anxiety, 1) {{Cite book | author=Craske | author2=Barlow | last-author-amp=yes | title=Worry | publication-date=2006 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | page=53 | isbn=978-0-19-530001-7 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. Originally used with [[systematic desensitization]], relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, [[hypnosis]] and [[biofeedback]]-induced relaxation are a few of the techniques used with relaxation training.

One of the eight essential phases of [[EMDR]] (developed by [[Francine Shapiro]]), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Corey | first=G. | title=Theory and practice of counseling and psychotherapy | edition=6th | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Co. |date=March 2000 | location=Belmont, CA | page=550 | isbn=978-0-534-34823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are many different types of meditation practiced in western culture. Mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving kindness meditations for instance have been found to provide cognitive benefits such as relaxation and decentering. With training in meditation, depressive rumination can be decreased and overall peace of mind can flourish. Different techniques have shown to work better for different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Feldman | first=G. | title=Differential effects of mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving-kindness meditation on decentering and negative reactions to repetitive thoughts | journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy | year=2010 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.06.006 | volume=48 | issue=10 | pages=1002–1011| pmc=2932656 | pmid=20633873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound-based meditation===

[[Herbert Benson]] of [[Harvard Medical School]] conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In 1975, Benson published a book titled ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Relaxation Response |publisher=[[William Morrow Paperbacks]], Exp Upd edition (February 8, 2000)|author1=Herbert Benson |author2=Miriam Z.

Everly page 199-202"/&gt; Wilson translates the most famous Vedic mantra "Gayatri" as: "We meditate on that desirable light of the divine Savitri, who influences our pious rites" (Rigveda : Mandala-3, Sukta-62, Rcha-10). Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed via [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] in China as well as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[early Buddhism]] in [[Nepal]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="George S.

[[Western Christian]] meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western [[Christian meditation]] progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks called [[Lectio Divina]], i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a "ladder" were defined by the monk [[Guigo II]] in the 12th century with the Latin terms ''lectio'', ''meditatio'', ''oratio'', and ''contemplatio'' (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western [[Christian meditation]] was further developed by saints such as [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and [[Teresa of Avila]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Spirituality: A Historical Sketch'' by George Lane 2005 {{ISBN|0-8294-2081-9}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S.

===Modern dissemination in the west===
&lt;!--- In progress: This section is being constructed -- 5 July 2010 ---&gt;
Methods of meditation have been cross-culturally disseminated at various times throughout history, such as Buddhism going to East Asia, and [[History of Sufism|Sufi practices]] going to many Islamic societies. Of special relevance to the modern world is the dissemination of meditative practices since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of numerous Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has also been revived,&lt;ref name=reininger98&gt;{{Cite book |title=Centering prayer in daily life and ministry |editor=Gustave Reininger |year=1997 |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8264-1041-2 |pages=|doi=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xEhaEDm7jsIC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=isbn=978-0-8264-1041-2+Centering+prayer+in+daily+life+and+ministry&amp;q |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries.&lt;ref name=contempout&gt;The organization [http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=community_chapters_international Contemplative Outreach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103193809/http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/site/PageServer?pagename=community_chapters_international |date=2011-11-03 }}, which teaches Christian [[Centering Prayer]], has chapters in non-Western locations in Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea (accessed 5 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Also evident is some extent of influence over [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking through [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', although he states, "I find that a meditation practitioner is often quite useless and that a contemplation practitioner is always insane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meditation|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0002.661/--meditation?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=meditation|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about Eastern meditation had begun "seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity",&lt;ref name=taylor99&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Eugene Taylor |year=1999 |title=Introduction |editor1=Michael Murphy |editor2=Steven Donovan |editor3=Eugene Taylor |journal=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research with a Comprehensive Bibliography 1931-1996 |pages=1–32 |url=http://library.noetic.org/library/publication-bibliographies/physical-and-psychological-effects-meditation |doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} and such ideas "came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s."&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|3}} The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[World Parliament of Religions]], held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, [[Swami Vivekananda]]... [founded] various [[Vedanta]] ashrams... [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation in 1904; [[Abdul Baha]] ... [toured] the US teaching the principles of Bahai, and [[Soyen Shaku]] toured in 1907 teaching Zen...&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|4}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Meditating in Madison Square Park.jpg|thumb|right|Meditating in [[Madison Square Park]], [[New York City]]]]
More recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. Observers have suggested many types of explanations for this interest in Eastern meditation and revived Western contemplation. [[Thomas Keating]], a founder of [[Contemplative Outreach]], wrote that "the rush to the East is a symptom of what is lacking in the West. There is a deep spiritual hunger that is not being satisfied in the West."&lt;ref name=keating97&gt;{{Cite book |title=Open mind, open heart |last=Keating |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Keating |date=1997 |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8264-0696-5 |origyear=First published in 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} [[Daniel Goleman]], a scholar of meditation, suggested that the shift in interest from "established religions" to meditative practices "is caused by the scarcity of the personal experience of these [meditation-derived] transcendental states&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the living spirit at the common core of all religions."&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;{{rp|xxiv}}

Another suggested contributing factor is the rise of communist political power in Asia, which "set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West",&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|7}} oftentimes as refugees.&lt;ref name=taylorinflux&gt;Taylor (1999, p. 7) stated that "the increased Soviet influence in India, the Cultural Revolution in China, the Communist Chinese takeover of Tibet and Mongolia, and the increased political influence of Chinese Communism in Korea and Southeast Asia were key forces that collectively set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West. An entirely new generation of them appeared on the American scene and they found a willing audience of devotees within the American counter-culture. [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]], [[Swami Satchidananda|Swami Satchitananda]], [[Prem Rawat|Guru Maharaji]], [[Kirpal Singh|Kerpal Singh]], [[Nyanaponika Thera|Nayanaponika Thera]], [[Swami Rama]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]], [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]], [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Sri Bagwan Rujneesh]], [[Vilayat Inayat Khan|Pir Viliyat Kahn]], and the [[Karmapa]] were but a few of the names that found followers in the United States... [and] the most well known and influential... today remains [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation, religion and drugs==
{{Main|Entheogen|Religion and drugs}}
{{see also|Psychedelic psychotherapy}}
Many major traditions in which meditation is practiced, such as Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/theprecepts/a/preceptsintro.htm |title=The Buddhist Precepts. An Introduction |first=Barbara |last=O'Brien |publisher=[[about.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The natural mind: an investigation of drugs and the higher consciousness |last=Weil |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Weil |year=1998 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=|isbn=9780395911563 |pages=68–69 |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; advise members not to consume [[intoxicants]], while others, such as the Rastafarian movements and Native American Church, view drugs as integral to their religious lifestyle.

The fifth of the five precepts of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], the ethical code in the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] traditions, states that adherents must: "abstain from fermented and distilled beverages that cause heedlessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/theprecepts/a/fifthprecept.htm|title=The Fifth Buddhist Precept|first=Barbara |last=O'Brien |publisher=[[about.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the ingestion of psychoactives has been a central feature in the rituals of many religions, in order to produce [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]]. In several traditional [[shamanistic]] ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is believed to be a gift from [[Jah]] and a [[Religious and spiritual use of cannabis|sacred herb]] to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. Native Americans use [[peyote]], as part of religious ceremony, continuing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativeamericanchurch.com/law.html |title=PUBLIC LAW 103-344 [H.R. 4230]; October 6, 1994 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the [[soma (drink)|soma]] drink has a long history of use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the [[Vedas]].

During the 1960s and 70s, both eastern meditation traditions and psychedelics, such as [[LSD]], became popular in America, and it was suggested that LSD use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual/existential end.&lt;ref&gt;"A Zen Life" a documentary film about the life of D.T. Suzuki&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of eastern traditions rejected this idea, including many who had tried LSD themselves. In ''The Master Game'', [[Robert S de Ropp]] writes that the "door to full consciousness" can be glimpsed with the aid of substances, but to "pass beyond the door" requires yoga and meditation. Other authors, such as [[Rick Strassman]], believe that the relationship between religious experiences reached by way of meditation and through the use of psychedelic drugs deserves further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences'', 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89281-927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Mindfulness meditation, in its modern form, is regarded by psychologist [[Thomas Joiner]] to have been "corrupted" for commercial gain by self-help celebrities, and he suggests that it encourages narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets which can be unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531430-900-lost-in-meditation-two-books-argue-over-mindfulness/amp/|title=Lost in meditation: Two books argue over mindfulness - New Scientist|website=www.newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mindlessness-9780190200626?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Mindlessness: The Corruption of Mindfulness in a Culture of Narcissism|first=Thomas|last=Joiner|date=28 September 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannah Foster''' (31 August 1985 – 14 March 2003) was a 17-year-old British student who was kidnapped, raped and murdered after a night out in [[Southampton]] in March 2003. Foster was murdered by an Indian immigrant named Maninder Pal Singh Kohli. Her body was found in nearby [[West End, Hampshire|West End]], two days after she disappeared in Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3518651/Hannah-Fosters-killer-Maninder-Pal-Singh-Kohli.html | title = Hannah Foster's killer: Maninder Pal Singh Kohli | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | author = Caroline Gammell | date = 25 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Hannah Foster was a promising A-Level student from Southampton, who had been preparing to study medicine at university. On 14 March 2003, she went out in Southampton with a friend for a few drinks. Her friend got the bus home, while Hannah decided to walk the half-mile to her home. Indian native, sandwich delivery man Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, was cruising the area in his white van. He snatched Hannah as she walked. From his van, Foster secretly made a call to emergency services in the hope they would realise she was in trouble. On the 999 tape, Foster can be heard speaking to a man with an Asian accent. The tape was played during the later trial at Winchester Crown Court on Wednesday 15 October 2008. Foster's body was found in bushes in a country lane just outside Southampton two days later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had been raped and strangled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohli fled to India shortly after Foster's body was found. He was soon identified by investigators as a prime suspect in the case. After Indian police failed to apprehend Kohli, Foster's parents went to India themselves and made a public appeal for information of his whereabouts. During their 10-day visit, Foster's parents held a series of press conferences as well as opening a telephone "hotline". Their visit soon became a subject of high interest in the Indian press, and Kohli was arrested five days after their arrival. Hampshire police announced a reward of [[Indian rupee|INR]] 5,000,000 to anyone whose clues led to the arrest of Kohli. Kohli's wife in England, and his brother, a policeman in India, denied his involvement in the murder.

The key to the arrest of Kohli was information from taxi driver Jason Lepcha, hired by Kohli partly because of his understanding of English.  Lepcha received a reward of [[Indian rupee|INR]] 367,000.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;[http://www.darjeelingtimes.com/news/News/School-named-after-Hannah.html "School named after Hannah in Darjeeling"] ''[[The Times of India]]'' 30 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He used all this money to establish a school in Hannah's name.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/briefing/hannahfoster/3922279.A_wonderful_tribute_to_Hannah/ "A wonderful tribute in India to Hannah Foster"] ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]'' 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; When visiting Darjeeling in 2006, Hannah's parents unwittingly hired Lepcha as their driver, and heard his story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannahmemorialacademy.org/pages/text_page.php?cid=candr "In the beginning – Christine and Roger's story"]&lt;/ref&gt; On their return to England, they worked with others to set up a registered charity in memory of Hannah which supports Lepcha's school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannahmemorialacademy.org/ "The Hannah Memorial Academy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
Kohli was arrested on 15 July 2004 in [[West Bengal]]'s [[Darjeeling]] district while trying to flee to [[Nepal]]. While in police custody, Kohli stated he was "tired of running". On 28 July 2004, Kohli admitted to raping and murdering Foster in an interview with a private television channel. Confessing to his crime, Kohli said that he was forced to kill Foster after raping her because she refused to cover up his crime. In August 2004, he retracted his confessional statement saying it was "not by my own will".

Kohli was held in judicial custody in India pending [[extradition]] to the United Kingdom; a final decision to extradite him to the UK was handed down on 8 June 2007. On 28 July 2007 Kohli arrived in the UK after being extradited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6920436.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Hannah suspect arrives back in UK | date = 28 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohli was charged with the murder, kidnap, and rape of Hannah Foster after landing at Heathrow, following his extradition from India. He was also charged with manslaughter, false imprisonment, and perverting the course of justice. On 10 December 2007, Kohli entered a plea of not guilty to the charges of kidnapping, rape and murder at [[Winchester Crown Court]].

==Sentence==
On 25 November 2008, Kohli, then aged 41, was found guilty of all charges at [[Winchester]] Crown Court and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], with a recommended minimum term of 24 years, less two years for time already served in the UK on remand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/briefing/hannahfoster/3876021.Life_for_Hannah_Foster_s_murderer/ | work = Southern Daily Echo | title = Life for Hannah Foster's murderer Maninder Pal Singh Kohli | date = 25 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah's family expressed their disappointment in the sentence, hoping that the killer would spend the rest of his life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Makin |first=Jenny |date=26 November 2008 |title= Kohli should spend rest of life behind bars |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/briefing/hannahfoster/3876041.Hannah_s_killer_should_never_be_freed__say_parents/ |newspaper=[[Southern Daily Echo]] |location=[[Southampton]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the trial judge's recommendation, Kohli is expected to remain in prison until at least 2030 and the age of 63.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49305">'''Oppression''' can refer to an authoritarian regime controlling its citizens via state control of politics, the monetary system, media, and the military; denying people any meaningful human or civil rights; and terrorizing the populace through harsh, unjust punishment, and a hidden network of obsequious informants reporting to a vicious secret police force. 

Oppression also refers to a less overtly malicious pattern of subjugation, although in many ways this social oppression represents a particularly insidious and ruthlessly effective form of manipulation and control. In this instance, the subordination and injustices do not afflict everyone—instead it targets specific groups of people for restrictions, ridicule, and marginalization. No universally accepted term has yet emerged to describe this variety of oppression, although some scholars will parse the multiplicity of factors into a handful of categories, e.g., social (or sociocultural) oppression; institutional (or legal) oppression; and [[economic oppression]].

==Authoritarian oppression==
The word ''oppress ''comes from the Latin ''oppressus'', past participle of ''opprimere'', ("to press against",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=oppress|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|last=|first=|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=9780544454453|edition=5th|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125135556/https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=oppress|archivedate=2017-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to squeeze", "to suffocate").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.kdictionaries-online.com/DictionaryPage.aspx?ApplicationCode=18#&amp;&amp;DictionaryEntry=oppress&amp;SearchMode=Entry|title=Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=K Dictionaries Ltd, by arrangement with Random House Information Group, an imprint of The Crown Publishing Group, a division of Random House, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|edition=Revised &amp; Updated|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084452/http://www.kdictionaries-online.com/DictionaryPage.aspx?ApplicationCode=18#&amp;&amp;DictionaryEntry=oppress&amp;SearchMode=Entry|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian governments]] use oppression to subjugate the people, they want their citizenry to feel that "pressing down", and to live in fear that if they displease the authorities they will, in a metaphorical sense, be "squeezed" and "suffocated", e.g., thrown in a dank, dark, state prison or summarily executed. Such governments oppress the people using restriction, control, terror, hopelessness, and despair.{{efn|This description of authoritarian governments is somewhat simplistic in that it describes the epitome of authoritarianism, i.e., the worst-case scenario, which still exists in some countries today, but has gradually become less prevalent over the last two centuries or so. See the five books cited at the end of this paragraph for a more nuanced discussion. Also see the Wikipedia article, [[Authoritarianism]].}} The tyrant's tools of oppression include, for example, extremely harsh punishments for "unpatriotic" statements; developing a loyal, guileful [[secret police]] force; prohibiting [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of the press]]; controlling the monetary system and economy; and imprisoning or killing activists or other leaders who might pose a threat to their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes after the Cold War|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Way|first2=Lucan A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521882521|oclc=968631692|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968631692|location=New York City, NY|pages=5–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967148718|title=Non-democratic politics : authoritarianism, dictatorship, and democratization|last=Xavier|first=Márquez|year=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=1–21; 39–61; 130–141|isbn=9781137486318|location=London|oclc=967148718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/340983053|title=Democracy and authoritarianism in the post-communist world|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Bunce|first=Valerie|last2=McFaul|first2=Michael|last3=Stoner|first3=Kathryn|isbn=9780521115988|location=Cambridge, England (UK)|oclc=340983053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191465180|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of authoritarianism: Puritanism, democracy, and society|last=Zafirovski|first=Milan|date=2007|pages=15–18|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|isbn=9780387493206|location=New York City, NY|oclc=191465180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607553768|title=The new authoritarianism in the Middle East and North Africa|last=King|first=Stephen J.|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253353979|location=Bloomington, IN|oclc=607553768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic, political, legal, cultural, and institutional oppression==
Oppression also refers to a more insidious type of manipulation and control, in this instance involving the subjugation and marginalization of specific groups of people within a country or society, such as: [[Women's rights|girls and women]], [[Misandry|boys and men]], [[Person of color|people of color]], [[Minority religion|religious communities]], [[Poverty|citizens in poverty]], [[LGBT history|LGBT people]], [[youth rights|youth and children]], and many more. This [[Social class|socioeconomic]], cultural, political, legal, and institutional oppression (hereinafter, "social oppression") probably occurs in every country, culture, and society, including the most advanced [[Democracy|democracies]], such as the United States, Japan, Costa Rica, Sweden, and Canada.{{efn|This list of countries is mostly arbitrary, and is meant only to illustrate what is meant by "advanced democracies".}}{{efn|The terms [[Representative democracy|representative democracies]], [[Republic|republics]], or [[Democratic republic|democratic republics]] could also be used instead of [[Democracy|democracies]]. The four Wikipedia articles linked to in the previous sentence discuss the similarities and differences between and amongst the four related terms.}}

A single, widely accepted definition of social oppression does not yet exist, although there are commonalities. Taylor (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=Elanor|year=2016|title=Groups and Oppression|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12252/abstract|journal=Hypatia|volume=31|issue=3|pages=520–536|doi=10.1111/hypa.12252|issn=1527-2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829135247/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12252/abstract|archivedate=2016-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined (social) oppression in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oppression is a form of injustice that occurs when one social group is subordinated while another is privileged, and oppression is maintained by a variety of different mechanisms including social norms, stereotypes and institutional rules. A key feature of oppression is that it is perpetrated by and affects social groups. ... [Oppression]  occurs when a particular social group is unjustly subordinated, and where that subordination is not necessarily deliberate but instead results from a complex network of social restrictions, ranging from laws and institutions to implicit biases and stereotypes. In such cases, there may be no deliberate attempt to subordinate the relevant group, but the group is nonetheless unjustly subordinated by this network of social constraints.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=520-521}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harvey (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41528208|title=Civilized oppression|first=Jean|last=Harvey|date=1999|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=1–2|isbn=978-0847692743|location=Lanham|oclc=41528208}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the term "civilized oppression", which he introduced as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is harder still to become aware of what I call 'civilized Oppression,' that involves neither physical violence nor the use of law. Yet these subtle forms are by far the most prevalent in Western industrialized societies. This work will focus on issues that are common to such subtle oppression in several different contexts (such as racism, classism, and sexism) ... Analyzing what is involved in civilized oppression includes analyzing the kinds of mechanisms used, the power relations at work, the systems controlling perceptions and information, the kinds of harms inflicted on the victims, and the reasons why this oppression is so hard to see even by contributing agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research and theory development on social oppression has advanced apace since the 1980s with the publication of seminal books and articles,{{efn|see "General references (seminal works)" below.}} and the cross-pollination of ideas and discussion among diverse disciplines, such as: feminism, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and political science. Nonetheless, more fully understanding the problem remains an extremely complicated challenge for scholars. Improved understanding will likely involve, for example, comprehending more completely the historical antecedents of current social oppression; the commonalities (and lack thereof) among the various social groups damaged by social oppression (and the individual human beings who make up those groups); and the complex interplay between and amongst sociocultural, political, economic, psychological, and legal forces that cause and support oppression.

==Social oppression==
Social oppression is when a single group in society takes advantage of, and exercises power over, another group using dominance and subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Sociology: Oppression, Resistance, and the State|last=Glasberg, Shannon|first=Davita, Deric|publisher=Sage Publication Inc|year=2011|isbn=9781452238081|location=United States of America|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals by those with relative power.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wormer, K., &amp; Besthorn, F. H. (2010). ''Human behavior and the social environment, macro level: Groups, communities, and organizations''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a social group setting, oppression may be based on many ideas, such as poverty, gender, class, race, or other categories. Oppression by institution, or systematic oppression, is when the laws of a place create unequal treatment of a specific social identity group or groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Institutionalized Oppression Definitions|last=Cheney|first=Carol|last2=LeFrance|first2=Jeannie|date=2006|website=Act for Action|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Quinteros|first3=Terrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of social oppression is when a specific social group is denied access to education that may hinder their lives in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Politics of Difference|last=Young|first=Iris|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic oppression is the divide between two classes of society. These were once determined by factors such slavery, property rights, disenfranchisement, and forced displacement of livelihood. Each divide yielded various treatments and attitudes towards each group.

Social oppression derives from power dynamics and imbalances related to the social location of a group or individual. [[Social location]], as defined by Lynn Weber, is "an individual's or a group's social 'place' in the race, class, gender and sexuality hierarchies, as well as in other critical social hierarchies such as age, ethnicity, and nation".&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality: A Conceptual Framework|last=Weber|first=Lynn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-538024-8|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=|oclc=699188746}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} An individual's social location often determines how they will be perceived and treated by others in society. Three elements shape whether a group or individual can exercise power: the power to design or manipulate the rules and regulations, the capacity to win competitions through the exercise of political or economic force, and the ability to write and document social and political history.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, S. J. (Ed.). (2015). ''Race, Gender, Sexuality, and Social Class: Dimensions of Inequality and Identity''. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are four predominant social hierarchies, race, class, gender and sexuality, that contribute to social oppression.

===Privilege===
Weber,&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; among some other political theorists, argues that oppression persists because most individuals fail to recognize it; that is, discrimination is often not visible to those who are not in the midst of it. [[Privilege (social inequality)|Privilege]] refers to a sociopolitical immunity one group has over others derived from particular societal benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|title=Definition of PRIVILEGE|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920143749/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|archive-date=2017-09-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the groups who have privilege over gender, race, or sexuality, for example, can be unaware of the power their privilege holds. These inequalities further perpetuate themselves because those who are oppressed rarely have access to resources that would allow them to escape their maltreatment. This can lead to [[internalized oppression]], where subordinate groups essentially give up the fight to get access to equality, and accept their fate as a non-dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Freibach-Heifetz|first1=Dana|last2=Stopler|first2=Gila|date=June 2008|title=On conceptual dichotomies and social oppression|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|volume=34|issue=5|pages=515–35|doi=10.1177/0191453708089197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial oppression===
The first social hierarchy is race or racial oppression, which is defined as: " ... burdening a specific race with unjust or cruel restraints or impositions. Racial oppression may be social, systematic, institutionalized, or internalized. Social forms of racial oppression include exploitation and mistreatment that is socially supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/racial-oppression-bacab47f0ce758d|title=What is Racial Oppression?|last=|first=|date=|website=Reference|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425024203/https://www.reference.com/world-view/racial-oppression-bacab47f0ce758d|archive-date=2017-04-25|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States history consists of five primary forms of racial oppression including genocide and geographical displacement, slavery, second-class citizenship, non-citizen labor, and diffuse racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Blauner, B. (1972). ''Racial oppression in America''. Harpercollins College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first, primary form of racial oppression—[[genocide]] and [[Forced displacement|geographical displacement]]—in the US context refers to [[Western Europe]] and settlers taking over an Indigenous population's land. Many Indigenous people, commonly known today as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], were relocated to [[Indian Reservation]]s or killed during wars fought over the land. The second form of racial oppression, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], refers to [[Africans]] being taken from their homeland and sold as property to [[white Americans]]. Racial oppression, particularly in the [[Southern United States]], was a significant part of daily life and routine in which African-Americans worked on plantations and did other labor without pay and the freedom to leave their workplace. The third form of racial oppression, [[second-class citizen]]ship, refers to some categories of citizens having fewer rights than others. Second-class citizenship became a pivotal form of racial oppression in the United States following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], as African-Americans who were formerly enslaved continued to be considered unequal to white citizens, and had no voting rights. Moreover, immigrants and foreign workers in the US are also treated like second-class citizens, with fewer rights than people born in the US. The fourth form of racial oppression in American history, non-citizen labor, refers to the linkage of race and legal citizenship status. During the middle of the 19th century, some categories of immigrants, such as Mexicans and Chinese, were sought as physical laborers, but were nonetheless denied legal access to citizenship status. The last form of racial oppression in American history is diffuse discrimination. This form of racial oppression refers to discriminatory actions that are not directly backed by the legal powers of the state, but take place in widespread everyday social interactions. This can include employers not hiring or promoting someone on the basis of race, landlords only renting to people of certain racial groups, salespeople treating customers differently based on race, and racialized groups having access only to impoverished schools. Even after the civil rights legislation abolishing segregation, racial oppression is still a reality in the United States. According to Robert Blauner, author of ''Racial Oppression in America'', "racial groups and racial oppression are central features of the American social dynamic".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:Crying eye.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pencil drawing of a crying eye.|"crying eye" (pencil drawing)]]

===Class oppression===
The second social hierarchy, class oppression, sometimes referred to as classism, can be defined as prejudice and discrimination based on social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classism|title=Definition of CLASSISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425024521/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classism|archivedate=2017-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class is an unspoken social ranking based on income, wealth, education, status, and power. A class is a large group of people who share similar economic or social positions based on their income, wealth, property ownership, job status, education, skills, and power in the economic and political sphere. The most commonly used class categories include: upper class, middle class, working class, and poor class. A majority of people in the United States self-identify in surveys as middle class, despite vast differences in income and status. Class is also experienced differently depending on race, gender, ethnicity, global location, disability, and more. Class oppression of the poor and working class can lead to deprivation of basic needs and a feeling of inferiority to higher-class people, as well as shame towards one's traditional class, race, gender, or ethnic heritage. In the United States, class has become racialized leaving the greater percentage of people of color living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classism.org/about-class/|title=Class Action   » About Class|website=www.classism.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703001452/http://www.classism.org/about-class/|archivedate=2017-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since class oppression is universal among the majority class in American society, at times it can seem invisible, however, it is a relevant issue that causes suffering for many.

===Gender oppression===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The third social hierarchy is gender oppression, which is instituted through gender norms society has adopted. In some cultures today, gender norms suggest that masculinity and femininity are opposite genders, however it is an unequal binary pair, with masculinity being dominant and femininity being subordinate. Gender as such is not natural but socially constructed, and gendered power differences provide social mechanisms that benefit masculinity. "Many have argued that cultural practices concerning gender norms of child care, housework, appearance, and career impose an unfair burden on women and as such are oppressive."{{cn|date=November 2017}} According to feminist Barbara Cattunar, women have always been "subjected to many forms of oppression, backed up by religious texts which insist upon women's inferiority and subjugation".{{cn|date=November 2017}} Femininity has always been looked down upon, perpetuated by socially constructed stereotypes, which has affected women's societal status and opportunity. In current society, sources like the media further impose gendered oppression as they shape societal views. Females in pop-culture are objectified and sexualized, which can be understood as degrading to women by depicting them as sex objects with little regard for their character, political views, cultural contributions, creativity or intellect. Feminism, or struggles for women's cultural, political and economic equality, has challenged gender oppression. Gender oppression also takes place against trans, gender-non-conforming, gender queer, or non-binary individuals who do not identify with binary categories of masculine/feminine or male/female.

===Age oppression===
Young people are a commonly, yet rarely acknowledged, oppressed demographic. Minors are denied many democratic and human [[rights]], including the rights to [[vote]], [[marry]], and give [[sexual consent]]. Society as a whole also tends to [[discrimination|discriminate]] against young people and view them as inferior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1978-00956-000]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality oppression===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The fourth social hierarchy is sexuality oppression or [[heterosexism]]. Dominant societal views with respect to sexuality, and sex partner selection, have formed a sexuality hierarchy oppressing people who do not conform to [[heteronormativity]]. Heteronormativity is an underlying assumption that everyone in society is heterosexual, and those who are not are treated as different or even abnormal by society, excluded, oppressed, and sometimes subject to violence. Heterosexism also derives from societal views of the nuclear family which is presumed to be heterosexual, and dominated or controlled by the male partner. Social actions by oppressed groups such as [[LGBT]]QI movements have organized to create social change.

=== Religious Persecution ===
[[File:P religion world.svg|thumb|Different types of religious symbols]]
Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual because of their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.definitions.net/definition/religious+persecution|title=What does religious persecution mean?|website=www.definitions.net|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iris Young oppression can be divided into different categories such as powerlessness, exploitation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Politics of Difference|last=Young|first=Iris|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=0691078327|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first category of powerlessness in regards to religious persecution is when a group of people that follow one religion have less power than the dominant religious followers. An example of powerlessness would be during the 17th century when the pilgrims, wanting to escape the [[Church of England]] came to what is now called the [[United States]]. The pilgrims created their own religion of [[Protestantism]], and after doing so they eventually passed laws to keep other religions from prospering.  The Protestants used their power of legislature to oppress the other religions in the United States. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenfeld|first=Warren|date=|title=Christian Privilege and the Promotion of "Secular" and Not-So "Secular" Mainline Christianity in Public Schooling and in the Larger Society|url=|journal=Equity and Excellence in Education|volume=39|pages=|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second category of oppression: exploitation, has been seen in many different forms around the world when it comes to religion. The definition of exploitation is the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/exploitation|title=exploitation {{!}} Definition of exploitation in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example during the [[American Civil War]], white Americans used Chinese immigrants in order to build the [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental railroads.]] During this time it was common for the Chinese immigrants to follow the religions of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Confucianism]], because of this the Chinese were looked at as different and not equal to the white Americans. Due to this view it led them to unequal pay, and many hardships during their time working on the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscitizenship.info/Chinese-immigration-and-the-Transcontinental-railroad/|title=Chinese immigration and the Transcontinental railroad|website=www.uscitizenship.info|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third category that can be seen in religious persecution is violence. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary violence is "the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy". An example of violence in regards to religious persecution is hate crimes that occur in the United States against Muslims. Sense [[September 11 attacks|September 11th, 2001]] hate crimes against people of the Muslim faith have greatly increased. One incident occurred on August 5th, 2017 when three men bombed a [[Mosque]] because they felt that Muslims "'push their beliefs on everyone else'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/minnesota-mosque-bombing-suspects.html|title=3 Suspects in Bombing of Minnesota Mosque Face Weapons Charges|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violence happens to not only muslims but other religions as well.

===Domination===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Addressing social oppression on both a macro and micro level, feminist [[Patricia Hill Collins]] discusses her "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-92483-2|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=295|oclc=491072106|author-link=Patricia Hill Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination discusses the interrelated nature of four domains of power, including the structural, disciplinary, [[hegemony|hegemonic]], and interpersonal domains. Each of these spheres works to sustain current inequalities that are faced by marginalized, excluded or oppressed groups. The structural, disciplinary and hegemonic domains all operate on a macro level, creating social oppression through macro structures such as education, or the criminal justice system, which play out in the interpersonal sphere of everyday life through micro-oppressions.

[[Standpoint theory]] can help us to understand the interpersonal domain. Standpoint theory deals with an individual's social location in that each person will have a very different perspective based on where they are positioned in society. For instance, a white male living in America will have a very different take on an issue such as abortion than a black female living in Africa. Each will have different knowledge claims and experiences that will have shaped how they perceive abortion. Standpoint theory is often used to expose the powerful social locations of those speaking, to justify claims of knowledge through closer experience of an issue, and to deconstruct the construction of knowledge of oppression by oppressors.

===Institutionalized oppression===
"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one's membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |title=Institutionalized Oppression Definitions |format=PDF |last1=Cheney |first1=Carol |last2=LaFrance |first2=Jeannie |last3=Quinteros |first3=Terrie |date=25 August 2006 |website=The Illumination Project |publisher=Portland Community College |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907023850/http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - The Monroe Doctrine, 1823.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting representing the Monroe Doctrine, and a quote about oppression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt|U.S. Capitol - oil painting by Allyn Cox - The Monroe Doctrine (1823), plus a quote from President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1940). (photograph: Architect of the Capitol)]]

Institutionalized oppression allows for government organizations and their employees to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon group identity. Dating back to colonization, the United States implemented the institution of slavery where Africans were brought to the United States to be a source of free labor to expand the cotton and tobacco industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seabrook|first=Renita|last2=Wyatt-Nichol|first2=Heather|date=|title=The Ugly Side of America: Institutional Oppression and Race|url=|journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy|volume=23|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing these systems by the United States government was justified through religious grounding where "servants [were] bought and established as inheritable property".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments freed African Americans, gave them citizenship, and provided them the right to vote, institutions such as some police departments continue to use oppressive systems against minorities. They train their officers to profile individuals based upon their racial heritage, and to exert excessive force to restrain them. [[Racial profiling]] and [[police brutality]] are "employed to control a population thought to be undesirable, undeserving, and under punished by established law".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Above the Law: Police and the Excessive Use of Force|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|last2=Fyfe|first2=James J.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both situations, police officers "rely on legal authority to exonerate their extralegal use of force; both respond to perceived threats and fears aroused by out-groups, especially— but not exclusively— racial minorities".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, "blacks are: approximately four times more likely to be targeted for police use of force than their white counterparts; arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal activities at higher rates than their overall representation in the U.S. population; and are more likely to fear unlawful and harsh treatment by law enforcement officials".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The International Association of Chiefs of Police collected data from police departments between the years 1995 and 2000 and found that 83% of incidents involving use-of-force against subjects of different races than the officer executing it involved a white officer and a black subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Institutionalized oppression is not only experienced by people of racial minorities, but can also affect those in the LGBT community. Oppression of the LGBT community in the United States dates back to President Eisenhower's presidency where he passed [[Executive Order 10450]] in April 1953 which permitted non-binary sexual behaviors to be investigated by federal agencies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law and the Gay Rights Story : The Long Search for Equal Justice in a Divided Democracy|last=Walker|first=Frank|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this order, "More than 800 federal employees resigned or were terminated in the two years following because their files linked them in some way with homosexuality."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Oppression of the LGBT community continues today through some religious systems and their believers' justifications of discrimination based upon their own freedom of religious belief. States such as Arizona and Kansas passed laws in 2014 giving religious-based businesses "the right to refuse service to LGBT customers".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence against Queer People : Race, Class, Gender, and the Persistence of Anti-LGBT Discrimination|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (EDNA) offers full protection of LGBT workers from job discrimination; however, the act does not offer protection against religious-based corporations and businesses, ultimately allowing the LGBT community to be discriminated against in environments such as churches and religious-based hospitals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The LGBT community is further oppressed by the United States government with the passage of the [[First Amendment Defense Act]] which states, "Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1598/text|title=S.1598 - First Amendment Defense Act|last=Lee|first=Mike|date=June 2015|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608160625/https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1598/text|archive-date=2017-06-08|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act essentially allows for institutions of any kind—schools, businesses, hospitals—to deny service to people based upon their sexuality because it goes against a religious belief.

===Economic oppression===
The term economic oppression changes in meaning and significance over time, depending on its contextual application. In today's context, economic oppression may take several forms, including, but not limited to: the practice of [[bonded labour]] in some parts of India, [[serfdom]], [[Unfree labour|forced labour]], low wages, denial of [[equal opportunity]], and practicing employment discrimination, and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Kirst-Ashman, K. K., &amp; Hull, G. H. (2012). Understanding Generalist Practice. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann Cudd]] describes the main forces of economic oppression as oppressive economic systems and direct and indirect forces. Even though capitalism and socialism are not inherently oppressive, they "lend themselves to oppression in characteristic ways".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cudd, Ann E. (2006). Analyzing Oppression. Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0-19-518744-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She defines direct forces of economic oppression as "restrictions on opportunities that are applied from the outside on the oppressed, including enslavement, segregation, employment discrimination, group-based harassment, opportunity inequality, [[neocolonialism]], and governmental corruption". This allows for a dominant social group to maintain and maximize its wealth through the intentional exploitation of economically inferior subordinates. With indirect forces (also known as oppression by choice), "the oppressed are co-opted into making individual choices that add to their own oppression". The oppressed are faced with having to decide to go against their social good, and even against their own good. If they choose otherwise, they have to choose against their interests, which may lead to resentment by their group.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

An example of direct forces of economic oppression is [[employment discrimination]] in the form of the [[gender pay gap]]. Restrictions on women's access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an "inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations".&lt;ref name="Mupepi, Mambo 2016"&gt;Mupepi, Mambo (Ed.). (2016). Effective Talent Management Strategies for Organizational Success. Hershey: Business Science Reference. {{ISBN|1522519610}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, The Economics Daily, "Women's median earnings 82 percent of men's in 2016. https://www.bls.gov {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123041856/https://www.bls.gov/ |date=2017-11-23 }} (visited April 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the "ideal-worker norm," which "defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight," a situation designed for the male sex.&lt;ref name="Mupepi, Mambo 2016"/&gt; 

Women, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the "ideal-worker norm". With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnear, Karen L. (2011). Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook. ABC-Clio. {{ISBN|9781598844252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that this difference in wage earnings is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Charlotta.  (2010). "Why Is There A Gender Wage Gap According To Occupational Prestige?" Acta Sociologica (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 53.2: 99-117. Academic Search Complete.&lt;/ref&gt; Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that "over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females".&lt;ref&gt;Weichselbaumer, D. and Winter-Ebmer, R. (2005). A Meta-Analysis of the International Gender Wage Gap. Journal of Economic Surveys, 19: 479–511. Doi: 10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect economic oppression is exemplified when individuals work abroad to support their families. [[Outsourcing|Outsourced]] employees, working abroad generally little to no bargaining power not only with their employers, but with immigration authorities as well. They could be forced to accept low wages and work in poor living conditions. And by working abroad, an outsourced employee contributes to the economy of a foreign country instead of their own. Veltman and Piper describe the effects of outsourcing on female laborers abroad:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her work may be oppressive first in respects of being [[Heteronomy|heteronomous]]: she may enter work under conditions of constraint; her work may bear no part of reflectively held life goals; and she may not even have the: freedom of bodily movement at work. Her work may also fail to permit a meaningful measure of economic independence or to help her support herself or her family, which she identifies as the very purpose of her working.&lt;ref&gt;Veltman, A., &amp; Piper, M. (Eds.). (2014). Autonomy, Oppression, and Gender. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By deciding to work abroad, laborers are "reinforcing the forces of economic oppression that presented them with such poor options".&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===Feminism and Equal Rights===
[[File:No Chains Woman.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=Image of a woman breaking free of chains.|A woman breaking free of chains.]]Although a relatively modern form of resistance, feminism's origins can be traced back to the events leading up to the introduction of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) in 1923. While the ERA was created to address the need for equal protection under the law between men and women in the workplace, it spurred increased feminism that has come to represent the search for equal opportunity and respect for women in patriarchal societies, across all social, cultural, and political spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5771e8ef-9026-4070-a19b-3afe0237ba52%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=117|title=Equality, Sameness, Difference: Revisiting the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Chávez|first=Karma|last2=Nair|first2=Yasmin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Conrad|first3=Ryan|author-last##=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations and marches have been a popular medium of support, with the January 21, 2017, [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]'s replication in major cities across the world drawing tens of thousands of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-photos/|title=Women's March|last=Nusca|first=Andrew|date=January 21, 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085625/http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-photos/|archive-date=2017-04-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists' main talking points consist of women's reproductive rights, the closing of the pay gap between men and women, the [[glass ceiling]] and workplace discrimination, and the [[intersectionality]] of feminism with other major issues such as African-American rights, immigration freedoms, and gun violence.

==="Resistance"===
Resistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hay|first=Carol|date=|title=The Obligation to Resist Oppression|url=|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, resistance to oppression has been largely overlooked in terms of the amount of research and number of studies completed on the topic, and therefore, is often largely misinterpreted as "lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cudd|first=Ann|date=|title=Strikes, Housework, and the Moral Obligation to Resist|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two centuries, resistance movements have risen that specifically aim to oppose, analyze, and counter various types of oppression, as well as to increase public awareness and support of groups marginalized and disadvantaged by systematic oppression. Late 20th century resistance movements such as [[liberation theology]] and [[anarchism]] set the stage for mass critiques of, and resistance to, forms of social and institutionalized oppression that have been subtly enforced and reinforced over time. Resistance movements of the 21st century have furthered the missions of activists across the world, and movements such as [[liberalism]], [[Black Lives Matter]] (related: [[Blue Lives Matter]], [[All Lives Matter]]) and [[feminism]] (related: [[Meninism]]) are some of the most prominent examples of resistance to oppression today.

{{wiktionary|probate court}}
A '''probate court''' (sometimes called a '''surrogate court''') is a [[court]] that has competence in a [[jurisdiction]] to deal with matters of [[probate]] and the [[Administration of an estate on death|administration of estates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycourts.gov/forms/surrogates/pdfs/SURROGATE_INFO.pdf|title=SURROGATE’S COURT|last=|first=|date=|website=ww.nycourts.gov|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, such courts may be referred to as Orphans' Courts, or courts of ordinary. In some jurisdictions probate court functions are performed by a [[chancery court]] or another [[court of equity]], or as a part or division of another court. 

Probate courts administer proper distribution of the [[asset]]s of a [[Death|decedent]] (one who has died), [[Adjudication|adjudicates]] the validity of [[will (law)|wills]], enforces the provisions of a valid will (by issuing the [[Probate|grant of probate]]), prevents [[malfeasance]] by [[executor]]s and administrators of [[Estate (law)|estates]], and provides for the [[equitable distribution]] of the assets of persons who die [[intestate]] (without a valid will), such as by granting a [[Letters of Administration|grant of administration]] giving judicial approval to the [[personal representative]] to administer matters of the estate. 

In contested matters, the probate court examines the authenticity of a will and decides who is to receive the deceased person's property. In a case of an [[intestacy]], the court determines who is to receive the deceased's property under the law of its jurisdiction. The probate court will then oversee the process of distributing the deceased's assets to the proper beneficiaries. A probate court can be petitioned by interested parties in an estate, such as when a [[beneficiary]] feels that an estate is being mishandled. The court has the authority to compel an executor to give an account of their actions.

In some jurisdictions (e.g. [[Texas]]) probate courts also handle other matters, such as guardianships, trusts, and mental health issues (including the authority to order involuntary commitment to psychiatric facilities).

== Orphans' Court ==
An Orphans' Court was an organization established in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] American colonies during [[colonization]]. The major goal of the organization was to protect [[orphan]]ed children and their right to their deceased family member's estate from claims and against abuses by stepparents and others.

Today, at least in [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]], probate courts are still called Orphans' Courts, for historical reasons, hearing matters involving wills of deceased estates which are contested and supervising estates which are probated judicially.&lt;ref name=MarlandOrphCrt&gt;Maryland Courts, [http://mdcourts.gov/orphanscourt/about.html About the Orphans' Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Rats Dungeon", or "Dungeon of the Rats", was a feature of the [[Tower of London]] alleged by [[Roman Catholic]] writers from the [[Elizabethan era]]. "A cell below high-water mark and totally dark" would draw in rats from the [[River Thames]] as the tide flowed in. Prisoners would have their "alarm excited", and in some instances have "flesh ... torn from the arms and legs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Dutch Revolt]], [[Diederik Sonoy]], an ally of [[William the Silent]], is documented to have used a method where a [[pottery]] bowl filled with rats was placed open side down on the naked body of a prisoner. When hot [[charcoal]] was piled on the bowl, the rats would "gnaw into the very bowels of the victim" in an attempt to escape the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Rat torture appears in the famous case study of a patient of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The [[Rat Man]] obsessed that his father and lady friend would be subjected to this torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=More about Rats and Rat People|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|volume=52|pages=277–288|author=Leonard Shengold|year=1971|pmid=5106163|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rat torture was allegedly used in [[Brazil]] during the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]] of 1964-1985,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} in [[Chile]] during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|regime of Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Elizabeth|title=Torture Under Pinochet's Regime|year=2009|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Argentina]] during the period of the [[National Reorganization Process]] (1976–1983).&lt;ref name="CONADEP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nunca Más (Never Again); Report of CONADEP|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons|CONADEP]] in Argentina detailed the use of a torture method known as "the recto-scope" (reserved primarily for Jewish prisoners) which consisted of inserting living rats into a victim's [[rectum]] or [[vagina]] through a tube.&lt;ref name="CONADEP"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] documented the case of a woman tortured by the Chilean CNI (National Intelligence Agency) in 1981, who described being kept in a room full of live rats during interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Chile: Evidence of torture: an Amnesty International Report. London (Amnesty International Publications) 1983, pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2010, in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]], [[David Wax]] was alleged to have threatened kidnap victim Yisrael Bryskman with rat torture unless he agreed to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) [https://www.gq.com/story/epstein-orthodox-hit-squad "Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad"], ''GQ''&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for assisting in a kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;(January 13, 2016) [http://www.timesofisrael.com/nj-couple-sentenced-for-helping-jewish-divorce-ring/ "NJ Couple Sentenced For Helping Jewish Divorce Ring"], ''The Times of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==

Rats are featured in the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] story ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]''. The narrator lies on [[the rack]], and can only watch as a [[scythe]] swings back and forth, approaching closer each time, as rats swarm over his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An account similar to the Sonoy torture appears in the 1899 [[Octave Mirbeau]] novel ''[[The Torture Garden (novel)|The Torture Garden]]'', and psychologist Leonard Shengold has identified this as the possible source of the story that the Rat Man told Freud. Part of the book, an imaginary dialog between a torturer and a beautiful woman who is sexually excited by the accounts, is set in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The ministry imprisons him in [[Room 101]]. Here Winston must face his greatest fear: rats. A cage filled with hungry rats is placed over his head, their only source of food or escape being by eating their way through Winston's face. At this point Winston breaks and begs that the method actually be used on his lover Julia, a sign that he has finally been broken.

'''Enrico de Jesus Puno''' (February 13, 1953 – October 30, 2018), better known as '''Rico J. Puno''', was a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] singer, composer, comedian, actor and television host who was credited as a pioneer-promoter of original [[Filipino music]]. He started the trend of incorporating [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] [[lyrics]] in his rendition of the [[United States|American]] song ''[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]'' and other foreign songs. Puno became known as a singer who regularly infused his on-stage performance with tongue-in-cheek comedy and adult humor. He hosted the noontime variety show ''[[Pilipinas Win na Win]]'' alongside [[Rey Valera]], [[Marco Sison]] and [[Nonoy Zuñiga]] for two months in 2010 replacing [[Kris Aquino]]. He also hosted on ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]'' together with [[John Estrada]], [[Randy Santiago]], [[Mariel Rodriguez]], [[Pokwang]] and [[Toni Gonzaga]] as one of the main host replacing ''Pilipinas Win na Win''.

Puno was also active in politics. In 1998, he was elected as the City Councilor of [[Makati City]] from its 1st district until his third and last term ended in 2007. He ran for a comeback in 2010 as the vice mayoralty candidate of Makati City, but was unsuccessful. In 2016, Puno was elected as a councilor in Makati, under the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2016/05/10/1581821/jhong-hilario-rico-j.-puno-elected-makati] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Puno was born in [[Manila]] to parents, Felipe Puno Sr. and Corazon J. Puno. Although he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Philippine School of Business Administration, Puno dreamed of becoming a singer.&lt;ref name=Carousel&gt;[http://www.carouselpinoy.com/ricojcaroustar.html Rico J. Puno, Caroustar of the Month, Carousel Pinoy Entertainment, CarouselPinoy.com, December 2004], retrieved on: July 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Puno introduced himself and his talent to the entertainment business by performing at folk houses and small clubs in Metro Manila. In 1975, while singing at the ''Palazzi'', Puno met and performed with the American [[Motown]] group, ''[[The Temptations]]''. Puno's talent was later noticed by the executive producers from [[Vicor Records]] (now [[Vicor Music]]). His first record was ''Love Won't Let Me Wait'', while his first big hit was the Tagalog-infused ''The Way We Were''.&lt;ref name=Carousel/&gt;

In 1976, Puno won the Aliw Award for ''Most Promising Entertainer''. Two years later, he became Aliw's ''Entertainer of the Year''. His ''Rico in Concert'' show at the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] launched him as one of the foremost Philippine pop stars.

In 1977, Puno covered the Carpenters song ''Merry Christmas Darling'' from his first Christmas album, ''The Spirit of Christmas'' which was originally sung by Karen Carpenter.

In 1978, Puno's popularity and his regular concerts at the [[Araneta Coliseum]] (now SMART Araneta Coliseum) in [[Quezon City]] and his performance tours in the [[United States]] broke records in terms of audience attendance. His fame also made him into a sought-after product endorser including advertisements for [[San Miguel Beer]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Carousel/&gt;

In 1979, Puno represented the Philippines at the [[Tokyo Music Festival]], with ''Lupa'' (Ground), a song that imparted messages on how an individual could strive to change for the better, on how to gain humility and other human values, on how not to judge others, and on how to struggle against one's own weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Fiesta/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Image:Thebig5-Rico.jpg|thumb|From the left, Marco Sison, Rico J. Puno, [[Rey Valera]], [[Hajji Alejandro]], [[Nonoy Zuñiga]] --&gt;
From 2001, the ''Greatest Hits'' series in Manila, produced by Viva Concerts helped maintain Puno's popularity.  These ''Greatest Hits'' concerts brought him together with other ''Greatest Hitmakers'' in the Philippine music scene during the 1980s, namely Philippine pop icons: [[Hajji Alejandro]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Nonoy Zuñiga]] and [[Marco Sison]].&lt;ref name=Carousel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiesta/&gt;

He also covered the song ''Ang Huling El-Bimbo'' in 2005 and originally composed by Ely Buendia, who was originally from the [[Eraserheads]].

He also covered the song ''Mabuti Pa Sila'' in 2010 and originally composed and recorded by Gary Granada.

During Puno's recent performances, he is often joined on stage by his oldest daughter, Tosca Camille.&lt;ref name=Carousel/&gt;  Rico's son, Rox is also a singer and a band member.

Rico was honored and awarded recently in ''ASAP Pinoy'' on ASAP show on ABS-CBN contributing his best in singing performing as a total entertainer who celebrating his 40th anniversary in music and entertainment movie and TV career in 2017.

===Hit songs===
Puno's hit songs included "Kapalaran" (Fate), "Buhat" (Ever Since), "Macho Gwapito" (Gorgeous Young Man), "Lupa" (Soil or Ground), "Damdamin" (Feelings), "May Bukas Pa" (There's Still Tomorrow), "Ang Tao'y Marupok" (People Are Weak), "Magkasuyo Buong Gabi" (Together Through the Night) - a duet with Elsa Chan - and his Filipino rendition of "You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show)".&lt;ref name=Carousel/&gt;

One of Puno's recent albums, is ''Aliw'' by [[Sony BMG]] Records. His carrier single was "Kay Hirap Mong Limutin" (It Is Hard To Forget You) by [[Lito Camo]].&lt;ref name=Fiesta/&gt;

==Popularity==
The duration of Puno's career spanned more than four decades. He was a favorite of the [[PAGCOR|Philippine Amusement and Games Corporation]] (PAGCOR) and other casinos around Metro Manila and the provinces. His performances included tours in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Dubai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]an countries.&lt;ref name=Fiesta&gt;[http://www.philippinefiesta.com/rico.html Rico J.

Owing to his rising popularity, various TV networks and movie producers soon came knocking on his door for more acting/hosting opportunities.  [[GMA Network]] hired Puno to host a noontime variety show, ''[[Lunch Date]]'' which first aired on March 1986 and served as a replacement for ''[[Student Canteen]]''.  However, in 1987 he left the show after it reformatted.  In 1994-1995 he headlined another noontime show, ''Chibugan Na'' (It's Eating Time), aired on weekdays at 12 noon on [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]], with Hajji Alejandro.&lt;ref name=GEO&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/aileenbtadeo/rico_main.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:08:13 Rico J. Puno, Discography, Song Lyrics and Trivia, Geocities.com (undated)], retrieved on: July 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Puno returned as TV host for ''Macho Guwapito'' on the now-defunct Makisig Network. He was one of the judges in the inaugural week of the reality talent show [[Showtime (Philippines)|Showtime]] on [[ABS-CBN]].  In 2010, he also hosted "[[Pilipinas Win na Win]]" and "[[Happy Yipee Yehey]]!" in 2011-2012.

Puno is also the owner of the [[karaoke]] bar, ''Coriks'', at Vito Cruz Extension, Manila. He also manages a trucking business.

He won a seat in the [[Makati City]] Council from the first district in 1998.&lt;ref name=GEO/&gt; Among Puno's notable ordinances filed during his first term was the installation of a surveillance camera in every convenience store in Makati that operates 24 hours a day, as protection against robbers who prey on convenience stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makati.gov.ph/portal/contents/city_gov/organization/admin_services/city_council/puno.htm Councilor Rico J. Puno's Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913080307/http://www.makati.gov.ph/portal/contents/city_gov/organization/admin_services/city_council/puno.htm |date=September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the city council after his third and final consecutive term ended in 2007. His seat in the city council was kept by his eldest daughter, Tosca Camille. Three years later, he teamed up with [[Jejomar Binay, Jr.|Jun-Jun Binay]] to run for city vice mayor in [[Makati City]]. Although Binay won the mayoralty race, Puno lost to Barangay Valenzuela captain Romulo Pena, Jr., who was the running mate of then-outgoing vice mayor Ernesto Mercado.

==Death==
Puno died of [[heart failure]] on October 30, 2018, in [[St. Luke's Medical Center – Global City]]. He was 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OPM icon Rico J.

'''Rodney Sturt Taylor''' (11 January 1930&amp;nbsp;– 7 January 2015) was an Australian actor. He appeared in more than 50 films, including ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960), ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961).

==Early life==
Taylor was born on 11 January 1930&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', Birth Announcements, Saturday 18 January 1930, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], the only child of William Sturt Taylor, a steel construction contractor and commercial artist, and Mona Taylor (née Thompson), a writer of more than a hundred short stories and children's books. His middle name comes from his great-great grand uncle, Captain [[Charles Sturt]], a British explorer of the [[Australian outback|Australian Outback]] in the 19th century.

Taylor attended [[Parramatta High School]] and later studied at the [[UNSW Art &amp; Design|East Sydney Technical and Fine Arts College]]. For a time he worked as a commercial artist, but decided to become an actor after seeing [[Laurence Olivier]] in an [[The Old Vic|Old Vic]] touring production of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vagg ''Rod Taylor: An Aussie in Hollywood'', Bear Manor Media, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Australia===
Taylor acquired extensive radio and stage experience in Australia, where his radio work included a period on ''[[Blue Hills (radio serial)|Blue Hills]]'' and a role as [[Tarzan]]. Earlier in his career he had to support himself by working at Sydney's [[Mark Foy's]] department store, designing and painting window and other displays during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodtaylorsite.com/radio.shtml|title=The Complete Rod Taylor Site: Radio|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he took part in a re-enactment of [[Charles Sturt]]'s voyage down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, playing Sturt's offsider, [[George Macleay]]. A short documentary, ''[[Inland with Sturt]]'' (1951), was based on it. Taylor also appeared in a number of theatre productions for Australia's [[Mercury Theatre (Australia)|Mercury Theatre]].

Taylor made his feature film debut in the Australian [[Lee Robinson (director)|Lee Robinson]] film ''[[King of the Coral Sea]]'' (1954), playing an American. He later played [[Israel Hands]] in a [[Hollywood]]-financed film shot in Sydney, ''[[Long John Silver (film)|Long John Silver]]'' (1954), an unofficial sequel to ''[[Treasure Island]]''. Following these two films, Taylor was awarded the 1954 Rola Show Australian Radio Actor of the Year Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodtaylorsite.com/radio.shtml|title=The Complete Rod Taylor Site: Radio|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a ticket to [[London]] via Los Angeles, but Taylor did not continue on to London.

===Hollywood===
[[File:Rod Taylor Lloyd Bochner Hong Kong 1961.JPG|thumb|Taylor (seated) with [[Lloyd Bochner]] in the TV series ''[[Hong Kong (TV series)|Hong Kong]]'', 1961]]
Taylor soon landed roles in television shows such as ''[[Studio 57]]'' and the films ''[[Hell on Frisco Bay]]'' (1955) and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956). In 1955, he guest-starred in the third episode ("The Argonauts") of the first hour-long [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series, ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program starring [[Clint Walker]]. Taylor and [[Edward Andrews]] played gold seekers Clancy and Duncan, respectively, who are best friends until they strike it rich, only to see Native Americans release their gold dust to the wind. The episode was a remake of the film ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948). Taylor was considered for one of the leads in [[Warner Bros. Television]]'s ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]''.

Toward the end of 1955, Taylor unsuccessfully [[screen test]]ed to play boxer [[Rocky Graziano]] in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'' after [[James Dean]]'s death, but his use of a Brooklyn accent and physical prowess in the test impressed the studio enough to gain him a long-term contract. At MGM, he played a series of support roles in ''[[The Catered Affair]]'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;Saragossi, Steve ''Taylor-Made'' ''Cinema Retro'' Vol. 7 Issue 19&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'' (1957), and ''[[Ask Any Girl (film)|Ask Any Girl]]'' (1959). He had a significant role in ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), which won [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for two of its stars, [[David Niven]] and [[Wendy Hiller]]. He also made a strong impression guest-starring in an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[And When the Sky Was Opened]]" (1959).

===Stardom===
Taylor's first leading role in a feature film was in ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960), [[George Pal]]'s adaptation of the science-fiction classic by [[H. G. Wells]], with Taylor as the time traveler who, thousands of years in the future, falls for a woman played by [[Yvette Mimieux]]. Taylor played a character not unlike that of his ''Twilight Zone'' episode of a year earlier and the film ''[[World Without End (film)|World Without End]]'' in 1956.

In or around 1960, he was approached regarding the role of [[James Bond]] in the [[James_Bond_in_film#Eon_Productions|first feature-length Bond film]]. Taylor reportedly declined to become involved because he considered the character of Bond "beneath him".&lt;ref name="smh-obit"&gt; [https://www.smh.com.au/national/rod-taylor-the-hollywood-star-who-never-forgot-he-was--an-aussie-20150113-12n0cc.html Mark Juddery,  "Rod Taylor, the Hollywood star, who never forgot he was an Aussie", ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 13 January 2015] (access: 7 September 2018). &lt;/ref&gt; Taylor later commented: "Every time a new Bond picture became a smash hit ... I tore out my hair." 

In the 1960–1961 television season, Taylor starred as foreign correspondent Glenn Evans in the ABC dramatic series ''[[Hong Kong (TV series)|Hong Kong]]''. His principal co-star was [[Lloyd Bochner]]; [[Jack Kruschen]] played the bartender, Tully. The program faced stiff competition on Wednesday evenings from [[NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]]'', hence lasted for only one season. He voiced Pongo (a [[Dalmatian dog|Dalmatian]] dog) in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s animated feature ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961) and also guest-starred on [[Marilyn Maxwell]]'s short-lived ABC series ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'' around the same time. In 1962, he starred in an episode of NBC's ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'' ("[[The Ordeal of Dr. Shannon]]"), an adaptation of [[A. J. Cronin]]'s novel ''[[Shannon's Way]]''.

Taylor starred in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s horror/thriller ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), along with [[Tippi Hedren]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Veronica Cartwright]], and [[Jessica Tandy]], playing a man whose town and home come under attack by menacing birds. Taylor then starred with [[Jane Fonda]] in the romantic comedy ''[[Sunday in New York]]'' (also 1963).

During the mid-1960s, Taylor worked mostly for MGM. His credits including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963), his first feature film role as an Australian, with [[Richard Burton]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Maggie Smith]]; ''[[Fate Is the Hunter (film)|Fate Is the Hunter]]'' (for [[20th Century Fox]], 1964) with [[Glenn Ford]] and Suzanne Pleshette; ''[[36 Hours (1965 film)|36 Hours]]'' (1964) with [[James Garner]]; ''[[Young Cassidy]]'' (1965) with [[Julie Christie]] and [[Maggie Smith]]; ''[[The Liquidator (1965 film)|The Liquidator]]'' (1965) with [[Jill St. John]]; ''[[Do Not Disturb (1965 film)|Do Not Disturb]]'' (1965); and ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'' (1966), both co-starring [[Doris Day]].

He began to change his image toward the end of the decade to more tough-guy roles, such as ''[[Chuka (film)|Chuka]]'' (1967), which he also produced, and he starred in ''[[Dark of the Sun]]'' (or ''The Mercenaries'', 1968), again with Yvette Mimieux; ''[[Nobody Runs Forever]]'' (1968) where he played [[New South Wales Police]] Sergeant  [[Scobie Malone]], this being Taylor's first starring feature film role as an Australian; and ''[[Darker than Amber (film)|Darker than Amber]]'' (1970) as [[Travis McGee]].

He was also reportedly up for the role of martial artist Roper in the [[Bruce Lee]] vehicle ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973). The film was directed by [[Robert Clouse]], who had also directed Taylor in the film ''Darker than Amber'' (1970). Taylor was supposedly deemed too tall for the part, and the role instead went to [[John Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityonfire.com/commentary/etd.mp3 City On Fire (audio commentatary)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In 1973, Taylor was cast in ''[[The Train Robbers]]'' with [[John Wayne]] and [[Ann-Margret]]. The film was a box office success. Taylor also had some television roles: he starred in ''[[Bearcats!]]'' (1971) on [[CBS]] and in ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1976) on NBC. He had a regular role in the short-lived spy drama series ''[[Masquerade (TV series)|Masquerade]]'' (1983) and played one of the leads in the equally short-lived series, ''[[Outlaws (1986 TV series)|Outlaws]]'' (1986). From 1988 to 1990, Taylor appeared in the CBS drama series ''[[Falcon Crest]]'' as [[Frank Agretti]], playing opposite [[Jane Wyman]]. In the mid 1990s, he appeared in several episodes of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]''.

In 1993, he hosted the documentary ''[[Time Machine: The Journey Back]]''. The special ended with a mini-sequel written by [[David Duncan (writer)|David Duncan]], the screenwriter of the [[George Pal]] film. Taylor recreated his role as George, reuniting him with Filby ([[Alan Young]]).

Taylor returned to Australia several times over the years to make films, playing a 1920s traveling showman in ''[[The Picture Show Man]]'' (1977) and a paid killer in ''[[On the Run (1982 film)|On the Run]]'' (1983). In the black comedy ''[[Welcome to Woop Woop]]'' (1997), he played the foul-mouthed redneck Daddy-O.

By the late 1990s, Taylor had moved into semi-retirement. In 2007, he appeared in the horror telemovie ''[[Kaw (film)|Kaw]]'', which revisits the idea of marauding birds turning on their human tormentors. In this film, however, the cause of the disturbance was discovered by Taylor who plays the town doctor. He appeared in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' in 2009, portraying [[Winston Churchill]] in a cameo.&lt;ref name=miamih&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Eyman|title=Tarantino Comes Calling With A Role For Rod Taylor|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/story/1196616.html|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=23 August 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kJ4OVKYY?url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/story/1196616.html|archivedate=5 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a documentary on Taylor's life, "Pulling No Punches", was released and entered into the [[Beverly Hills Film Festival]].

==Personal life==
Taylor married his third wife, Carol Kikumura, on 15 October 1980. He is the father of now retired [[CNN]] financial reporter [[Felicia Taylor]] (born 1964) from his second marriage to model Mary Hilem (1 June 1963 – 18 September 1969). His first wife was model Peggy Williams (1951–1954).

==Death==
Taylor suffered a fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on January 7, 2015, in [[Beverly Hills, California]], at the age of 84, four days short of his 85th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/australian-actor-rod-taylor-dead-at-84-legendary-star-suffers-a-heart-attack-at-la-home/story-fnilxh2s-1227179390543?from=public_rss ''Courier-Mail'', 9 January 2015, Australian actor Rod Taylor dead at 84, legendary star suffers a heart attack at Beverly Hills home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/rod-taylor-dead-the-bird-the-time-machine-1201396390/ |title=Rod Taylor, ‘The Birds’ and ‘The Time Machine’ Star, Dies at 84 |magazine=Variety |date=8 January 2015 |accessdate=8 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS''' '''''City of Glasgow''''' of 1850 was a single-screw passenger [[steamship]] of the [[Inman Line]], which disappeared en route from [[Liverpool]] to [[Philadelphia]] in January 1854 with 480 passengers and crew. Based on ideas pioneered by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']] of 1845, ''City of Glasgow'' established that Atlantic steamships could be operated profitably without government subsidy. After a refit in 1852, she was also the first Atlantic steamship to carry [[steerage]] passengers, representing a significant improvement in the conditions experienced by immigrants. In March 1854 ''City of Glasgow'' vanished at sea with no known survivors.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=CR Vernon |year=1957 |title=Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day |place= |publisher=John De Graff |pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and design==
Built by [[John Macgregor#Tod and Macgregor|Tod &amp; Macgregor]] of [[Partick]], [[Glasgow]] and launched on 28 February 1850, ''City of Glasgow'' initially carried 44 first class and 85 second class passengers along with 1,200 tons of cargo. Her iron hull considerably reduced repair costs incurred by the wooden-hulled steamships of the day, and the use of a propeller instead of paddle wheels allowed more space for passengers and cargo. ''City of Glasgow'' was especially economical because she was not built for speed; her best time across the Atlantic was 14 days, 4 hours, almost 4 days longer than [[Cunard Line]]'s [[RMS America Class|''Asia'']], the record holder in 1850. While the ''City of Glasgow's'' two lever-beam engines of 350 horsepower produced a moderate 9.5 knots, her coal consumption was only 20 tons per day, compared with 76 tons for ''Asia''.&lt;ref name=tgas&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=1859 |title=Transactions of the Glasgow Archaeological Society |place= |publisher=James MacNab |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KdIGAAAAYAAJ |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
She made five voyages on the [[Glasgow]] – [[New York City]] service on [[Tod &amp; Macgregor]]'s own account and sailed on her maiden voyage on 15 April 1850. ''City of Glasgow'' was the first steamship to travel from Glasgow to New York. [[William Inman]], a business partner of the line of sailing packets, persuaded his other partners to expand their line by buying the advanced new steamship. On 5 October 1850, she was purchased by the newly formed Liverpool and Philadelphia Steam Ship Company (also known as the Inman Line) and moved to the [[Liverpool]] – [[Philadelphia]] route from 17 December 1850. In 1852, the company entered the immigrant trade and ''City of Glasgow'' was refitted to accommodate an additional 400 third class passengers in her holds.&lt;ref name=gibbs/&gt;

Cabins were available in state rooms from fifteen to twenty one guineas for each berth.  Steerage passengers were charged eight guineas.  Dogs were £3. &lt;ref name = "advert"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Liverpool and Philadelphia Steam-Ship Company's Favourite Iron Screw Steam Ships |work=Liverpool Mercury |date=17 March 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000081/18540317/007/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss at Sea==
''City of Glasgow'' left Liverpool on the 1 March 1854, with 480 people on board.  There were 111 cabin and saloon passengers and 293 in steerage.  Her crew was 76; 5 Captain and officers, 1 surgeon, 1 purser, 4 engineers, 6 firemen, 5 coal trimmers, 19 stewards and waiters, 1 stewardess, 1 quartermaster and 30 able seamen.  She sailed under Captain K. Morrison.  This was his first voyage in command, but he had served as her chief officer for many months before.  He was reported to have considerable experience in navigating the Atlantic. &lt;ref name = "report"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Missing City of Glasgow Steamer |work=Sheffield Independent |date=13 May 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000181/18540513/051/0011| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was due to return from Philadelphia on the 25th March 1854.&lt;ref name=advert/&gt;

No word was received from the ship after she left Liverpool. Her sister ship the ''City of Manchester'' met many icebergs and large fields of ice on her journey from Philadelphia on the 8 March.  Other ships reported that the ice was greater than had been witnessed for many years.  Large icebergs and fields of ice were in the course that the steamers usually used. &lt;ref name = "report"/&gt; When news of her delay reached the ship's owners, they issued a report stating that they felt the ship had been detained in the ice. She was well supplied with water, coal and provisions. &lt;ref name = "opinion"&gt;{{cite news |title=The City of Glasgow Screw Steamer |work=Liverpool Mercury |page=8 |date=25 April 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000081/18540425/035/0008| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of May 1854 she was accepted as lost.  The ship and her cargo was insured for £50,000. &lt;ref name = "standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=The City of Glasgow Screw Steam-Ship |work=London Evening Standard |page=2 |date=29 May 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000183/18540529/023/0002| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her fate remains a mystery.&lt;ref name="Transatlantic by Stephen Fox"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Stephen |year=2003 |title=Transatlantic |place= |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=182–184 |isbn=0-06095549-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newspapers of the day reported various sightings of the ship, but these were often contradictory. For example, the Captain of the ''Baldaur'' spotted a large steamer with a list to port on the 21 April, &lt;ref name=report/&gt; however he asserted was "unlike that ill-fated vessel".&lt;ref name = "baldaur"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Steamer City of Glasgow |work=Liverpool Mercury |page=6 |date= 30 May 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000081/18540530/014/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''Mary Morris'' came upon the hull of large iron vessel that was apparently Clyde built and thought to be of the ''City of Glasgow''. &lt;ref name = "brighton"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Missing Steamship City of Glasgow |work=Brighton Gazette |page=6 |date= 19 October 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000938/18541019/129/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the owners of the ''City of Glasgow'' ascertained that this was in fact the ''Shannon'' from Glasgow to Montreal.  &lt;ref name = "marymorris"&gt;{{cite news |title=Omnium |work=Worcestershire Chronicle |page=7 |date= 25 October 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000350/18541025/035/0007| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was reported that a portion of the bow of a ship, bearing the name ''City of Glasgow'' in gilded letters, washed ashore at Ballochgair near [[Campbeltown]] on 25 October 1854.&lt;ref name=tgas/&gt;  &lt;ref name = "nairnshire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wreck of the City of Glasgow|work=Nairnshire Telegraph and General Advertiser for the Northern Counties |page=2 |date= 9 November 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001194/18541109/015/0002| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However another ship called ''City of Glasgow'' at 416 tons had sailed from the Clyde under Muir towards Calcutta at the end of October.  She may have been caught in late gales in the area but continued on her way.  Lloyd's List reported a head-board been found with ''City of Glasgow'' on it in [[Kilbrannan Sound]] around the same time.  This may be related to the Campbeltown find. &lt;ref name = "lloyds"&gt;{{cite news |title=Glasgow, 2nd Nov.|work=Lloyd's List |page=4 |date= 3 November 1854 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000861/18541103/068/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Santa Fe courthouse ghost''' event was a purported [[ghost]] sighted on a video captured by a security camera at a [[courthouse]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] on June 15, 2007. Once the "ghost video" was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] it quickly attracted widespread attention and many improbable suggestions as to its origin. [[Benjamin Radford]], a managing editor of ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' investigated the sighting and concluded that the origin of the ghost was nothing more than a bug crawling across the camera lens.

==Details of the event==

[[File:Santa Fe Courthouse.jpg|thumb|right|The front entrace of the Santa Fe Courthouse]]On Friday, June 15, 2007, a bright, round object was recorded by a [[surveillance]] camera moving around in the image of the rear entrance of the First Judicial District courthouse, Catron Street, Santa Fe. The recording, starting at 7:27:11 a.m., shows a bright spot of light that comes into view at the top right hand corner of the image before moving downwards and out of the cameras field of view in the bottom left hand side of the image at 7:27:23 a.m.{{R|newmexican}} After Jason Auslander of ''[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]]'' reported on the event and uploaded the footage to Youtube it was picked up by various news outlets such as ''[[ABC News]]'', ''[[CBS News]]'', ''[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and promptly became a topic of discussion all over the country.{{R|csicop}} 

Soon after the footage was released to the public, a large number of people contacted the ''Santa Fe New Mexican'' and Auslander proposing various theories on what the object was.{{R|newmexican2}} Some thought the object might be ball lightning, others were convinced they could see a face in the image.{{R|newmexican2}} One woman who claimed to be a [[Psychic reading|spiritual reader]] said she saw five separate spirits in the video and another person advised the journalist to consult a "[[Mediumship|reputable channeler]]".{{R|newmexican2}} ''The New Mexican'' website logged thousands of hits for the video. The video was later uploaded to [[YouTube]] and was viewed more than 50,000 times within a couple of days, reaching the top 15 videos on the site at that time.{{R|newmexican3}} This drew hundreds of additional e-mails from people to the news outlet.{{R|sciencedaily}}

Many predictions were made about the real identity of the mysterious object within the staff of the courthouse as well.{{R|newmexican}} Some people supposed that it was the ghost of convicted murderer Andy Lopez, who was shot and killed at the courthouse after taking nine people hostage in February 1985.{{R|newmexican}} Other [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] predictions included a spirit of a little girl who was lost and a different ghost who had been disturbed by the construction of a convention centre across the street.{{R|newmexican}} However, some more realistic [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] from the courthouse staff were that it might be a [[Populus fremontii|cottonwood seed]], someone walking with a light on their head, an [[insect]] or [[spider]] walking on the camera lens or a [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], perhaps from a passing car.{{R|newmexican}} Vanessa Pacheco, who was the supervisor of the court security for the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office, said people’s opinions on the video depended on whether they believe in ghosts.{{R|newmexican2}}

==Investigation and explanation==

[[File:Camera at the Santa Fe courthouse which recorded a ghostly image.jpg|thumb|right|The camera at the Santa Fe courthouse which recorded the ghostly image]][[Benjamin Radford]], the deputy editor of ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' science magazine, a ''LiveScience'' [[columnist]] and author of hundreds of articles and several books on science, [[Skeptical movement|skepticism]], and the [[paranormal]], was invited at the request of ''The New Mexican'' to do research on the phenomenon.{{R|livescience}} After the first day of his investigation he had ruled out a number of potential causes including camera artefacts, reflections and hoaxes.{{R|livescience}} Of the chances of the image being a hoax he said ''"It was almost certainly not a hoax, because it’s unlikely anyone would think to make a blurry, indistinguishable blob on a courthouse surveillance video"''.{{R|livescience}} Having investigated many similar ghost videos of this type, he said that ''"the quality of the image is often inversely proportional to the belief that the object is a ghost; the fuzzier and more ambiguous the form, the more likely a ghost will be offered as an explanation"''.{{R|livescience}} 

He believed the undetermined object was most likely a fluffy cottonwood seed or a spider or insect crawling across the camera lens.{{R|newmexican3}} To find out what lay behind the mystery, he conducted two sets of experiments, one by scattering [[cotton]] from the adjacent cottonwood tree and one by using insects.{{R|mysterious}} The first experiment involved collecting cottonwood fluff from a nearby tree and blowing it into the air in front of the camera using a [[Blowgun|blow tube]]. This proved to be inconclusive since the image cotton didn’t represent a glowing fluffy ball the same as the one in the original recording.{{R|livescience}} 

The second experiment using bugs, in the end, was more successful. Radford originally tried to coax a small moth to fly in front of the camera lens but was unsuccessful.{{R|newmexican3}} He then purchased 1,750 [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]] from a local supplier and came back to next day at 7:00am hoping to get a result using the same lighting conditions as when the event was originally recorded.{{R|foxnews}}{{R|livescience}} After placing the bugs on the camera he waited a while to let them crawl all over it before going inside to review the recording.{{R|livescience}} Initially the bugs didn't appear to create the same glowing image as was first recorded but at 7:26am they finally had success.{{R|mysterious}} The sun hit one of the bugs crawling across the lens and the effect recreated an accurate "ghost" down to its color, size, shape and movement.{{R|csicop}} The courthouse staff watching the recording agreed that the mystery had been solved thoroughly and the origin of the ghost was nothing more than a bug.{{R|csicop}} A detailed report on Radford’s experiments was published in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine's September/October issue that year, and in 2014 in Radford's book [[Mysterious New Mexico]].{{R|csicop}}{{R|mysterious}}[[File:Investigator Benjamin Radford conducting experiments on a courthouse camera.jpg|thumb|right|Investigator Benjamin Radford conducting experiments on the courthouse camera]]

'''Snowman''' (February 29, 1948 – September 24, 1974) was a former [[working animal|plow horse]] of mixed breed ancestry, possibly a cross of Quarter Horse, Morgan, and various draft horse types. He was purchased for $80.00 on his way to a [[horse slaughter|slaughterhouse]] and became a champion in [[show jumping]] in the United States during the 1950s. During his career he was known as "The Cinderella Horse" due to his "rags to riches" story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowman|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83453147|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowman was originally used for farm work and in 1956 was headed for the [[slaughterhouse]] at eight years of age. On that day, Harry de Leyer, a [[Long Island, New York]], riding instructor, attended the horse auction in New Holland, Pennsylvania, looking for school horses. He arrived late, and the only remaining horses were those waiting to be loaded into trucks bound for slaughter plants. De Leyer made eye contact with a large gray&lt;!--Snowman was a gray horse whose coat had become completely white due to age.  He was not a genetically “white” horse. Do not change this--&gt; horse that he purchased for $80. He first used Snowman as a lesson horse for children. De Leyer recognized talent in the horse after he sold him to a neighbor and the horse jumped high fences to return home. De Leyer then began training Snowman as a show jumper.

The horse began winning prestigious classes only two years after he was bought off the slaughter truck, and his career lasted five years. He was photographed performing unusual feats such as jumping over other horses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showjumpinghalloffame.net/gfx/sjhf_inductees/snowman2.jpg Show Jumping Hall of Fame] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611093706/http://www.showjumpinghalloffame.net/gfx/sjhf_inductees/snowman2.jpg |date=June 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his calm disposition made him a favorite. He once won a [[leadline]] class and an open jumper championship on the same day.

Snowman also appeared on television shows ([[Johnny Carson]]'s for one, where Carson climbed on his back). He was the subject of two books, had his own fan club, and was flown abroad for "guest appearances".

De Leyer kept Snowman through his retirement until the animal was [[euthanasia|euthanized]] in the fall of 1974 due to complications from kidney failure at the age of twenty-six.

Snowman was inducted into the [[United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame]] in 1992. In 2005, Snowman was made into a [[Breyer horse]] model on the Gem Twist mold, which is no longer manufactured. In 2013, Snowman was again introduced in the Breyer line on the Idocus mold. The 2013 model box reads "Snowman - Show Jumping Hall of Famer".

Snowman is the subject of the book, ''The Eighty Dollar Champion: Snowman, the Horse That Inspired a Nation'', by [[Elizabeth Letts]], published by [[Random House]] in 2011, a No. 1 ''New York Times'' bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Ihsan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2013-06-02/e-book-nonfiction/list.html |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |website=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayden |first=Erik |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-acquires-bestselling-book-eighty-671845 |title=MGM Acquires Best-Selling Book 'Eighty-Dollar Champion' (Exclusive) |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A documentary movie was made in 2016, ''Harry &amp; Snowman'', that features original footage of his years as an equestrian family member as well as a show ring competitor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/movies/harry-snowman-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; Snowman was featured in season 21, episode 8 of ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel Channel Schedule|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/tv-schedule.2018.09.26.CST|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Summerland''' is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater" /&gt; [[Wicca]]ns and some earth-based [[Modern paganism|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-summerland-2562874| title=What is the Summerland?|author=Patti Wigington|date=March 19, 2018|publisher=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesterbear.com/Wicca/FAQsummerland.html|title=FAQ:What is the Summerland? Do you think it is a real place?|author=Myth Woodling|date=March 23, 2014|work=Yet Another Wicca...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary|Summerland}}

==History of the concept==
[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'', to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of human spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or 'sphere', of the afterlife we can hope to enter.

[[C.W. Leadbeater]], a Theosophist, also taught that those who were good in their previous earthly [[incarnation]] went to a place called Summerland between incarnations.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W  ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy==
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the [[Astral plane]] Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. 

Theosophists believe the Summerlands are maintained by hosts of [[Deva (New Age)|planetary angels]] serving [[Sanat Kumara]], the [[Nordic alien]] from [[Venusians|Venus]] who Theosophists believe is the governing [[deity]] of Earth and leader of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth. Sanat Kumara is believed to rule over our planet from the [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] of [[Shamballa]], believed by Theosophists to exist on the etheric plane (a plane between the [[physical plane]] and the astral plane), about five miles (8 km) above the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt;

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the [[Mental plane]] Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations — only those souls that are more highly developed [[Spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, i.e., those souls that are at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|first, second, and third levels of initiation]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt;

The final permanent eternal afterlife heaven to which Theosophists believe most people will go millions or billions of years in the future, after our cycle of reincarnations in this [[Round (Theosophy)|Round]] is over, is called [[Nirvana]], and is located beyond this physical [[Cosmos]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt; In order to attain Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fourth level of initiation]] or higher, meaning one is an ''[[arhat]]'' and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

The '''thermal time hypothesis''' is a possible solution to the [[problem of time]] in classical and quantum theory as has been put forward by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Alain Connes]]. Physical time flow is modeled as a fundamental property of the theory, a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Connes, C. Rovelli, "Von Neumann Algebra Automorphisms and Time-Thermodynamics Relation in General Covariant Quantum Theories", ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' 11:2899–2918, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Generally covariant]] theories do not have a notion of a distinguished [[physical time]] with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.

'''William III''' ({{lang-nl|Willem}}; 4 November 1650 – 8 March 1702),&lt;ref name=OSNS/&gt; also widely known as '''William of Orange''', was sovereign [[Prince of Orange]] from birth, [[Stadtholder]] of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Overijssel]] in the [[Dutch Republic]] from 1672 and King of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] from 1689 until his death in 1702. As King of Scotland, he is known as '''William II'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_03_revolution.html|title=Act of Union 1707, the Revolution in Scotland|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 August 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080615023245/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_03_revolution.html| archivedate = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes informally known in [[Northern Ireland]] and Scotland as "'''King Billy'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Varieties of Cultural History |author=Peter Burke |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1997 |page=51 |isbn=0-8014-8492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William inherited the [[principality of Orange]] from his father, [[William II, Prince of Orange|William II]], who died a week before William's birth. His mother, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]], was the daughter of King [[Charles I of England]]. In 1677, he married his fifteen-year-old first cousin, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], the daughter of his maternal uncle [[James, Duke of York]].

A [[Protestant]], William participated in several wars against the powerful [[Catholic]] King of France, [[Louis XIV]], in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith. In 1685, William's Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James, became king of England, Scotland and Ireland. James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain. William, supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, invaded England in what became known as the "[[Glorious Revolution]]". On 5 November 1688, he landed at the southern English port of [[Brixham]]. James was deposed and William and Mary became joint sovereigns in his place. William and Mary reigned together until Mary's death on 28 December 1694, after which William ruled as sole monarch.

William's reputation as a staunch Protestant enabled him to take power in Britain when many were fearful of a revival of Catholicism under James. William's victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 is still [[The Twelfth|commemorated]] by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] in Northern Ireland and Scotland. His reign in Britain marked the beginning of the transition from the personal rule of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] to the more Parliament-centred rule of the [[House of Hanover]].

==Early life==

===Birth and family===
[[File:Portret van Willem II (1626-50), prins van Oranje, en zijn echtgenote Maria Stuart (1631-60) Rijksmuseum SK-A-871.jpeg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Mary, Princess Royal, in a yellow gown and William II in a black suit|upright|William's parents, [[William II, Prince of Orange]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]], 1647]]

William III was born in [[The Hague]] in the [[Dutch Republic]] on 4 November 1650.&lt;ref name=OSNS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Baptised William Henry ({{lang-nl|Willem Hendrik}}), he was the only child of [[stadtholder]] [[William II, Prince of Orange]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]]. Mary was the eldest daughter of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland]] and sister of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and [[King James II and VII]].

Eight days before William was born, his father died of [[smallpox]]; thus William was the Sovereign [[Prince of Orange]] from the moment of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately, a conflict ensued between his mother the [[Princess Royal]] and William II's mother, [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], over the name to be given to the infant. Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother, but her mother-in-law insisted on giving him the name William or ''Willem'' to bolster his prospects of becoming stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26; van der Zee, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; William II had appointed his wife as his son's guardian in his will; however, the document remained unsigned at William II's death and was void.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 1651, the ''[[Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland]]'' (Supreme Court) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother, his paternal grandmother and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], whose wife, [[Louise Henriette of Nassau|Louise Henriette]], was William II's eldest sister.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26–27. The Prussian prince was chosen because he could act as a neutral party mediating between the two women, but also because as a possible heir he was interested in protecting the Orange family fortune, which Amalia feared Mary would squander.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and education===
William's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 5–6; Troost, 27&lt;/ref&gt; William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard&lt;ref name=t3437/&gt; and the Scottish noblewoman, Lady [[Anna Mackenzie]].&lt;ref name=odnbanna&gt;Rosalind K. Marshall, 'Mackenzie, Anna, countess of Balcarres and countess of Argyll (c.1621–1707)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4467, accessed 29 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the [[Reformed churches|Reformed religion]] from the [[Calvinist]] preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the [[Franciscus Gomarus|Contra-Remonstrant]] theologian [[Gisbertus Voetius]].&lt;ref name=t3437&gt;Troost, 34–37&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal education for William was described in ''Discours sur la nourriture de S. H. Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange'', a short treatise, perhaps by one of William's tutors, [[Constantijn Huygens]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 27. The author may also have been [[Johan van den Kerckhoven]]. ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; In these lessons, the prince was taught that he was [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] to become an instrument of [[Divine Providence]], fulfilling the historical destiny of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan davids de heem-fleurs avec portrait guillaume III d'Orange.jpg|thumb|The young prince portrayed by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] and [[Jan Vermeer van Utrecht]] within a flower garland filled with symbols of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], c. 1660]]

From early 1659, William spent seven years at the [[University of Leiden]] for a formal education, under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik Bornius (though never officially enrolling as a student).&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; While residing in the ''Prinsenhof'' at [[Delft]], William had a small personal retinue including [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]], and a new governor, [[Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein]], who (as an illegitimate son of stadtholder [[Frederick Henry of Orange]]) was his paternal uncle.

[[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and his uncle [[Cornelis de Graeff]] pushed the [[States of Holland]] to take charge of William's education and ensure that he would acquire the skills to serve in a future—though undetermined—state function; the States acted on 25 September 1660.&lt;ref name=troost43&gt;Troost, 43&lt;/ref&gt; This first involvement of the authorities did not last long. On 23 December 1660, when William was ten years old, his mother died of [[smallpox]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], London, while visiting her brother, the recently restored [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name=troost43/&gt; In her will, Mary requested that Charles look after William's interests, and Charles now demanded that the States of Holland end their interference.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; To appease Charles, they complied on 30 September 1661.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 44&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Zuylenstein began to work for Charles and induced William to write letters to his uncle asking him to help William become stadtholder someday.&lt;ref name=troost49&gt;Troost, 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his mother's death, William's education and guardianship became a point of contention between [[Orangism (Netherlands)|his dynasty's supporters]] and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues, but in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] one of Charles's peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; As a countermeasure in 1666, when William was sixteen, the States officially made him a ward of the government, or a "Child of State".&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; All pro-English courtiers, including Zuylenstein, were removed from William's company.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; William begged De Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay, but he refused.&lt;ref name=vdk14&gt;Van der Kiste, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt, the leading politician of the Republic, took William's education into his own hands, instructing him weekly in state matters and joining him for regular games of [[real tennis]].&lt;ref name=vdk14/&gt;

===Exclusion from stadtholdership===
{{Main article|First Stadtholderless Period}}

After the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant.&lt;ref&gt;In the province of [[Friesland]] that office was filled by William's uncle-by-marriage [[William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the demand of [[Oliver Cromwell]], the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]], which ended the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], had a secret annexe that required the [[Act of Seclusion]], which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[English Restoration]], the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for very long, was declared void as the [[English Commonwealth]] (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed.&lt;ref name=troost41&gt;Troost, 41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, Mary and Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.&lt;ref name=troost41/&gt;

In 1667, as William III approached the age of 18, the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangist party]] again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and [[Captain-General]]. To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange, De Witt, the leader of the [[Dutch States Party|States Party]], allowed the [[pensionary]] of [[Haarlem]], [[Gaspar Fagel]], to induce the States of Holland to issue the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)|Perpetual Edict]].&lt;ref name=troost52&gt;Troost, 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict declared that the Captain-General or Admiral-General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; Even so, William's supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige and, on 19 September 1668, the [[States of Zeeland]] appointed him as ''First Noble''.&lt;ref name=vdk16&gt;Van der Kiste, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; To receive this honour, William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to [[Middelburg]].&lt;ref name=vdk16/&gt; A month later, Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of Holland, the centre of anti-Orangism, abolished the office of stadtholder and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670, establishing the so-called "Harmony".&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland [[regenten|regent]] (city council member) to uphold the Edict; all but one complied.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; William saw all this as a defeat, but the arrangement was a compromise: De Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely, but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the ''[[Council of State of the Netherlands|Raad van State]]'', the Council of State, then the [[Generality (Netherlands)|generality]] organ administering the defence budget.&lt;ref name=troost59&gt;Troost, 59&lt;/ref&gt; William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting rights, despite De Witt's attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with republicans===
In November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859&amp;nbsp;[[Dutch guilder|guilder]] debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange.&lt;ref name=troost62&gt;Troost, 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders.&lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated [[Calvinist]] and patriotic Dutchman, and reconsidered his desire to show him the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as "sovereign" of a Dutch [[rump state]].&lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles, Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Republic's security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo-French attack became imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the threat, the States of [[Gelderland]] wanted William to be appointed Captain-General of the [[Dutch States Army]] as soon as possible, despite his youth and inexperience.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 65&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1671, the States of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] made this their official policy.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 66&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 1672, the States of [[Holland]] made a counterproposal: to appoint William for just a single campaign.&lt;ref name=troost67&gt;Troost, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached: an appointment by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] for one summer, followed by a permanent appointment on his 22nd birthday.&lt;ref name=troost67/&gt;

Meanwhile, William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States to appoint William stadtholder.&lt;ref name=troost65&gt;Troost, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; In return, William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles's interests as much as his "honour and the loyalty due to this state" allowed.&lt;ref name=troost65/&gt; Charles took no action on the proposal, and continued his war plans with his French ally.

==Becoming stadtholder==

==="Disaster year": 1672===
{{Main article|Rampjaar}}
[[File:Johannes Voorhout - Willem III te paard -1670-2.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait by [[Johannes Voorhout]]]]

For the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous. It became known as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' ("disaster year"), because in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, [[Bishopric of Münster|Münster]], and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]]. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the [[Battle of Solebay]], in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the [[Dutch Water Line]] on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 74&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis XIV of France]], believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible.&lt;ref name=troost78&gt;Troost, 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies.&lt;ref name=troost78/&gt;

On 4 July, the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder, and he took the oath five days later.&lt;ref name=troost76&gt;Troost, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a special envoy from Charles II, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], met with William in [[Nieuwerbrug]] and presented a proposal from Charles. In return for William's capitulation to England and France, Charles would make William Sovereign Prince of Holland, instead of stadtholder (a mere civil servant).&lt;ref name=troost80&gt;Troost, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; When William refused, Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the Republic's existence.&lt;ref name=troost80/&gt; William answered famously: "There is one way to avoid this: to die defending it in the last ditch." On 7 July, the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked. On 16 July, Zeeland offered the stadtholderate to William.&lt;ref name=troost76/&gt;

Johan de Witt had been unable to function as [[Grand Pensionary]] after being wounded by an attempt on his life on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 75&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August, William published a letter from Charles, in which the English king stated that he had made war because of the aggression of the De Witt faction.&lt;ref name=troost85&gt;Troost, 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The people thus incited, De Witt and his brother, [[Cornelis de Witt|Cornelis]], were [[Johan de Witt#Year of Disaster|brutally murdered]] by an Orangist [[civil militia]] in The Hague on 20 August.&lt;ref name=troost85/&gt; Subsequently, William replaced many of the Dutch regents with his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recapture of Naarden by William III in 1673 -Belegeringe der Stadt Naerden (Romeyn de Hooghe).jpg|thumb|left|Recapture of [[Naarden]] by William of Orange in 1673]]

Though William's complicity in the lynching has never been proved (and some 19th-century Dutch historians have made an effort to disprove that he was an accessory) he thwarted attempts to prosecute the ringleaders, and even rewarded some, like [[Hendrik Verhoeff]], with money, and others, like [[Johan van Banchem]] and [[Johan Kievit]], with high offices.&lt;ref&gt;Rowen, H. H. (1986) ''John de Witt: Statesman of the "true Freedom"'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-52708-2}}, p. 222; Nijhoff, D. C. (1893) ''Staatkundige Geschiedenis van Nederland. Tweede Deel'', pp. 92–93, and fn.4 p. 92; [[Robert Fruin|Fruin, Robert]], [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_gid001186701_01/_gid001186701_01_0008.php "De schuld van Willem III en zijn vrienden aan den moord der gebroeders de Witt"], in ''De Gids'' (1867), pp. 201–218&lt;/ref&gt; This damaged his reputation in the same fashion as his later [[Massacre of Glencoe|actions at Glencoe]].

William continued to fight against the invaders from England and France, allying himself with Spain and [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. In November 1672, he took his army to [[Maastricht]] to threaten the French supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 122&lt;/ref&gt; By 1673, the Dutch situation further improved. Although Louis took Maastricht and William's attack against [[Charleroi]] failed, [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]] defeated the Anglo-French fleet three times, forcing Charles to end England's involvement by the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]; after 1673, France slowly withdrew from Dutch territory (with the exception of Maastricht), while making gains elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagel now proposed to treat the liberated provinces of Utrecht, Gelderland and [[Overijssel]] as conquered territory ([[Generality Lands]]), as punishment for their quick surrender to the enemy.&lt;ref name=troost106&gt;Troost, 106–110&lt;/ref&gt; William refused but obtained a special mandate from the States General to appoint all delegates in the States of these provinces anew.&lt;ref name=troost106/&gt; William's followers in the States of Utrecht on 26 April 1674 appointed him hereditary stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 109&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 1675, the States of Gelderland offered him the titles of Duke of Guelders and Count of [[Zutphen]].&lt;ref name=troost109&gt;Troost, 109–112&lt;/ref&gt; The negative reactions to this from Zeeland and the city of Amsterdam made William ultimately decide to decline these honours; he was instead appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and Overijssel.&lt;ref name=troost109/&gt;

===Marriage===
[[File:Lely Queen Mary II.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Mary with brown hair and in a blue-and-gray dress|William married his first cousin, the future [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], in 1677.]]

During the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin [[Mary II of England|Mary]], elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; Charles relented, and Bishop [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]] married the couple on 4 November 1677.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but [[miscarried]]. After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, 86–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout William and Mary's marriage, William had only one reputed mistress, [[Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney|Elizabeth Villiers]], in contrast to the many mistresses his uncles openly kept.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace with France, intrigue with England===
By 1678, Louis sought peace with the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 141–145&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, tensions remained: William remained very suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired "Universal Kingship" over Europe; Louis described William as "my mortal enemy" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger. France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the ''[[Chambers of Reunion|Réunion]]'' policy) and the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, caused a surge of [[Huguenot]] refugees to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] (an anti-French coalition that also included the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 156–163&lt;/ref&gt;

After his marriage in November 1677, William became a strong candidate for the English throne should his father-in-law (and uncle) James be excluded because of his Catholicism. During the crisis concerning the [[Exclusion Bill]] in 1680, Charles at first invited William to come to England to bolster the king's position against the exclusionists, then withdrew his invitation—after which [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] also tried unsuccessfully to bring William over, but now to put pressure on Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, William secretly induced the States General to send Charles the "Insinuation", a plea beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James.&lt;ref name=troost152&gt;Troost, 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James, William denied any involvement.&lt;ref name=troost152/&gt;

In 1685, when James II succeeded Charles, William at first attempted a conciliatory approach, at the same time trying not to offend the Protestants in England.&lt;ref name=troost173&gt;Troost, 173–175&lt;/ref&gt; William, ever looking for ways to diminish the power of France, hoped that James would join the League of Augsburg, but by 1687 it became clear that James would not join the anti-French alliance.&lt;ref name=troost173/&gt; Relations worsened between William and James thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 180–183&lt;/ref&gt; In November, James's second wife, [[Mary of Modena]], was announced to be pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 189&lt;/ref&gt; That month, to gain the favour of English Protestants, William wrote an [[open letter]] to the English people in which he disapproved of James's pro-Roman Catholic policy of religious toleration. Seeing him as a friend, and often having maintained secret contacts with him for years, many English politicians began to urge an armed invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of England===
[[File:The Arrival of William III.jpg|alt=sepia-toned allegorical engraving representing William III's arrival at Tor Bay|thumb|''The Arrival of William III'' by Sir [[James Thornhill]]. William landed in England on 5 November ([[Guy Fawkes night|Guy Fawkes]] day), a day already special in the Protestant calendar.]]

William at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Troost, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Claydon | first = Tony|origyear= September 2004|edition=online|date=May 2008|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29450|title=William III and II (1650–1702) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 August 2008}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Arthur Herbert]] that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade.&lt;ref name= troost191&gt;Troost, 191&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, bore a son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 191; van der Kiste, 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Public anger also increased because of the trial of [[seven bishops]] who had publicly opposed James's [[Declaration of Indulgence]] granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 1688—the same day the bishops were acquitted—a group of political figures, known afterward as the "[[Immortal Seven]]", sent William a [[invitation to William|formal invitation]].&lt;ref name= troost191 /&gt; William's intentions to invade were public knowledge by September 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 193–196&lt;/ref&gt; With a Dutch army, William landed at [[Brixham]] in southwest England on 5 November 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 200–203; van der Kiste, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; He came ashore from the ship ''[[Brielle|Brill]]'', proclaiming "the liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain". William's fleet was vastly larger than the Spanish Armada 100 years earlier: approximately 250 carrier ships and 60 fishing boats carried 35,000 men, including 11,000-foot and 4,000 horse soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 105; Machiel Bosman, "De Roofkoning. Prins Willem III en de invasie van Engeland" (2016), pages 156, 214–16. The Spanish Armada counted 130 ships and 25,000 men&lt;/ref&gt; James's support began to dissolve almost immediately upon William's arrival; [[List of James II deserters to William of Orange|Protestant officers defected from the English army]] (the most notable of whom was [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill of Eyemouth]], James's most able commander), and influential noblemen across the country declared their support for the invader.&lt;ref name=troost204&gt;Troost, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

James at first attempted to resist William, but saw that his efforts would prove futile.&lt;ref name=troost204/&gt; He sent representatives to negotiate with William, but secretly attempted to flee on 11/21 December, throwing the [[Great Seal of England|Great Seal]] into the [[Thames]] on his way.&lt;ref name= troost205&gt;Troost, 205–207&lt;/ref&gt; He was discovered and brought back to London by a group of fishermen.&lt;ref name= troost205 /&gt; He was allowed to escape to France in a second attempt on 23 December.&lt;ref name= troost205 /&gt; William permitted James to leave the country, not wanting to make him a [[martyr]] for the Roman Catholic cause; it was in his interests for James to be perceived as having left the country of his own accord, rather than having been forced or frightened into fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, 242–246; Miller, 208&lt;/ref&gt; William is the last person to successfully invade England by force of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dutch role in the Glorious Revolution | first = Jonathan | last = Israel |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=105 |isbn= 0-521-39075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclaimed king===
[[File:King William III by Thomas Murray.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait attributed to [[Thomas Murray (artist)|Thomas Murray]], c. 1690]]

William summoned a [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] in England, which met on 22 January 1689,&lt;ref name=legit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacobite.ca/essays/ruvigny.htm |title=Legitimism in England |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight.&lt;ref name=davies614&gt;Davies, 614–615&lt;/ref&gt; William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere [[King consort|consort]].&lt;ref name=troost207&gt;Troost, 207–210&lt;/ref&gt; The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 469; Israel, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; When the majority of [[Tories (political faction)|Tory]] Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately. Furthermore, Mary, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] majority, quickly resolved that the throne was vacant, and that it was safer if the ruler were Protestant. There were more Tories in the [[House of Lords]], which would not initially agree, but after William refused to be a [[regent]] or to agree to remain king only in his wife's lifetime, there were negotiations between the two houses and the Lords agreed by a narrow majority that the throne was vacant. The Commons made William accept a Bill of Rights,&lt;ref name=legit/&gt; and, on 13 February 1689, Parliament passed the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Declaration of Right]], in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee, had abdicated the government of the realm, thereby leaving the throne vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 210–212&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown was not offered to James's infant son, who would have been the [[heir apparent]] under normal circumstances, but to William and Mary as joint sovereigns.&lt;ref name=troost207/&gt; It was, however, provided that "the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives".&lt;ref name=troost207/&gt;

William and Mary were crowned together at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 11 April 1689 by the [[Bishop of London]], [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]].&lt;ref name=troost219&gt;Troost, 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the coronation is performed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but the Archbishop at the time, [[William Sancroft]], refused to recognise James's removal.&lt;ref name=troost219/&gt;

William also summoned a Convention of the [[Estates of Scotland]], which met on 14 March 1689 and sent a conciliatory letter, while James sent haughty uncompromising orders, swaying a majority in favour of William. On 11 April, the day of the English coronation, the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; William and Mary were offered the Scottish Crown; they accepted on 11 May.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 614–615. William was "William II" of Scotland, for there was only one previous Scottish king named [[William I of Scotland|William]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution settlement===
[[File:William&amp;MaryEngraving1703.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving depicting the king, queen, throne, and arms|upright|Engraving of William III and Mary II, 1703]]
William encouraged the passage of the [[Toleration Act 1689]], which guaranteed [[religious toleration]] to Protestant [[nonconformists]].&lt;ref name=davies614/&gt; It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the [[religious liberty]] of Roman Catholics, [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarians]], and those of non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref name=troost219/&gt; In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.&lt;ref name=vdk114&gt;Van der Kiste, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]], established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the [[right to petition]], raise a [[standing army]] during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the [[right to bear arms]] to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require [[excessive bail]] or inflict [[cruel and unusual punishments]].&lt;ref name=davies614/&gt; William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown. After the death of either William or Mary, the other would continue to reign. Next in the line of succession was Mary II's sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], and her issue, followed by any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage.&lt;ref name=vdk114/&gt; Roman Catholics, as well as those who married Catholics, were excluded.&lt;ref name=vdk114/&gt;

==Rule with Mary II==

===Resistance to validity of rule===

Although most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the [[divine right of kings]], which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament. Over the next 57 years [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] pressed for restoration of James and his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacobite.ca/ |title=The Jacobite Heritage |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjurors]] in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the [[Church of England]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.&lt;ref name=Nonjurors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacobite.ca/essays/nonjurors.htm |title=Nonjurors |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De slag aan de Boyne (Ierland) tussen Jacobus II en Willem III, 12 juli 1690 Rijksmuseum SK-A-605.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of a battle scene|''[[Battle of the Boyne]] between James II and William III, 12 July 1690'', [[Jan van Huchtenburg]]]]

Ireland was controlled by Roman Catholics loyal to James, and [[Jacobitism|Franco-Irish Jacobites]] arrived from France with French forces in March 1689 to join the [[Williamite war in Ireland|war in Ireland]] and contest Protestant resistance at the [[Siege of Derry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Derry.php |title=The Siege of Derry (1688–1689) |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; William sent his navy to the city in July, and his army [[Siege of Carrickfergus|landed in August]]. After progress stalled, William personally intervened to lead his armies to victory over James at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] on 1 July 1690,&lt;ref&gt;Due to the change to the [[Gregorian calendar]], William's victory is commemorated annually by Northern Irish and Scottish Protestants on [[The Twelfth]] of July – cf. Troost, 278–280&lt;/ref&gt; after which James fled back to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Boyne.php |title=The Battle of the Boyne (1689–1690) |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon William's return to England, his close friend [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Dutch General Godert de Ginkell]], who had accompanied William to Ireland and had commanded a body of Dutch cavalry at the Battle of the Boyne, was named Commander in Chief of William's forces in Ireland and entrusted with further conduct of the war there. Ginkell took command in Ireland in the spring of 1691, and following several ensuing battles, succeeded in capturing both [[Galway]] and [[Limerick]], thereby effectively suppressing the Jacobite forces in Ireland within a few more months. After difficult negotiations a [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] was signed on 3 October 1691—the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. Thus concluded the Williamite pacification of Ireland, and for his services the Dutch general received the formal thanks of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and was awarded the title of [[Earl of Athlone]] by the king.

A series of [[Jacobite rising of 1689|Jacobite risings]] also took place in Scotland, where [[John Graham, 1st Viscount of Dundee|Viscount Dundee]] raised Highland forces and won a victory on 27 July 1689 at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]], but he died in the fight and a month later Scottish [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian]] forces subdued the rising at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 270–273&lt;/ref&gt; William offered [[Scottish clan]]s that had taken part in the rising a pardon provided that they signed allegiance by a deadline, and his government in Scotland punished a delay with the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] of 1692, which became infamous in Jacobite propaganda as William had countersigned the orders.&lt;ref name=troost274&gt;Troost, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beebunion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/features_union_restoration2.shtml |title=BBC – History – Scottish History – Restoration and Revolution (II) |work=The Making of the Union |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowing to public opinion, William dismissed those responsible for the massacre, though they still remained in his favour; in the words of the historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|John Dalberg-Acton]], "one became a colonel, another a knight, a third a peer, and a fourth an [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|earl]]."&lt;ref name=troost274/&gt;

William's reputation in Scotland suffered further damage when he refused English assistance to the [[Darien scheme]], a Scottish colony (1698–1700) that failed disastrously.&lt;ref name=beebjac&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/scotland_jacobites_01.shtml |title= BBC – History – British History in depth: The Jacobite Cause |accessdate= 9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliament and faction===
[[File:William III Silver Coin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A silver coin picturing William III and his coat of arms|Silver [[Crown (British coin)|Crown coin]], 1695. The Latin inscription is (obverse) ''GVLIELMVS III DEI GRA[TIA]'' (reverse) ''MAG[NAE] BR[ITANNIAE], FRA[NCIAE], ET HIB[ERNIAE] REX 1695''. English: "William III, By the grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, 1695." The reverse shows the arms, clockwise from top, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, centred on William's personal arms of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].]]

Although the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 221&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; This "balanced" approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 222; van der Zee, 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[English general election, 1690|Parliamentary elections of 1690]], William began to favour the Tories, led by [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Danby]] and [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 223–227&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tories favoured preserving the king's prerogatives, William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 226&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the [[Whig Junto|Junto]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 228–232&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the [[Bank of England]] following the example of the [[Bank of Amsterdam]]. William's decision to grant the [[Royal Charter]] in 1694 to the Bank of England, a private institution owned by bankers, is his most relevant economic legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 129–131&lt;/ref&gt; It laid the financial foundation of the English take-over of the central role of the [[Dutch Republic]] and Bank of Amsterdam in global commerce in the 18th century.

William dissolved Parliament in 1695, and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs. There was a considerable surge in support for William following the exposure of a Jacobite plan to assassinate him in 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament passed a [[bill of attainder]] against the ringleader, [[Sir John Fenwick, 3rd Baronet|John Fenwick]], and he was beheaded in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===War in Europe===
{{Main article|Nine Years' War}}
William continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 239–241; van der Zee, 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg) |Grand Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 241–246&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice. Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 150–158&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at [[Battle of La Hougue |La Hogue]] in 1692, the allies for a short period controlled the seas, and the [[Treaty of Limerick]] (1691) pacified Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 281–283&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe, as William lost [[Namur (city)| Namur]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1692, and the French under the command of the [[François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg | Duke of Luxembourg]] beat him badly at the [[Battle of Landen]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 244–246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Willem III, prins van Oranje, koning van Engeland en stadhouder Rijksmuseum SK-A-367.jpeg|thumb|William III painted in the 1690s by [[Godfried Schalcken]]]]
Mary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, leaving William III to rule alone.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; William deeply mourned his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 180–184&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his conversion to [[Anglicanism]], William's popularity plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 186–192; Troost, 226–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of homosexuality===
During the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Culture and Society in Britain | editor-first = J | editor-last = Black | place = Manchester | year = 1997 | page = 97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]] became [[Earl of Portland]], and [[Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Arnold Joost van Keppel]] was created [[Earl of Albemarle]]. These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships. William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations. Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours,&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 25–26; Van der Zee, 421–423&lt;/ref&gt; while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, and that there was nothing unusual in someone childless like William adopting or evincing paternal affections for a younger man.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 204–205; Baxter, 352; {{Citation | first = James | last = Falkner | contribution = Keppel, Arnold Joost van, first earl of Albemarle (1669/70–1718) | title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the case, Bentinck's closeness to William did arouse jealousies in the Royal Court. William's young protegé, [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Keppel]], aroused more gossip and suspicion, being 20 years William's junior, strikingly handsome, and having risen from being a royal page to an earldom with some ease.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Portland wrote to William in 1697 that "the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man, and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties&amp;nbsp;... make the world say things I am ashamed to hear."&lt;ref name= vdk202&gt;Van der Kiste, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, was "tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations". William tersely dismissed these suggestions, however, saying, "It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal."&lt;ref name=vdk202/&gt;

===Peace with France===
[[File:Lord Justices of England.jpg|alt=Black and white depiction of six small portraits arrayed in a circle around a larger portrait|thumb|left|Engraving from 1695 showing the [[Lord Justices]] who administered the kingdom while William was on campaign]]
In 1696, the Dutch territory of [[Drenthe]] made William its Stadtholder. In the same year, [[Jacobite assassination plot 1696|Jacobites plotted]] to assassinate William III in an attempt to restore James to the English throne, but failed. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] (20 September 1697), which ended the [[Nine Years' War]], Louis recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 251&lt;/ref&gt; Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.

As his life drew towards its conclusion, William, like many other European rulers, felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[New World]]. The King of Spain, [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], was an invalid with no prospect of having children; amongst his closest relatives were Louis XIV (the King of France) and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch, for he feared that such a calamity would upset the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. William and Louis XIV agreed to the [[First Partition Treaty]], which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire: [[Joseph Ferdinand, Electoral Prince of Bavaria]], would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 253–255&lt;/ref&gt; Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir, and war appeared to be averted.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Louis XIV of France, standing, wearing an ermine robed faced with fleur-de-lis|[[Louis XIV of France]] was William's lifelong enemy.]]

When, however, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox, the issue re-opened. In 1700, the two rulers agreed to the [[Treaty of London, 1700|Second Partition Treaty]] (also called the Treaty of London), under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=troost256&gt;Troost, 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish, who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor, to whom the Italian territories were much more useful than the other lands.&lt;ref name=troost256/&gt; Unexpectedly, the invalid King of Spain, Charles II, interfered as he lay dying in late 1700.&lt;ref name=troost258&gt;Troost, 258–260&lt;/ref&gt; Unilaterally, he willed all Spanish territories to [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], a grandson of Louis XIV. The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance.&lt;ref name=troost258/&gt; Furthermore, Louis XIV alienated William III by recognising [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the son of the former King James II who had died in 1701, as ''de jure'' King of England.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 260&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent conflict, known as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], continued until 1713.

===English succession===
The Spanish inheritance was not the only one that concerned William. His marriage with Mary had not yielded any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of her last surviving child, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 234&lt;/ref&gt; As the complete exhaustion of the line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would be inherited by a distant relative, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James I]], and her Protestant heirs.&lt;ref name=troost235&gt;Troost, 235&lt;/ref&gt; The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia. The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia.&lt;ref name=troost235/&gt;

In 1702, William died of [[pneumonia]], a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel. The horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; Because his horse had stumbled into a [[mole (animal)|mole's]] burrow, many Jacobites toasted "the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 255&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, [[Winston Churchill]], in his ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', stated that the fall "opened the door to a troop of lurking foes".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; William was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] alongside his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/royalty/12322|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106223703/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/royalty/12322|archivedate=6 January 2008|title=William III|publisher=Westminster Abbey Official site|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister-in-law, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], became [[queen regnant]] of England, Scotland and Ireland.

William's death brought an end to the Dutch [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]], members of which had served as stadtholder of Holland and the majority of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic since the time of [[William the Silent]] (William I). The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel—all suspended the office after his death. Thus, he was the last [[agnatic|patrilineal]] descendant of William I to be named stadtholder for the majority of the provinces. Under William III's will, [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso]] stood to inherit the Principality of Orange as well as several lordships in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 959–960&lt;/ref&gt; He was William's closest agnatic relative, as well as son of William's aunt [[Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau|Albertine Agnes]]. However, King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] also claimed the Principality as the senior [[Primogeniture|cognatic]] heir, his mother [[Countess Louise Henriette of Nassau|Louise Henriette]] being Albertine Agnes's older sister.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 962, 968&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), Frederick I's successor, [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], ceded his territorial claim to King [[Louis XIV of France]], keeping only a claim to the title. Friso's posthumous son, [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]], succeeded to the title at his birth in 1711; in the [[Treaty of Partition]] (1732) he agreed to share the title "Prince of Orange" with Frederick William.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 991–992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/berlin1732.htm|title=Text of the Treaty of Partition|language=French|publisher=Heraldica|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William's primary achievement was to contain France when it was in a position to impose its will across much of Europe. His life's aim was largely to oppose [[Louis XIV of France]]. This effort continued after his death during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Another important consequence of William's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], [[James I of England|James I]], in 1603. The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the [[English Civil War]] during the 1640s and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref name=claydon3&gt;Claydon, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; During William's reign, however, the conflict was settled in Parliament's favour by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Triennial Act 1694]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref name=claydon3/&gt;

New York City was briefly renamed New Orange for him in 1673 after the Dutch recaptured the city, which had been renamed New York by the British in 1665. His name was applied to the [[Fort Amsterdam|fort]] and administrative centre for the city on two separate occasions reflecting his different sovereign status—first as Fort Willem Hendrick in 1673, and then as Fort William in 1691 when the English evicted Colonists who had seized the fort and city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03046437&amp;id=Jvy84lE_tHoC&amp;dq=%22Willem+Hendrick%22 "The Dutch Under English Rule"] ''The History of North America'' by Guy Carleton Lee Francis and Francis Newton Thorpe. Published 1904 by G. Barrie &amp; Sons, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern day [[Orange Order]] is named after William III, and makes a point of celebrating his victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] with annual parades in Northern Ireland, Liverpool and parts of Scotland and Canada on [[The Twelfth|12 July]].

By 1674, William was fully styled as "Willem III, [[by God's grace]] [[Prince of Orange]], [[Count of Nassau-Dillenburg|Count of Nassau]] etc., [[Stadtholder]] of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[Utrecht]] etc., [[Captain-General|Captain-]] and [[Admiral-General]] of the United Netherlands".&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 77&lt;/ref&gt; After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the titles "[[King and Queen of England]], [[King of Scotland|Scotland]], [[British claims to the French throne|France]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Fidei defensor|Defenders of the Faith]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guinness Book of Answers|publisher=Guinness Publishing|location=London|year=1991|page=709|isbn=0-85112-957-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms===
As Prince of Orange, William's coat of arms was: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], I [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] [[Semé|billetty]] a lion [[rampant]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] (for [[House of Nassau|Nassau]]); II Or a lion rampant guardant [[Gules]] crowned Azure ([[Katzenelnbogen]]); III Gules a [[fess]] [[Argent]] ([[Vianden]]), IV Gules two lions [[passant guardant]] Or, armed and langued azure (Dietz); between the I and II quarters an [[inescutcheon]], Or a fess [[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]] ([[Moers]]); at the fess point an inescutcheon, quarterly I and IV Gules, a [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] Or ([[Châlons-en-Champagne|Châlons]]); II and III Or a bugle horn Azure, stringed Gules ([[Principality of Orange|Orange]]) with an inescutcheon, Nine pieces Or and Azure ([[Geneva]]); between the III and IV quarters, an inescutcheon, Gules a fess counter embattled Argent ([[Buren]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pinches|first=John Harvey|author2=Pinches, Rosemary|title=The Royal Heraldry of England |series=Heraldry Today |year=1974|publisher=Hollen Street Press |location=Slough, Buckinghamshire |isbn=0-900455-25-X|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coat of arms used by the king and queen was: Quarterly, I and IV Grand quarterly, Azure three [[fleurs-de-lis]] Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] Or ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]); II Or a lion rampant within a double [[tressure]] flory-counter-flory Gules ([[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|for Scotland]]); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent ([[Coat of arms of Ireland|for Ireland]]); overall an escutcheon Azure billetty a lion rampant Or.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclagan|first1=Michael |last2=Louda|first2=Jiří|title=Line of Succession: Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe|year=1999|publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co|location=London|isbn=1-85605-469-1|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later coat of arms, William used the motto: ''[[Je Maintiendrai]]'' (medieval French for "I will maintain"). The motto represents the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], since it came into the family with the [[Principality of Orange]].

On his return to Scotland, he worked as assistant lecturer in English literature to [[John Nichol (biographer)|John Nichol]] from 1884. In 1890, McCormick was appointed as Professor of English Language and Literature by the then [[University College, Dundee]], alongside a lectureship at the [[University of St Andrews]].

'''Wojtek''' (1942–1963; {{IPA-pl|ˈvɔjtɛk}}; in English, sometimes spelled '''Voytek''' and so pronounced) was a [[Syrian brown bear]] bought, as a young cub, at a railway station in [[Hamadan]], Iran, by [[Polish II Corps]] soldiers who had been evacuated from the [[Soviet Union]].  In order to provide for his rations and transportation, he was eventually enlisted officially as a soldier with the rank of private, and was subsequently promoted to [[corporal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tvp.info/15256579/pomnik-legendarnego-niedzwiedzia-wojtka-stanal-w-krakowie |title=Pomnik legendarnego niedźwiedzia Wojtka stanął w Krakowie |trans-title=Statue of the legendary bear Wojtek unveiled in Krakow |work=[[Telewizja Polska]] |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2015 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He accompanied the bulk of the Polish Second Corps to Italy, serving with the 22nd Artillery Supply Company.  During the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], in [[Italy]] in 1944, Wojtek helped move crates of ammunition and became a celebrity with visiting Allied generals and statesmen.

After the war, mustered out of the Polish Army, he was billeted and lived out the rest of his life at the [[Edinburgh Zoo]] in Scotland.

==History==
[[File:Polish Soldier in Iran wojtek.jpeg|thumb|left|Two Polish soldiers in Iran]]
In the spring of 1942 the newly formed [[Anders Army]] left the [[Soviet Union]] for [[Iran]], accompanied by thousands of Polish civilians who had been deported to the [[gulag]]s following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939. During a rest stop near the town of Hamadan while en route to Tehran on 8 April 1942, a group of Polish soldiers encountered a young Kurdish boy who had found a bear cub after its mother had been shot by hunters. One of the civilian refugees in their midst, eighteen-year-old Irena Bokiewicz, was very taken with the cub, which prompted Lieutenant Anatol Tarnowiecki to buy the young bear, who spent the next three months in the Polish refugee camp that was established near Tehran, principally under the care of Irena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=O niedźwiedziu, który był polskim żołnierzem |trans-title=The bear, who was a Polish soldier |journal=Polonia Włoska Biuletyn Informacyjny |publisher=Wiosna/Lato |date=17 July 2013 |page=24 |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/000823018fce5ff37e1c7 |accessdate=24 December 2015 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August the bear was donated to the 2nd Transport Company, which later became the 22nd Artillery Supply Company, and he was given the name Wojtek by the soldiers.

Wojtek initially had problems swallowing and was fed [[condensed milk]] from an old [[vodka]] bottle. He was subsequently given fruit, marmalade, honey and syrup, and was often rewarded with beer, which became his favourite drink. He later also enjoyed smoking (or eating) [[cigarette]]s.&lt;ref name="cigarettes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wojtek wraca |trans-title=Wojtek returns |newspaper=[[Polityka]] |page=11 |date=2 February 2008|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eating cigarettes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/what-s-on/smarter-than-the-average-bear-by-far-1-1342563 |title=Smarter than the average bear .. by far |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He loved wrestling with the soldiers and was taught to salute when greeted. Wojtek became quite an attraction for soldiers and civilians alike, and soon became an unofficial [[mascot]] of all units stationed nearby. With the 22nd Company he moved to [[Iraq]] and then through [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1320417/Private-Wojtek-35-stone-bear-battled-Nazis-remembered-statue.html |title=Private Wojtek, the 35 stone bear who battled Nazis to be remembered with statue |work=[[Mail Online]] |date=14 October 2010  |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Wojtek'' is the  [[nickname]], [[diminutive]] form, or [[hypocorism]] of "[[Wojciech]]" (Happy Warrior), an old [[Slavic name]] that is still common in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.behindthename.com/name/wojciech |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Wojciech |work=Behind the Name |year=2014 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private Wojtek==
[[File:Wojtek soldier bear.svg|thumb|Wojtek with artillery shell: Emblem of 22nd Artillery Supply Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://suite101.de/article/private-wojtek-alias-voytek-ein-bar-im-dienste-der-armee-a89384 |title='Private Wojtek' alias Voytek, ein Bär im Dienste der Armee |trans-title='Private Wojtek' alias Voytek, a bear in the service of the Army |first=Adele |last=Sansone |work=Suite101 |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2014|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

To get him onto a British transport ship when the unit sailed with the rest of the [[Polish II Corps]] from Egypt to fight alongside the British 8th Army in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], because regulations forbade mascot and pet animals, Wojtek was officially drafted into the Polish Army as a private and was listed among the soldiers of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company. Henryk Zacharewicz and Dymitr Szawlugo were assigned as his caretakers.

As an enlisted soldier of the company, with his own paybook, rank and serial number, he lived with the other men in tents or in a special wooden crate, which was transported by truck. According to numerous accounts, during the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] Wojtek helped by carrying 100-pound crates of 25-pound artillery shells, all without dropping a single one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=Aileen |title=Wojtek the Bear – Polish War Hero |publisher=Birlinn Publishers |date=1 November 2010 |isbn=978-1-84158-845-2 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the bear's popularity, the HQ approved a depiction of a bear carrying an artillery shell as the official emblem of the 22nd Company.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;

==Postwar==
After [[World War II]], in 1945, Wojtek was transported to [[Berwickshire]], [[Scotland]], with the rest of the 22nd Company. They were stationed at Winfield Airfield on Sunwick Farm, near the village of [[Hutton, Scottish Borders]]. Wojtek soon became popular among local civilians and the press, and the Polish-Scottish Association made him an honorary member.

Following demobilisation on 15 November 1947, Wojtek was given to the [[Edinburgh Zoo]], where he spent the rest of his life, often visited by journalists and former Polish soldiers, some of whom would toss him cigarettes, which he proceeded to eat because there was no one there to light them for him.&lt;ref name="mailonsunday"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-510452/The-hero-bear-went-war-loved-smoke-beer.html |title=The hero bear who went to war (and loved a smoke and a beer) |first=Beth |last=Hale |work=[[Mail Online]] |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media attention contributed to Wojtek's popularity. He was a frequent guest on BBC television's ''[[Blue Peter]]'' programme for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/wojtek-soldier-bear-edinburgh/|title=The story of Wojtek – the soldier bear who was promoted to Corporal|date=2017-12-29|work=iNews|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wojtek died in December 1963, at the age of 21. At the time of his death he weighed nearly {{convert|35|stone|kg}}, or 490 pounds, and was over 1.8 metres (6 feet) tall.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

On 25 April 2013, the [[Kraków]] city council decided to erect a statue of Wojtek in the city's [[Jordan Park]]. It was unveiled on 18 May 2014, the 70th anniversary of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]].&lt;ref name="polskieradio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/134028,Krakow-votes-for-WWII-soldier-bear-statue |title=Krakow votes for WWII soldier bear statue |work=[[Polskie Radio]] |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pilnuj |last=Polski |url=http://wpolityce.pl/historia/195392-niedzwiedz-wojtek-bedzie-mial-swoj-pomnik-w-krakowskim-parku-jordana-zapraszamy-na-niedzielne-uroczystosci-rocznicy-bitwy-o-monte-cassino |title=Niedźwiedź Wojtek będzie miał swój pomnik w krakowskim Parku Jordana |trans-title=Wojtek the Bear will have his monument in Krakow's Jordana Park |publisher=Wpolityce.pl |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=15 August 2014|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 2011, a film, ''Wojtek:  The Bear That Went to War'', was broadcast on [[BBC Two Scotland]], narrated by [[Brian Blessed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018jhfr |title=Wojtek: The Bear That Went to War |work=[[BBC Two]] |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British people|British]] songwriter [[Katy Carr]] released a music video called 'Wojtek,' on 17 September 2014 – the 75th anniversary of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2015/09/video-premiere-katy-carr-wojtek/ |title=Video Premiere: Katy Carr – Wojtek |first=Alex |last=Gallacher |work=Folk Radio UK |date=17 September 2015 |accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is referenced in ''[[Hearts of Iron IV]]'', as an Easter egg achievement, 'Bearer of Artillery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hoi4wiki.com/Achievements |title= Hearts of Iron IV achievements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scythe (board game)|Scythe board game]], a fictionalized Poland known as "Polania Republic" is represented with the characters "Anna &amp; Wojtek", where Wojtek is Anna's bear companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://stonemaiergames.com/games/scythe/characters/ |title=Scythe Character Details |accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the anime series ''[[Girls und Panzer]]'', the emblem of the Poland-inspired school, Bonple, features a bear carrying an artillery shell, as a reference to the emblem of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company and Wojtek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gup/images/6/61/All_schools.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131025232540|title=School emblems of Girls und Panzer|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Girls und Panzer der Film|2015 feature film]] to the series, the name "Wojtek" is also used for a teddy-shaped amusement park vehicle and later museum exhibit for the in-series [[List of Girls und Panzer characters#Boko|''Boko'']] franchise.

In the online digital collectible card game ''[[Gwent: The Witcher Card Game|Gwent]]'', Wojtek is named in an audible voice line in reference to a bear summoned by a unit card of the Skellige starter deck.

'''Xenotransplantation''' (''xenos-'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "foreign" or strange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dooldeniya |first1=M D , |last2=Warrens |first2=AN |title=Xenotransplantation: where are we today? |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539416/ |website=NCBI |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=C Ben |title=Xenotransplanation and Transgenics: The Need to Discuss Limits |url=https://cbhd.org/content/xenotransplanation-and-transgenics-need-discuss-limits |website=Cbhd |publisher=Cbhd |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''heterologous transplant''' is the [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[biological tissue|tissue]]s or [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s from one [[species]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/transplantation/xeno/en/ Xenotransplantation]. Definition by the World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt; Such cells, tissues or organs are called '''xenografts''' or '''xenotransplants'''. It is contrasted with [[allotransplantation]] (from other individual of same species), [[Syngenic|syngeneic]] transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and [[autotransplantation]] (from one part of the body to another in the same person).

Xenotransplantation of human [[tumor]] cells into [[immunocompromised]] mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical [[oncology]] research.

Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage [[organ failure]], a significant health problem in parts of the [[industrialized world]].  It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kress | first1 = J. M. | title = Xenotransplantation: Ethics and economics | journal = Food and drug law journal | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–384 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10346691}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission ([[xenozoonosis]]) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to [[animal testing]], animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/organfarm/interviews/lyons.html |title=Interviews - Dan Lyons |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html  |title=Organ Transplants from Animals: Examining the Possibilities |publisher=Internet Archive |work=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210031618/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html |archivedate = 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for patients and physicians to use the term "allograft" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the [[scientific literature]]) to maintain the more precise distinction in [[usage]].

==History==

The first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with [[renal insufficiency]].&lt;ref name=History1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reemtsma|first1=K|title=Xenotransplantation: A Historical Perspective.|journal=ILAR journal|date=1995|volume=37|issue=1|pages=9–12|pmid=11528018|url=https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/37/1/9/760596/Xenotransplantation-A-Historical-Perspective|doi=10.1093/ilar.37.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts attempts to use organs from lambs, pigs and primates were published.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

Scientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the [[immunological]] basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.  Even more studies followed Dr. [[Joseph Murray]]'s first successful [[kidney transplantation|renal transplantation]] in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

In 1963, doctors at [[Tulane University]] attempted [[chimpanzee]]-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

An American infant girl known as "[[Baby Fae]]" with [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a [[baboon]] heart in 1983. The procedure was performed by [[Leonard L. Bailey]] at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. Fae died 21 days later due to a [[Humoral immunity|humoral-based]] [[graft rejection]] thought to be caused mainly by an ABO [[blood type]] mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable [[allograft]] replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story grew so big that it made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360230053022 | last1 = Bailey | first1 = L.

Human organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying [[human biology]] without harming human patients. This technique has also been proposed as an alternative source of human organs for future transplantation into human patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Tanya |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/growing-human-kidneys-in-rats-sparks-ethical-debate/ |title=Growing human kidneys in rats sparks ethical debate |publisher=CBS News |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researchers from the [[Ganogen Research Institute]] transplanted [[human]] [[fetal]] [[kidneys]] into rats which demonstrated life supporting function and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/ajt.13149 |pmid=25645705|title=Arterial Flow Regulator Enables Transplantation and Growth of Human Fetal Kidneys in Rats|journal=American Journal of Transplantation|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1692–700|year=2015|last1=Chang|first1=N.

==Potential uses==
A worldwide shortage of organs for clinical implantation causes about 20–35% of patients who need replacement organs to die on the waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Healy | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Lawler | first2 = Z. | last3 = McEvoy | first3 = O. | last4 = Parlon | first4 = B. | last5 = Baktiari | first5 = N. | last6 = Egan | first6 = J.

If [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.

Xenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient’s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from [[Transplant rejection|rejecting]] allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Platt JL, Cascalho M |title= New and old technologies for organ replacement|journal= Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 179–85|pmid=23449347|year= 2013|doi= 10.1097/MOT.0b013e32835f0887|pmc=4911019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3501885 |pmid= 23172951|year= 2012|author1= Van Der Windt|first1= D.

Xenotransplantation also is and has been a valuable tool used in research laboratories to study [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19913288|year=2010|author1=Bols|first1=P.

== Potential animal organ donors ==

Since they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for [[xenotransfusion]]s. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.&lt;ref name=michler1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Michler | first1 = R. | title = Xenotransplantation: Risks, Clinical Potential, and Future Prospects | doi = 10.3201/eid0201.960111 | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–70 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8903201 | pmc =2639801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic pig|Pig]]s (''Sus scrofa domesticus'') are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Warrens | first2 = A. N. | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.96.3.111 | title = Xenotransplantation: Where are we today? | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 111–117 | year = 2003 | pmc = 539416 | pmid=12612110}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are readily available, their organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations.&lt;ref name=Taylor2007&gt;Taylor, L. (2007) [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3715.htm Xenotransplantation]. Emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt; Current experiments in xenotransplantation most often use pigs as the donor, and baboons as human models.

In the field of regenerative medicine, pancreatogenesis- or nephrogenesis-disabled pig embryos, unable to form a specific organ, allow experimentation toward the ''in vivo'' generation of functional organs from xenogenic pluripotent stem cells in large animals via compensation for an empty developmental niche (blastocyst complementation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Matsunari Hitomi |author2=Nagashima Hiroshi |author3=Watanabe Masahito | year = | title = and Hiromitsu Nakauchi (2013).

==Barriers and issues==

=== Immunologic barriers ===

To date no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s [[immune system]]. "Xenozoonoses" are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead ti the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boneva |first1=RS |last2=Folks |first2=TM |last3=Chapman |first3=LE |title=Infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation. |journal=Clinical microbiology reviews |date=January 2001 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1-14 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.1.1-14.2001 |pmid=11148000}}&lt;/ref&gt;This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include: 
* Hyperacute rejection
* Acute vascular rejection
* Cellular rejection
* Chronic rejection

A rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of [[antibodies]] present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;

==== Hyperacute rejection ====

This rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human [[complement system]], which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the [[IgM]] class, but also include [[IgG]], and [[IgA]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, Gal-α-1,3Gal (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme α-galactosyl transferase.&lt;ref name=candinas2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Candinas | first1 = D. | last2 = Adams | first2 = D. H. | title = Xenotransplantation: Postponed by a millennium? | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/93.2.63 | journal = QJM | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–66 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10700475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign [[antigen]] by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the [[classical complement pathway]]. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The end result is [[thrombosis]] and [[necrosis]] of the xenograft.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

===== Overcoming hyperacute rejection =====

Since hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:

''Interruption of the complement cascade'' 
*The recipient's complement cascade can be inhibited through the use of cobra venom factor (which depletes C3), soluble complement receptor type 1, anti-C5 antibodies, or C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

''Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)'' 
*1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockouts – These pigs don’t contain the gene that codes for the enzyme responsible for expression of the immunogeneic gal-α-1,3Gal moiety (the α-Gal epitope).&lt;ref name=latemple&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D.

*Increased expression of H-transferase (α 1,2 fucosyltransferase), an enzyme that competes with galactosyl transferase. Experiments have shown this reduces α-Gal expression by 70%.&lt;ref name=sharma&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.14.7190 | last1 = Sharma | first1 = A. | last2 = Okabe | first2 = J. | last3 = Birch | first3 = P. | last4 = McClellan | first4 = S.

*Expression of human complement regulators ([[CD55]], [[CD46]], and [[CD59]]) to inhibit the complement cascade.&lt;ref name=huang&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2001.tb00521.x | last1 = Huang | first1 = J. | last2 = Gou | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhen | first3 = C. | last4 = Jiang | first4 = D. | last5 = Mao | first5 = X. | last6 = Li | first6 = W. | last7 = Chen | first7 = S. | last8 = Cai | first8 = C. | title = Protection of xenogeneic cells from human complement-mediated lysis by the expression of human DAF, CD59 and MCP | journal = FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–209 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11720816}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plasmaphoresis, on humans to remove 1,3 galactosyltransferase, reduces the risk of activation of effector cells such as CTL (CD8 T cells), complement pathway activation and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).

====Acute vascular rejection====

Also known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly [[macrophages]] and [[natural killer cells]] (with small numbers of [[T cells]]), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

Binding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]], as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as [[E-selectin]], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ([[ICAM-1]]), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ([[VCAM-1]]).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

This response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine [[major histocompatibility complex]] molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

===== Overcoming acute vascular rejection =====
Due to its complexity,  the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include: 
*Administering a synthetic thrombin inhibitor to modulate thrombogenesis
*Depletion of anti-galactose antibodies (XNAs) by techniques such as immunoadsorption, to prevent endothelial cell activation
*Inhibiting activation of macrophages (stimulated by CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells) and NK cells (stimulated by the release of Il-2). Thus, the role of MHC molecules and T cell responses in activation would have to be reassessed for each species combo.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

==== Accommodation ====

If hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection&lt;ref name=takahashi&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = T. | last2 = Saadi | first2 = S. | last3 = Platt | first3 = J. L. | doi = 10.1007/BF02786395 | title = Recent advances in the immunology of xenotransplantation | journal = Immunologic Research | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–297 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9379077 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as [[heme oxygenase-1]] (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

==== Cellular rejection ====
Rejection of the xenograft in hyperactute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the [[humoral immune system]], since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on [[cellular immunity]], and is mediated by: 
*Natural killer cells, which accumulate in and damage the xenograft; and
*T-lymphocytes – which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.

In direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host’s class I MHC molecules to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=abbas2005&gt;Abbas, A., Lichtman, A. (2005) ''Cellular and Molecular Immunology'', 5th ed., pp. 81, 330–333, 381, 386. Elsevier Saunders, Pennsylvania,{{ISBN|0-7216-0008-5}}, {{DOI|10.1002/bmb.2004.494032019997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===== Overcoming cellular rejection =====

A proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient’s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of [[hematopoiesis]]. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient’s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

==== Chronic rejection ====

Chronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt; [[Fibrosis]] in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is [[arteriosclerosis]]. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years.&lt;ref name="abbas2005"/&gt; It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.&lt;ref name=vanderpool&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanderpool | first1 = H. Y. | title = Xenotransplantation: Progress and promise | doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7220.1311 | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7220 | page = 1311 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559062| pmc =1129087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dysregulated coagulation ====

Successful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as [[coagulopathy]].&lt;ref name="cowan2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cowan PJ |author2=Robson SC |author3=d’Apice AJF |title=Controlling coagulation dysregulation in xenotransplantation|journal=Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=214–21|pmid=21415824|pmc=3094512|year=2011|doi=10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283446c65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of [[coagulopathy]], or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe [[thrombocytopenia]], causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding.&lt;ref name="cowan2011" /&gt; An alternate clotting disorder, [[thrombosis]], may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting.&lt;ref name="ekser2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ekser B, Cooper DK|title=Overcoming the barriers to xenotransplantation: prospects for the future|journal=Expert review of clinical immunology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=219–30|pmid=20402385|pmc=2857338|year=2010|doi=10.1586/eci.09.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

Just as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

=== Physiology ===
Extensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:

*Size – Differences in organ size limit the range of potential recipients of xenotransplants.
*Longevity – The lifespan of most pigs is roughly 15 years, currently it is unknown whether or not a xenograft may be able to last longer than that. 
*Hormone and protein differences – Some proteins will be molecularly incompatible, which could cause malfunction of important regulatory processes. These differences also make the prospect of hepatic xenotransplantation less promising, since the liver plays an important role in the production of so many proteins.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;
*Environment – For example, pig hearts work in a different anatomical site and under different hydrostatic pressure than in humans.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;
*Temperature – The body temperature of pigs is 39&amp;nbsp;°C (2&amp;nbsp;°C above the average human body temperature). Implications of this difference, if any, on the activity of important enzymes are currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===Xenozoonosis===
Xenozoonosis,  also known as [[zoonosis]] or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the [[avian influenza]], when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans.&lt;ref name=who2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beigel | first1 = J. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | last3 = Han | first3 = A. | last4 = Hayden | first4 = F. | last5 = Hyer | first5 = R. | last6 = De Jong | first6 = M. | last7 = Lochindarat | first7 = S. | last8 = Nguyen | first8 = T. | last9 = Nguyen | first9 = T. | last10 = Tran | first10 = T.

*Implantation breaches the physical barrier that normally helps to prevent disease transmission,	
*The recipient of the transplant will be severely immunosuppressed; and
*Human complement regulators (CD46, CD55, and CD59) expressed in transgenic pigs have been shown to serve as virus receptors, and may also help to protect viruses from attack by the complement system.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00128-X | last1 = Takeuchi | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = R.

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine [[herpesvirus]], [[rotavirus]], [[parvovirus]], and [[circovirus]]. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000 /&gt; Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.&lt;ref name=FDA2006&gt;FDA.

Baboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body’s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA ([[histocompatibility]]).

In 2005, the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |title=The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's 2005 statement on xenotransplantation |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |archivedate = 2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated "... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim (10 December 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215005407/http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/329402/xenotransplantation_ban_lifted_australia Xenotransplantation ban lifted in Australia]. lifescientist.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Porcine endogenous retroviruses ====
[[Endogenous retroviruses]] are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance.&lt;ref name="vanderpool"/&gt; Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt; PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells.&lt;ref name=armstrong1971&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-10-2-195 | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = J.

===Ethics===
Xenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 PETA Media Center: Factsheet: Xenotransplantation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626072643/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 |date=June 26, 2010 }}.

==== Informed consent of patient ====
[[Autonomy]] and [[informed consent]] are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellison T. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethics and regulation|journal=Xenotransplantation|volume=13|issue=6|pages=505–9|pmid=17059575|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3089.2006.00352_3.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. However, it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent, because the repercussions of transplantation are high, with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation. Close contacts are at risk for such infections. Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that [[xenozoonosis]] is not occurring. The question then becomes: does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent, and are the [[confidentiality|principles of confidentiality]] broken?

The safety of public health is a factor to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaiser M. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethical considerations based on human and societal perspectives|journal=Acta veterinaria Scandinavica. Supplementum|volume=99|pages=65–73|pmid=15347151|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is any risk to the public at all for an [[outbreak]] from transplantation there must be procedures in place to protect the public. Not only does the recipient of the transplantation have to understand the risks and benefits, but society must also understand and consent to such an agreement.

The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association points out one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sykes M |author2=D’Apice A |author3=Sandrin M |year= 2003|title= Position Paper of the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association|journal= Xenotransplantation|volume= 10|issue= 3|pages= 194–203|pmid=12694539|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.00067.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that the recipient of the transplantation will be asked to undergo lifelong monitoring, which would deny the recipient the ability to terminate the monitoring at any time, which is in direct opposition of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] and the [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]].
In 2007, xenotransplantation was banned under ethical grounds in all countries but Argentina, Russia and New Zealand. Since then, the practice has only been carried out to treatment for diabetes type 1 to serve as a substitute for penicillin injections. 

==== Xenotransplantion guidelines in the United States ====

The Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of that recipient's lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;United States Food and Drug Administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''Æthelfrith''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|θ|əl|f|r|ɪ|θ}}; died c. 904/915) was an [[ealdorman]] of southern [[Mercia]], who flourished in the last two decades of the ninth century and the first decade of the tenth century. His father is unknown. He was married to Æthelgyth, daughter of Æthelwulf; Æthelwulf is unidentified, but a possible candidate is King [[Alfred the Great]]'s brother-in-law, the ealdorman of the [[Gaini]] who died in 901. Æthelfrith was father to four ealdormen: [[Æthelstan Half-King]] ([[East Anglia]]), Ælfstan ([[Mercia]]), Æthelwald ([[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]), and [[Eadric, Ealdorman of Wessex|Eadric]] ([[Hampshire]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Cyril ‘Æthelstan (fl. 932-956)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

"In 903 it happened to Æthelfrith, dux, that all his deeds of title perished in the destruction of a fire. Therefore impelled by such a necessity, the aforementioned dux asked King [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], also [[Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia|Æthelred]] and [[Æthelflæd]], who then held rulership and power over the Mercian people under the aforementioned king, also all the members of the witan, that they should permit him and give authorisation for the rewriting of replacement charters for him." Among the charters reissued was one "concerning that land of ten hides, namely at [[Islington]], which [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]], the celebrated king of the Mercians, gave to his faithful comes, Beornnoth, to be free for himself and for his heirs in perpetuity after him"[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/367a.html]. It would appear therefore that Æthelfrith, or possibly his, wife, could trace his family roots to the old Mercian aristocracy.
