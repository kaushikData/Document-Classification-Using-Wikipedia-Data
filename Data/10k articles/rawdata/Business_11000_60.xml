'''Antonio James Manchin''' (April 7, 1927 – November 3, 2003) was a [[West Virginia]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician who served as a member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] (1948–50; 1998-2003), as [[West Virginia Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (1977–85), and as [[State Treasurer]] (1985–89). A colorful and controversial figure, he was the uncle of former [[West Virginia Governor]] and current [[U.S. Senator]] [[Joe Manchin III]].

==Early life and education==
Manchin was born in [[Farmington, West Virginia]] to Kathleen and Joseph Manchin I. His parents were of Italian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Joseph |first1=Manchin |title=1930 US Census, Marion County, West Virginia |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XMHC-CC2 |website=FamilySearch |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an A.B. degree in political science and sociology and a master's degree in education from [[West Virginia University]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Early career (1948-1975)==
Manchin was first elected to the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1948 at age 21, but was defeated in his bid for re-election in 1950. He spent most of the 1950s working as a high school teacher and wrestling coach.&lt;ref name="house resolution"/&gt;

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed him to serve as State Director of the [[Farmers Home Administration]] and he served at the federal level as Special Assistant to the National Administrator of the Farmers Home Administration, holding those positions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1972, he ran for [[West Virginia Secretary of State]] when incumbent [[Jay Rockefeller]] retired to run for governor. In the seven candidate Democratic primary, he lost and ranked second place with 18% of the vote, behind Thomas Winner who won with a plurality of 20% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624451&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Governor [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.]] in 1973 appointed him to direct the Rehabilitation Environmental Action Program (REAP), a successful effort which rid the State of more than 100,000 junked cars&lt;ref name="house resolution"/&gt; as well as numerous appliances.

==Statewide offices (1976-1989)==
In 1976, Manchin ran again to become Secretary of State and defeated incumbent Republican [[James R. McCartney|James McCartney]] 55%-45%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624452&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, he won re-election with 71% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=582030&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected State Treasurer in 1984, he created the Teddi Program which brought 28,000 new jobs to West Virginia.&lt;ref name="house resolution"/&gt; He was [[impeachment in the United States|impeached]] by the House of Delegates on March 30, 1989, amid a controversy over bad investments that lost the state $279 million mainly during the time period between April and June 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/30/us/impeachment-in-west-virginia.html "Impeachment in West Virginia"], ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The impeachment resolution blamed Manchin for negligence in delegating and supervising the investment fund, making improper investments and covering up losses.&lt;ref name="vows to stay"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AeYPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NowDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6692,326677&amp;dq=a+james+manchin&amp;hl=en|author=A.V. Gallagher|agency=The Associated Press|work=The Free-Lance-Star|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia|date=March 30, 1989|title=Manchin impeached, but vows to stay on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he initially vowed to stay in office, conviction by the Senate would have meant losing his eligibility to run for office again, and could have cost him his pension.&lt;ref name="vows to stay"/&gt; He resigned before his trial by the State Senate was completed.

===Elections===
He later returned to the House of Delegates in 1998, where he served until his death from a massive heart attack in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Legendary W.Va. Politician, Del. A. James Manchin Dies, ''The Times Leader'', 3 Nov 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
The House of Delegates called him "a flamboyant character of the first magnitude" and praised his love of ceremony in their resolution honoring him after his death.&lt;ref name="house resolution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Text_HTML/2004_SESSIONS/RS/Bills/hr4%20intr.htm |title=House Resolution 4, a Memorial to Manchin|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee assignments===
*Government Organization
*Roads and Transportation
*Veteran Affair (Vice Chair)
*Enrolled Bills (Chair)

==Personal life==
Manchin was married to Stella Machel Petros and had three children. One of his sons, Mark, was Chief of [[Webster County Schools (West Virginia)|Webster County School District]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9a1BAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yqkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6034,1777445&amp;dq=james+manchin&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Roman Catholic]], he served as a lector at his church.&lt;ref name="house resolution"/&gt;

'''Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales''', or '''ADAMS''', is a $35 million [[DARPA]] project designed to identify patterns and anomalies in very large data sets.

'''António de Sommer Champalimaud''' ([[Lisbon]], Lapa, 19 March 1918 &amp;ndash; [[Lisbon]], Lapa, 8 May 2004) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[banker]] and [[industrialist]] who in 2004 was the wealthiest man in [[Portugal]]. He earned his fortune with [[insurance]], [[banking]] and [[cement]] [[industries]] which were nationalized after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974. After living in exile in [[Brazil]] for seven years, he returned to Portugal and rebuilt his companies.

==Biography==
Born in 1918, the eldest child and son of Carlos Montez Champalimaud ([[Peso da Régua]], [[Godim]], 13 November 1877 &amp;ndash; [[Cascais]], 4 May 1937), a [[Military]] [[physician|Doctor]], Lord of the ancestral home of Quinta do Cotto in the Douro region &lt;ref&gt;http://www.quintadocotto.pt/en/quinta.php&lt;/ref&gt; (great-great-grandson in female line of [[French people|French]] Paul Joseph Champalimaud, seigneur de Nussane, who came to Portugal and here married Clara Maria de Sousa Lira e Castro), and wife (m. Lisbon, 2 June 1917) Ana de Araújo de Sommer (Lisbon, 23 April 1885 &amp;ndash; ?) (great-granddaughter in male line of [[Germans|German]] Franz Joseph Freiherr von [[Sommer]] and wife Klara Werlein von [[Ascheberg]], who came to Portugal during the [[Liberal Wars]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=19743 António Champalimaud in a Portuguese Genealogical site&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the La Guardia Jesuit High School before enrolling at the [[University of Lisbon|Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa]] to study [[Chemistry]]. António never finished his college education, for at 19, after his father's death, he took over the family's construction company. Later, at the age of 28 he took over his uncle's ([[Henrique de Sommer|Henrique de Araújo de Sommer]], one of Portugal most important industrialists, who had died without issue, as did two of his brothers, two of his sisters and his niece) cement business.

In Cascais, [[Estoril]], at the Igreja de Santo António, on 16 December 1941 he married [[Don (honorific)|Dona]] Maria Cristina da Silva José de Mello ([[Lapa (Lisbon)|Lapa, Lisbon]], 6 March 1920 &amp;ndash; Lisbon, [[Prazeres (Lisbon)|Prazeres]], 25 August 2006), daughter of the major industrialist Dom Manuel Augusto José de Mello, of the Counts do [[Cartaxo Municipality|Cartaxo]] and of the [[Count]]s and [[Marquess]]es of [[Sabugosa]] Counts of São Lourenço [[Alféres|Alferes-Majors of the Realm]], and Amélia de Resende Dias de Oliveira da Silva. They had seven children together. Maria Cristina was an heir to the [[Grupo CUF]], a company that was a conglomerate with interests in [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[textiles]], [[banking]], [[insurances]], [[shipbuilding]] and repairing, [[shipping]] and [[tobacco]] industries. They were divorced by 1957, after which he started competing with his ex-brother-in-law in the banking and insurance markets. His ex-wife married secondly in Lisbon, São Mamede, on 29 March 1980 Amaro de Azevedo Gomes (Cascais, [[São Domingos de Rana]], 22 June 1917 &amp;ndash; Lisbon, São Mamede, 1 January 2008), without issue.

He bequeathed 500 million euros to establish the [[Champalimaud Foundation]] in order to support [[biomedicine]]. The foundation also administers a yearly 1 million euro prize for outstanding research related to [[Visual perception|vision]], an appropriate prize, as late in life António lost his [[eyesight]].

==Business==
Champalimaud expanded the cement business he took over from his uncle [[Henrique de Sommer]] in 1946 and expanded it in Portugal to the point of a near monopoly.   He also expanded his cement industry into Africa, to the Portuguese overseas territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. 

In the early 1960s, he bought the ''Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor'' (BPSM) and the insurance companies ''Confiança'', ''Mundial'' and ''Continental Resseguros''.  In 1969 he fled to Mexico to avoid an arrest warrant related to an inheritance case over shares of the ''Empresa de Cimentos de Leiria'', his uncle's old company.  The warrant was revoked in 1973, after which Champalimaud returned to Portugal.

In 1975, a year after the [[Carnation Revolution]], his companies were nationalized by the new government. Champalimaud first fled to France and ultimately to Brazil. Without his fortune, he restarted building his wealth, first establishing a cement company in Brazil, and later by also operating commercial farms. In 1992, Champalimaud returned to Portugal and started to buy back his old companies. 

In a series of transactions, Champalimaud sold the Champalimaud Group to the [[Banco Santander|Banco Santander Central Hispano]], BSCH, Spain's largest bank {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.

The '''Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka''', or '''AATSL''', is a Sri Lankan qualification and professional body for vocational accountants which was launched as an initiative that came through the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka]] (CA Sri Lanka). AAT is a technician level qualification offering higher apprenticeships which entitles those who have completed the exams and obtained relevant supervised work experience to become an accountant.&lt;ref name=refone&gt;{{cite web|title= History - The Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|url= http://www.aatsl.lk/about-us/profile.html|website= AATSL|publisher= AATSL|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The need for accounting technicians were emphasized in the master plan for Accountancy Education in Sri Lanka prepared by the [[Asian Development Bank]] Inception Mission in 1986 and following that AATSL was established in Dec. 1987 on the model of the [[Association of Accounting Technicians|Association of Accounting Technicians (UK)]] and subsequently AAT Ireland (called Institute of Accounting Technicians Ireland) was formed in April 1983.&lt;ref name=his&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.aatsl.lk/about-us/history.html|website=Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|publisher=AATSL|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional Recognition ==

AAT Sri Lanka is registered under the Companies Act No 17 of 1982 and re-registered under the Companies Act No 7 of 2007, as a company limited by guarantee. Two years after its inception, the Institute was admitted to the Associate Membership of the [[International Federation of Accountants|International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)]] which is a key body for Accountants. AAT Sri Lanka also has the distinction of being the first Associate Member of the [[Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants|Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA)]], a leading network of accounting bodies in the region.

== Governing Council ==

AATSL is governed by a governing council which has the primary responsibility of presiding over the AATSL’s affairs and provide efficient governance for the benefit of all stakeholders. It has 16 non-executive autonomous members who are either elected by the members of the Association or nominated by various bodies or persons. All Council Members serve in an independent capacity and do not receive any remuneration for their services.&lt;ref name=refs&gt;{{cite web|title=Governing Council|url=http://www.aatsl.lk/about-us/governing-council.html|website=Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|publisher=AATSL|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications ==

Accounting Technicians are Middle Level Professional Accountants immediately after obtaining the Associate Membership (MAAT). However, by gaining experience in the field of Accountancy they can reach to Senior Technician Level (SAT) and Fellow Technician Level (FMAAT), which are considered as well groomed Professional Accountants. One can add more value and recognition to this qualification by gaining qualifications in other Professional Accountancy bodies.

== AAT Business School ==

AAT Business School is a Strategic Business Unit (SBU) operating under the AATSL, committed towards enhancing competencies and recognition of those seeking individual development. It was officially inaugurated on 22 January 2014 by Mr. Warren Allen, the President of The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) (2012–14). The AAT Business School offers programs which can be categorized into Information Technology, Management Development Program (MDP), Taxation, English language and People and Leadership Skills (PLS).&lt;ref name=biz&gt;{{cite web|title= About AAT Business School|url=http://www.aatsl.lk/aat-business-school/about-aat-business-school.html|website= Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|publisher=AATSL|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles L. Andes''' or '''Chuck Andes''' (1930 – August 17, 2006) was an American businessman who later in his career made contributions to [[civic service]], most notably as chairman of the [[Franklin Institute]] science museum in [[Philadelphia]]. He received the [[William Penn Award]], Philadelphia’s highest honor for business leaders contributing to civic service. Andes was born and raised in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania|Swarthmore]], Pennsylvania where his father was a prominent home builder. He attended [[Swarthmore College]] and earned a bachelor's degree from [[Syracuse University]].

==Background==
In 1952, he joined [[Adtech Industries]], a direct marketing distributor of specialty advertising products, then became national sales manager of that company in 1956 and its president in 1961.

Andes joined his friend [[Joseph Segel]] at The [[Franklin Mint]] (a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] producing coinage) in 1967, becoming its first executive vice-president. In 1970, he was named president of its US division, and Franklin Mint stock began to be actively traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. When Segel retired in 1973, Andes became CEO and chairman of Franklin Mint Corporation, which by then had expanded internationally and was also producing coin-of-the-realm for several foreign countries.

Under Andes’ direction, sales at The Franklin Mint grew steadily, due largely to a program of product diversification from [[coin]]s and [[medal]]s to [[porcelain]], [[crystal]], die-cast collectibles and leather-bound books, while still maintaining its status as the world’s largest [[private mint]].

In 1981, Franklin Mint Corporation was acquired by [[Warner Communications]] (the predecessor of [[Time Warner Corporation]]). Andes continued as CEO of Franklin Mint Corporation until 1986.

In 1986, The Franklin Institute, America’s oldest science museum, was experiencing attendance and financial problems. Andes, who had previously served on its board, agreed to become its full-time CEO and chairman on a pro bono basis, and he promptly launched the $70 million  "Futures Center" expansion program for the institute. Largely through his efforts the necessary funding was raised and the Futures Center was completed in the spring of 1990. Attendance increased from 500,000 to over a million annually, and the Futures Center received outstanding reviews from around the world. Andes also initiated the [[Bower Awards]] at The Franklin Institute, which are considered by many to be America’s most prestigious awards for achievements in science.

From 1992 to 1994, Andes served as Ranking Republican Member of The [[Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority]] (PICA), the state agency that was charged with financial oversight of the City of Philadelphia and with selling $2 billion of bonds to finance operations in support of Mayor [[Ed Rendell]]’s program to bail out the City.&lt;ref&gt;
Biography, Charles L. Andes, p2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, after he retired as chairman emeritus of the Franklin Institute, Andes was asked to serve as CEO and Chairman of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], an acclaimed art museum and America’s oldest and most distinguished art school. Andes served for two years in that position.

In 1994, Andes also became the first president of the [[Eastern Technology Council]], an association developed to assist technology companies to develop business opportunities and raise capital. Andes grew the Council from 150 companies to over 1,000 in three years. From 1993 to 1996, Andes participated in venture capital activities with [[Safeguard Scientifics]], founding several companies and serving as a member of the [[Executive Committee of Technology Leaders]] Venture Capital Funds I and II

After 1997, Andes assisted many aspiring entrepreneurs and became an investor in seven new enterprises, serving as chairman of two them, [[Network Direct]] and [[Eagle Email]].

During his career Andes served on a number of corporate boards, including [[Fidelity Trust Company|Fidelity Bank]] and [[National Media Corporation]], and non-profit boards including the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]], [[American Music Theater Festival]], [[National Constitution Center]], [[National Epilepsy Foundation]], [[United Nations Association of the USA]], the [[Pennsylvania Ballet]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], the [[Union League]], [[WHYY-TV]]/[[WHYY-FM]] and the [[Wistar Institute]].

==Death==
Andes is remembered by his family and friends for his keen sense of humor. In talking about the success he realized at the Franklin Mint and the Franklin Institute, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a sense of mission and excitement at the Mint, and it was the same thing here at the Institute. We were banded together by a common purpose—and by the sheer terror of it all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He died on August 17, 2006 in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]]. He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Dorothea ("Dottebob"), four daughters, Elizabeth Bell, Susan Frost, Karen Andes and Page Morocco, and five grandchildren.

==Awards==
Over the years, Andes received recognition and awards from many organizations including Man of the Year from [[Advertising Specialty Guild of America]], Annual Entrepreneurs Award from the [[Area Council for Economic Education]], CEO of the year from ''[[Financial World]]'' Magazine, Exemplar Award from the [[NAACP]], Civic Achievement Award from the [[American Jewish Committee]], Annual Achievers Award from [[Wheels, Inc.]], Citations of Merit from The City of Philadelphia and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], [[Good Scout Award]] from [[Boy Scouts of America]], Entrepreneur of the Year from [[Ernst and Young]] and [[Merrill Lynch]], Ten Most Influential Philadelphians Award from ''[[Philadelphia Magazine]]'', and the William Penn Award from the [[Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce]].

'''''Clockwatchers''''' is an American comedy-drama film released in [[1997 in film|1997]]. Directed by [[Jill Sprecher]], it stars [[Parker Posey]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Toni Collette]] and [[Alanna Ubach]] as [[Temporary work|temporary office staffers]] in an office complex. 
The four become misfit friends in an office environment where they are ignored and mistrusted by their co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E5D61230F936A25756C0A96E958260 |title=Clockwatchers (1997) |author=Holden, Stephen |date=May 15, 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Iris (Collette) is a shy young professional who doesn't want to rock the boat at the office where she [[Temporary work|temps]]. Margaret (Posey) is the polar opposite, and serves as a catalyst to help Iris become more assertive. Paula (Kudrow) eagerly awaits post-work [[happy hour]]s and the chance to flirt with attractive men. Jane (Ubach) is engaged to marry a jerk who is already cheating on her. Margaret hopes to become a permanent employee as an assistant to Mr. Lasky ([[Bob Balaban]]), but her dreams are thwarted when he suddenly dies. The four temps form a camaraderie which assists them in getting through their boring and tedious days at work.

A series of thefts occur in the office and suspicion falls on the temps, particularly Margaret. When Iris finds a plastic monkey inside Margaret's desk that she had thought was stolen, Iris loses faith in Margaret and believes that she is the office thief. Margaret suggests a one-day strike from work due to mistreatment and being under appreciated as temps, and her friends halfheartedly agree to join her, but on the appointed day Margaret is the only one who does not come to work. As a result, the company's officious head of human resources ([[Debra Jo Rupp]]) fires Margaret, and management micromanages the remaining three temps. Iris, Paula and Jane's friendship comes to an end as result of the stress, ending the camaraderie among the temporary workers, and eventually they all go their separate ways. Paula is upset when she learns of Jane's wedding from a newspaper announcement, to which she was not invited, and leaves to work in another department.

It is later discovered that another employee (a rich girl who was hired as a permanent employee after her first day) was the thief and that Margaret simply had a similar toy in her desk. Iris confronts the thief when her diary disappears; Iris later receives a new diary and note of apology.

When Iris is not hired for a permanent job she really wanted, she quits the temp pool. A senior executive agrees to sign a letter of recommendation for Iris.  Iris takes advantage of the fact that executives rarely learn the temps' names, and she tells the executive that her name is Margaret, so that Margaret can finally receive the recommendation she had been striving for as a temp.  Iris then mails the letter of recommendation to Margaret with a note.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews. It currently holds an 83% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 24 reviews (20 positive, 4 negative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clockwatchers/ |title=Clockwatchers (1997) |author= |date= |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Demetrius Comino''' OBE (4 December 1902 – 27 September 1988)&lt;ref name="Darbyshire"&gt;Darbyshire, Anthony, and Duckworth, Eric (2011), ''Demetrius Comino: A life and legacy of achievement'', Comino Foundation. – {{cite web |url=http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514235835/http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2013 |df=dmy }} (accessed: 22 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian-born [[Greeks|Greek]] engineer, [[inventor]], entrepreneur and philanthropist during the 20th century. He invented the [[slotted angle]] steel construction system, [[Dexion]], which became widely used internationally for commercial [[Shelf (storage)|shelving]], [[warehouse|storage]] racking, [[Trade fair|exhibition]] stands, [[Dwelling|accommodation]], and for domestic purposes. In 1971 he founded the [[Comino Foundation]], an educational charity.

==Early career==
Demetrius (always known as 'Dimitri') Comino (Greek: Δημήτριος Κομηνός) was born in Sydney, the eldest son of a Greek oyster merchant who had migrated from the island of [[Kythira]] in 1884. He demonstrated his creativity aged 12 when he invented a toy [[submarine]],&lt;ref name="NewSci" /&gt; and after attending [[Sydney Grammar School]], travelled to London in 1921 to study [[electrical engineering]] at [[University College London]]. After graduating with a first class honours degree in 1924, Comino served a three-year apprenticeship with [[British Thomson-Houston]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] before leaving to establish a [[printing]] business, Krisson Printing Ltd, near [[Oxford Circus]] in central London ("Krisson" being [[Greek language|Greek]] for 'better').&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eiloari"&gt;Eiloari, Tim "Right Angle" ''New Scientist'', 13 December 1973, p.798.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing business grew quickly, but Comino never felt happy in printing and wanted further business challenges.&lt;ref name="Eiloari" /&gt; In 1937, he established Dexion Ltd (from the Greek for 'right') to market products he had developed and patented to improve the efficiency of the printing process. These included: a gauge to check the squareness and register of a printer's forme;&lt;ref&gt;US patent 23138293, Gauge Device, Demetrius Comino, 1938 – http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2138293.html&lt;/ref&gt; trolleys; chutes; a duplicate book;&lt;ref&gt;Duplicate book patent, dated April 1936 – http://ip.com/patent/CA357121A (accessed 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; interlocking frames to hold print in place inside the chase; and a compositor's chart.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius Comino – 8 patents – http://www.patentmaps.com/assignee/Demetrius_Comino_1.html (accessed 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As a printer, he was also concerned about the lack of versatility of the wooden shelving often for storing paper and other consumables. He began to work on steel shelving which could readily be assembled, dismantled and then reassembled. By 1939 he had developed an angled section made of steel with slots cut down one side and a long groove cut down the other. [[Birmingham]]-based [[Accles &amp; Pollock]] manufactured an initial batch which was delivered in late August, a week before the declaration of the [[Second World War]] on 3 September 1939, and Comino sold most of this angled section to local stores of [[Lillywhites]], [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]] and [[Selfridges]].&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

During the war, partly because of paper rationing, the Krisson printing business shrank, but Comino's engineering background and problem-solving mentality helped him shift into new areas of machining. Having turned down a managerial position in an aircraft factory offered by the [[Minister of Aircraft Production|Ministry of Aircraft Production]], he installed equipment to make aircraft parts, with the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]] allocating lathes, drills, milling machines and other machine tools.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Comino continued to experiment with the angled steel lengths made before the war. Eventually, he worked out that by fitting one angled section into another and bolting them together through carefully positioned holes he could produce a very rigid joint, and, in addition to [[adjustable shelving]], he began to develop ideas of what other structures could be created using the product.

==Dexion==
{{Main|Dexion}}
After the war, Krisson resumed as a printing business, but Comino left day-to-day management in the hands of senior staff so that he could devote himself to the Dexion slotted angle concept (though he did write a history of the printing business, published as ''The Krisson Story'' in 1953). Several prototypes were made, and in 1946, with £7000 savings and £7000 borrowed from Krisson's bankers, he invested in a second-hand Henry &amp; Wright standard [[Die (manufacturing)|die press]], and began manufacture, adapting the press so that the steel strip could be continuously fed into it and painted. In May 1947, he established a factory in [[Chingford]] in north-east London, staffed by nine factory workers and one sales person,&lt;ref&gt;Dexion Commercial Pty Ltd; background to company – http://www.geca.org.au/company---dexion-commercial.html (accessed: 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but sales were initially disappointing, partly due to post-war cash payment requirements. However, sales and production increased to 50,000 feet per week in 1949, generating a business turnover of £500,000 that year. During 1950, the Dexion strips began to be used for exhibitions, and production reached 125,000 feet per week, and a new Dexion factory was opened in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]].&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

Dexion quickly faced competition. The prior existence of [[Meccano]] prevented a generic patent&lt;ref name="NewSci"&gt;Profile: Demetrius Comino "The secret is: think about first principles", ''New Scientist'', 25 July 1957, pp.20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; so Dexion patents were restricted to slot and hole configurations,&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: Rigid Angle Joint patent 2746780, Filing date 27 November 1951; issued 22 May 1956. http://www.google.com/patents/US2746780&lt;/ref&gt; and other UK and European companies began offering different hole patterns and metal strip thicknesses. But by 1956 Dexion's turnover exceeded £2m, and of the company's 700 employees, 200 were based outside its three UK plants – in factories in Australia, [[Belgium]] and Canada, with licensees in other countries (France, [[Chile]], Spain, [[Argentina]] and the US).

The main scoreboard and television platform at the [[1956 Winter Olympics]]' ski stadium at [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] was constructed from Dexion, and [[Ghana]]'s independence celebrations in 1957 involved grandstands for 10,000 people, six miles of crush barriers and 500 bunting poles – all made of Dexion.&lt;ref name="NewSci" /&gt;

In 1968, the company went public, buoyed by results showing a 40% increase in world sales to £14m and a new record profit of £1.133m. However, the early 1970s UK recession proved challenging, and following two poor trading years, Dexion came to the attention of Chicago-based steel company [[Interlake Inc]], and a £9.4m sale eventually took place in July 1974, valuing Dexion at £4m less than its 1968 flotation price. Comino, by this point Dexion's chairman, retired, though he retained a place on the company's board until 1978.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

Under its new management, Dexion flourished for 20 years with sales reaching £200m by 1995. Interlake then sold Dexion, with ownership eventually passing to the [[Norway]]-based [[Constructor Group AS]]. UK manufacture ceased in 2003, but Dexion warehouse solutions are still marketed, generating a 2010 turnover of €100m from operations in 30 European countries.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

==Philanthropy==

===Disaster relief===
After the August [[1953 Ionian earthquake|1953 earthquake]] rocked the [[Ionian Islands]] in Greece, Dexion donated 20,000 feet of its product for new housing (a prototype house was designed within three weeks). "Operation Ulysses" attracted worldwide attention, including an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;The Great Frame-Up. ''Time'', 23 November 1953 – reproduced at http://www.kythera-family.net/index.php?nav=5-56&amp;hits=20&amp;did=11001 (accessed: 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[British Pathe]] newsreels.&lt;ref&gt;Operation Ulysses – http://www.britishpathe.com/video/dexion-houses/query/dexion and http://www.britishpathe.com/video/new-homes-for-quake-victims (both accessed: 17 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dexion made a similar gesture following the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]], providing Dexion building frame materials to enable 49 Royal Engineers to build 1560 dwellings, enough for two complete villages, one of which was nicknamed Dexiongrad.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Yorker'', 17 October 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis Ian (1977) "Emergency Shelters", ''Disasters: the international journal of disaster relief'', vol 1, no 1, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Comino was appointed [[OBE]] in 1963 for services to industry.

===The Comino Foundation===
{{Main|Comino Foundation}}
Throughout his working life, Comino had looked to develop generic approaches to practical problem-solving.&lt;ref name="Eiloari" /&gt; He devised a simple 'Problem-solving Procedure' (PSP) in 1956; he then defined the essential ingredients for problem solving and achievement – PACRA (Purpose-Alternatives-Criteria-Resources-Action); he then promoted what became the GRASP process (Getting Results And Solving Problems – also known as Getting Results and Seizing Potential). These ideas led him to establish the Comino Foundation educational charity in 1971, a step which was financially supported by the proceeds of some dividend income following the 1968 public flotation of Dexion.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

The Foundation's objectives included promotion of GRASP and also attempted to change attitudes to manufacturing in the UK. An early activity was a series of discussion dinners organised by [[Edward de Bono]] between 1976 and 1980. Comino also worked with [[Keith Jackson (educationalist)|Keith Jackson]] who was researching problem-solving at the then [[Henley Business School|Henley Administrative Staff College]]; the Foundation then part-funded Jackson for several years as a Professor at the Centre for Education Management at [[Bulmershe College of Higher Education]] near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], pioneering work on applying the GRASP approach in schools in [[Metropolitan Borough of Dudley|Dudley]] that continued through to 1989.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Williams, (1993) "The achieving school", Managing Service Quality, Vol. 3 Iss: 1, pp.395 – 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Val &amp; Little, Vivienne (1997) 'GRASPing' for development, Teacher Development: An international journal of teachers' professional development, volume 1, issue 2, pp.219–231. Original accessible via http://www.informaworld.com (fee required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1989 also saw the publication of Keith Jackson's book ''Getting Results and Solving Problems in Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Comino was also involved with discussions about 'anti-industrial' attitudes, and the Comino Foundation funded a fellowship which enabled [[Kenneth Adams]] to study and identify the causes of such views, producing a report "Attitudes to Industry in Britain" in 1979. The next Comino Fellowship was awarded through the [[Royal Society of Arts]], which established a Comino Fellowship Committee 'to change the cultural attitude to industry from one of lack of interest or dislike to one of concern and esteem'. This eventually led to a joint government/industry initiative to promote 1986 as "Industry Year", with the RSA and the Comino Foundation providing core funding of £250,000 – which persuaded the [[Confederation of British Industry]] to raise £1 million and government departments to provide £3 million.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In September 1935, Comino married Katina Georgiadi, the daughter of a well-respected [[Rhodes]] family.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire" /&gt; Together they had one daughter, Anna.

Comino died of a heart attack on 27 September 1988 while on holiday in [[Athens]]. A memorial tribute dinner was held on 5 June 1989 at the RSA.

==Legacy==
Comino's association with Dexion in the UK was marketed until December 2011 with Constructor Group's UK sales office in [[Swindon]] trading as Dexion Comino Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;New UK Sales Director for Dexion Comino Ltd http://www.dexion.co.uk/About-us/News--Events/New-UK-Sales-Director/ (accessed: 24 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dexion Comino Ltd change of name notified to Companies House, 23 December 2011 – http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/937eb7bbc761d9c1d99b223eb5015b7d/compdetails (accessed: 24 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comino Foundation continues, and supports Comino Centres at the [[University of Winchester]], [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and [[Liverpool John Moores University]].&lt;ref&gt;Comino Foundation – http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/F2_Contact.html (accessed: 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comino is also commemorated through an annual award by the Supply Chain &amp; Logistics Association of Australia, which since 1980 has presented an annual "Storage and Handling of Materials Award" trophy dedicated to the Dexion founder.&lt;ref&gt;Finalists announced for prestigious 2011 Australian Supply Chain &amp; Logistics Awards http://sclaa.com.au/News/NationalNews/AustralianSupplyChainLogisticsAwards2011.aspx (accessed: 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3872">The '''European Operations Management Association''' (EurOMA) is an international network of academics and practitioners from around the world who have a common interest in the continuing development of Operations Management. EurOMA is a European-based network with rapidly growing international links, whereby members can share their ideas, knowledge, and experience. It is a communication network that bridges the gap between research and practice. Together with its American- and Japan-based counterparts, the [http://www.poms.org Production and Operations Management Society] (POMS) and [http://e-jomsa.jp/annaieng.html Japanese Operations Management and Strategy Association] (JOMSA), EurOMA is working towards extending the arena of [[Operations management|Operations Management]] throughout the world by bringing the professionals in the field closer together.

EurOMA places a key focus for development and application of knowledge; excellence in manufacturing and service operations must be led by the development of new knowledge. The Association provides such a focus for identifying and disseminating the latest thinking and research as well as for exploring current issues in OM, thereby setting research agendas for the future.  The International Annual EurOMA Conference is a major forum for the presentation of new ideas and developments in the field.

Furthermore, EurOMA aims to support education in Operations Management by promoting a wide range of academic activities designed to advance the teaching and learning of Operations Management, including workshops, seminars, summer schools and forums.

The current EurOMA president is [http://www.dig.polimi.it/index.php?id=251 Raffaella Cagliano] of the Politecnico di Milano, who heads up the [http://www.euroma-online.org/r/default.asp?iId=GLKGM EurOMA board].

==Origins==
The Association was originally formed as a UK-based group (OMA) in 1984, and rapidly grew into Europe's leading professional association for Operations Management. The expanding European dimension led to the forming of the European Operations Management Association (EurOMA) in October 1993.  EurOMA is a professional non-profit association, and currently administered by EIASM, the [http://www.eiasm.org European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management].

==Activities==
*'''Annual conference:''' EurOMA hosts an annual conference that brings together Operations Management scholars from across the world. It also participates in joint events with its US partner organisation, the [http://www.poms.org Production and Operations Management Society] (POMS).
*'''Publications:''' The official journal of EurOMA is the [[International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management]] (IJOPM), which provides a communication medium for all those working in the operations management field, whether they work in academic institutions, in industry or in consultancy.  The content of the journal focuses on topics which have a substantial management (as opposed to technical) content.
*'''Education:''' EurOMA hosts many educational and training programs, including the EurOMA Summer School, the Annual Doctoral Workshop, and the Service Operations Management forum.

In the [[United States]], an '''excess profits tax''' is a tax, some say [[excise tax]], on any [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] above a certain amount. A predominantly wartime fiscal instrument, the tax was designed primarily to capture wartime profits that exceeded normal peacetime profits to prevent [[perverse incentive]]s for manufacturers to engage in [[war profiteering]] and warmongering.{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}

In 1863 the Confederate congress and the state of Georgia experimented with excess profits taxes, perhaps, the first time it has happened in American history. 
==20th century==
===United Kingdom===
In Great Britain in World War I, the Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Arnold, "‘A paradise for profiteers’? The importance and treatment of profits during the First World War." ''Accounting History Review'' 24#2-3 (2014): 61-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Billings and Lynne Oats, "Innovation and pragmatism in tax design: Excess Profits Duty in the UK during the First World War." ''Accounting History Review'' 24#2-3 (2014): 83-101. &lt;/ref&gt;  Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax at this time in Britain.

===United States===
The first effective American excess profits tax was enacted in 1917, with rates graduated from 20 to 60 percent on the profits of all businesses in excess of prewar earnings but not less than 7 percent or more than 9 percent of invested capital. In 1918 a national law limited the tax to corporations and increased the rates. Concurrent with this 1918 tax, the federal government imposed, for the year 1918 only, an alternative tax, ranging up to 80 percent, with the taxpayer paying whichever was higher. In 1921 the excess profits tax was repealed despite powerful attempts to make it permanent. In 1933 and 1935 Congress enacted two mild excess profits taxes as supplements to a capital stock tax.

The crisis of [[World War II]] led Congress to pass four excess profits statutes between 1940 and 1943. The 1940 rates ranged from 25 to 50 percent and the 1941 ones from 35 to 60 percent. In 1942 a flat rate of 90 percent was adopted, with a postwar refund of 10 percent; in 1943 the rate was increased to 95 percent, with a 10 percent refund. Congress gave corporations two alternative excess profits tax credit choices: either 95 percent of average earnings for 1936–1939 or an invested capital credit, initially 8 percent of capital but later graduated from 5 to 8 percent. In 1945 Congress repealed the tax, effective 1 January 1946. The Korean War induced Congress to reimpose an excess profits tax, effective from 1 July 1950 to 31 December 1953. The tax rate was 30 percent of excess profits with the top [[corporate tax]] rate rising from 45% to 47%, a 70 percent ceiling for the combined corporation and excess profits taxes.

In 1991 some members of Congress sought unsuccessfully to pass an excess profits tax of 40 percent upon the larger oil companies as part of energy policy.
Some social reformers have championed a peacetime use of the excess profits tax, but such proposals face strong opposition from businesses and some economists, who argue that it would create a disincentive to capital investment.

==Biography==
Born Dec. 10, 1756 in [[Hanover, Pennsylvania]], the son of Henry Bedinger (1729-1772) and Magdelena Schlegel (1734-1796).  Bedinger attended an English school. The family moved to Virginia about 1762 and to Kentucky in 1779 and settled at Boonesborough. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], he served as adjutant in [[John Bowman (pioneer)|John Bowman's]] expedition against [[Chalahgawtha|Chillicothe]] in May 1779. He returned to Virginia and served at the [[siege of Yorktown]], and therefore missed the [[Battle of Blue Licks]] in Kentucky.

During the [[Northwest Indian War]], he was a major in [[Drake's Regiment]] in 1791, a major commanding the Winchester Battalion of Sharpshooters in the [[St. Clair's Defeat|St. Clair expedition]] in 1791, and a major commanding the Third Sublegion of the United States Infantry from April 11, 1792, to February 28, 1793.

He served as member of the State house of representatives of the first legislature of Kentucky in 1792. He served in the State senate in 1800 and 1801.

Bedinger was elected as a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]] to the [[8th United States Congress|Eighth]] and [[9th United States Congress|Ninth]] Congresses (March 4, 1803 – March 3, 1807).
He engaged in agricultural pursuits.
He died at [[Blue Licks Springs, Kentucky]], December 7, 1843.
He was interred in the family cemetery on his farm near [[Lower Blue Licks Springs, Kentucky]].

'''Captain Homer Washington Hedge''' (Sept 29, 1863, Norwich CT – Sept 10, 1909) was a wealthy advertising executive in New York City. He helped to found both the Automobile Club of America (currently known as the  [[American Automobile Association]]) and the [[Aero Club of America]]. He was an avid [[balloonist]] and competed in the sport of balloon racing.

==Biography==
At the age of 25, in 1888, Hedge joined the First Signal Corp. of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in New York City. He worked out of their recruiting office until 1898. By the end of this period, he had risen to the rank of Captain. He was referred to as "Captain" for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Annual report of the Adjutant-General of the State of New York for the Year 1893 | publisher = James B. Lyon | location = Albany | year = 1894 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-8CgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | accessdate = 2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hedge managed the Manhattan offices of Pettingill &amp; Company, a large New York advertising agency. In April 1904, he purchased the New York offices, and it became the Homer W. Hedge Company. At the time, this was one of the largest advertising agencies in the U.S. Their customers included Equitable Life Insurance, the [[Electric Vehicle Company]], and the [[Remington Arms Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = With Ample Capital | journal= Printers' Ink |year = 1904 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GPI1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8 | accessdate = 2012-03-12 | page = 8 | volume = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 1899, a group of gentlemen auto racers met at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan and founded the [[Automobile Club of America]], an organization that became the [[American Automobile Association]] . At that meeting, Homer W. Hedge was elected secretary, a post he retained for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Automobile Club Formed | date=17 October 1899 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/10/17/117931914.pdf | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Hedge became Founder and first President of the [[Aero Club of America]].

Hedge was the author of a book on ballooning, The American Aeronaut (1907).

'''ISO 10962''' defines the structure and format for classification of [[financial instrument]]s approved by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).
There are many types of Financial Instruments used for saving, investing, trading, hedging and speculating.  These instruments are generally organized in groups called "asset classifications." The most common asset classifications are generally described using terms like "Equities (Stocks)," "Debt (Bonds)," "Derivatives (Contracts)," "Currencies," and a few other generalized terms. 

ISO 10962 provides a global standard for these classifications in the form of specific codes.  Classification of financial instrument (CFI) Code is used to define and describe [[financial instruments]] as a uniform set of codes for all market participants.&lt;ref name="annaweb"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = CFI &amp; ISO 10962 on ANNA website
  | publisher = Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA)
  | url = http://www.anna-web.org/standards/cfi-iso-10962
  | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The code is issued by the members of [http://www.anna-web.org/standards/cfi-iso-10962 ANNA, the Association of National Numbering Agencies].  The group is currently working to simplify the structure so that it can be adopted more widely by non-governmental market participants.

The [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s from the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] in each position of this 6 character code reflect specific characteristics intrinsic to the financial instruments that are defined at the issue of the instrument, and which in most cases remain unchanged during the lifetime of the instrument (or by the market on which the instrument trades).&lt;ref name="fix"&gt;{{Cite web

==History of ISO 10962 Modification==
* Standard was first accepted and published in 1997
* The last revised and accepted version of the standard is ISO 10962:2015 and was published by ISO in 2015.&lt;ref name="iso1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/44799.html|title=ISO 10962:2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=International Organization for Standardization (ISO)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302082529/https://www.iso.org/standard/44799.html|archive-date=2017-03-02|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2006 [[FIX Protocol|FIX Protocol group]] published a proposal for changes of the standard for Consultation, but the changes have not yet been accepted.&lt;ref name="fix"/&gt; 
* As of May 17, 2013 an update of the standard is under development &lt;ref name="iso2"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = ISO/CD 10962
  | publisher = International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44799
  | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and Goals of Introduction==

Where distinct entities transact it is seen as helpful to establish a common transaction language. The CFI code is meant to provide the most comprehensive information possible, while at the same time maintaining the code manageability, provides a standard for identification of type of instrument and their main high level characteristics, determined by the intrinsic characteristics of the financial instrument, which would be independent of the individual names or conventions of a given country or financial institution. This principle avoids confusion arising from different linguistic usage as well as redundancy, while allowing an objective comparison of the instruments across markets.&lt;ref name="fix"/&gt;

CFI codes also aim to simplify electronic communication between participants, improve understanding of the characteristics of financial instruments for the investors, and allow securities grouping in a consistent manner for reporting and categorization purposes.&lt;ref name="annaweb"/&gt;

==Structure of CFI Code==
* The first character indicates the highest level of category to which the instrument belongs: Equities, Debt, Entitlements (Rights, Warrants), Options, Futures and Others (Miscellaneous).&lt;ref name="cnvm"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = CFI Code description on CNVM site
  | publisher = The Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNVM)
  | url = http://www.cnmv.es/portal/ANCV/CodigoCFI.aspx?lang=en
  | accessdate = 30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second character refers to specific groups within each category. For example, the subdivisions of the Equities category are: ordinary shares, preferred/preference shares, units, and others, while for the Debt instruments category, the subdivisions are: bonds, convertible bonds, money market instruments, and others.&lt;ref name="cnvm"/&gt;
* The other four characters refer to each group's main features. For example, in the case of equities, whether they are voting or non-voting, restrictions, payment status, etc. In the case of Debt instruments, the type of interest (fixed or variable), guarantee, form of redemption, etc.&lt;ref name="cnvm"/&gt;
* The letter '''X''' always means ''Not Applicable/Undefined''.

'''Jacques Dauphin''' (July 4, 1923 &amp;ndash; April 1, 1994) was a French advertising pioneer&lt;ref name="He is referred to as a pioneer"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of FEPE|url=http://www.fepe.com/page.php?id=31|publisher=FEPE official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  founder and CEO of Dauphin OTA. He is best known as the father of modern [[billboard]] [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durand|first=Dominique|title=Le Livre du Mur Peint (Painted Walls) - Preface by Jacques Dauphin as the inventor of painted walls as advertising mediums|year=1985|publisher=Editions Alternatives|location=Paris|pages=166|url=http://www.priceminister.com/offer/buy/131712145/le-livre-du-mur-peint-art-et-techniques-de-durand-dominique-et-boulogne-daniel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation and OOH are synonymous: John Ellery|url=http://www.mxmindia.com/2011/09/exclusive-interview-with-john-ellery/}} Jacques Dauphin is cited as "legendary".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notre histoire|url=http://www.clearchannel.fr/notre-histoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Dauphin OTA was sold to the American company [[Clear Channel]] and became an emblematic part of its outdoor communication division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History|url=http://www.clearchannel.com/Corporate/PressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID=1166&amp;p=hidden|publisher=Clear Channel official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clear Channel acquires Dauphin OTA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clear Channel Buys Stake In French Outdoor Ad Company|url=http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=19990611fai|publisher=San Diego Daily Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
After graduating with a law degree from Faculte de droit de Paris and from [[HEC Paris]], Jacques Dauphin re-opened the Parisian-based office created by his father Eugene Dauphin&lt;ref name="Eugene Dauphin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Lucy|title=Media Briefs|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/58816/Media-Briefs/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|publisher=Marketing|accessdate=17 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1921 who closed it during WWII to prevent any collaboration with the Nazis. He then developed the company to a broader scale after the French Liberation expanding its activities (mainly billboard advertising and radio) to other European countries including the UK, Belgium, Italy or Spain.&lt;ref name="Eugene Dauphin"/&gt; Jacques Dauphin has notably created and developed the 4x3 format that remains today the international standard format used in billboard advertising worldwide.

==Career==
His professional achievements have been honoured in several occasions and he has successively occupied the following positions: president (1958 - 1966) of the national outdoor advertising federations of France, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands best known as FEPE that he created&lt;ref name="He is referred to as a pioneer"/&gt; and the [[International Advertising Association]]. He was then vice-president (1969), president (1972 - 1974), and honorary president of the French Chambers of advertising. He presided the 3rd World Congress of Outdoor Advertising in London in 1972. He was a member of the International Commission « Publicité distribution » of the International Chamber of Commerce, and co-president of Grand prix international de l´affichage. He has been made Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] and Knight of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dauphin Coat of Arms and Name History|url=http://www.houseofnames.com/dauphin-coat-of-arms|publisher=House of Names}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Personal Interests==
[[File:Dauphin aime le cinéma, Cannes 1989.jpg|thumb|344x344px|Dauphin’s campaign and billboard advertising in support of the Cannes Film Festival - 1989]]Through Dauphin OTA Jacques Dauphin was also particularly active in the promotion of the arts and image. 

He notably promoted the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the French International Contemporary Art Fair best known as FIAC.

Through Dauphin, Jacques Dauphin has commissioned and inspired various artists, such as [[Daniel Buren]] or [[François Morellet]] among others.

Jacques Dauphin has turned billboard advertising into a popular art form, a witness of the contemporary society, and one of the leading media of the XXth century in Europe.

==Other facts==
After his only son died in a tragic car accident in 1988 Jacques Dauphin had no heir to take up the business that has led to the sale of the company in 1999.

His only heiress is his only granddaughter Charlotte de La Rochefoucauld (born Charlotte Dauphin in 1987) who has married Comte Charles-Henri de La Rochefoucauld in 2012 in Saint-Louis des Invalides cathedral in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=William 1|title=Hanover8|url=http://www.william1.co.uk/han8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Royal forums|title=Noble Marriages Announcements 2012|url=http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f265/noble-marriages-announcements-2012-a-32280-3.html|publisher=The Royal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Dauphin's life and career, his personality, leadership, and his passion for sailing have inspired French film director [[Claude Lelouch]] for his film [[Itinerary of a Spoiled Child]] and its lead character Sam Lion.

== Quotes ==
“Billboard advertising is a visual rape.”

“Our billboards are our stage, our trestles: we are an entertainment business, a performing art company.”

“Billboards are the infantry of advertising.”

'''Mass production''', also known as flow production or continuous production, is the production of large amounts of [[standardized]] products, including and especially on [[assembly line]]s. Together with [[job production]] and [[batch production]], it is one of the three main production methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/business/production/methodsofproductionrev1.shtml Production Methods], BBC GCSE Bitesize, retrieved 2012-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mass production'' was popularized by a 1926 article in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' supplement that was written based on correspondence with [[Ford Motor Company]].  The ''New York Times'' used the term in the title of an article that appeared before publication of the ''Britannica'' article.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of mass production are applied to various kinds of products, from [[fluids]] and particulates handled in bulk (such as [[food]], [[fuel]], [[chemicals]], and [[mining|mined]] [[minerals]]) to discrete solid parts (such as fasteners) to assemblies of such parts (such as [[household appliances]] and [[automobiles]]).

Mass production is a diverse field, but it can generally be contrasted with [[craft production]] or [[distributed manufacturing]]. Some mass production techniques, such as standardized sizes and production lines, predate the [[Industrial Revolution]] by many centuries; however, it was not until the introduction of [[machine tool]]s and techniques to produce interchangeable parts were developed in the mid 19th century that modern mass production was possible.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

==Overview==
Mass production involves making many copies of products, very quickly, using assembly line techniques to send partially complete products to workers who each work on an individual step, rather than having a worker work on a whole product from start to finish.

Mass production of fluid matter typically involves pipes with [[centrifugal pump]]s or [[screw conveyor]]s (augers) to transfer raw materials or partially complete products between vessels.  Fluid flow processes such as oil refining and bulk materials such as wood chips and pulp are automated using a system of [[process control]] which uses various instruments to measure variables such as temperature, pressure, volumetric  and level, providing feedback

Bulk materials such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or [[screw conveyor|screw]] conveyors, [[bucket elevator]]s and mobile equipment such as front-end [[Loader (equipment)|loaders]].  Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts.  Also used for handling heavy items like reels of paper, steel or machinery are electric [[overhead crane]]s, sometimes called bridge cranes because they span large factory bays.

Mass production is [[Capital intensity|capital intensive]] and energy intensive, as it uses a high proportion of machinery and energy in relation to workers. It is also usually [[Automation|automated]] while total expenditure per unit of product is decreased. However, the machinery that is needed to set up a mass production line (such as [[robot]]s and [[machine press]]es) is so expensive that there must be some assurance that the product is to be successful to attain profits.

One of the descriptions of mass production is that "the skill is built into the tool" {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}, which means that the worker using the tool may not need the skill. For example, in the 19th or early 20th century, this could be expressed as "the craftsmanship is in the [[workbench]] itself" (not the training of the worker). Rather than having a skilled worker measure every dimension of each part of the product against the plans or the other parts as it is being formed, there were [[jig (tool)|jigs]] ready at hand to ensure that the part was made to fit this set-up. It had already been checked that the finished part would be to specifications to fit all the other finished parts—and it would be made more quickly, with no time spent on finishing the parts to fit one another. Later, once computerized control came about (for example, [[CNC]]), jigs were obviated, but it remained true that the skill (or knowledge) was built into the tool (or process, or documentation) rather than residing in the worker's head. This is the specialized capital required for mass production; each workbench and set of tools (or each CNC cell, or each [[fractionating column]]) is different (fine-tuned to its task).

==History==
=== Pre-industrial ===
Standardized parts and sizes and factory production techniques were developed in pre-industrial times; however, before the invention of [[machine tool]]s the manufacture of precision parts, especially metal ones, was very labor-intensive.

[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|upright|This [[woodcut]] from 1568 shows the left printer removing a page from the press while the one at right inks the text-blocks. Such a duo could reach 14,000 hand movements per working day, printing around 3,600 pages in the process.&lt;ref name="Wolf 1974, 67f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f.}}: {{quote|From old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Crossbows]] made with bronze parts were produced in [[China]] during the [[Warring States period]]. The Qin Emperor unified China at least in part by equipping large armies with these weapons, which were equipped with a sophisticated trigger mechanism made of interchangeable parts.&lt;ref&gt;Mass-Produced Pre-Han Chinese Bronze Crossbow Triggers: Unparalleled Manufacturing Technology in the Ancient World. by David Williams. Arms &amp; Armour, Volume 5, Number 2, October 2008 , pp. 142-153(12) http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/aaa/2008/00000005/00000002/art00003  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211212949/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/aaa/2008/00000005/00000002/art00003 |date=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galley|Ships of war]] were produced on a large scale at a moderate cost by the [[Carthaginians]] in their excellent harbors, allowing them to efficiently maintain their control of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Venice|Venetians]] themselves also produced ships using prefabricated parts and [[assembly line]]s many centuries later. The [[Venetian Arsenal]] apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world's first [[factory]] which, at its height, employed 16,000 people. Mass production in the publishing industry has been commonplace since the [[Gutenberg Bible]] was published using a [[printing press]] in the mid-15th century.

===Industrial===
In the [[Industrial Revolution]] simple mass production techniques were used at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in England to make ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It was achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]] under the management of Sir [[Samuel Bentham]].&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt;The first unmistakable examples of manufacturing operations carefully designed to reduce production costs by specialized labour and the use of machines appeared in the 18th century in England. &lt;ref&gt; Brumcarrier &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|left|A pulley block for rigging on a sailing ship. By 1808, annual production in Portsmouth reached 130,000 blocks.]]
The Navy was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 [[Block (sailing)|pulley blocks]] to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system. Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a pioneer of machine tool technology who had developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800 which standardized [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time which in turn allowed the application of [[interchangeable parts]], collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components.&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt; A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made into one of three possible sizes.&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt; The machines were almost entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour [[productivity]] due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel's son and engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain labour of one hundred and ten.&lt;ref name="Pulleys"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1808, annual production from the 45 machines had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Pulleys"&gt;[http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&amp;tv=true "The Portsmouth blockmaking machinery"]. makingthemodernworld.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm "Portsmouth Royal Dockyard Historical Trust: History 1690 - 1840"]. portsmouthdockyard.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production techniques were also used to rather limited extent to make clocks and watches, and to make small arms, though parts were usually non-interchangeable.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though produced on a very small scale, [[Crimean War]] gunboat engines designed and assembled by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]] of Greenwich are recorded as the first instance of the application of mass production techniques (though not necessarily the assembly-line method) to marine engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Osborn |first1=G.A. |year=1965 |title=The Crimean War gunboats, part 1 |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=51 |issue= 2|pages=103–116 |publisher= |doi=10.1080/00253359.1965.10657815 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In filling an Admiralty order for 90 sets to his high-pressure and high-revolution horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Trunk|trunk engine]] design, Penn produced them all in 90 days. He also used [[British Standard Whitworth|Whitworth Standard]] threads throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= |first= |last= |newspaper=The Times |date=24 January 1887 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prerequisites for the wide use of mass production were [[interchangeable parts]], [[machine tools]] and [[power (physics)|power]], especially in the form of [[electricity]].

Some of the organizational management concepts needed to create 20th-century mass production, such as [[scientific management]], had been pioneered by other engineers (most of whom are not famous, but [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] is one of the well-known ones), whose work would later be synthesized into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[operations research]], and [[management consultancy]]. Although after leaving the [[Henry Ford Company]] which was rebranded as [[Cadillac]] and later was awarded the [[Dewar Trophy]] in 1908 for creating interchangeable mass-produced precision engine parts, [[Henry Ford]] downplayed the role of Taylorism in the development of mass production at his company. However, Ford management performed time studies and experiments to mechanize their factory processes, focusing on minimizing worker movements. The difference is that while Taylor focused mostly on efficiency of the worker, Ford also substituted for labor by using machines, thoughtfully arranged, wherever possible.


In 1807, [[Eli Terry]] was hired to produce 4,000 wooden movement clocks in the Porter Contract. At this time, the annual yield for wooden clocks did not exceed a few dozen on average. Terry developed a [[Milling machine]] in 1795, in which he perfected [[Interchangeable parts]]. In 1807, Terry developed a spindle cutting machine, which could produce multiple parts at the same time. Terry hired [[Silas Hoadley]] and [[Seth Thomas (clockmaker)|Seth Thomas]] to work the [[Assembly line]] at the facilities. The Porter Contract was the first contract which called for mass production of clock movements in history. In 1815, Terry began mass producing the first shelf clock. [[Chauncey Jerome]], an apprentice of Eli Terry mass produced up to 20,000 brass clocks annually in 1840 when he invented the cheap 30 hour OG clock. &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Kenneth D., and Snowden Taylor. Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock. Ken Roberts Publishing, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of War]] sponsored the development of interchangeable parts for guns produced at the arsenals at [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] and [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], Virginia (now West Virginia) in the early decades of the 19th century, finally achieving reliable interchangeability by about 1850.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; This period coincided with the development of [[machine tools]], with the armories designing and building many of their own.  Some of the methods employed were a system of gauges for checking dimensions of the various parts and [[jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[fixture (tool)|fixture]]s for guiding the machine tools and properly holding and aligning the work pieces.  This system came to be known as ''armory practice'' or the ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'', which spread throughout New England aided by skilled mechanics from the armories who were instrumental in transferring the technology to the sewing machines manufacturers and other industries such as machine tools, harvesting machines and bicycles. [[Singer Corporation|Singer Manufacturing Co.]], at one time the largest sewing machine manufacturer, did not achieve interchangeable parts until the late 1880s, around the same time [[Cyrus McCormick]] adopted modern manufacturing practices in making [[reaper|harvesting machines]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

Mass production benefited from the development of materials such as inexpensive steel, high strength steel and plastics. Machining of metals was greatly enhanced with [[high speed steel]] and later very hard materials such as [[tungsten carbide]] for cutting edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabrication using steel components was aided by the development of [[electric resistance welding|electric welding]] and stamped steel parts, both which appeared in industry in about 1890. Plastics such as [[polyethylene]], [[polystyrene]] and [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) can be easily formed into shapes by [[plastics extrusion|extrusion]], [[blow molding]] or [[injection molding]], resulting in very low cost manufacture of consumer products, plastic piping, containers and parts.

An influential article that helped to frame and popularize the 20th century's definition of mass production appeared in a 1926 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' supplement. The article was written based on correspondence with Ford Motor Company and is sometimes credited as the first use of the term.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factory electrification ===
[[Electrification]] of factories began very gradually in the 1890s after the introduction of a practical [[DC motor]] by [[Frank J. Sprague]] and accelerated after the [[AC motor]] was developed by [[Galileo Ferraris]], [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and others. Electrification of factories was fastest between 1900 and 1930, aided by the establishment of electric utilities with central stations and the lowering of electricity prices from 1914 to 1917.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"&gt;{{ Cite book

Electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation were more efficient than small steam engines and because [[line shaft]]s and belts had high friction losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal

Many factories saw a 30% increase in output just from changing over to electric motors.

Electrification enabled modern mass production, as with Thomas Edison’s iron ore processing plant (about 1893) that could process 20,000 tons of ore per day with two shifts of five men each. At that time it was still common to handle bulk materials with shovels, wheelbarrows and small narrow gauge rail cars, and for comparison, a canal digger in previous decades typically handled 5 tons per 12-hour day.

The biggest impact of early mass production was in manufacturing everyday items, such as at the [[Ball Brothers]] [[Ball Corporation|Glass Manufacturing Company]], which electrified its [[mason jar]] plant in [[Muncie, Indiana]], U.S. around 1900. The new automated process used glass blowing machines to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. Electric mixers replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 [[day labor]]ers for moving heavy loads across the factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology |last=Nye |first=David E. |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England |isbn= |pages=14, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Henry Ford]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |authorlink=Henry Ford |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |location= New York |page=15 (on line edition) |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/3936620.0001.001?view=toc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The provision of a whole new system of electric generation emancipated industry from the leather belt and [[line shaft]], for it eventually became possible to provide each tool with its own electric motor. This may seem only a detail of minor importance. In fact, modern industry could not be carried out with the belt and line shaft for a number of reasons. The motor enabled machinery to be arranged in the order of the work, and that alone has probably doubled the efficiency of industry, for it has cut out a tremendous amount of useless handling and hauling. The belt and [[line shaft]] were also tremendously wasteful – so wasteful indeed that no factory could be really large, for even the longest line shaft was small according to modern requirements. Also high speed tools were impossible under the old conditions – neither the pulleys nor the belts could stand modern speeds.  Without high speed tools and the finer steels which they brought about, there could be nothing of what we call modern industry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Airacobra P39 Assembly LOC 02902u.jpg|thumb|The assembly plant of the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1944. Note parts of [[overhead crane]] at both sides of photo near top.]]

Mass production was popularized in the late 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford's [[Ford Motor Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|}}&lt;/ref&gt; when introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production. Ford also bought or designed and built special purpose machine tools and fixtures such as multiple spindle [[Drill#Drill press|drill presses]] that could drill every hole on one side of an engine block in one operation and a multiple head [[milling machine]] that could simultaneously machine 15 engine blocks held on a single fixture. All of these machine tools were arranged systematically in the production flow and some had special carriages for rolling heavy items into machining position. Production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools.&lt;ref name= "Hounshell1984p288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The use of assembly lines==
[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913. The magneto assembly line was the first.]]
Mass production systems for items made of numerous parts are usually organized into [[assembly line]]s.  The assemblies pass by on a conveyor, or if they are heavy, hung from an [[overhead crane]] or monorail.

In a factory for a complex product, rather than one assembly line, there may be many auxiliary assembly lines feeding sub-assemblies (i.e. car engines or seats) to a backbone "main" assembly line.  A diagram of a typical mass-production factory looks more  like the skeleton of a fish than a single line.

==Vertical integration==
[[Vertical integration]] is a business practice that involves gaining complete control over a product's production, from raw materials to final assembly.

In the age of mass production, this caused shipping and trade problems in that shipping systems were unable to transport huge volumes of finished automobiles (in Henry Ford's case) without causing damage, and also government policies imposed trade barriers on finished units.&lt;ref&gt;''Womack, Jones, Roos; The Machine That Changed The World, Rawson &amp; Associates, New York. Published by Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford built the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] with the idea of making the company's own iron and steel in the same large factory site as parts and car assembly took place.  River Rouge also generated its own electricity.

Upstream vertical integration, such as to raw materials, is away from leading technology toward mature, low return industries. Most companies chose to focus on their core business rather than vertical integration.  This included buying parts from outside suppliers, who could often produce them as cheaply or cheaper.

[[Standard Oil]], the major oil company in the 19th century, was vertically integrated partly because there was no demand for unrefined crude oil, but kerosene and some other products were in great demand.  The other reason was that Standard Oil monopolized the oil industry.  The major oil companies were, and many still are, vertically integrated, from production to refining and with their own retail stations, although some sold off their retail operations.   Some oil companies also have chemical divisions.

Lumber and paper companies at one time owned most of their timber lands and sold some finished products such as corrugated boxes.  The tendency has been to divest of timber lands to raise cash and to avoid property taxes.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The economies of mass production come from several sources. The primary cause is a reduction of non-productive effort of all types. In [[craft production]], the craftsman must bustle about a shop, getting parts and assembling them. He must locate and use many tools many times for varying tasks. In mass production, each worker repeats one or a few related tasks that use the same tool to perform identical or near-identical operations on a stream of products. The exact tool and parts are always at hand, having been moved down the assembly line consecutively. The worker spends little or no time retrieving and/or preparing materials and tools, and so the time taken to manufacture a product using mass production is shorter than when using traditional methods.

The probability of [[human error]] and variation is also reduced, as tasks are predominantly carried out by machinery; error in operating such machinery, however, has more far-reaching consequences. A reduction in labour costs, as well as an increased rate of production, enables a company to produce a larger quantity of one product at a lower cost than using traditional, non-linear methods.

However, mass production is inflexible because it is difficult to alter a [[design]] or [[Manufacturing|production]] process after a [[production line]] is implemented. Also, all products produced on one production line will be identical or very similar, and introducing variety to satisfy individual tastes is not easy. However, some variety can be achieved by applying different finishes and decorations at the end of the production line if necessary. The starter cost for the machinery can be expensive so the producer must be sure it sells or the producers will lose a lot of money.

The Ford Model T produced tremendous affordable output but was not very good at responding to demand for variety, [[customization]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, or design changes. As a consequence Ford eventually lost market share to General Motors, who introduced annual model changes, more accessories and a choice of colors.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

With each passing decade, engineers have found ways to increase the flexibility of mass production systems, driving down the [[lead time]]s on new product development and allowing greater customization and variety of products.

==Socioeconomic impacts==
In the 1830s, French political thinker and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] identified one of the key characteristics of America that would later make it so amenable to the development of mass production: the homogeneous consumer base. De Tocqueville wrote in his ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) that "The absence in the United States of those vast accumulations of [[wealth]] which favor the expenditures of large sums on articles of mere luxury... impact to the productions of American industry a character distinct from that of other countries' industries. [Production is geared toward] articles suited to the wants of the whole people".

Mass production improved [[Productivity#Historical productivity: Major sources of growth and effects on living standards|productivity]], which was a contributing factor to economic growth and the decline in work week hours, alongside other factors such as transportation infrastructures (canals, railroads and highways) and agricultural mechanization.  These factors caused the typical work week to decline from 70 hours in the early 19th century to 60 hours late in the century, then to 50 hours in the early 20th century and finally to 40 hours in the mid-1930s.

Mass production permitted great increases in total production.  Using a European crafts system into the late 19th century it was difficult to meet demand for products such as sewing machines and animal powered mechanical [[reaper|harvesters]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt;  By the late 1920s many previously scarce goods were in good supply. One economist has argued that this constituted "overproduction" and contributed to high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression: The Macroeconomics of Electrification |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Say's law]] denies the possibility of general [[overproduction]] and for this reason classical economists deny that it had any role in the Great Depression.

Mass production allowed the [[sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[consumerism]] by lowering the [[unit cost]] of many goods used.

He is a resident of the UK having been granted political asylum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/bakiev-secures-interpol-victory&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Maksim Bakiyev has a legal background, having graduated from the joint [[Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University]]. As a student, Maksim worked in a consulting firm, specialized in investment into emerging markets in Central Asia and the Middle East. In March 2010 Maksim was widely believed to be the richest man in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/Politics/2010-06-15/maksim-bakiyev-most-wanted.html Maksim Bakiyev – most wanted in Kyrgyzstan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617024712/http://rt.com/Politics/2010-06-15/maksim-bakiyev-most-wanted.html |date=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Maksim was appointed the head of the Central Agency for Development in October 2009. Since the 2010 overthrow he has been charged with embezzlement and abuse of power by the interim government of Kyrgyzstan. It is suspected that he transferred about $35 million of a $300 million loan from Russia into his private bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100416/158613170.html |title=Bakiyev's son suspected of Russian loan embezzlement |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors also alleged that his companies owed almost $80 million in taxes on aviation fuel sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100615/ap_on_re_as/as_kyrgyzstan UN says violence in Kyrgyzstan was orchestrated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617212043/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100615/ap_on_re_as/as_kyrgyzstan |date=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A civil fraud claim regarding this was brought in the UK High Court and was withdrawn by two Kygrz Republic agencies in October 2016, and he has no charges for fraud against him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/kyrgyz-withdraws-20-million-fraud-claim-against-bakiev&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 Kyrgyzstan uprising|2010 uprising]] in Kyrgyzstan, Maxim Bakiyev was headed to the US for a series of meetings in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothkopf |first=David |url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/04/19/where_in_the_world_is_maksim_bakiyev |title=Where in the world is Maksim Bakiyev? |publisher=Blog.foreignpolicy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he never showed up. In May [[Interpol]] posted Maxim Bakiyev as wanted on its website. In 2016, following the successful dismissal of all fraud and criminal charges against Maxim Bakiev, Interpol withdrew its red notice against Mr Bakiev.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/bakiev-secures-interpol-victory&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and asylum==
On June 13, 2010, Maksim was arrested in the UK when he landed at [[Farnborough Airport]] in Hampshire in a privately hired jet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/met-arrests-son-of-ousted-kyrgyz-leader-8210436.html&lt;/ref&gt; He sought asylum there but the interim government demanded his extradition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/bakiev-secures-interpol-victory&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Kyrgyz official warned that the interim government would consider shutting down the U.S. [[Transit Center at Manas|Manas airbase]] if Britain refuses to hand him over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miriam Elder in Moscow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/17/kyrgyzstan-us-airbase-warning |title=Kyrgyzstan threatens to shut US base unless ex-president's son is extradited |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was later denounced by president of Kyrgyzstan, [[Roza Otunbayeva]].

On October 12, 2012, Bakiyev was arrested in London by UK extradition officers on the request of U.S. authorities, who want to question him for alleged involvement in fraud. In a statement, the Kyrgyz presidency declared: "''Because of the absence of an extradition agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic and Great Britain, the British side is now considering the issue of extraditing Maxim Bakiyev to the United States.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex Kyrgyz President's Son Arrested in London|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/ex-kyrgyz-presidents-son-arrested-in-london/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=13 October 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2013, a Kyrgyz court sentenced Bakiyev in absentia to 25 years in prison for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Kyrgyz President's Son Sentenced in Absentia to 25 years Jail|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/former-kyrgyz-presidents-son-sentenced-in-absentia-to-25-years-jail/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=28 March 2013|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, a US criminal securities fraud case against him was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-09/u-s-case-ends against-ex-kygryz-leader-bakiyev-s-son&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a personal injury claim against Maxim Bakiev was brought by British businessman Mr Sean Daley, alleging that his shooting and attempted murder in Bishkek had been organized and arranged by Mr Bakiev, was dismissed at the High Court of Justice in London as not "credible", "unsatisfactory" and "wholly implausible". Evidence submitted was stated by Mr Justice Supperstone to give "rise to real concern that it was made in collaboration with Mr Ismailov (the Kyrgyz prosecutor)for the purpose of ensuring the conviction of Mr Bakiev.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/high-court-dismisses-personal-injury-claim-against-maksim&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 South Kyrgyzstan unrest==
In May 2010, an audio recording&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KB8GAnNM78&amp;feature=channel |title=Phone conversation between Maksim and Janybek Bakiyev |publisher=Youtube |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was posted anonymously on YouTube with a caption identifying the voices as those of Maxim and his uncle [[Janish Bakiyev]]. The men were discussing plans to arm groups to spread chaos across the south of Kyrgyzstan, sometime in June. Both men have denied the authenticity of the tape and Bakiyev has repeatedly said he has no involvement in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/06/20106164631604263.html |title=Kyrgyz violence level 'alarming' |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence to incriminate the Bakievs in the June events.&lt;ref&gt;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_490.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyrgyz deputy Prime Minister [[Almazbek Atambayev]], claims that the [[2010 South Kyrgyzstan riots|2010 inter-ethnic riots in south Kyrgyzstan]] were paid for with $10 million from Bakiyev's pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100615/159430286.html |title=Kyrgyzstan to seek extradition of ex-president's son over riots |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Newbold Castle''' (born July 2, 1939) is an American attorney and politician who was [[Governor of Delaware]] (1985–92) and the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|DE|AL}} (1993–2011). He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

The district includes the entire state of Delaware and is the oldest intact surviving district in the nation. He was the longest-serving U.S. Representative in the state's history.&lt;ref name=whyy&gt;{{cite news|date=2009-10-06|work=WHYY|title=Rep.

He was the [[List of lieutenant governors of Delaware|20th]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Delaware]] from 1981 to 1985, and the [[List of Governors of Delaware|69th]] [[Governor of Delaware]] from 1985 to 1992.

On October 6, 2009, Castle announced his candidacy in the [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|2010 special election]] for the seat in the [[United States Senate]] held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Ted Kaufman]].&lt;ref name=announcement&gt;{{cite news|date=2009-10-06|work=FOX News|title=Delaware GOP Congressman to Run for Biden's Former Senate Seat|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/06/delaware-gop-congressman-run-bidens-senate-seat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman, appointed by Governor [[Ruth Ann Minner]] to fill the vacancy created by [[Joe Biden]] (who resigned to become [[Vice President of the United States]]), was not a candidate in the [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|special election]].&lt;ref name=kaufman&gt;{{cite news|date=2008-11-25|work=FOX News|title=Longtime Biden aide picked to fill his Senate seat|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Nov25/0,4670,BidenSenate,00.html|first=Sarah|last=Brumfield|access-date=2010-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604065650/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Nov25/0,4670,BidenSenate,00.html|archive-date=2011-06-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election would determine who would fill the balance of Biden's term, which would end on January 3, 2015. In one of the most surprising election results of the 2010 campaign season, Castle was defeated in the Republican primary for the US Senate seat by [[Christine O'Donnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/senate/christine-odonnell-upsets-mike.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Christine O'Donnell upsets Mike Castle in Delaware Senate primary}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would have been heavily favored in the general election against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Chris Coons]], who went on to easily [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|beat]] O'Donnell by 17 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/delaware/election_2010_delaware_senate|title=Election 2010: Delaware Senate|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], the son of Louisa Johnston (née Bache) and James Manderson Castle, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barone|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit)|author2=Richard E. Cohen|author3=Grant Ujifusa|title=The Almanac of American Politics|publisher=National Journal Group|year=2008|location=Washington, D.C.|page=370|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2008/about.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his maternal great-great-grandfathers was Virginia Senator [[John W. Johnston]], and Castle's fifth great-grandfathers were founding fathers [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Daniel Carroll]]. Castle's father was a patent lawyer for DuPont, a firm so central to the city that it was long known in Wilmington simply as "the company." After graduating from [[Tower Hill School]] in 1957, he attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in economics from Hamilton in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hamilton.edu/news/story/delaware-congressman-alumnus-mike-castle-to-deliver-commencement-address|title= Delaware Congressman, Alumnus Mike Castle to Deliver Commencement Address|publisher=Hamilton College|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Hamilton, Castle was a brother of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] Fraternity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1964, he earned a [[Juris Doctorate]] degree from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was admitted to both the Delaware [[Bar association|Bar]] and the Washington, D.C. Bar that same year.

==Family==
Michael Castle and Jane DiSabatino married on May 23, 1992; they have no children.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Both are [[Roman Catholic]]s.

==Professional and political career==
Following his admission to the bar, Castle returned to Wilmington and joined Connolly, Bove and Lodge, working as an associate (1964–1973) and later partner (1973–1975). A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served as [[Deputy Attorney General]] of Delaware from 1965 to 1966, and was elected to the [[Delaware House of Representatives]] in 1966. He served as a state representative for two years before winning a seat in the [[Delaware Senate]], where he remained for eight years. He also served as [[minority leader]] from 1975 to 1976.

In 1976, Castle left the state legislature and returned to the full-time practice of law, founding his own firm with Carl Schnee (who was later nominated as [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware|U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware]] by [[President of the United States|President]] Bill Clinton in 1999). He returned to politics in 1980, when he was recruited to run for [[Lieutenant Governor of Delaware]] by [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]]. He defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state senator Thomas B. Sharp, with 59% to 40% of the vote. He served from 1981 to 1985, and headed panels on education and drunk driving.

==Governor of Delaware==
[[File:Castle, Thornburgh, and Weinberger at the Pentagon, July 6, 1982.JPEG|thumb|Lt. Governor Castle (left) with Governor [[Dick Thornburgh]] of Pennsylvania (center) and Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]], July 1982.]]
As the hand-picked choice of the popular Governor du Pont, he easily won election as Governor of Delaware, defeating former [[Delaware Supreme Court]] Justice William T. Quillen. In the campaign, Castle was criticized for being a shadow of his mentor and only promising an extension of du Pont’s program. Delaware voters however elected him to another term in 1988 when he defeated Democrat Jacob Kreshtool by a wide margin, and is the last time a Republican won a governor election in the state. Castle served two terms, cutting the second one slightly short when he resigned to begin his first term as U.S. Representative.

In 1992, Castle did not run again for Governor, due to constitutional term limits. The result was what became known as "the Swap." Castle ran for the seat of U.S. Representative [[Tom Carper]] and Carper ran for Governor. Delaware’s political leadership had quietly worked out the arrangement and retained the services of two very popular office holders.

Castle was first elected U.S. Representative in 1992, defeating former Lieutenant Governor Shien Biau Woo. Since then, he won election by wide margins eight times, defeating Democrats Carol Ann DeSantis in 1994, [[Dennis E. Williams]] in 1996 and 1998, Michael C. Miller in 2000 and 2002, Paul Donnelly in 2004, Dennis Spivack in 2006, and Karen Hartley-Nagle in 2008.

Castle was president of the [[Republican Main Street Partnership]] and was the co-chair of several Congressional caucuses, including the Diabetes Caucus, the Community College Caucus, the Biomedical Research Caucus and the Passenger Rail Caucus. He was also considered one of the most moderate Republicans in the U.S. House. In the wake of [[Tom DeLay]]'s indictment in September 2005, liberal columnist [[E.J. Dionne]] named Castle as one of four lawmakers capable of leading an anticorruption reform of the Republican Party. Castle was a member of various moderate/liberal Republican Organizations, such as [[Republicans For Environmental Protection]], The [[Republican Majority For Choice]], [[Republicans For Choice]] and [[Christine Todd Whitman]]'s Its My Party Too. He is [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] and supports some [[gun control]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/delaware-senate-race-kamikaze-republican-tea-party/story?id=11627467|title=Delaware Senate Race: A Kamikaze Republican and the Tea Party|last=News|first=A.

Castle's centrist positions served him well in a state that trended increasingly Democratic during his tenure in the House.  Delaware had long been reckoned as a [[bellwether]], but has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992, due almost entirely to heavily Democratic [[New Castle County]].  At the same time, his centrist record made him the target of conservative groups such as [[Club for Growth]], who ranked him the least conservative Republican in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101101041107/http://www.clubforgrowth.org/projects/scorecard/?year=2009&amp;chamber=2 U.S. House in 2008], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100909021301/http://removerinos.com/CastleM.html RemoveRINOs], who, in April 2010, named him the Ace of Spades on its most-wanted list.

In February 2004, Castle sponsored H.R. 3831 to reauthorize the assault weapons ban of 1994. The bill was co-sponsored by 11 Republican colleagues and 129 Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|108|H.R.|3831}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Rep. [[Mark Kirk]], R-IL, introduced H.R. 6257 to reinstate the ban, and Castle was one of the bill's four Republican co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|110|HR|6257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills died in committee.

Castle cosponsored the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill proposed expanding the number of [[embryonic stem cell]] lines that are eligible for federally funded research, expecting that this funding would generate more research and ultimately greater progress in developing new treatments for a wide range of [[Embryonic Stem Cell#Utilities|medical conditions]]. Presently, the only embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federal funded research were derived before August 9, 2001. This legislation removes that date restriction, along with proposing stronger ethical requirements. After successfully passing both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House, it received U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]’s first presidential veto in July 2006.

In December 2010, Castle was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the [[United States military]]'s "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" ban on [[openly gay]] service members.&lt;ref name=metro_weekly_20101215&gt;Chris Geidner, [http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2010/12/breaking-house-passes-dadt-rep.html House Passes DADT Repeal Bill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021205547/http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2010/12/breaking-house-passes-dadt-rep.html |date=2013-10-21 }}, ''[[Metro Weekly]]'' (December 15, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_20101215&gt;[http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/638 House Vote 638 – Repeals 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118070035/http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/638 |date=2016-01-18 }}, ''[[New York Times]]'' (December 15, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle suffered two minor strokes during the [[Delaware congressional election, 2006|2006 campaign]], but fully recovered. Considering the general Democratic sweep of other offices, he won the election comfortably, but with a greatly reduced margin over previous years. Despite the increased Democratic sweep of the [[United States House of Representatives election in Delaware, 2008|2008 election]], he, unlike many Republicans, managed to increase his margin of victory, winning over Democratic challenger Karen Hartley-Nagle by 23 points. Considering his moderate profile, popularity, and long history of service to the state, his victory was not considered surprising. Castle appeared in the documentary, Keeping the Peace, which focused on Michael Berg's 'anti-war' campaign for Castle's congressional seat in 2006. It premiered at the Philadelphia Independent Film Festival in 2009 and won the Audience Award.

On November 9th, 2009, Congressman Castle's District was profiled by [[Stephen Colbert]] in his segment "Better Know a District."

==2010 Senate campaign==
{{main|United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010}}
In 2010, Congressman Castle ran to be the Republican candidate to fill the seat of former Senator [[Joe Biden]], who had become Vice President on January 20, 2009. Castle was defeated in the Republican primary on September 14, 2010, by [[Christine O'Donnell]], the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] favorite. The primary drew 57,000 voters, a small slice of the overall electorate. After the primary, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind twice polled Delaware voters, running a hypothetical match-up between Castle and the Democratic candidate, [[Chris Coons]]; in it, Castle beat Coons by a 21-point margin (54%–34%) and also had a favorable rating of 48% compared to O'Donnell's 34%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/winsome/final.pdf |format=PDF |title=O’Donnell Winning Tea Party, Losing Delaware |website=Publicmind.fdu.edu |accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle refused to support O'Donnell in the Senate campaign against Coons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42206.html|title=Mike Castle Won't Endorse Christine O'Donnell|publisher=Politico|author=David Catanese|date=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coons went on to defeat O'Donnell decisively in the general election.

In June 2010, Castle was one of only two Republicans to vote in favor of the [[DISCLOSE Act]], intended to limit spending on political campaigns by corporations in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''. The bill requires added disclosure for political spending by corporations and prohibits some [[corporate political spending]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=von Spakovsky |first=Hans A. |authorlink=Hans A. von Spakovsky |title=The Fight over the DISCLOSE Act Is Far from Over |publisher=[[National Review]] |date=2010-06-24 |url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGYzNDY5MTBkOWI1MDQ3ZWQ1NWFlYzU0YmIzZjI4NjY= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708112028/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGYzNDY5MTBkOWI1MDQ3ZWQ1NWFlYzU0YmIzZjI4NjY= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |accessdate=2010-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Town hall===
A [[Town hall meeting|town hall style meeting]] organized by Castle to discuss [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] with constituents&lt;ref name="delawareonline1"&gt;[http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090721/NEWS/307210003 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724082909/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090721/NEWS/307210003|date=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured on the [[Drudge Report]] with the headline ''"VIDEO: Congressman's town hall erupts over Obama birth certificate...".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drudgereport.com|title=DRUDGE REPORT 2011|publisher=Drudgereport.com|accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was linked to a tape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V1nmn2zRMc&amp;e|title=Mike Castle on Barack H.

The incident sparked discussion of the topic in relation to the moderate Republican congressman and commentators' surprise at the audience reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697/vp/32056026#32056026|title=Hardball with Chris Matthews|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rick PerlsteinJuly 21, 2009|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/207836|title=Feeling the Wrath of Bill O'Reilly's Army|publisher=Newsweek|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/the-early-word-prime-time-night|work=The New York Times|title=The Early Word: Prime-Time Night|first=Bernie|last=Becker|date=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle was heckled and booed after calmly responding to a protester, "If you’re referring to the President there, he is a citizen of the United States."&lt;ref name="delawareonline1"/&gt; The incident has become a focus of attention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mike%20castle%22%20town%20hall%20obama&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=sp&amp;qscrl=1] {{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100705200925/http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/honorstheses/DerekFrome.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; evaluations of the period.

Reporting in the international press on the explosion of interest in the subject focused on the central role of the Castle incident. The [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper [[The Guardian]] reported:&lt;blockquote&gt;But the real impact has been a video that has garnered hundreds of thousands of hits on the web (in which Congressman) Mike Castle, address(es) a town hall meeting on health care in Delaware last month when a woman suddenly stands up waving a bunch of papers...The encounter was a warning to Republican officials how far [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|the conspiracy theory]] has permeated parts of their party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/28/birther-movement-obama-citizenship|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|title=Anti-Obama 'birther movement' gathers steam|first=Chris|last=McGreal|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The site was formerly marshland adjacent to the [[St. Lawrence River]].  It was used as a landfill and dumpsite from 1866 until 1966, and then was paved to serve as a parking lot for [[Expo 67]] and was named ''Autoparc Victoria''. Following the Expo, it briefly served as the site of the [[Victoria STOLport]], or ''ADACport'' in French.

The '''Paris Chamber of Commerce''' (''Chambre de commerce et d'industrie de Paris'' or CCIP) is a [[chamber of commerce]] of the [[Paris]] region. 
It defends the interests of companies of the city of Paris, and provides services to these companies.
Since 2013 it has been a division of the [[Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry]].

==History==

The CCIP was created on 25 February 1803 by [[Napoleon]] and is the successor to the [[Guild]]s of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. 
It was initially located in the [[préfecture]], before transferring to the building now occupied by the [[Paris Bourse]], and then to the [[Hôtel Potocki]].

On 1 January 2013 the Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry was created, combining eight chambers of commerce of the area in and around Paris.
The merger brought together the six departmental CCI (Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne, Val d'Oise, Yvelines Versailles) and the two territorial CCI (Seine-et -Marne and Essonne).{{sfn|Philippe Flamand|2013}}

On 1 January 2013 the ''CCI départementale de Paris'' was created as a division of the ''CCI de région Paris Ile-de-France''.
It has its headquarters at 2 Place de la Bourse and provides operational services at the [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Bourse de commerce]]. As of 2015 there were 36 elected officials and a staff of 125 people. The CCI Paris acts as an advocate for business in Paris, and provides support to company creators, marketers and business leaders.{{sfn|La CCI Paris – CCI Paris Ile-de-France}}

==Universities managed by the CCIP==

The Paris Chamber of Commerce owns many of the city's leading ''[[Grandes écoles]]''. The Chamber's [http://www.ccip.fr/index.asp?idlangue=5&amp;idmetapage=45#orientation full list] includes many of France's most famous graduate business schools and engineering schools.

Some of the better known schools include:

* [[École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Électronique et Électrotechnique]]
* [[ESCP Europe]]
* [[HEC Paris]]
* [[ISTM|ISTM Institut Supérieur de Technologie et de Management]]

'''Process flowsheeting''' is the use of computer aids to perform steady-state heat and mass balancing, sizing and costing calculations for a [[chemical process]]. It is an essential and core component of [[process design]].

The process design effort may be split into three basic steps
* [[Chemical synthesis|Synthesis]]
* [[Analysis]] and
* [[Optimization]].

== Synthesis ==

Synthesis is the step where the structure of the flowsheet is chosen. It is also in this step that one initializes values for [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] which one is free to set.

== Analysis ==

Analysis is usually made up of three steps
* Solving heat and  material balances
* Sizing and costing the equipment and
* Evaluating the economic worth, safety, [[operability]] etc. of the chosen [[flow sheet]]

== Optimization ==

Optimization involves both structural optimization of the flow sheet itself as well as optimization of parameters in a given flowsheet. In the former one may alter the equipment used and/or its connections with other equipment. In the later one can change the values of parameters such as temperature and pressure. Parameter Optimization is a more advanced stage of theory than process flowsheet optimization.

== Plant design project ==

The first step in the sequence leading to the construction of a process [[plant]] and its use in the manufacture of a product is the conception of a process. The concept is embodied in the form of a "flow sheet". [[Process design]] then proceeds on the basis of the flow sheet chosen. [[Physical property]] data are the other component needed for process design apart from a flow sheet. The result of process design is a [[process flow diagram]], PFD. Detailed [[engineering]] for the project and vessel specifications then begin. Process flowsheeting ends at the point of generation of a suitable PFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Westerberg|first=A. W.|title=Process Flowsheeting|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge Universities Press|isbn=0-521-22043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General purpose flowsheeting programs became usable and reliable around 1965-1970.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">The '''Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration''' was a [[List of Canadian Royal Commissions|royal commission]] created in 1975 to study corporate concentration in [[Canada]].

== History ==
The commission was created by the [[Canadian federal government]] under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] through Part I of the [[Inquiries Act]] by
Order in Council of 1 May 1975, P.C. 1975-999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1975-1-1-eng.pdf publications.gc.ca: "Report of the Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration"], March 1978&lt;/ref&gt; to study corporate concentration in Canada.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration fonds|url=http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;lvl=0&amp;v=0&amp;coll=0&amp;itm=257685&amp;rt=1&amp;bill=1|publisher=Archives Canada|accessdate=22 October 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission, which was chaired by retired clerk of the [[Privy Council of Canada]] [[Robert Broughton Bryce]] of Ottawa and completed by tele-journalist [[Pierre Nadeau]] of Montreal, and lawyer [[Robert Warren Vincent Dickerson]] of Vancouver, was tasked with studying the nature and effect of corporate concentration, its economic and social implications, and whether any safeguards were required to protect the public interest;&lt;ref name="AC" /&gt; Dickerson had been in 1971 the lead co-author of ''Proposals for a New Business Corporations Law for Canada''.  The commission was created in the wake of a failed attempt by [[Power Corporation of Canada]] to gain control over [[Argus Corporation]].&lt;ref name="AC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Objectives of Canadian Competition Policy, 1888-1983|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EoWC4d5XvBsC|publisher = IRPP|date = 1984-01-01|isbn = 9780886450021|language = en|first = Paul K.|last = Gorecki|first2 = W.

==Influence==

In 1986, the federal government of [[Brian Mulroney]] introduced the [[Competition Act]], to change Canada's competition laws.

'''Satellite News Channel (SNC)''' is a defunct American [[news broadcasting|news]]-based [[cable television]] channel that was operated as a [[joint venture]] between the ABC Video Enterprises division of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Inc.]] and the Group W Satellite Communications subsidiary of [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] (Group W). Designed as a [[communications satellite|satellite]]-delivered cable network, the channel is best remembered as the first 24-hour news cable competition to the Cable News Network ([[CNN]]). SNC's headquarters were based in the [[New York City]] suburb of [[Stamford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slocum|first1=Bill|title=Cable TV Finds A Stamford Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/15/nyregion/cable-tv-finds-a-stamford-home.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=September 12, 2016|work=New York Times|date=June 15, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel's format consisted of 18-minute-long rotating newscasts with the remaining time in each half-hour block allocated for a regional news summary; this lent credence to SNC's slogan, "Give us 18 minutes, we'll give you the world," which was derived through Group W's experience in [[all-news radio]]. Each 18-minute national newscast featured content gathered from both in-house newsgathering and reporting staffs and reports sourced from international television networks that maintained content agreements with Group W/ABC to supply stories for the channel.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;{{citation | url=//www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949378,00.html |title= One-Two Punch | publisher = Time.com |date = August 24, 1981 | accessdate = July 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ABC Video Enterprises and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W Satellite Communications]] announced the formation of the Satellite News Channel (as the News-Channel) on August 12, 1981, with a tentative launch set for early 1982.&lt;ref name=jvacs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrigan|first1=Kathryn Rudie|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|date=January 1, 1985|publisher= Beard Books|isbn=1587981955 |pages=169–170|edition=reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] founder Ted Turner subsequently announced plans to launch a spin-off service, CNN2 (later renamed CNN Headline News shortly after SNC's launch; it is now named [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]]), which originally maintained a format similar to that being planned by the Satellite News Channel – albeit with newscasts running in 30-minute intervals – as a preemptive strike against the ABC/Group W venture. CNN2 made its launch on January 1, 1982 on participating cable systems across the county as well as through a sneak preview block on sister channel [[TBS (TV network)|Superstation WTBS]].&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Ted Turner responds to network challenge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u0tPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CY8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4017%2C4080465|accessdate=September 12, 2016|work=Ellensburg Daily Record|agency=UPI|issue=Vol. 80 No. 198|date=August 21, 1981|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite News Channel launched on June 21, 1982. During that time, it provided competition for CNN, the first cable network to do so at the time.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref name="tvn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ariens|first1=Chris|title=ABC News and Univision to Launch 24-Hour News Channel|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/abc-news-and-univision-to-launch-24-hour-news-channel/127770|accessdate=September 12, 2016|work=TVNewser|publisher=Ad Week Network|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network utilized footage from [[ABC News]] for its reports and maintained seven newsgathering and reporting crews based in [[Washington, D.C.]] At launch, Satellite News Channel compensated participating cable operators to carry the channel, contrary to the standard of the period in which cable channels charged a nominal fee per subscriber for carriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cable TV becoming "gold mine' industry|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19820516&amp;id=ab8sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xyYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4967,3498301|accessdate=September 12, 2016|work=Sunday Star-News|agency=N.Y. Times News Service|issue=Vol. 52 No. 37|date=May 16, 1982|page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this model, SNC had difficulty obtaining clearance from cable systems.&lt;ref name="tvn"/&gt; The network and its satellite transponder space was eventually purchased by CNN's corporate parent, the [[Turner Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref name=jvacs/&gt; Satellite News Channel ceased operations on October 27, 1983, after sixteen months on the air; most local cable systems replaced SNC with either CNN or, more commonly, CNN Headline News.

==After the closure – successor channels==
For a brief time after SNC shut down, its theme music was used by fellow-Connecticut cable network [[ESPN]].

In 1996, ABC revealed plans to launch a 24-hour news channel, however discontinued them after [[Fox News Channel]] and [[MSNBC]] were announced.&lt;ref name="tvn" /&gt;

In 2004, ABC News returned to the 24-hour news market with [[ABC News Now]]. The channel began as a digital subchannel but was later moved to cable. However that channel like SNC received little cable and satellite carriage, only being available on regional cable systems and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]]'s mobile devices. After nine years in operation, it was shut down.

In 2013 ABC News partnered with [[Univision Communications]] to launch [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]], a new cable news channel focused on a Hispanic audience with shows skewed to a younger demographic which also includes satire and entertainment programs. The channel went live on October 28, 2013. The channel is ABC's third attempt at a cable news channel and their second partnership on one, the first since SNC. As far as distribution, Fusion has fared much better in respects to carriage than its two predecessors, securing both major [[satellite]] carriers and major cable operators in markets like New York City.

'''Sean Christopher Avery''' (born April 10, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. During his career in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), he played left wing for the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Dallas Stars]] and [[New York Rangers]], gaining recognition for his [[Pest (ice hockey)|agitating]] playing style and controversial behaviour both on and off the ice. He is also known for his eclectic interests, having worked in fashion, most notably as an intern at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine; as a model; and as a restaurateur. He finished his 12-year career with a total of 90 goals, 247 points and 1,533 penalty minutes in 580 games.

After retiring in 2012, Avery began working at Lipman, an advertising and creative agency in New York City. He was promoted to senior staffer, but the firm closed without notice in September 2013, reportedly due to financial problems, later filing for bankruptcy, and owing Avery $229,167.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://nypost.com/2013/10/23/sean-avery-owed-229k-by-bankrupt-lipman-agency/|title = Sean Avery owed $229K by bankrupt Lipman agency|last = Claire Atkinson|date = October 23, 2013|work = New York Post|access-date = October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery's memoir, ''Ice Capades: A Memoir of Fast Living and Tough Hockey'', was published by [[Blue Rider Press]] in 2017.

==Early life==
Avery was born in [[North York, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://torontolife.com/city/nhl-fans-break-from-playoffs-to-discuss-gay-marriage-because-apparently-its-still-2006/|title = NHL fans break from playoffs to discuss gay marriage—because, apparently, it’s still 2006|last = John Michael McGrath|date = May 10, 2011|journal = Toronto Life|access-date = October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Al and Marlene Avery, both teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Curt Sampson, [http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/2008/10/23/Sean_Avery_Dressed_to_Kill.aspx “Sean Avery: Dressed to Kill”], ''[[D Magazine]]'', November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Pickering, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;John Dellapina, [http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/rangers/sean-avery-stand-toronto-article-1.276721 “Sean Avery: Can’t stand Toronto,”] ''[[New York Daily News]]'', December 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Dunbarton High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.faceoff.com/story.html?id=e5d6af76-c157-453b-8942-68d054411bf8&amp;k=83328&amp;add_feed_url=http://www.faceoff.com/news.atom|title = Avery disillusioned with Toronto hockey talk|date = December 6, 2007|accessdate = October 6, 2015|website = Faceoff.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094625/http://www.faceoff.com/story.html?id=e5d6af76-c157-453b-8942-68d054411bf8&amp;k=83328&amp;add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fnews.atom|archive-date = December 8, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger brother named Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://canadafreepress.com/article/2854|title = Sean Avery’s kid brother, Scott|date = April 30, 2008|accessdate = October 6, 2015|website = Canada Free Press|last = Judi McLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==

===Junior league (1996–2000)===
Prior to joining the NHL, Avery played for the [[Owen Sound Platers]] and the [[Kingston Frontenacs]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL).

===Detroit Red Wings (2001–2003)===
Avery was signed by the Detroit Red Wings as a free agent in 1999. He played one final season in the OHL before turning professional in 2000 with the [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He broke into the NHL in the [[2001–02 Detroit Red Wings season|2001–02 season]], playing 36 games with the Red Wings and 36 in the minors. The Red Wings went on to win the [[Stanley Cup]] that season, but Avery did not play in the playoffs nor did he play the required 41 games to get his name engraved on the Cup.

Midway through the [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03 season]], Avery was traded to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] along with defenseman [[Maxim Kuznetsov]] and two draft picks for [[Mathieu Schneider]].&lt;ref name="mbrehm"&gt;Mike Brehm, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/wings/2003-03-11-schneider_x.htm “Red Wings acquire Schneider from Kings,”] ''[[USA Today]]'', March 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 15 points in 51 games.

===Los Angeles Kings and NHL lockout (2003–2007)===
[[Image:seanavery.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Avery with the Kings]]
In [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]], Avery played 76 games for the Kings, scoring 9 goals to go along with 19 assists. He also led the NHL in penalty minutes with 261.

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Avery briefly played in the [[Finnish Elite League]] with the [[Lahti Pelicans]], and in the [[United Hockey League]] for the [[Motor City Mechanics]]. Along with 149 penalty minutes in just 16 games, he tallied 26 points for the Mechanics, including two hat tricks, making him the first player in Mechanics history to record two hat tricks in one season. Several players spoke publicly of their dissatisfaction with the [[NHL Players' Association]]’s leadership during the lockout, including Avery, who publicly blamed NHLPA president Bob Goodenow for wasting an entire season with a battle that alienated fans and yielded few results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/07/06/avery050705.html|title=Top brass not at NHL bargaining table|work=CBC News|date=July 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery led the league in penalty minutes for the second consecutive season in 2005-06, with 257. With three games remaining, the Kings unofficially suspended Avery for the remainder of the season after he refused to do a drill in practice. Nevertheless, the team re-signed him to a one-year deal.&lt;ref name="cfoster"&gt;Chris Foster, [http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/24/sports/sp-kings24 “Avery Gets One-Year Kings Deal,”] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time with the Kings, Avery has been said to have mocked Dustin Brown about his lisp. Former Kings' teammate [[Ian Laperrière]] said it "was bullying, like you might see in high school."  But according to other players and coaches, Brown's lisp was not Avery's target, Brown's then girlfriend, now wife, Nicole was. Avery did not think Nicole Brown was glamorous enough to be a "girlfriend of a hockey player in Hollywood."  Brown admits the bullying might have affected him in ways that he did not realize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2012/04/25/sean-avery-used-to-mock-dustin-brown-about-his-lisp-and-wife/|title = Sean Avery used to mock Dustin Brown about his lisp and wife|date = April 25, 2012|last = Mike Halford|work = NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Rangers (2007–2008)===
[[Image:AveryNYR.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Avery in 2007]]
On February 5, 2007, in the middle of the 2006–07 season, Avery was traded to the New York Rangers.&lt;ref name="cfoster"/&gt; After joining the Rangers, he scored 20 points in 29 games to help the team complete a 17–4–6 end-of-season run to qualify for the playoffs. On March 17, Avery recorded a single-game career-high four points (one goal and three assists) against the [[Boston Bruins]] in a 7–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores107/107076/NHL706086.htm|title=Rangers 7, Bruins 0|work=USA Today|date=April 18, 2006|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery played in his first career playoff game on April 12 against the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], recording his first playoff points with a goal and an assist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2007/04/14/rangers-atlanta.html “Avery, Shanahan give Rangers 2-0 series lead,”] [[CBC Sports]], April 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He cut down on penalty minutes by about 65% in 2006–07 compared to seasons past.

On August 1, 2007, Avery, as a restricted free agent, earned an [[arbitration]] award of $1.9 million for the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], which the Rangers accepted, keeping him with the team for at least another year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nhl&amp;id=2957420 “Rangers re-sign LW Sean Avery after arbitrator awards him $1.9 million salary,”] [[ESPN]], August 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2008, in a game against the [[Buffalo Sabres]], Avery scored a goal 10 seconds into the game, setting a record for fastest goal scored by a Ranger on home ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2008021613|title = Avery scores twice, Rangers rout Sabres and Miller with 4 in 1st|agency = Associated Press|last = Podell|first = Ira|date = February 16, 2008|accessdate = October 6, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023080048/http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2008021613|archive-date = October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dallas Stars (2008)===
Avery signed a four-year, $15.5 million contract with the [[Dallas Stars]] on July 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=450364 “Stars Sign Sean Avery,”] stars.nhl.com, July 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a roommate of the Stars' co-general manager [[Brett Hull]] when the two played for the Red Wings. Hull thought the Stars needed more fire and emotion on the ice, and felt Avery would fit the bill. Avery scored 3 goals in 23 games before he and the team parted ways following his six-game suspension by the NHL in December 2008, due to controversial remarks made about fellow players.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Heika, [http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/11147983 “Dallas Stars frustrated with suspended Avery's actions,”] ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stars placed Avery on waivers on February 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nhl&amp;id=3891428 “Stars place left winger Avery on waivers,”] ESPN, February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsnhartford"&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=266456&amp;lid=sublink01&amp;lpos=headlines_nhl;_ylt=AurPHuBcie0o6v6Jnqxv1zgLMxIF “Stars Assign Avery to Rangers’ AHL Affiliate in Hartford,”] [[The Sports Network|TSN]], February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the Rangers (2009–2012)===
[[Image:SeanAvery2009.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Avery in the 2009 playoffs]]
After clearing [[Waivers (NHL)|waivers]] on February 9, 2009, Avery was assigned to the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]], the Rangers' AHL affiliate, although he remained a member of the Stars organization (that season, the Stars had no AHL affiliate).&lt;ref name="tsnhartford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3896515 Stars send Avery to Hartford] ESPN, February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, Avery was placed on re-entry waivers by Dallas, and claimed by the Rangers the following day.&lt;ref name="espn030309"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3948668 “Rangers take Avery off waivers,”] ESPN, March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2010, in a game against the Stars, his former team, Avery recorded one goal and three assists.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Z. Klein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/sports/hockey/07nhl.html “Avery Comes Alive Against the Stars, His Ex-Team,”] ''[[New York Times]]'', January 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2011, the Rangers waived Avery. The following day, he cleared waivers and was assigned to New York’s affiliate, the [[Connecticut Whale (AHL)|Connecticut Whale]] of the AHL.&lt;ref name="tsn100511"&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=377498 "Avery clears waivers, sent to AHL; Staal on injured list,"] TSN, October 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2011, the Rangers placed Avery on 24-hour re-entry waivers. The move was done to bring him up as a replacement for the injured Mike Rupp. He cleared waivers and re-joined the Rangers for their November 5 game against the Montreal Canadiens.&lt;ref name="lbooks103111"&gt;Larry Books, [https://nypost.com/2011/10/31/rangers-put-avery-on-re-entry-waivers/ “Rangers put Avery on re-entry waivers,”] ''[[New York Post]]'', October 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite playing less than 10 minutes in all 15 games he played for the Rangers that season, he scored 3 goals. After being a healthy scratch for nine games, Avery was once again placed on waivers on December 30, 2011. Since no NHL team claimed him, he returned to the AHL's Connecticut Whale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/7407681/sean-avery-clears-waivers-headed-ahl-now Sean Avery clears waivers]. espn.com (December 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; His last game played with the Whale was on January 27, 2012. He was left off the Whale's Clear Day list of players eligible to play for the remainder of the AHL season submitted on March 5, and told to no longer report to games or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Strang, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/7654673/sean-avery-tenure-new-york-rangers-franchise-over “AHL’s Whale done with Sean Avery,”] ESPN, March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2012, Avery retired. He announced his retirement on ''Watch What Happens Live'' with host [[Andy Cohen (television personality)|Andy Cohen]].&lt;ref name="lbooks031412"&gt;Larry Books, [https://nypost.com/2012/03/14/former-rangers-forward-avery-calls-it-quits/ “Former Rangers forward Avery calls it quits,”] ''New York Post'', March 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katie Strang, [http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/7681867/new-york-rangers-sean-avery-says-officially-retired “Sean Avery talks retirement,”] ESPN, March 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Over the course of his hockey career, Avery was involved in a number of controversies and fined by the NHL on numerous occasions. The controversy started early in his career; Red Wings general manager [[Ken Holland]] said he unloaded Avery during the 2002–03 season partly because he didn't seem to have respect for the game.&lt;ref name="Mature"&gt;Rosen, Dan; and Adam Kimelman. [http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=396369 Holland: "Avery hasn't matured"]. NHL.com, 2008-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leukemia comment===
In November 2007, Howard Berger a reporter for Toronto radio station [[FAN 590]] stated that an unnamed Rangers player had accused Avery of commenting about [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] player [[Jason Blake (ice hockey)|Jason Blake]]'s battle with leukemia, prior to a pre-game confrontation between Avery and Toronto's [[Darcy Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/10470990 “Controversial incidents involving Sean Avery”], [[CBS Sports]], November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Avery, who denied the allegation, received an NHL-maximum $2500 fine, and Tucker received a $1000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citynews.ca/2007/11/13/did-sean-avery-make-comments-about-jason-blakes-fight-with-cancer “Did Sean Avery Make Comments About Jason Blake’s Fight With Cancer?”], ''[[CityNews]]'', November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Avery Rule===
[[Image:Averyrule.jpg|right|thumb|Avery "screening" Brodeur]]
On April 13, 2008, during game three of a first round [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoff]] game against the [[New Jersey Devils]], Avery turned his back on the play in order to face and [[Screen (ice hockey)|screen]] Devils goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] during a two-man advantage on the power play. He waved his hands and stick in front of Brodeur in an attempt to distract him and block his view. The puck was later cleared out of the Devils' zone but on the second Rangers offensive attack, Avery scored a power play goal.

Although screening is a commonly used tactic (especially on the power play), notable in this instance was that Avery had spent the initial part of the play facing Brodeur while ignoring the puck, with his back to the play (normally, the player screening the goaltender is facing the play). The following day, the NHL issued an interpretation of the league's unsportsmanlike conduct rule to cover actions such as the one employed by Avery, which would now result in a minor penalty.&lt;ref name="ESPN.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3346729|title=NHL amends unsportsmanlike conduct rule in response to Avery's antics|publisher=ESPN|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known colloquially as "The Avery Rule".&lt;ref name="The Demon on His Shoulder,"&gt;Allen Salkin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/fashion/29avery.html?pagewanted=all “The Demon on His Shoulder,”] ''New York Times'', March 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery's tactics during that series against the Devils earned multiple power plays, and he scored in each of the first three games. His controversial yet effective antics helped lead the Rangers to a 4–1 series win. At the end of the series, Brodeur refused to shake Avery's hand. In an interview after game 5 when asked about the handshake line, Avery replied, "Fatso forgot to shake my hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/devils/index.ssf/2009/03/sean_avery_gets_best_of_new_je.html|title=Sean Avery gets best of New Jersey Devils in New York Rangers' 3–0 victory|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heckling incident===
[[Image:Sean Avery rangers 2011-02-13.JPG|thumb|200px|Avery during the 2010–11 season]]
On November 1, 2008, following a game with the Stars against the Boston Bruins, Avery was accused of shouting obscenities at a fan who had been heckling him during the game. A report of complaint was filed with the NHL, but no action was taken.&lt;ref name="sburnside"&gt;Scott Burnside, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&amp;id=3740622 “Isolated incident? No, Avery’s career has been defined by indiscretions,”] ESPN, December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sloppy seconds" comment===
On December 2, 2008, prior to the Stars' morning skate in preparation for a game against the [[Calgary Flames]], Avery approached the assembled reporters in the dressing room and stated, “I just want to comment on how it's become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my [[Sloppy seconds (sexual practice)|sloppy seconds]]. I don't know what that's about, but enjoy the game tonight.” At the time, two of Avery's ex-girlfriends were dating fellow NHL players - actress [[Elisha Cuthbert]] was dating Flames defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]], and model [[Rachel Hunter]] was dating Kings center [[Jarret Stoll]].&lt;ref name="sburnside"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/10470990 “Controversial incidents involving Sean Avery”], CBS Sports, November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=remarkcbc&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/12/05/avery-suspension-stars.html “Avery to sit 6 games for controversial remark,”] CBC Sports, December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the NHL suspended Avery indefinitely for "conduct detrimental to the league or the game of hockey". His comments were met with near-unanimous condemnation by the Stars organization, fellow players, and fans alike. Stars owner [[Tom Hicks]] said that the team would have suspended Avery had the NHL not acted first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=395722|title=NHL statement on Avery suspension}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery apologized the next day, calling his actions "inappropriate" and "a bad attempt to build excitement for the game".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3743305 Stars LW Avery issues apology for televised comments about ex-girlfriends]. [[Associated Press]] via [[ESPN]]; 2008-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, the NHL fixed Avery's suspension at six games, retroactive to the December 2 game against the Flames. He agreed to undergo anger management counseling due to what the NHL called unacceptable and antisocial behavior. [[NHL Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]] noted that both he and league disciplinarian [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey)|Colin Campbell]] had warned Avery several times before about his behaviour.&lt;ref name=remarkcbc/&gt; On December 14, after the last game of Avery's suspension, the Stars announced that Avery would not return to the team. One factor in the Stars decision was that coach [[Dave Tippett]] and several of the players, including [[Mike Modano]] and [[Marty Turco]], let it be known they weren't willing to take him back on the team. Tippett had warned Avery not to talk to the media about his former girlfriends, and was outraged when he did so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=259679 Avery to continue counseling, will not return to Stars], TSN.ca, 2008-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3768552 Stars: Avery will not return]. ESPN, 2008-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Sports Network|TSN]]'s [[James Duthie (sportscaster)|James Duthie]], Avery's teammates had soured on him not long after he arrived. The "sloppy seconds" incident was the last straw, and Hicks had been actively looking to cut ties with him while the suspension was underway.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Duthie (sportscaster)|Duthie, James]]. [http://www2.tsn.ca/columnists/james_duthie/?id=258309 Avery's teammates hope "indefinitely" means "forever"], [[The Sports Network]], 2008-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tortorella feud===
Prior to his second stint with the Rangers, Avery had been called out on numerous occasions by then TSN commentator and future Rangers coach [[John Tortorella]], who is noted for his no-nonsense behavior with his players and the press. After rejoining the Rangers, Avery’s relationship with Tortorella was uneasy, although in Avery's book he reports there were moments of mutual admiration. Nearly a year after Avery retired, on March 30, 2013, following the Rangers’ second consecutive shutout loss, a tweet from Avery's [[Twitter]] account said of his former coach, “Fire this CLOWN, his players hate him and wont play for his BS.”&lt;ref&gt;Greg Wyshynski, [https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/sean-avery-had-huge-smile-over-john-tortorella-151814254.html “Sean Avery had ‘huge smile’ over John Tortorella’s firing by Rangers,”] [[Yahoo!

I’m happy for the Rangers and Ranger fans.”&lt;ref name="lbooks053113"/&gt;

==Advertising==

===Lipman Agency===
Upon his retirement from the NHL, in April 2012, Avery began working at New York City-based advertising and creative agency Lipman. Hired by founder, chairman and chief creative officer David Lipman, Avery was appointed chief strategic officer and helped develop strategies for numerous Lipman clients, including the campaign for the [[Stuart Weitzman]] line’s Spring/Summer 2013 campaign, featuring [[Kate Moss]], and [[7 For All Mankind]] jeans, which showcased Avery himself as a model. He has also handled a range of assignments for Lipman’s parent company, Revolate Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Elliott, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/business/media/sean-avery-is-not-the-average-ad-executive.html?_r=1&amp; “From Madison Square Garden to Madison Avenue,”] ''New York Times'', December 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restaurants==

===Warren 77===
In the summer of 2009, Avery opened Warren 77, a sports bar named after its address in [[Manhattan]]’s [[Tribeca]] neighborhood at 77 Warren Street. On opening night, many figures from the hockey world were present, including [[Brendan Shanahan]], [[Ken Daneyko]] and [[Henrik Lundqvist]]. The décor was meant to reflect an old New York style, with [[Andy Warhol]] originals and pictures of icons on the walls, as well as pictures of the New York Rangers, past and present. Matt Abramcyk, a former art dealer, and Chris Miller, co-owner of the Beatrice Hotel, are co-owners of the bar.&lt;ref name="The Demon on His Shoulder,"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Mathews, [http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-interview-sean-avery-on-warren-77/#1 “Interview: Sean Avery on Warren 77,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021134741/http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-interview-sean-avery-on-warren-77/#1 |date=October 21, 2011 }} ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', June 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Thompson, [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/tables/2009/09/28/090928gota_GOAT_tables_thompson “Tables for Two: Warren 77,”] ''[[The New Yorker]]'', September 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

===Marriage equality===
In May 2011, Avery recorded a video for the [[Human Rights Campaign|New Yorkers for Marriage Equality]] campaign, in support of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="HRCMedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGGH3M9NKBI|title=Sean Avery for HRC's NYers 4 Marriage Equality|publisher=YouTube|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery was believed to be the first athlete in New York to publicly voice his support for same-sex marriage.

===Regional tax reform===
In April 2014, Farah's Ministry of Finance announced that the Puntland government would start taxation of UN and international organizations working in Puntland. According to the head of the [[Nugal, Somalia|Nugal]] tax department Abdiwahab Farah Ali, this is the first such initiative undertaken in the regional state, and is expected to raise available revenue for local development projects by the new Puntland authorities. The decision is part of a pledge by Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali to increase the government's development funding in part through higher taxation. Toward this end, the Puntland government already increased taxes on commercial firms operating in the state in order to meet regional financing benchmarks.&lt;ref name="Sptsttuio"&gt;{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Puntland to start the taxation of UN and the other International organisations|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2014/04/somalia-puntland-to-tax-un-and-the-other-international-organisations-in-the-region/|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Raxanreeb|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse''' is a [[Neoclassical architecture|Classical Revival]] [[courthouse]] located at 40 [[Centre Street (Manhattan)|Centre Street]] on [[Foley Square]] in the [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center neighborhood]] of [[lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. The building, designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] and his son, Cass Gilbert, Jr.,&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''U.S. Courthouse'''.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] and the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] hear cases in the courthouse, which is across the street from the [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City]].

==Architecture and design==
The building has two major parts, the [[Foundation (engineering)|base]] and the [[tower]]. Including both, the building is 179.83 m tall and 37 [[Storey|stories]].

The six-story courthouse base is marked by a [[pilaster]]ed [[facade]] and a [[colonnade]]. Built around three interior [[courtyard]]s, it is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] and irregularly shaped, following the outline of the site. Massive [[granite]] steps flanked by large [[pedestal]]s lead up to the main entrance on Foley Square. Gilbert intended the pedestals to bear two monumental sculptural groups, but they were never executed. Ten four-story [[Corinthian column]]s form the imposing [[portico]] that shelters the entrance, and the [[frieze]] is carved with a detailed floral design. The ends of the [[entablature]] above are embellished with [[roundel]]s, designed to resemble ancient [[coin]]s, on which are carved the heads of four ancient lawgivers: [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], and [[Moses]]. The Corinthian capitals crowning the columns of the portico return to top pilasters along the building's other primary facades. Minnesota granite, off-white in color and mottled with [[Peach (color)|peach]] and [[gray]], was used to finish the exterior elevations of the courthouse.

A 30-story square tower is 590 feet in height and is set back from the base parallel to the front of the building.  The tower is set back slightly on the 27th floor, marked by [[urn]]s at the corners. The [[roof]] of the tower is [[pyramid]]al, pitched steeply, and made of [[terra cotta]], with a [[gold leaf]], with a small open lantern, also gold-[[Architectural glass|glazed]] terra cotta, at the top.

The main hall spans the width of the building along its principal elevation. It is very similar in design and ornamentation to the main hall of the [[United States Supreme Court building]], which Gilbert designed at the same time. Variations on the decorative motifs employed within the main hall appear throughout the rest of the interior. Twenty-nine feet in height, it has green- and black-veined white [[marble]] floors; the white marble that lines its walls has gold- and cream-colored veining, providing a subtle but attractive contrast of warm and cool tones. Elaborate [[molding (decorative)|molding]], featuring a [[Meander (art)|meander]] (Greek key) design, divides the ceiling into rectangular, [[coffer]]ed sections. The coffers are decorated with large [[plaster]] [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s tipped with [[Carat (purity)|22k]] gold leaf on alternating backgrounds of [[crimson]] and [[peacock]] [[blue]], with smaller rosettes at the junctions of the coffers.

[[File:Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse WTM3 NYU FC 0026.jpg|thumb|325px|left|The [[colonnade]] of [[Corinthian columns]]]]

Richly ornamental [[bronze]]work surrounds many of the interior [[door]]s, including those of the [[elevator]]s. This bronze detailing features an unusual combination of metaphorical images related to law and government, including [[dolphin]]s, an erudite if somewhat obscure symbol of birth and [[Democracy|democratic]] ideals. Among the other motifs are grasshoppers apparently feeding on stalks of [[wheat]], accompanied by the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[meta]]'', meaning "to transform", which conveys the idea that change, even conflict, is essential to growth; there are also [[owl]]s, representing [[wisdom]], and acorns and [[oak]] [[leaf|leaves]], signifying strength and endurance.

The building contains 35 courtrooms. Sixteen are original to the courthouse: five in the base and eleven in the tower, including the historic [[United States Court of Appeals]] courtroom. All have wood-[[Panelling|paneled]] walls with colossal round arches and fluted [[Ionic order|Ionic]] pilasters; the Greek key molding seen in the main hall also enframes the ceilings of the tower courtrooms. The Court of Appeals courtroom ceiling also depicts [[nautical]] symbols.

Within the tower, at the twenty-fifth floor, a double-height [[library]] features large ceiling [[Beam (structure)|beams]] supported by [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] painted with [[stencil]]ed foliate designs. The library's high, arched windows offer stunning views of the Manhattan [[skyline]].

The courthouse was not unanimously well-received when it was completed. Architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called it "the supreme example of pretentiousness, mediocrity, bad design and fake grandeur."&lt;ref name=aia /&gt;

The courthouse has three particularly striking neighbors. Flanking it are two [[high-rise]] structures: the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]] (1914) by [[McKim, Mead, and White]]; and the [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse]] (1994) by [[Kohn Pedersen Fox|Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates]]. Adjacent to the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse, and also facing Foley Square, is the [[New York County Courthouse]] (1926) by [[Guy Lowell]].

==History==
[[File:Thurgood Marshall United States Court House.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Thurgood Marshall United States Court House in 1936|The Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in 1936, the year of its completion]]
[[Architect]] [[Cass Gilbert]] was commissioned to design a new federal courthouse at [[Foley Square]] in 1931. Design work began in 1933. Construction began in July 1932 and lasted three and a half years. It was among the first [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] skyscrapers constructed. After Gilbert's death, construction was supervised by his son Cass Gilbert Jr. until its completion in 1936. The courthouse was originally known as the '''Foley Square Courthouse'''.

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (as '''U.S. Courthouse''') on September 2, 1987.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable events over the years that have occurred in the courthouse include the [[espionage]] conspiracy trial of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]; the guilty plea of [[Ivan Boesky]], who inspired the [[Gordon Gekko]] character, to conspiracy charges; and the trial of [[Martha Stewart]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;Chad Bray, [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2013/01/02/you-can-go-home-again-second-circuit-to-return-monday-as-courthouse-reopens/ You Can Go Home Again: Second Circuit To Return to Old Digs], ''Wall Street Journal'' (January 2, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, three large historic courtrooms were restored. The courthouse was substantially renovated in 1999. In 2001, the [[United States Congress]] passed a bill renaming the building in honor of [[Thurgood Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/988.&lt;/ref&gt; who had worked at the courthouse from 1961 to 1965 as a judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before later being elevated to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The legislation was signed into law on August 20, 2001, and the building was rededicated on April 15, 2003.

From November 2006 to January 2013, the Second Circuit left the Marshall Courthouse while the building underwent extensive renovations.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt; During this period, the [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse]] (located across the street) temporarily housed the Second Circuit. &lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt; The Second Circuit returned to the Marshall Courthouse after renovations were completed.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt; The Courthouse is currently managed by GSA Building Manager Jesse P. Leonard.

'''William Haughey, Baron Haughey''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 1956 in [[Glasgow]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressteam.co.uk/index.php/news/tycoon-unveils-house-plans PressTeam Scotland Ltd - Tycoon unveils house plans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Scottish [[businessman]], [[philanthropist]]&lt;ref name="ET"/&gt; and [[chairperson|chairman]] of City Facilities Management Holdings Ltd.

==Career==
Haughey had attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]]&lt;ref name=early/&gt; followed by [[Langside College]],&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; and then worked in the [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]] industry in [[Abu Dhabi]] before returning to Scotland to set up his own business with £70,000 of savings he had accrued. He founded City Refrigeration, a refrigeration equipment and maintenance supplier, with his wife Susan in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-22988889 | work=BBC News | title=Sir Willie Haughey's City Refrigeration sees profits up | date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cityfm.com/about-city/ | publisher=City Facilities Management | title=About City | accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caledonia House (geograph 3220465).jpg|left|thumb|City Facilities Management headquarters in [[Glasgow]]]]
After securing a service contract with the [[Wellpark Brewery|Tennent's]] company in the 1980s which led to agreements with further breweries, he sold a majority stake to the [[3i]] equity firm.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; A downturn in the financial situation caused Haughey to sell two other small companies he had established back to City to increase turnover and broaden the range of services provided by the firm. In 1997 the firm signed a deal with [[Asda]] to maintain refrigeration equipment in stores throughout the United Kingdom. Due to the success of that venture, Haughey and his wife found themselves able to buy back almost full control of City from 3i in 1999,&lt;ref name=stroke/&gt; allowing them to have decisive input on its future strategic direction;&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; a gradual, continuous expansion of its operations followed over the subsequent decades.&lt;ref name=stroke&gt;{{cite web

Haughey backed the [[Entrepreneurial Spark]] start-up accelerator, hosting the Glasgow 'hatchery' in his City Refrigeration Headquarters.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/special-reports/big-profile-blast-past-sir-10795465|title=The Big Profile Blast from the Past: Sir Willie Haughey, City Refrigerations Holdings|work=Scottish Business Insider|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City corporate headquarters are at ''Caledonia House'' in [[Gorbals]], Glasgow, having relocated from nearby [[Shawfield]] in 2009 when those premises were demolished for construction of the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways#M74 northern extension to M8 (2008–2011)|M74 motorway completion]].&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; The new site was virtually on the site of Haughey's childhood home which had been demolished years earlier.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williehaughey.com:80/city-refrigeration-early.aspx|title=The Early Years|publisher=Willie Haughey: An Inspirational Scottish Businessman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614163553/http://www.williehaughey.com:80/city-refrigeration-early.aspx|archive-date=14 June 2012|date=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical division is located in Clydesmill Industrial Estate near to [[Cambuslang]].

By 2017, the company had been rebranded as ''City Facilities Management'' and launched a European arm, headquartered in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/news/sir-willie-haugheys-city-refrigeration-10814391|title=Sir Willie Haughey's City Refrigeration Holdings launched new European venture|work=Scottish Business Insider|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=17 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their international clients include [[Coles Supermarkets]] in Australia.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt;

==Personal life and awards==
Haughey married Susan in 1978. He has one son Kenny.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; In his spare time he enjoys playing golf and tournament poker. He once revealed that he winds down every Friday night with a [[fish supper]].&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite web|title=I may be a millionaire but there's nothing I like better than a fish supper on a Friday night|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/12849417.I_may_be_a_millionaire_but_there_apos_s_nothing_I_like_better_than_a_fish_supper_on_a_Friday_night/|publisher=''[[Evening Times]]''|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=3 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2013, it was announced he was going to be a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] peer in the [[House of Lords]].

Haughey has been named in several newspaper reports in connection with the resignation of [[Steven Purcell]], the leader of [[Glasgow City Council]] until 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/comment/Eddie-Barnes-Resignation-is-a.6117742.jp|title=Resignation is a hammer-blow for Scottish Labour so close to a general election|date=3 March 2010|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=28 March 2010|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/comment/Steven-Purcell-Fall-of-a.6130367.jp|title=Steven Purcell: Fall of a High Flier|date=7 March 2010|publisher=Scotland on Sunday|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7061166.ece|title=Labour donor Willie Haughey in ‘cash for favours’ row|date=14 March 2010|publisher=Sunday Times Scotland|accessdate=28 March 2010 | location=London | first1=Jon | last1=Ungoed-Thomas | first2=Mark | last2=MacAskill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/company-linked-to-purcell-in-700-000-land-deal-with-labour-donor-1.1014924|title=Company linked to Purcell in £700,000 land deal with Labour donor|date=21 March 2010|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/firm-caught-up-in-purcell-furore-pulls-out-of-labour-party-conference-1.1015284|title=Firm caught up in Purcell furore pulls out of Labour party conference|date=23 March 2010|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15772731|title=Heartland attack|date=25 March 2010|publisher=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7078926.ece|title=Labour in little local difficulty|date=28 March 2010|publisher=Sunday Times Scotland|accessdate=28 March 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=MacAskill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2013 he was created a [[life peer]] taking the title '''Baron Haughey''', of [[Hutchesontown]] in the City of [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60635 |date=23 September 2013 |page=18709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 edition of the [[Sunday Times Rich List]] estimated his family's fortune at £265 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuk-rich-list-ui-2017-uk-prod.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/richlist/view/group17|title=Rich list 2017 - Wealthiest in Scotland|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Haughey was reported as having become involved in discussions between the [[Scottish Football Association]] and [[Queen's Park F.C.]] over the future use of [[Hampden Park]], the stadium used by the former but owned by the latter. With the SFA threatening to move their matches to [[Edinburgh]] and unwilling to pay more than £2 million to buy Hampden from Queen's Park while the club demanded £6 million, Haughey stepped in with an offer to 'split the difference' by adding a contribution to raise the purchase offer to £4 million, in order for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] matches and cup finals to remain in their traditional Glasgow home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/scotland/scottish-fa-close-to-4m-purchase-of-hampden-park-reports-1-4797517 |title=Scottish FA close to £4m purchase of Hampden Park - reports |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=11 September 2018 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workforce development''', an [[United States of America | American]] approach to [[economic development]], attempts to enhance a region's [[economic stability]] and prosperity by focusing on people rather than [[business]]es. It essentially develops a [[human resource management|human-resources]] strategy. Work-force development has evolved from a problem-focused approach, addressing issues such as low-skilled workers or the need for more employees in a particular industry, to a holistic approach considering participants' many barriers and the overall needs of the region.

Work-force development has historically occurred in two forms: place-based strategies that attempt to address the needs of people living in a particular neighborhood, and sector-based strategies that focus on matching workers' skills to needs in an industry already present in the region.

Across both approaches, themes for best practices have emerged. Successful workforce development programs (WDPs&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| title                 = Workforce New Jersey End of Year Report
| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=J75YAAAAYAAJ
| publisher             = Workforce New Jersey
| publication-date      = 1995
| page                  = 11 
| accessdate            = 2016-09-29
| quote                 = The SDA staff is assuming all training and related activities, including the responsibility of administering the Individual Training Grants for the Workforce Development Program (WDP) and the approval of WDP Additional Benefits during Training ((ABT).
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) 
typically have a strong network of ties in a community, and are equipped to respond to changes in their environments. Additionally, they take a holistic approach to the problems faced by participants.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The responsibility for work-force development in the United States has rested on the government's shoulders for at least a century, since the advent of [[state school | public school]]s. This formal system of education replaced earlier systems in American history when students whose parents desired them to learn a trade other than their parents' took up apprenticeships. Informal schooling took place at home, depending on the household's ability and income level. Public schools were founded to prepare students to earn a [[living wage]] by providing them with skills such as reading and arithmetic.{{cn|date=September 2016}} However, employers still typically provided vocational [[on-the-job training | training on-the-job]].

Traditional work-force development has been problem-focused. Economic development practitioners evaluated neighborhoods, cities, or states on the basis of perceived weaknesses in [[human resources | human-resource]] capacity. However, recent efforts{{when?|date=September 2016}} view work-force development in a more positive light. Economic developers use work-force development as a way to increase equity among inhabitants of a region. Inner-city residents may not have access to equal education opportunities, and work-force development programs can increase their skill levels so they can compete with [[suburbanite]]s for high-paying jobs.

Workforce development {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} often takes a more holistic approach, addressing issues such as [[spatial mismatch]] or poor transportation to jobs. Programs to train workers often form part of a network of other human-service or community opportunities.

==Approaches to work force development==
Researchers have categorized two approaches to work force development, sector-based and place-based approaches. The sectoral advocate speaks for the demand side, emphasizing employer- or market-driven strategies, whereas the place-based practitioner is resolutely a believer in the virtue of the supply side: those low-income job seekers who need work and a pathway out of poverty. However, contemporary strategies often use a mixed approach.&lt;ref name="Giloth 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giloth|first=Robert P.|title=Learning from the field: Economic growth and work force development in the 1990s|journal=Economic Development Quarterly|date=November 2000|volume=14|series=4|issue=340-359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sector-based approach===

====Description====
Sector-based approaches consider the sectors, or industries, in a region that are in need of specific workplace skills. These strategies focus on the demand side of workplace development and consider the industries in which it is most likely that new employees will be hired. Sector-based programs may have higher entrance requirements than place-based strategies because their ultimate aim is to aid the sector at which they are targeted, not to increase the general hirability of the most disadvantaged residents.

====Creation of a sector-based program====
Sector-based strategies are designed to fit the needs of both industry employers and workers who want to improve their skills and advance their career development. By definition, sector-based approaches must target a specific industry.

An initial assessment can reveal which industries would be good targets for a region, and assessments during the program can help refine the program's focus.

Appropriate strategies are typically created through networks and partnerships. These partnerships are designed to connect low-income or disadvantaged individuals with employment in jobs that offer the promise of financial stability and significant growth in the industry in the near future.

Community involvement is also an important component in building a sector-based strategy. Specifically, the involvement of an intermediary with deep knowledge of the industry is necessary.  The intermediary can facilitate partnerships with employers, and help create solutions for both employers and potential employees. Employers will be encouraged to participate in activities such as developing curriculum, creating evaluation and assessment tools, and committing to job shadow programs.

Because the sector approach targets an entire sector, rather than a single company, a sector strategy often involves the government working side-by-side with industry leaders to help an entire sector become more competitive.

====Potential barriers====
Several potential barriers exist for employing sector-based work force development strategies. First, in many regions a skills gap exists between what workers know and what employers need. Although demand might be high for a particular occupation, it may be unrealistic to train a low-skill population in the necessary skills.

Second, rapid change makes sector-based strategies difficult. Quick turnover in technology can make a training program obsolete in a few years. There is also the recent development of companies outsourcing or sub-contracting as well as giving out temporary work. In order to be competitive in the marketplace they need to reduce costs and increase flexibility. &lt;ref name=":123"&gt;Rademacher, Ida. “Working with Value: Industry-Specific Approaches to Workforce Development.” ''The Aspen Institute'', Feb. 2008, www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/working-value-industry-specific-approaches-workforce-development/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Last, many potential workers in the United States demonstrate low literacy or educational levels. In some regions, work force development programs will have to teach basic skills like reading as well as giving instruction in more specialized tasks.

===Place-based approach===

====Description====
Place-based approaches, which consider the supply side of the workplace (workers), are primarily focused on the characteristics of people in the region or community where the training program will be located. Place-based strategies often help participants gain initial access to the labor market while addressing other essential concerns to the region, such as housing development or English skills. In general, place-based approaches aim at training the unemployed workers and enhancing their skills for entering the labor market.

Place-based strategies have been criticized for their focus on finding jobs for participants quickly, rather than evaluating the quality of those jobs

====Elements of place-based programs====
Place-based approaches have provided an ideal framework for state and local government to address the issue of unemployment and poverty problems in local communities or regions. A strong place-based effort will focus on the most pressing needs of local residents, such as physical or substance abuse or financial difficulties, along with providing employment training. The program may want to provide mentors who can connect participants to resources, rather undertaking the large financial burden of providing these services. &lt;ref&gt;“Place-Based vs. Sector-Based Workforce Development.” ''Social Solutions'', 16 Aug. 2017, www.socialsolutions.com/blog/place-based-vs-sector-based-workforce-development/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential Barriers ====
Not only do programs have to think about placing individuals into jobs in demand that fits the individuals' skill, but programs also have to consider the stability of jobs they place individuals in and the opportunities for growth the jobs provide.

== Core Concerns ==
Skills, networks, careers, and collaboration play a key part in the concept and implementation of workforce development programs. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Schrock, G. (2014). Connecting people and place prosperity: Workforce development and urban planning in scholarship and practice. ''Journal of Planning Literature, 29''(3), 257-271. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0885412214538834&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skills ===
The acquisition and development of skills is one of the crucial aspects of workforce development training. Two types of skills are commonly defined: general skills and job-specific skills. Described by their name, general skills (language, writing, basic computer skills) can be used in various careers and job-specific skills (like a particular computer application) are more directed towards the demands of the occupation. The more specialized skills get, the more thought programs have to put in when deciding whether or not the benefits of training is worth the costs, considering job-specific skills only apply to a limited set of jobs. Through this process of skills formation, programs work to increase their trainees' [[human capital]]. By making this investment, businesses proactively increase their workers' productivity and efficiency, maximizing their own profit. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The general guide for evaluating the effectiveness of a skill-building system is measuring the increase in skills, the increase in "productivity and earnings in the labor market" from this added skill, and the rate of return in terms of cost.

Workforce development programs and federal training programs also have to be careful in what kind of skills they intend their workers to gain. "Developing skills in fields not in demand can lead to frustration, job dissatisfaction, lower wages, and not necessarily to more good jobs". &lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Lerman, Robert I. 2008. ‘‘Are Skills the Problem? Reforming the Education and Training System in the United States.’’ In A Future of Good Jobs? America’s Challenge in the Global Economy, edited by Timothy J. Bartik and Susan N. Houseman, 17–80. Kalamazoo, MI: W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, economists has noticed a growing occurrence in [[Structural unemployment|skills mismatch]] where the education received through the public education system, does not align with the kind of education needed for high wage, steady careers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Though workforce development strives to remedy the effects of this problem, the only way to truly fix it is to address the root of the problem which concerns primary and secondary education systems.

=== Networks ===
Workforce development tackles systemic inequalities in the labor market by operating on both sides, efficiently connecting workers with jobs and employers with workers. Theories on networks have emphasized the importance of who you know, rather than what you know which is an attributing factor for some labor market inequalities regarding gender, racial minorities, and the poor.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Individuals are more likely to hear about job opportunities from those of the same sex, and women are more likely to search for jobs closer to home than men are, contributing to the perpetuation of occupational inequalities by sex. &lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Susan, and Geraldine Pratt. 1991. ‘‘Job Search and the Occupational Segregation of Women.’’ Annals of the Association of American Geographers 81 (2): 229–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Living in inner-city communities and belonging to a minority group isolates those individuals from networks of the gainfully employed. Connecting disadvantaged workers to good jobs is not impossible however, and the Center of Employment Training (CET) in San Jose has found a successful way of operating it. CET had networks with employers to identify skill demands and even stronger networks with individuals in the community they were serving.&lt;ref&gt;Melendez, Edwin, and Bennett Harrison. 1998. ‘‘Matching the Disadvantaged to Job Opportunities: Structural Explanations for the Past Successes of the Center for Employment Training.’’ Economic Development Quarterly 12 (1): 3–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Careers ===
Another key part in workforce development's service for individuals is career advancement. This guidance on paths and barriers to advancement is especially relevant today, where the practice of internal labor markets is uncommon, particularly among women and minorities. In the past, advancement often took place in [[Internal labor market|internal labor markets]] (ILMs) so promotions and upward mobility occurred within the same firm workers were hired in. "They promoted predictability, stability, and long-term skill development".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  ILMs no longer dominate the field of career advancement as a result of the [[Dual labour market|dualization of labor markets]]. This term refers to the noticeable split in "primary sector" and "secondary sector jobs" where the former is recognized for high skills, wages, and stability while the latter is marked by the opposite.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Vietorisz, Thomas, and Bennett Harrison. 1973. ‘‘Labor Market Segmentation: Positive Feedback and Divergent Development.’’ American Economic Review 63 (2): 366–76.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ongoing corporate restructuring has shifted risk of economic instability from firms onto workers and households&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Jacob S. 2006. The Great Risk Shift. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, rendered opportunities for upward mobility within firms more opaque and elusive&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Joan. 2006. Moving Up in the New Economy: Career Ladders for U.S. Workers. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, and weakened institutions (i.e., unions) for worker voice and democratic decision making on the job".&lt;ref&gt;Kochan, Thomas. 2006. ‘‘Restoring Voice at Work and in Society.’’ In America at Work: Choices and Challenges, edited by Edward E.Lawler and James O’Toole, 37–52. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; These recent challenges make the role of workforce development programs all the more valuable.

=== Public and Private Collaboration ===
Collaboration between public organizations (a non profit or government administered organization like [[Job Corps]]) and private corporations is an essential aspect of workforce development. Research by Harvard professor James E. Austin has defined three stages of collaboration: philanthropic, transactional, and integrative. [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]]'s and [[City Year]]'s partnership exemplifies the purpose of workforce development and Austin uses the development of their relationship as an example for all three stages.

==== Philanthropic ====
In the philanthropic stage, the relationship between the partners is donor and receiver. For Timberland, this meant donating 50 pairs of boots to City Year for their youth service corps uniform. This one sided exchange of economic resources required low investment by Timberland as the charity was considered a "peripheral part" of their activities, and no investment by City Year as there was no reciprocity.

==== Transactional ====
The next stage, transactional, is defined by more involvement by both partners and an increased flow of mutual resources. Timberland supplied City Year's entire uniform and raised their contribution to $1 million. They assisted the non-profit with "finances, marketing, and human resource management". In return, "City Year organized community service projects for Timberland employees" and "led Timberland employees in team building and diversity training".  The exchange of resources is no longer one-sided in the transactional stage. Timberland builds their brand by adding a new element of social involvement within and outside the company. City Year fulfills its mission of promoting "civic engagement, not just by its youth corps members but also by corporations and other elements of society".  Both partners are involved in contributing to each other's value construct.

==== Integration ====
The highest level of collaboration is integration. This stage requires further involvement than the transactional stage and is characterized by "imprinting" on each other's organizational culture. City Year's commitment to community service has been engrained in Timberland, now that their employees get 40 hours of paid time off each year for service activities. The company has helped City Year in expanding its operations nationally. The jump from transactional to integrative may be hard to measure, but Chief Operating officer of Timberland Jeff Schwartz clarifies the difference. Under the transactional stage, a board member's work on City Year's financial plans and business policies could count as paid-time community service. Under the integrative stage, these actions would be considered "no different than being out assisting one of the company's manufacturing plants". Though the two organizations are still identified as separate entities, there exists a "merged identity" when the two work together. Schwartz claim the company is "much more linked" and "not simply personal, [but] collective" with City Year in this relationship. &lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Austin, J. (2000). Strategic collaboration between nonprofits and business. ''Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly'', ''29''(1), 69-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers to workforce development collaborations ==
Collaborations are key to the success of workforce development programs but factors like competition, high initial upfront costs, and fragmented governance make it hard for programs to work together.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Meléndez, E., Borges-Mendez, R., Visser, M., &amp; Rosofsky, A. (2015). The restructured landscape of economic development: Challenges and opportunities for regional workforce development collaborations. ''Economic Development Quarterly, 29''(2), 150-166. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891242414566151&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition ===
The workforce development system has recently been experiencing increased competition as new actors enter, resources dwindle, performance measures arise, and federal funding decreases. These factors, especially the cuts in federal funding, pressure organizations to collaborate with other organizations that oftentimes have different missions. The forced partnerships resulting from this bring new factors to the table, heightening the chaos within the already struggling system. Though required partnerships sound positive or at least non-competitive, it is important to remember that workforce development agencies prioritize themselves first, as any organization would. The competition for scarce resources is fierce when trying to accomplish and even surpass new performance measures to secure more funding and stay in business. This is where the root of tension and hesitancy to collaboration lies- with institutions fighting for survival in the midst of partnership with others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== High initial upfront costs ===
In order for collaborations to be relatively successful, the companies involved are expected to spend a significant amount of time and resources in discussing labor market issues and the ways in which these issues should be addressed in the partnership. In addition, they have to weigh the costs and benefits, and recognize the values of a future in cooperation which are customarily seen long term. Proposals should be specific and codeveloped so there is a clear structure to the work. "Starting with a full consideration of what all sides need lays the base for a successful partnership". &lt;ref name=":162"&gt;Austin, J. (2000). Strategic collaboration between nonprofits and business. ''Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly'', ''29''(1), 69-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering there are no short term incentives to reward this front load effort required from companies engaging in collaboration, the motivation to do so is weak.

To combat these high initial upfront costs, some organizations with complementary interests collaborate with each other to form "clusters". With a common goal driving the group, there is noticeably increased efficiency in providing services which is why there is a faster return on investments working like this. Unfortunately, the success of agencies with similar missions clustering together discourages more comprehensive collaborations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Fragmented governance ===
Inherent to the concept of partnership and collaboration is the meshing of various organizations. When these diverse companies join, the accountability systems and governances they once individually had vanish. They lack "a centralized authority through which leadership, accountability, and governance can be provided which may hinder workforce development collaborations".

The root of a faulty framework stems from the fact that most collaborations are only established through [[Memorandum of understanding|memorandums of understanding]] (MOUs). This expression of agreement does not do enough to address large governance issues, ensure participation among the collaboration, define leadership, and add more specified accountability measures. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Successful conditions for work force development programs==

Although workforce development strategies vary by whether they are focused on demands due to the location or from industries in the area, or both, common threads run through the success stories evaluated by economic developers thus far.

===Pre-assessment of community needs===

Prior to implementing a sector- or place-based approach, an analysis of the community's current and anticipated needs should be undertaken. One report details a sector analysis to determine the need for more healthcare workers in a particular community, for example.

===Ties with employers===

Both sector and place-based strategies emphasize the importance of ties with the employers. Even in place-based strategies focused on finding work quickly must tie efforts to employers to determine who is hiring.

In place-based programs, this may entail determining general skills that are lacking in a specific population such as English-speaking skills.
 
Work force development programs can be evaluated based on the strength and number of ties with community employers during the creation stage of the program, as well as their ongoing participation to constantly assess which skills are most needed. “Employer leadership is key to long-term reform” of work force development systems.

It is in the program's best interest to enforce high standards for their participants to gain and maintain credibility among the employers they are sending their participants to. With a good reputation, the program may be able to work with more companies and make even more jobs available to participants.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Rademacher, Ida. “Working with Value: Industry-Specific Approaches to Workforce Development.” ''The Aspen Institute'', Feb. 2008, www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/working-value-industry-specific-approaches-workforce-development/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptability===

Programs must be flexible, so that they can change when market or work force conditions change. One marker of adaptability is the presence of mechanisms to listen to what the community saying, evidenced by the close ties with community stakeholders and nonprofits as explained above.

Another area where this characteristic is important is with participant training. Programs should take into account how skilled participants are when coming into the program and the pace that participants works at. Consideration of these factors on a person-to-person basis is important to develop participants' skills more efficiently and keep participants engaged. Programs should recognize that skills for a job are not the only keys to success for the job. "Individuals need to understand the norms and culture of the workplace. Thus programs pay a great deal of attention not only to the content of training curricula but also to the atmosphere and culture of the training program".&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;Rademacher, Ida. “Working with Value: Industry-Specific Approaches to Workforce Development.” ''The Aspen Institute'', Feb. 2008, www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/working-value-industry-specific-approaches-workforce-development/.&lt;/ref&gt;
