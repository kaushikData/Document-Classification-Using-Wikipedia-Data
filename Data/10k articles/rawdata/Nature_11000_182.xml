      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">The '''1982–83 El Niño event''' was one of the strongest [[El Niño]] events since records were kept.

It led to widespread flooding across the southern [[United States]], droughts in [[Indonesia]] and [[Australia]], and lack of snow in northern areas of the United States. The estimated economic impact was over [[United States dollar|US$]]8 billion.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Fcst-office.com_July_22_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcst-office.com/HardRock/Meteo241/El%20Nino%201982-1983/ProjectThree.html|title=The 1982-83 El Nino|date=|newspaper=Fcst-office.com|author=|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This El Niño event also led to an abnormal number of [[1983 Pacific hurricane season|hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean]] during this time span; the [[Hurricane Iwa|strongest hurricane up to 1983]] hit [[Hawaii]] during this El Niño event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/06/12/how-the-super-el-nino-of-1982-83-kept-itself-a-secret/|title=How the super El Nino of 1982-83 kept itself a secret|last=Williams|first=Jack|date=2015-06-12|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astronautics''' (or '''cosmonautics''') is the theory and practice of navigation beyond [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].

The term ''astronautics'' (originally ''astronautique'' in [[French language|French]]) was coined in the 1920s by [[J.-H. Rosny aîné|J.-H. Rosny]], president of the [[Académie Goncourt|Goncourt academy]], in analogy with [[aeronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1972x006x004/HSMx1972x006x004x0250.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811223005/http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1972x006x004/HSMx1972x006x004x0250.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields, the term [[aerospace]] is often used to describe both at once. In 1930, [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] published the first book on the new research field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/robert-esnault-pelterie/3-l-astronautique/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429090122/http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/robert-esnault-pelterie/3-l-astronautique/ |archivedate=2014-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with aeronautics, the restrictions of mass, temperatures, and external forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions: high-grade [[vacuum]], the [[radiation]] bombardment of [[interplanetary space]] and the [[Van Allen belts|magnetic belts]] of [[low Earth orbit]]. [[launch vehicle|Space launch vehicles]] must withstand titanic forces, while [[satellites]] can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods.&lt;ref name="Sellers"&gt;''Understanding Space: An Introduction to Astronautics'', Sellers. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] that reaches [[orbit]].

==History==
The early history of astronautics is theoretical: the fundamental mathematics of space travel was established by [[Isaac Newton]] in his 1687 treatise [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]].&lt;ref name="BMW"&gt;''Fundamentals of Astrodynamics'', Bate, Mueller, and White. Dover: New York (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Other mathematicians, such as Swiss [[Leonhard Euler]] and Franco-Italian [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] also made essential contributions in the 18th and 19th centuries. In spite of this, astronautics did not become a [[practical discipline]] until the mid-20th century. On the other hand, the question of [[spaceflight]] puzzled the literary imaginations of such figures as [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Russian cosmism|Russian cosmist]] [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] derived the [[rocket equation]], the governing [[equation]] for a [[rocket|rocket-based propulsion]], enabling computation of the final velocity of a rocket from the mass of spacecraft (&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;), combined mass of propellant and spacecraft (&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt;) and exhaust velocity of the propellant (&lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt;).
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v\ = v_e \ln \frac {m_0} {m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

By the early 1920s, [[United States|American]] [[Robert Goddard]] was developing [[liquid-propellant rocket]]s, which would in a few brief decades become a critical component in the designs of such famous rockets as the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] and [[Saturn V]].

The [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie#Prix REP-Hirsch|Prix d'Astronautique]] (Astronautics Prize) awarded by the [[Société astronomique de France]], the French astronomical society, was the first prize on this subject. The international award, established by aviation and astronautical pioneer [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] and André-Louis Hirsch, was given from 1929-1939 in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics.

By the mid 1950s, the [[Space Race]] between the USSR and the USA had begun.

==Subdisciplines==
Although many regard astronautics itself as a rather specialized subject, engineers and scientists working in this area must be knowledgeable in many distinct fields.
* [[Astrodynamics]]: the study of orbital motion. Those specializing in this field examine topics such as spacecraft trajectories, ballistics and celestial mechanics.
* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]: how spacecraft change orbits, and how they are launched. Most spacecraft have some variety of [[rocket engine]], and thus most research efforts focus on some variety of [[rocket|rocket propulsion]], such as chemical, nuclear or electric.
* [[Spacecraft design]]: a specialized form of [[systems engineering]] that centers on combining all the necessary subsystems for a particular [[launch vehicle]] or [[satellite]].
* [[Control engineering|Controls]]: keeping a satellite or rocket in its desired orbit (as in spacecraft navigation) and orientation (as in [[attitude control]]).
* [[Space environment]]: although more a sub-discipline of [[physics]] rather than astronautics, the effects of [[space weather]] and other environmental issues constitute an increasingly important field of study for spacecraft designers.

'''Aydıncık Nature Park''' is a nature park in [[Turkey]]. It is at {{coord|36|08|52|N|33|21|38|E}} and situated to the east of [[Aydıncık, Mersin|Aydıncık]] [[ilçe]] (district) of [[Mersin Province]]. Its distance to Aydıncık centrum is about {{convert|2|km}} and to [[Mersin]] is about {{convert|170|km}}. [[Gilindire Cave]] is to the east of the nature park. It was declared a picnic area in 1988 and a nature park in 2011.

The park is at the east side of Aydıncık bay, facing [[Aydıncık Islands]] and the town. 
The total area of the park is {{convert|23.7|ha}}. The natural flora consists of [[Pinus brutia|Turkish pine]] (Pinus brutia), [[myrtus communis|myrtle]] (myrtus communis), [[quercus coccifera|kermes oak]] (quercus coccifera) and [[laurus nobilis|laurel]] (laurus nobilis), and [[Calicotome villosa|spini broom]] (calicotome villosa). [[Mediterranean gull]] (chthyaetus melanocephalus), [[Mediterranean monk seal]] (monachus monachus ) and various small reptiles make up the fauna around the park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mersin.ormansu.gov.tr/icel/AnaSayfa/korunanalanlar/tabiatparklari/aydincik.aspx?sflang=tr Ministry of Forestry Mersin branch page]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have a long history in the Black Hills. After conquering the [[Cheyenne]] in 1776, the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] took over the territory of the Black Hills, which became central to their culture. In 1868, the U.S. government signed the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]], establishing the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] west of the Missouri River, and exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever. However, when settlers discovered [[gold]] there in 1874, as a result of [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s Black Hills Expedition, miners swept into the area in a [[gold rush]]. The US government took back the Black Hills and in 1889 reassigned the Lakota, against their wishes, to five smaller reservations in western South Dakota, selling off 9 million acres of their former land. Unlike most of South Dakota, the Black Hills were settled by European Americans primarily from population centers to the west and south of the region, as miners flocked there from earlier gold boom locations in Colorado and Montana.

As the economy of the Black Hills has shifted from natural resources ([[mining]] and [[logging|timber]]) since the late 20th century, the [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]] and [[tourism]] industries have grown to take its place. Locals tend to divide the Black Hills into two areas: "The Southern Hills" and "The Northern Hills". The Southern Hills is home to [[Mount Rushmore]], [[Wind Cave National Park]], [[Jewel Cave National Monument]], [[Black Elk Peak]] (the highest point in the United States east of the Rockies, formerly known as Harney Peak), [[Custer State Park]] (the largest state park in South Dakota), the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] (the largest sculpture in the world), and the [[Mammoth Site, Hot Springs|Mammoth Site]] in [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]], the world's largest [[mammoth]] research facility.

Attractions in the Northern Hills include [[Spearfish Canyon]], historic [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], and the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]], held each August. The first Rally was held on August 14, 1938 and the 75th Rally in 2015 saw more than 1 million bikers visit the Black Hills. [[Devils Tower National Monument]], located in the Wyoming Black Hills, is an important nearby attraction and was the United States' first national monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ray H. |last=Mattison |url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/historyculture/places.htm |title=The First Fifty Years|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |year=1955 |accessdate=January 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{confusing|date=February 2018}}

Although written history of the region begins with the Sioux domination of the land over the native Arikara tribes, researchers have carbon-dating and stratigraphic records to analyze the early history of the area. Scientists have been able to utilize carbon-dating to evaluate the age of tools found in the area, which indicate a human presence that dates as far back as 11,500 BC with the [[Clovis culture]]. Stratigraphic records indicate environmental changes in the land, such as flood and drought patterns. For example, large-scale flooding of the Black Hill basins occurs at a probability rate of 0.01, making such floods occur once in every 100 years. However, during The Medieval Climate Anomaly, or the [[Medieval Warm Period]], flooding increased in the basins. A stratigraphic record of the area shows that during this 400-year period, thirteen 100-year floods occurred in four of the region's basins, while the same four basins from the previous 800 years only experienced nine floods.

The [[Arikara]] arrived by AD 1500, followed by the [[Cheyenne]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Kiowa]] and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].
The [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (also known as [[Sioux]]) arrived from [[Minnesota]] in the 18th century and drove out the other tribes, who moved west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/buffalowar/buffalo1.html |title=The Buffalo War |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed the land, which they called ''{{lang|lkt|Ȟe Sápa}}'' (Black Mountains). The mountains commonly became known as the Black Hills.

[[File:Custerblackhills.jpg|thumb|left|Gold miners in the Black Hills]]
[[File:Prairiecabin.jpg|thumb|left|Abandoned cabin near [[Dewey, South Dakota|Dewey]] in the southern Black Hills]]
[[François de La Vérendrye|François]] and [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye|Louis de La Vérendrye]] probably travelled near the Black Hills in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100517062419/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/history_of_the_black_hills.htm History of the Black Hills]". U.S. National Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Fur trappers and traders had some dealings with the Native Americans.

European Americans increasingly encroached on Lakota territory. After defeating the Lakota Sioux, the United States government made peace under the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty]] of 1868, establishing the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] west of the Missouri River and acknowledging their control of the Teton range. In this treaty, they protected the Black Hills "forever" from European-American settlement. Both the Sioux and Cheyenne also claimed rights to the land, saying that in their cultures, it was considered the ''[[axis mundi]]'', or sacred center of the world.

Although rumors of [[gold]] in the Black Hills had circulated for decades (see [[Thoen Stone]] and [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]]), it was not until 1874 that Brevet Major General [[George Armstrong Custer]] of the [[7th US Cavalry]] led an [[Black Hills Expedition (1874)|expedition]] there and discovered gold in [[French Creek (South Dakota)|French Creek]]. An official announcement of gold was made by the newspaper reporters accompanying the expedition. The following year, the [[Newton-Jenney Party]] conducted the first detailed survey of the Black Hills. The surveyor for the party, Dr. [[Valentine McGillycuddy]], was the first European American to ascend to the top of [[Black Elk Peak]]. This highest point in the Black Hills is 7,242 feet above sea level.

During the 1875–1878 [[Black Hills Gold Rush|gold rush]], thousands of miners went to the Black Hills; in 1880, the area was the most densely populated part of the [[Dakota Territory]]. Three large towns developed in the Northern Hills: [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Central City, South Dakota|Central City]], and [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]]. Around these were groups of smaller gold camps, towns, and villages. [[Hill City, South Dakota|Hill City]] and [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer City]] sprang up in the Southern Hills. Railroads were quickly constructed to the previously remote area. From 1880 on, the gold mines yielded about $4,000,000 annually, and the silver mines about $3,000,000 annually.

===Takeover of the Black Hills===
[[File:Inyan-Kara.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Inyan Kara Mountain|Inyan Kara]]'' is a sacred mountain to the [[Lakota people]]]]
The conflict over control of the region sparked the [[Black Hills War]] (1876), also known as the Great Sioux War, the last major [[Indian Wars|Indian War]] on the Great Plains. Following the defeat of the Lakota and their [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] allies in 1876, the United States took control of the Black Hills and another strip of land, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. The Lakota never accepted the validity of the US appropriation in 1877. They have continued to try to reclaim the property&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |publisher=Centre Communications |location=[[Irwindale, California]] |title=Eyanopopi: The Heart of the Sioux |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |date=1988 |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/help/how/find/films/indian/e.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104164108/http://www.library.arizona.edu/help/how/find/films/indian/e.html |archivedate=January 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and filed a suit against the federal government.

===Breakup of Great Sioux Reservation===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
In 1889, the United States dismantled the [[Great Sioux Reservation]], forcing the peoples on to five smaller reservations west of the Missouri River. It made available 9 million acres throughout this area for purchase for ranching or homesteading, in the same year that North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted to the Union. Many of the early farms established by homesteaders in the 20th century failed, as they were too small for farming in the arid regions. People made many mistakes and plowed the grasses holding the earth on the plains, causing the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.

===20th century land claims===
On July 23, 1980, in ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the Black Hills were illegally taken by the federal government and ordered remuneration of the initial offering price plus interest, nearly $106 million. The Lakota refused the settlement, as they wanted the Black Hills returned to them. The money remains in an interest-bearing account, which, as of 2015, amounts to over $1.2 billion, but the Lakota still refuse to take the money. They believe that accepting the settlement would allow the US government to justify taking ownership of the Black Hills.

In 2012, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] [[James Anaya]] conducted a 12-day tour of Native Americans' land to determine how the U.S. is carrying out the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], endorsed in 2010 by the [[Obama administration]]. Anaya met with tribes in seven states on [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and in urban areas as well as with members of the Obama administration and the [[Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]]. In an appeal issued August 21, 2012, Anaya brought a sale of over 1,900 acres of land in Black Hills by the Reynolds family to the attention of the U.S. government, and asked that it disclose measures taken by federal or state governments to address Sioux concerns over the sale of the land within Reynolds Prairie. These acres consist of five land tracts, including the sacred Pe' Sla site for Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota peoples; natives to Black Hills fund raised in order to buy the land during the Reynolds' sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spdb.ohchr.org/hrdb/22nd/public_-_UA_USA_21.08.12_(18.2012).pdf|title=Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples|last=Anaya|first=James|date=21 August 2012|website=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007232546/https://spdb.ohchr.org/hrdb/22nd/public_-_UA_USA_21.08.12_(18.2012).pdf|archive-date=7 October 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 2013, the U.S. responded, telling Anaya that it "understands several tribes purchased the Pe' Sla sacred site around November 30, 2012" meaning the Pe' Sla is officially Sioux land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spdb.ohchr.org/hrdb/22nd/USA_02.01.13_(18.2012).pdf|title=OHCHR Registry No. 01-13|last=Rice|first=Susan|date=15 January 2013|website=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Gold-quartz placer nugget, Lead SD.jpg|thumb|Gold-quartz placer nugget, found near Lead. About 1 cm wide.]]
The [[geology]] of the Black Hills is complex. A [[Tertiary]] mountain-building episode is responsible for the uplift and current [[topography]] of the Black Hills region. This uplift was marked by [[volcano|volcanic]] activity in the northern Black Hills. The southern Black Hills are characterized by [[Precambrian]] [[granite]], [[pegmatite]], and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks that comprise the core of the entire Black Hills uplift. This core is rimmed by [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]] [[sedimentary]] rocks. The [[stratigraphy]] of the Black Hills is laid out like a target, as it is an oval [[dome (geology)|dome]], with rings of different rock types [[Strike and dip|dipping]] away from the center.

===Precambrian===
[[File:Black Elk Peak hike 03.jpg|thumb|left|The granite core of the Black Hills rises {{convert|7244|ft|m}} at [[Black Elk Peak]].]]
The 'bulls eye' of this target is called the [[granite]] core. The granite of the Black Hills was emplaced by [[magma]] generated during the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny]] and contains abundant pegmatite. The core of the Black Hills has been [[Radiometric dating|dated]] to 1.8 billion years. There are other localized deposits that have been dated to around 2.2 to 2.8 billion years. One of these is located in the northern hills. It is called French Creek Granite although it has been metamorphosed into [[gneiss]]. The other is called the Bear Mountain complex, and it is located in the west central part of the hills.
[[File:Black Hills angular deformity.jpg|thumb|right|The angular [[unconformity]] between the Deadwood Formation and the underlying [[Precambrian]] rocks near Rapid City.]]
"Making a concentric ring around the core is the [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] zone. The rocks in this ring are all very old, as much as 2 billion years and older. This zone is very complex, filled with many diverse rock types. The rocks were originally [[sedimentary]], until there was a collision between the North American continent and a [[terrane]]. This collision, called the Trans-Hudson Orogeny, caused the original rocks to fold and twist into a vast mountain range. Over the millions of years, these tilted rocks, which in many areas are tilted to 90 degrees or more, eroded. Today we see the evidence of this erosion in the Black Hills, where the metamorphic rocks end in an angular [[unconformity]] below the younger sedimentary layers.

===Paleozoic===
The final layers of the Black Hills consist of sedimentary rocks. The oldest lie on top of the metamorphic layers at a much shallower angle. This rock called the [[Deadwood Formation]] is mostly [[sandstone]] and was the original source of [[gold]] found in the [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] area. Above the Deadwood Formation lies the Englewood Formation and Pahasapa [[limestone]], which is the source of the more than 200 [[caves]] found in the Black Hills, including [[Jewel Cave National Monument|Jewel Cave]] and [[Wind Cave National Park|Wind Cave]]. The Minnelusa Formation is next and is composed of highly variable sandstones and limestones followed by the Opeche [[shale]] and the Minnekahta limestone.

===Mesozoic===
The next rock layer, the [[Spearfish Formation]], forms a valley around the hills called the Red Valley and is often referred to as the Race Track.&lt;ref name=redvalley&gt;{{cite gnis|1267034|Red Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-black-hills-national-forest-rapid-city-sidwcmdev_066660.html |title=Black Hills National Forest — Environment |website=Gorp.com |accessdate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128223711/http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-black-hills-national-forest-rapid-city-sidwcmdev_066660.html |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly red [[shale]] with beds of [[gypsum]], and circles much of the Black Hills. These shale and gypsum beds as well as the nearby [[limestone]] beds of the Minnekahta are used in the manufacture of [[cement]] at a cement plant in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]]. Next is the shale and sandstone [[Sundance Formation]], which is topped by the [[Morrison Formation]] and the Unkpapa sandstone.

The outermost feature of the dome stands out as a [[hogback (geology)|hogback ridge]]. The ridge is made out of the Lakota Formation and the Fallriver sandstone, which are collectively called the [[Inyan Kara Mountain|Inyan Kara]] Group. Above this, the layers of rocks are less distinct and are all mainly grey shale with three exceptions: the Newcastle sandstone; the Greenhorn limestone, which contains many [[shark tooth|shark teeth]] [[fossil]]s; and the Niobrara Formation, which is composed mainly of [[chalk]]. These outer ridges are called [[cuesta]]s.

===Cenozoic===
[[Image:Fallingrock.jpg|thumb|right|Fallingrock cliff in Dark Canyon. The rock is of Paleozoic age but is capped with a Cenozoic gravel terrace.]]
The preceding [[stratum|layers]] were deposited in a horizontal manner. All of them can be seen in core samples and well logs from the flattest parts of the [[Great Plains]]. It took a period of [[tectonic uplift|uplift]] to bring them to their present topographical levels in the Black Hills. This uplift, called the [[Laramide orogeny]], began around the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] and left a line of [[igneous]] rocks through the northern hills superimposed on the rocks already discussed. This line extends from [[Bear Butte]] in the east to [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]] in the west. Evidence of Cenozoic [[volcanic]] eruptions, if this happened, has long since been eroded away.

The Black Hills also have a 'skirt' of [[gravel]] covering them in areas, which are called [[Pediment (geology)|pediments]]. Formed as the waterways cut down into the uplifting hills, they represent the former locations of today's rivers. These beds are generally around 10,000 years old or younger, judging by the artifacts and fossils found. A few places, mainly in the high elevations, are older, as old as 20 million years, according to camel and rodent fossils found. Some gravels have been found but for the most part, these older beds have been eroded away.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Biosystems==
[[File:Sylvan Lake 2016 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sylvan Lake, South Dakota|Sylvan Lake]], located in [[Custer State Park]]]]
As with the geology, the biology of the Black Hills is complex.  Most of the Hills are a fire-climax [[ponderosa pine]] forest, with [[White spruce|Black Hills spruce]] (''Picea glauca'' var. ''densata'') occurring in cool moist valleys of the Northern Hills. Oddly, this [[Endemism|endemic]] variety of spruce does not occur in the moist [[Bear Lodge Mountains]], which make up most of the Wyoming portion of the Black Hills. Large open parks (mountain meadows) with lush grassland rather than forest are scattered through the Hills (especially the western portion), and the southern edge of the Hills, due to the rainshadow of the higher elevations, are covered by a dry pine [[savannah]], with stands of [[mountain mahogany]] and [[Rocky Mountain juniper]].

Wildlife is both diverse and plentiful.  Black Hills creeks are known for their trout, while the forests and grasslands offer good habitat for [[American bison]], white-tailed and mule [[deer]], [[pronghorn]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[mountain lion]]s, and a variety of smaller animals, like [[prairie dog]]s, [[American marten]]s, [[American red squirrel]]s, [[Northern flying squirrel]]s, [[yellow-bellied marmot]]s, and [[fox squirrel]]s. Biologically, the Black Hills is a meeting and mixing place, with species common to regions to the east, west, north, and south. The Hills do, however, support some endemic taxa, the most famous of which is probably [[white-winged junco]] (''Junco hyemalis aikeni''). Some other endemics are Cooper's Rocky Mountain snail, Black Hills subspecies of  [[red-bellied snake]], and a Black Hills subspecies of [[southern red-backed vole]]. Some birds that are only in the Black Hills and not the rest of [[South Dakota]] are [[pinyon jay]], [[gray jay]], [[American three-toed woodpecker|three-toed woodpecker]], [[black-backed woodpecker]], [[American dipper]], [[ruffed grouse]], and others.

==Regions of the Black Hills==
[[File:Black Hills National Forest Districts Map.pdf|thumb|Black Hills National Forest Districts Map]]
The northern Black Hills approximate [[Lawrence County, South Dakota|Lawrence]] and [[Meade County, South Dakota|Meade]] Counties and are roughly equivalent to the Northern Hills District of the [[Black Hills National Forest]]. The central Black Hills (the Mystic District of the Black Hills National Forest) are located in [[Pennington County, South Dakota|Pennington County]] west of Rapid City. The southern Black Hills are in [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County]] and are administered in the national forest's Hell Canyon District. Finally, Wyoming's Black Hills follow the Bearlodge District, approximately [[Weston County, Wyoming|Weston]] and [[Crook County, Wyoming|Crook]] Counties.

Geologically separate from the Black Hills are the [[Elk Mountains (South Dakota)|Elk Mountains]], a small range forming the southwest portion of the region.

==Tourism and economy==
[[Image:Black Hills, Mount Rushmore National Park.jpg|thumb|Black Hills opposite [[Mount Rushmore]]]]
[[Image:Homestake works mine 1889.jpg|thumb|Homestake Mine in 1889]]
The region is home to [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]], [[Wind Cave National Park]], [[Jewel Cave National Monument]], [[Black Elk Peak]], [[Custer State Park]] (the largest state park in South Dakota, and one of the largest in the US), [[Bear Butte State Park]], [[Devils Tower National Monument]], and the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]]. The Black Hills also hosts the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]] each August. The rally was started in 1940 and the 65th Rally in 2005 saw more than 550,000 bikers visit the Black Hills. It is a key part of the regional economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2017 Sturgis Rally economic impact reportedly $738 million |url=https://www.blackhillsfox.com/content/news/2017-Sturgis-Rally-economic-impact-reportedly-738-million-450642483.html |accessdate=14 November 2018 |work=KEVN TV |agency=Gray Digital Media |date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George S. Mickelson Trail]] is a recently opened multi-use path through the Black Hills that follows the abandoned track of the historic railroad route from [[Edgemont, South Dakota|Edgemont]] to [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]]. The train used to be the only way to bring supplies to the miners in the Hills. The trail is about 110 miles in length, and can be used by hikers, cross-country skiers, and cyclists. The cost is two dollars per day, or ten dollars annually.

Today, the major city in the Black Hills is [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], with an incorporated population of almost 70,000 and a metropolitan population of 125,000. It serves a market area covering much of five states: North and [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Montana]]. In addition to tourism and mining (including coal, specialty minerals, and the now declining gold mining), the Black Hills economy includes ranching (sheep and cattle, primarily, with [[American bison|bison]] and [[ratites]] becoming more common), timber (lumber), [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], and some manufacturing, including [[Black Hills gold jewelry]], cement, electronics, cabinetry, guns and ammunition.

In many ways, the Black Hills functions as a very spread-out urban area with a population (not counting tourists) of 250,000. Other important Black Hills cities and towns include:
*[[Belle Fourche, South Dakota|Belle Fourche]], a ranching town
*[[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]], a mining and tourism town and headquarters for [[Black Hills National Forest]]
*[[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], a historic and well-preserved gambling mecca
*[[Hill City, South Dakota|Hill City]], a timber and tourism town in the center of the Hills, where the [[Black Hills Central Railroad]] operates historic steam trains over the former CB&amp;Q line to Keystone
*[[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]], an old resort town in the southern Hills
*[[Keystone, South Dakota|Keystone]], a tourism town just outside Mount Rushmore 
*[[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]], home of the now-closed [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] (gold) and the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]]
*[[Newcastle, Wyoming|Newcastle]], center of the Black Hills petroleum production and refining
*[[Spearfish, South Dakota|Spearfish]], home of [[Black Hills State University]]
*[[Sturgis, South Dakota|Sturgis]], originally a military town (Fort Meade, now a VA center, is located just to the east).  Now famous for one of the largest motorcycle rallies in the world.

The '''Blue Eye''' ({{lang-sq|Syri i Kaltër}}) is a water spring and [[natural phenomenon]] occurring near [[Mesopotam|Muzinë]] in [[Vlorë County]], southern [[Albania]]. A popular [[tourist attraction]], the clear blue water of the river bubbles forth from a depth of more than fifty-metres. Divers have descended to fifty metres, but it is still unclear what the actual depth of the karst hole is.&lt;ref name="Gloyer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillian Gloyer|title=Albania: The Bradt Travel Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_trOWbGcbkC&amp;pg=PA196|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-246-0|pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California chaparral and woodlands''' is a [[terrestrial ecoregion]] of lower northern, central, and southern [[California]] ([[United States]]) and northwestern [[Baja California]] ([[Mexico]]), located on the west coast of [[North America]]. It is an ecoregion of the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[Biome]], and part of the [[Nearctic]] [[ecozone]].

==Setting==

===Three sub-ecoregions===
The California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion is subdivided into three smaller ecoregions.&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt;

*'''[[California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion]]''': In southern coastal [[California]] and northwestern coastal [[Baja California]], as well as all the [[Channel Islands of California]] and [[Guadalupe Island]].
*'''[[California montane chaparral and woodlands]]''': In southern and central coast adjacent and inland California, covering some of the mountains of: the [[Coast Ranges]]; the [[Transverse Ranges]]; and the western slopes of the northern [[Peninsular Ranges]].
*'''[[California interior chaparral and woodlands]]''': In central interior California surrounding the [[California Central Valley]] cover the foothills and the Transverse Ranges and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].

===Locations===
[[Image:Chaparral1.jpg|right|thumb|[[California montane chaparral and woodlands|Montane chaparral and woodlands]] in the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]], near Santa Barbara, California]]
Most of the population of California and Baja California lives in these ecoregions, which includes the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], and [[Tijuana]].

The [[California Central Valley grasslands]] ecoregion, as well as the coniferous [[Sierra Nevada forests]], [[Northern California coastal forests]], and [[Klamath-Siskiyou forests]] of northern California and southwestern [[Oregon]], share many plant and animal affinities with the California chaparral and woodlands. Many  botanists consider the California chaparral and woodlands, Sierra Nevada forests, Klamath-Siskiyou forests, and Northern California coastal forests as a single [[California Floristic Province]], excluding the deserts of [[eastern California]], which belong to other floristic provinces. Many [[Bioregionalism|Bioregionalists]], including poet [[Gary Snyder]], identify the central and northern Coast Ranges, Klamath-Siskiyou, the Central Valley, and Sierra Nevada as the Shasta Bioregion or the [[Alta California]] [[Bioregion]].

==Flora==
The ecoregion includes a great variety of plant communities, including [[grassland]]s, [[oak savanna]]s and [[woodland]]s, [[chaparral]], and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forest]]s, including southern stands of the tall [[coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens''). The flora of this ecoregion also includes tree species such as [[Pinus sabiniana|Gray or foothill pine]] (''Pinus sabiniana''), [[Quercus dumosa|Scrub oak]] (''Quercus dumosa''), [[Aesculus californica|California buckeye]] (''Aesculus californica''), the rare [[Cupressus goveniana|Gowen cypress]] (''Cupressus goveniana)'', the rare [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] (''Cupressus macrocarpa''), and a wealth of [[endemic]] plant species, including the extremely rare [[Dudleya densiflora|San Gabriel Mountain liveforever]] (''Dudlea densiflora''), [[Cercocarpus traskiae|Catalina mahogany]] (''Cercocarpus traskiae''), and the threatened [[Streptanthus albidus|most beautiful jewel-flower]] (''Streptanthus albidus'' ssp. ''Peramoenus'').&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{cite web|title=California Chaparral &amp; Woodlands |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/california_chaparral_woodlands.cfm |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=2012-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008083831/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/california_chaparral_woodlands.cfm |archivedate=October 8, 2012 }} (material included verbatim under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en CC BY-SA 3.0 license]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesperoyucca whipplei]], colloquially known as Chaparral Yucca, is commonplace throughout the lower elevations of the climate zone.

==Fauna==
Species include the [[Polioptila californica|California gnatcatcher]] (''Polioptila californica''), [[Calypte costae|Costa's hummingbird]] (''Calypte costae''), [[Phrynosoma coronatum|coast horned lizard]] (''Phrynosoma coronatum''), and [[Lichanura trivirgata|rosy boa]] (''Lichanura trivirgata''). Other animals found here are the [[Dipodomys heermanni|Heermann kangaroo rat]] (''Dipodomys heermanni''), [[Dipodomys venustus|Santa Cruz kangaroo rat]] (''Dipodomys venustus''), and the endangered [[Perognathus alticolus|white-eared pocket mouse]] (''Perognathus alticolus'').&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt;

Another notable insect resident of this ecoregion is the [[rain beetle]] (''Plecoma'' sp.) It spends up to several years living underground in a larval stage and emerges only during wet-season rains to mate.

==Fire==
Chaparral, like most Mediterranean shrublands, is highly fire resilient and historically burned with high-severity, stand replacing events every 30 to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keeley|first1=JE|first2=FW|last2=Davis|year=2007|chapter=Chaparral|url=http://www.werc.usgs.gov/fileHandler.ashx?File=/Lists/Products/Attachments/3457/K2007_Chaparral_TVC.pdf|title=Terrestrial Vegetation of California|pages=339–366|editor1-first=MG|editor1-last=Barbour|editor2-first=T|editor2-last=Keeler-Wolf|editor3-first=AA|editor3-last=Schoenherr|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vale|first=TR|year=2002|title=Fire, Native Peoples, and the Natural Landscape|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|pages=269–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though adapted to infrequent fires, chaparral plant communities can be exterminated by frequent fires especially with climate change induced drought.&lt;ref name=Syphard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Syphard|first1=AD|first2=VC|last2=Radeloff|first3=JE|last3=Keeley|first4=TJ|last4=Hawbaker|first5=MK|last5=Clayton|first6=SI|last6=Stewart|first7=RB|last7=Hammer|display-authors=4|year=2007|title=Human influence on California fire regimes|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1388–1402|url=http://www.werc.usgs.gov/OLDsitedata/seki/pdfs/k2007_syphard_human%20influence.pdf|pmid=17708216|doi=10.1890/06-1128.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratt|first1=RB|first2=AL|last2=Jacobsen|first3=AR|last3=Ramirez|first4=AM|last4=Helms|first5=CA|last5=Traugh|first6=MF|last6=Tobin|first7=MS|last7=Heffner|first8=SD|last8=Davis|display-authors=4|year=2014|title=Mortality of resprouting chaparral shrubs after a fire and during a record drought: physiological mechanisms and demographic consequences|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=893–907|doi=10.1111/gcb.12477|pmid=24375846|url=https://www.csub.edu/~ajacobsen/Pratt%20et%20al.%202014%20GCB%20Mortality%20of%20resprouting%20shrubs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, frequent accidental ignitions can convert chaparral from a native shrubland to nonnative annual grassland and drastically reduce species diversity, especially under global-change-type drought.&lt;ref name=Syphard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt/&gt;

==Human influence==
[[File:Gaviota sp2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[California oak woodland]]s, in [[Gaviota State Park]], near Santa Barbara, California]]
The region has been heavily affected by grazing, logging, dams and water diversions, and intensive agriculture and urbanization, as well as competition by numerous introduced or exotic plant and animal species. Some unique plant communities, like southern California's [[Coastal Sage Scrub]], have been nearly eradicated by agriculture and urbanization. As a result, the region now has many rare and endangered species, including the [[California condor]] (''Gymnogyps californianus'').

{{Geological era}}
The '''Cenozoic''' [[Era (geology)|Era]] ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|n|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|ɪ|k|,_|ˌ|s|ɛ|-}}){{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Cenozoic}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Cenozoic}}}} meaning "new life", is the current and most recent of the three [[Phanerozoic]] geological eras, following the [[Mesozoic]] Era and extending from 66 million years ago to the present day.

The Cenozoic is also known as the ''Age of Mammals,'' because the extinction of many groups allowed mammals to greatly diversify so that large [[mammal]]s  dominated it. The continents also moved into their current positions during this era.

Early in the Cenozoic, following the [[K-Pg extinction event]], most of the fauna was relatively small, and included small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the large reptiles that had dominated during the Mesozoic. A group of avians known as the "terror birds" grew larger than the average human and were formidable predators. Mammals came to occupy almost every available niche (both marine and terrestrial), and some also grew very large, attaining sizes not seen in most of today's mammals.

The Earth's climate had begun a drying and cooling trend, culminating in the glaciations of the [[Pleistocene Epoch]], and partially offset by the [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]].

==Nomenclature==
''Cenozoic,'' meaning "new life," is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|καινός}} ''kainós'' "new," and {{lang|grc|ζωή}} ''zōḗ'' "life."&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=Cenozoic|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Cenozoic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era is also known as the ''Cænozoic'', ''Caenozoic'', or ''Cainozoic'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|aɪ|n|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|ɪ|k|,_|ˌ|k|eɪ|-}}).{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|Cainozoic}}}}&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "Cenozoic" (originally: "Kainozoic") was proposed in 1840 by the British geologist [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]] (1800–1874).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=John |title=Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge |volume= vol. 17 |date=1840 |publisher=Charles Knight and Co. |location=London, England |pages=153–154 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hn4zr7;view=1up;seq=163 |chapter=Palæozoic series}}  From pp. 153–154: "As many systems or combinations of organic forms as are clearly traceable in the stratified crust of the globe, so many corresponding terms (as Palæozoic, Mesozoic, Kainozoic, &amp;c.) may be made, … "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilmarth |first1=Mary Grace |title=Bulletin 769:  The Geologic Time Classification of the United States Geological Survey Compared With Other Classifications, accompanied by the original definitions of era, period and epoch terms |date=1925 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A. |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my7x_PBkpm4C&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The evolution of the spelling of "Cenozoic" is reviewed in:

Although John Phillips originally (1840) spelled Cenozoic as "Kainozoic", in 1841 he spelled it as "Cainozoic":
* {{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=John |title=Figures and Descriptions of the Palæozoic Fossils of Cornwall, Devon, and West Somerset; … |date=1841 |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, &amp; Longmans |location=London, England, U.K. |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ciE-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Cenozoic is divided into three periods: the [[Paleogene]], [[Neogene]], and [[Quaternary]]; and seven epochs: the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]], [[Pliocene]], [[Pleistocene]], and [[Holocene]]. The Quaternary Period was officially recognized by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] in June 2009,&lt;ref name=Gibbard&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010 | last1 = Gibbard | first1 = P. L. | last2 = Head | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Walker | first3 = M. J.

Knowledge of this era is more detailed than any other era because of the relatively young, well-preserved rocks associated with it.

===Paleogene Period===
The Paleogene spans from the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, 66 million years ago, to the dawn of the Neogene, 23.03 million years ago. It features three [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]s: the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]].  [[File:Basilosaurus.jpg|thumb|''[[Basilosaurus]]'']]

The [[Paleocene epoch]] lasted from 66 million to 56 million years ago. Modern placental mammals originated during this time. The Paleocene is a transitional point between the devastation that is the [[K-T extinction]], to the rich jungle environment that is the Early Eocene. The Early Paleocene saw the recovery of the earth. The continents began to take their modern shape, but all the continents and the subcontinent of India were separated from each other. [[Afro-Eurasia]] was separated by the [[Tethys Sea]], and the Americas were separated by the strait of Panama, as the isthmus had not yet formed. This epoch featured a general warming trend, with jungles eventually reaching the poles. The oceans were dominated by sharks&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Royal Tyrrell Museum|title=Lamniform sharks: 110 million years of ocean supremacy|date=2012-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4p9EWuVxYQ|accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the large reptiles that had once predominated were extinct. Archaic mammals filled the world such as [[creodonts]] (extinct carnivores, unrelated to existing [[Carnivora]]).

The [[Eocene Epoch]] ranged from 56 million years to 33.9 million years ago. In the Early-Eocene, species living in dense forest were unable to evolve into larger forms, as in the Paleocene. There was nothing over the weight of 10 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/eocene.php|title=Eocene Epoch|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were early primates, whales and horses along with many other early forms of mammals. At the top of the food chains were huge birds, such as [[Paracrax]]. The temperature was 30 degrees Celsius with little temperature gradient from pole to pole. In the Mid-Eocene, the Circumpolar-Antarctic current between Australia and Antarctica formed. This disrupted ocean currents worldwide and as a result caused a global cooling effect, shrinking the jungles. This allowed mammals to grow to mammoth proportions, such as whales which, by that time, had become almost fully aquatic. Mammals like ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' were at the top of the food-chain. The Late Eocene saw the rebirth of seasons, which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas, along with the evolution of [[grass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/eocene.php|title=Eocene Climate|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/paleogene/|title=Eocene|author=National Geographic Society|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Eocene was marked by the [[Eocene-Oligocene extinction event]], the European face of which is known as the [[Grande Coupure]].

The [[Oligocene Epoch]] spans from 33.9 million to 23.03 million years ago. The Oligocene featured the expansion of [[grass]] which had led to many new species to evolve, including the first elephants, cats, dogs, marsupials and many other species still prevalent today. Many other species of plants evolved in this period too. A cooling period featuring seasonal rains was still in effect. Mammals still continued to grow larger and larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/oligocene.php|title=Oligocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miocene.jpg|thumb|Animals of the Miocene (''[[Chalicotherium]]'', ''[[Hyenadon]]'', [[Entelodont]]...). Mammals are the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Cenozoic.]]The Neogene spans from 23.03 million to 2.58 million years ago.  It features 2 epochs: the Miocene, and the Pliocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408872/Neogene-Period|title=Neogene|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miocene epoch]] spans from 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago and is a period in which [[grass]] spread further, dominating a large portion of the world, at the expense of forests. [[Kelp]] forests evolved, encouraging the evolution of new species, such as [[sea otter]]s. During this time, [[perissodactyla]] thrived, and evolved into many different varieties. [[Apes]] evolved into 30 species. The [[Tethys Sea]] finally closed with the creation of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], leaving only remnants as the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Red sea|Red]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. This increased aridity. Many new plants evolved: 95% of modern [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]] evolved in the mid-Miocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/miocene.php|title=Miocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pliocene epoch]] lasted from 5.333 to 2.58 million years ago. The Pliocene featured dramatic climactic changes, which ultimately led to modern species and plants. The Mediterranean Sea dried up for several million years (because the [[ice age]]s reduced sea levels, disconnecting the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] from the Mediterranean, and evaporation rates exceeded inflow from rivers). ''[[Australopithecus]]'' evolved in [[Africa]], beginning the human branch. The [[isthmus of Panama]] formed, and animals migrated between [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], wreaking havoc on local ecologies. Climatic changes brought: [[savanna]]s that are still continuing to spread across the world; Indian [[monsoon]]s; [[desert]]s in central [[Asia]]; and the beginnings of the [[Sahara]] desert. The world map has not changed much since, save for changes brought about by the [[glaciations]] of the Quaternary, such as the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]], and the [[Baltic sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/pliocene.php|title=Pliocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/pliocene.html|title=Pliocene climate|author=Jonathan Adams|work=Oak Ridge National Library|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225011508/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/pliocene.html|archivedate=25 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quaternary===
The Quaternary spans from 2.58 million years ago to present day, and is the shortest geological period in the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. It features modern animals, and dramatic changes in the climate. It is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene and the Holocene.

[[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Antón.jpg|thumb|Megafauna of Pleistocene Europe ([[mammoth]]s, [[Panthera spelaea|cave lions]], [[woolly rhino]], [[reindeer]], [[Wild horse|horses]])]]
The Pleistocene lasted from 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago. This epoch was marked by ice ages as a result of the cooling trend that started in the Mid-Eocene. There were at least four separate glaciation periods marked by the advance of ice caps as far south as 40° N in mountainous areas. Meanwhile, Africa experienced a trend of desiccation which resulted in the creation of the Sahara, Namib, and Kalahari deserts. Many animals evolved including [[mammoth]]s, [[giant ground sloths]], [[dire wolves]], saber-toothed cats, and most famously ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. 100,000 years ago marked the end of one of the worst droughts in Africa, and led to the expansion of primitive humans. As the Pleistocene drew to a close, a major extinction wiped out much of the world's megafauna, including some of the hominid species, such as Neanderthals. All the continents were affected, but Africa to a lesser extent. It still retains many large animals, such as hippos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/pleistocene.php|title=Pleistocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocene began 11,700 years ago and lasts to the present day. All recorded history and "the [[history of the world]]" lies within the boundaries of the Holocene epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/holocene.php|title=Holocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activity is blamed for a mass extinction that began roughly 10,000 years ago, though the species becoming extinct have only been recorded since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This is sometimes referred to as the "[[Sixth Extinction]]". It is often cited that over 322 recorded species have become extinct due to human activity since the Industrial Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-the-sixth-mass-extinction-can-be-stopped/|title=Sixth Extinction extinctions|author=Scientific American|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/?4143/Extinction-crisis-continues-apace|title=Sixth Extinction|author=IUCN|work=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rate may be as high as 500 veterbrate species alone, the majority of which have occurred after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/5/e1400253.full/|title=Accelerated modern human–induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction|author=Ceballos et al. (2015)|work=Science Advances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal life==
Early in the Cenozoic, following the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event|K-Pg event]], the planet was dominated by relatively small fauna, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the dinosaurs that had dominated during the Mesozoic. Some flightless birds grew larger than humans. These species are sometimes referred to as "[[terror bird]]s," and were formidable predators. Mammals came to occupy almost every available [[ecological niche|niche]] (both marine and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]]), and some also grew very large, attaining sizes not seen in most of today's terrestrial mammals.

Early animals were the [[Entelodon]] (a so-called "hell pig"), [[Paraceratherium]] (a hornless rhinoceros relative) and [[Basilosaurus]] (an early whale). The extinction of many large [[diapsid]] groups, such as flightless [[dinosaurs]], [[Plesiosauria]] and [[Pterosauria]] allowed mammals and birds to greatly diversify and become the world's predominant fauna.

==Tectonics==
[[Geology|Geologically]], the Cenozoic is the era when the [[continent]]s moved into their current positions. [[Australia (continent)|Australia-New Guinea]], having split from [[Pangea]] during the early [[Cretaceous]], drifted north and, eventually, collided with [[South-east Asia]]; [[Antarctica]] moved into its current position over the [[South Pole]]; the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened and, later in the era (2.8 million years ago), [[South America]] became attached to [[North America]] with the [[isthmus of Panama]].

India collided with Asia {{Ma|55|45}} creating the Himalayas; Arabia collided with Eurasia, closing the [[Tethys Ocean]] and creating the Zagros Mountains, around {{Ma|35}}.&lt;ref name=Allen2008&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = M. B.| first2 = H. A. | title = Arabia-Eurasia collision and the forcing of mid Cenozoic global cooling| last2 = Armstrong  | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018208002642 | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 265 | issue = 1–2| pages = 52–58 | year = 2008| last1 = Allen | doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.04.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break-up of Gondwana in [[Late Cretaceous]] and Cenozoic times led to a shift in the river courses of various large African rivers including the [[Congo River|Congo]], [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Nile]], [[Orange River|Orange]], [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goudie |first1=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |date=2005 |title=The drainage of Africa since the Cretaceous |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67 |issue= 3–4|pages=437–456 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2004.11.008|bibcode=2005Geomo..67..437G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] at about {{Ma|55.5}} was a significant global warming event; however, since the [[Azolla event]] of {{Ma|49}}, the Cenozoic Era has been a period of long-term cooling. After the tectonic creation of [[Drake Passage]] at {{Ma|41}}, when South America fully detached from Antarctica during the [[Oligocene]], the climate cooled significantly due to the advent of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] which brought cool deep Antarctic water to the surface. The cooling trend continued in the [[Miocene]], with relatively short warmer periods. When South America became attached to North America creating the [[Isthmus of Panama]] around {{Ma|2.8}}, the Arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]] and [[Gulf Stream]] currents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508|title=How the Isthmus of Panama Put Ice in the Arctic|work=Oceanus Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually leading to the glaciations of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary ice age]], the current [[interglacial]] of which is the [[Holocene]] Epoch.
Recent analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency, oxygen isotope record, and tectonic plate subduction rate, which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary, climate and plate tectonic activity, shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years' timescale in the Cenozoic Era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of ∼13 Myr during most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J. | last2 = Kravchinsky | first2 = V.A. | last3 = Liu | first3 = X. | year = 2015 | title = The 13 million year Cenozoic pulse of the Earth | url = | journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume = 431 | issue = | pages = 256–263 | doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2015.09.033 | bibcode=2015E&amp;PSL.431..256C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
During the Cenozoic, [[Mammal evolution#Expansion of ecological niches in the Mesozoic|mammals proliferated]] from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[Marine mammal|marine]], and [[bat|flying]] animals, giving this period its other name, the Age of Mammals, despite the fact that there are more than twice as many [[bird]] species as mammal species.  The Cenozoic is just as much the age of [[savanna]]s, the age of co-dependent [[flowering plant]]s and [[insect]]s, and the age of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cenozoic/cenozoic.php|title=The Cenozoic Era|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grass]] also played a very important role in this era, shaping the evolution of the birds and mammals that fed on it.  One group that diversified significantly in the Cenozoic as well were the [[snake]]s. Evolving in the Cenozoic, the variety of snakes increased tremendously, resulting in many [[colubrids]], following the evolution of their current primary prey source, the [[rodent]]s.

In the earlier part of the Cenozoic, the world was dominated by the [[Gastornithidae|gastornithid]] birds, terrestrial [[Crocodilia|crocodile]]s like ''[[Pristichampsus]]'', and a handful of primitive large mammal groups like [[uintathere]]s, [[mesonychid]]s, and [[pantodont]]s. But as the forests began to recede and the climate began to cool, other mammals took over.

The Cenozoic is full of mammals both strange and familiar, including [[chalicothere]]s, [[creodont]]s, [[whale]]s, [[primate]]s, [[entelodont]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s, [[mastodon]]s and [[mammoth]]s, [[three-toed horse]]s, giant [[rhinoceros]] like ''[[Indricotherium]]'', the rhinoceros-like [[brontothere]]s, various bizarre groups of mammals from South America, such as the vaguely elephant-like [[pyrotheria|pyrothere]]s and the dog-like marsupial relatives called [[borhyaenidae|borhyaenids]] and the [[monotreme]]s and marsupials of Australia.

'''Chapman State Park''' is a {{convert|805|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Pleasant Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania|Pleasant Township]], [[Warren County, Pennsylvania]] near [[Clarendon, Pennsylvania|Clarendon]], in the United States.  The man-made [[Chapman Lake (Pennsylvania)|Chapman Lake]] covers {{convert|68|acre}} of the park.  Chapman State Park is named in honor of Dr. Leroy E. Chapman. Dr. Chapman was a [[Pennsylvania State Senate|state senator]] from 1929 until 1963. He was part of several civic groups that pushed for the creation of a state park in Warren County. Chapman State Park, opened in 1951, is adjacent to [[Allegheny National Forest]] and State Game Land 29 just off [[U.S. Route 6 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 6]].

==Recreation==
Chapman State Park is open for year-round recreation. Chapman Lake is open for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[boating]], and [[fishing]]. A large [[picnic]] area is near the beach and overlooks the lake.  Five pavilions are available by reservation or first-come, first-served. A rustic, wooded campground is open spring through fall. Twelve miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) of trails are open to [[hiking]]. Chapman State Park is also open to [[hunting]] and fishing in the streams as well as the lake. The park stays open in the winter for [[cross-country skiing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]] and [[ice fishing]].&lt;ref name="csp"&gt;{{cite web

The sand beach on Chapman Lake is open from 8:00 am until sunset. Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |title=Pa. state parks going without life guards at beaches in 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=[[Times Leader]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007235840/http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |archivedate=2008-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The beach opens for the summer on [[Memorial Day]] and closes [[Labor Day]] weekend. A concession is open in the beach area offering snacks, beverages, and ice cream treats.&lt;ref name="csp"/&gt;

Gas powered boats are prohibited on Chapman Lake. Electric powered and non powered boats must have a current registration with any state or a launch permit from the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]. A concession is open on the shores of the lake for renting [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s and paddle boats.&lt;ref name="csp"/&gt;

Chapman lake provides a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for warm water and cold water fish. Fishermen may catch [[brook trout|brook]] and [[brown trout]], [[bluegill]], [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]], [[yellow perch]], [[largemouth bass]], and [[Catostomidae|sucker]]. [[West Branch Tionesta Creek]] and [[Farnsworth Run]] have trout in the park and in the surrounding [[Allegheny National Forest]].&lt;ref name="csp"/&gt;

Visitors to Chapman State Park have several choices for over accommodations. The rustic campground in a wooded area has 83 campsites, with two shower houses and water hydrants.  Many campsites offer 30 Amp or 50 Amp electric service.  Approximately half the sites are pet friendly. Three [[cottage]]s are available to rent. The cottages sleep up to five people in single and double bunks. Each cottage has wooden floors, a porch, electric heat, lights, and outlets. The cottages also have a picnic table and fire ring in the yard area. In addition to the more traditional cottages two [[Mongolia]]n style [[yurt]]s are available to rent. These round structures are mounted on a wooden platform and have a cooking stove, refrigerator, tables, chairs, countertop, electric lights, heat and outlets. Picnic tables and fire rings are in the yard area.&lt;ref name="csp"/&gt;

Chapman State Park is a trailhead for an extensive network of trails in the {{convert|517000|acre}} Allegheny National Forest. All backpackers are asked to register at the park office and leave word about where they plan to hike and when they plan to return. Hikers are also encouraged to take a map and compass.&lt;ref name="csp"/&gt;

Over {{convert|400|acre}} of Chapman State Park are open to hunting. Hunters may park at the park to gain access to the surrounding state game lands and Allegheny National Forest. Common game species are [[white-tailed deer]], [[American black bear]], [[wild turkey]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], and [[ruffed grouse]]. All hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]].&lt;ref name="csp"/&gt;

[[File:SunArcs2011Oregon.png|thumb|right|A circumhorizontal arc (bottom) in relation to a [[circumscribed halo]] (top), Oregon. Photo taken by Shayla Doering]]

A '''circumhorizontal arc''' is an [[optical phenomenon]] that belongs to the family of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|ice halos]] formed by the refraction of sun- or moonlight in plate-shaped [[ice crystal]]s suspended in the atmosphere, typically in [[cirrus clouds|cirrus]] or [[cirrostratus]] clouds. In its full form, the arc has the appearance of a large, brightly spectrum-coloured band (red being the topmost colour) running parallel to the horizon, located far below the Sun or Moon. The distance between the arc and the Sun or Moon is twice as far as the common [[22° halo|22-degree halo]]. Often, when the halo-forming cloud is small or patchy, only fragments of the arc are seen. As with all halos, it can be caused by the Sun as well as (but much more rarely) the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz643.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other currently accepted names for the circumhorizontal arc are '''circumhorizon arc''' or '''lower symmetric 46° plate arc'''.&lt;ref&gt;Tape, Walter and Moilanen, Jarmo - 'Atmospheric Halos &amp; the search for angle x', American geophysical Union,2006 - pp196-7&lt;/ref&gt; The misleading term "'''fire rainbow'''" is sometimes used to describe this phenomenon, although it is neither a [[rainbow]], nor related in any way to fire. The term, apparently coined in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/cha2.htm|title=Circumhorizon arc|author=Les Cowley|publisher=atoptics.co.uk|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; may originate in the occasional appearance of the arc as "flames" in the sky, when it occurs in fragmentary cirrus clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/events/department-news/618/fire-rainbows/|title=Fire Rainbows|date=August 29, 2009|publisher=UC Santa Barbara Department of Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

The halo is formed by sunlight entering horizontally-oriented, flat, [[hexagon]]al ice crystals through a vertical side face and leaving through the near horizontal bottom face (plate thickness does not affect the formation of the halo). In principle, [[Parry arc|Parry oriented]] column crystals may also produce the arc, although this is rare. The 90° inclination between the ray entrance and exit faces produce the well-separated spectral colours. The arc has a considerable angular extent and thus, rarely is complete. When only fragments of a cirrus cloud are in the appropriate sky and sun position, they may appear to shine with spectral colours.&lt;ref name="atoptics-circumhor"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/cha2.htm |title = Circumhorizon arc |author = Les Cowley |publisher = Atmospheric Optics |accessdate = 2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency==

How often a circumhorizontal arc is seen, depends on the location and the latitude of the observer. In the United States it is a relatively common halo, seen several times each summer in any one place. In contrast, it is a rare phenomenon in northern Europe for several reasons. Apart from the presence of ice-containing clouds in the right position in the sky, the halo requires that the light source (Sun or Moon) be very high in the sky, at an elevation of 58° or greater. This means that the solar variety of the halo is impossible to see at locations north of 55°N or south of 55°S. A lunar circumhorizon arc might be visible at other latitudes, but is much rarer since it requires a nearly full Moon to produce enough light. At other latitudes the solar circumhorizontal arc is visible, for a greater or lesser time, around the summer solstice. Slots of visibility for different latitudes and locations may be looked up [http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/chafreq.htm here]. For example, in London, England the sun is only high enough for 140 hours between mid-May and late July, whereas Los Angeles has the sun higher than 58 degrees for 670 hours between late March and late September.

==Artificial circumhorizontal arcs==

A water glass experiment (known about since at least 1920) may be modified slightly to create an artificial circumhorizontal arc. Illuminating under a very steep angle from below the side face of a nearly completely water-filled cylindrical glass will refract the light into the water. The glass should be situated at the edge of a table. The second refraction at the top water-air interface will then project a hyperbola at a vertical wall behind it. The overall refraction is then equivalent to the refraction through an upright hexagonal plate crystal when the rotational averaging is taken into account. A colorful artificial circumhorizontal arc will then appear projected on the wall. Using a spherical projection screen instead will result in a closer analogy to the natural halo counterpart.&lt;ref name="artificial-circumhor"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.4984802 |title = Artificial circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs |author = Markus Selmke and Sarah Selmke |publisher = American Journal of Physics, Vol. 85, Issue 8, p.575-581 |accessdate = 2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|artificial halos]] can be created by similar means.

==Similar optical phenomena==

Circumhorizontal arcs, especially when only fragments can be seen, are sometimes confused with [[cloud iridescence]]. This phenomenon also causes clouds to appear multi-coloured, but it originates from [[diffraction]] (typically by liquid water droplets or ice crystals) rather than [[refraction]]. The two phenomena can be distinguished by several features. Firstly, a circumhorizon arc always has a fixed location in the sky in relation to the Sun or Moon (namely below it at an angle of 46°), while iridescence can occur in different positions (often directly around the Sun or Moon). Secondly, the colour bands in a circumhorizon arc always run horizontally with the red on top, while in iridescence they are much more random in sequence and shape, which roughly follows the contours of the cloud that causes it. Finally, the colours of a circumhorizon arc are pure and spectral (more so than in a rainbow), while the colours in cloud iridescence have a more washed-out, "mother of pearl" appearance.

Confusion with other members of the halo family, such as [[sun dogs]] or the [[circumzenithal arc]], may also arise, but these are easily dismissed by their entirely different positions in relation to the Sun or Moon. More difficult is the distinction between the circumhorizontal arc and the [[infralateral arc]], both of which almost entirely overlap when the Sun or Moon is at a high elevation. The difference is that the circumhorizontal arc always runs parallel to the horizon (although pictures typically show it as a curved line due to [[perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]]), whereas the infralateral arc curves upward at its ends.&lt;ref name="atoptics-circumhor" /&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''climax community''', or '''climatic climax community''', is a historic term for a biological [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]] which, through the process of [[ecological succession]]  in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a [[steady state]]. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a "steady state" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.

The idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term "climax" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, Henry Chandler. 1899. The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan. Botanical Gazette 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederic Clements' use of "climax"== 
Clements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1916. Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation. Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a "[[superorganism]]" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the "polyclimax"—multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable, because by definition climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.

Though the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community—of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions—as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there, when those conditions occur. But much of Clements's work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence. His method of dealing with ecological complexity was to define an ideal form of vegetation—the climax community—and describe other forms of vegetation as deviations from that ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Christopher. 2007. Method and Metaphysics in Clements’s and Gleason’s Ecological Explanations. Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38(1): 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing usage of "climax"==
Despite the overall abandonment of climax theory, during the 1990s use of climax concepts again became more popular among some [[theoretical ecologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Roughgarden, Jonathan, Robert M. May and Simon A. Levin, editors. 1989. Perspectives in Ecological Theory. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors and nature-enthusiasts continue to use the term "climax" in a diluted form to refer to what might otherwise be called mature or [[old growth|old-growth]] communities. The term "climax" has also been adopted as description for a late successional stage for marine macroinvertebrate communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg R., S. Agrenius, B. Hellman, H. C. Nilsson, and K. Norling. 2002. Recovery of marine benthic habitats and fauna in a Swedish fjord following improved oxygen conditions. Marine Ecology Progress Series 234: 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some contemporary ecologists still use the term "disclimax" to describe an [[ecosystem]] dominated by [[invasive species]] that competitively prevent the re-introduction of once native species. This concept borrows from Clement's earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term disclimax was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, it is one of the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1936. Nature and Structure of the Climax. Journal of Ecology. Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 252-284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. 1984. Prairie and plains disclimax and disappearing butterflies, in the central United States. Atala. Vol. 10-12, pp. 20-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coastal-Marine Automated Network''' ('''C-MAN''') is a [[meteorological]] observation network along the coastal United States.  Consisting of about sixty stations installed on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms, the stations record [[atmospheric pressure]], [[wind]] [[wind direction|direction]], [[wind speed|speed]] and gust, and air [[temperature]]; however, some C-MAN stations are designed to also measure [[sea surface temperature]], water level, [[Ocean surface wave|waves]], [[relative humidity]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and [[visibility]].  

The network is maintained by the [[National Data Buoy Center]] (NDBC) of the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), which is part of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), and data is ingested into [[numerical weather prediction]] computer models.  It was created in the early 1980s to maintain observations that were about to be discontinued by other programs.  Data is processed and transmitted similarly to the moored [[weather buoy|buoy]] system.

In 2002, C-MAN was added to the [[NOAA Observing System Architecture]] (NOSA).

A '''crevasse''' is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an [[ice sheet]] or [[glacier]], as opposed to a [[Fracture (geology)|crevice]] that forms in rock. Crevasses form as a result of the movement and resulting stress associated with the [[shear stress]] generated when two semi-rigid pieces above a plastic substrate have different rates of movement. The resulting intensity of the shear stress causes a breakage along the faces.

==Description==
Crevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create [[serac]]s, [[arch]]es, and other ice formations.&lt;ref name="Crevasses on Glacier"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Crevasses on Glaciers | author=van der Veen, C | journal=[[Polar Geography]] | year=1990 | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=213–245 | doi=10.1080/10889379909377677}}&lt;/ref&gt; These walls sometimes expose layers that represent the glacier's [[stratigraphy]]. Crevasse size often depends upon the amount of liquid water present in the glacier. A crevasse may be as deep as 100 metres, as wide as 20 metres, and up to several hundred metres long.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A crevasse may be covered, but not necessarily filled, by a [[snow bridge]] made of the previous years' accumulation and snow drifts. The result is that crevasses are rendered invisible, and thus potentially lethal to anyone attempting to navigate their way across a glacier.  Occasionally a snow bridge over an old crevasse may begin to sag, providing some landscape relief, but this cannot be relied upon. Anyone planning to travel on a glacier should be trained in [[crevasse rescue]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The presence of water in a crevasse can significantly increase its penetration. Water-filled crevasses may reach the bottom of glaciers or [[ice sheets]] and provide a direct hydrologic connection between the surface, where significant summer melting occurs, and the bed of the glacier, where additional water may moisten and lubricate the bed and accelerate ice flow.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Types of crevasses===

*Longitudinal crevasses form parallel to flow where the glacier width is expanding. They develop in areas of [[tensile stress]], such as where a valley widens or bends. They are typically concave down and form an angle greater than 45° with the margin.&lt;ref name="transverse crevasses" /&gt;
*Splashing crevasses result from shear stress from the margin of the glacier and longitudinal compressing stress from lateral extension. They extend from the glacier's margin and are concave up with respect to glacier flow, making an angle less than 45° with the margin. At the centre line of the glacier, there is zero pure shear from the margins, so this area is typically crevasse-free.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*Transverse crevasses are the most common crevasse type. They form in a zone of longitudinal extension where the principal stresses are parallel to the direction of glacier flow, creating extensional tensile stress. These crevasses stretch across the glacier transverse to the flow direction, or cross-glacier.  They generally form where a valley becomes steeper.&lt;ref name="transverse crevasses"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Primary Transverse Crevasses | author=Holdsworth, G | journal=Journal of Glaciology |date=October 1956 | volume=8 | issue=52 | pages=107–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], a '''joint friendship proclamation''' was created between the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|State of Slovakia]] against any further [[Hungary in World War II|Hungarian expansion]]. [[Ion Antonescu]], the [[Mareșal (Romania)|Marshal]] of Romania, engaged in some intra-[[Axis powers|Axis]] diplomacy and created the alliance in May 1942. The union was similar to the interbellic [[Little Entente]].

Later in the war, Slovak troops and Croatian naval and air units operated amicably from Romanian soil. In June, the Hungarians responded with a particularly blatant cross-border raid at [[Turda]], near Kolozsvár (today [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]); one of ten clashes that month. Matters had gone too far for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], who brought pressure to bear on Antonescu and [[Miklós Horthy]] to gain their public recognition that the [[Second Vienna Award]] was irrevocable. On 1 August 1942, Antonescu fudged the issue by announcing he would make no territorial claims until after the war, but in private, he never ceased to press Hitler for the return of [[Northern Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Third Axis Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941-1945, by Mark Axworthy, Cornel Scafeş and Cristian Crăciunoiu, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model''', referred to as the '''DICE model''' or '''Dice model''', is a computer-based [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment model]] developed by 2018 Nobel Laureate [[William Nordhaus]] that “integrates in an end-to-end fashion the economics, carbon cycle, climate science, and impacts in a highly aggregated model that allows a weighing of the costs and benefits of taking steps to slow greenhouse warming." Nordhaus also developed the RICE model ('''Regional Integrated Climate-Economy model'''), a variant of the DICE model that was updated and developed alongside the DICE model.&lt;ref name=epa-summary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eerm.nsf/vwan/ee-0564-114.pdf/$file/ee-0564-114.pdf|title = Summary of the DICE model|last = Newbold|first = Stephen|date = November 2010|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dice-till-2006&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/williamdnordhaus/dice-rice|title = DICE/RICE models - William Nordhaus - Yale Economics|date = October 2017|accessdate = October 11, 2018|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roll-dice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/web%20rice%20summary%20102599.htm|title = Summary of ''Roll the DICE Again: The Economics of Global Warming''|last = Nordhaus|first = William|last2 = Boyer|first2 = Joseph|date = October 1999|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epa-record/&gt; Researchers who collaborated with Nordhaus to develop the model include David Popp, Zili Yang, and Joseph Boyer.&lt;ref name=dice-till-2006/&gt;

The DICE model is one of the three main [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment models]] used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and it provides estimates intermediate between the other two models.&lt;ref name=epa-record&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=240426|title = Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy model (DICE)|publisher = [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[United States]]|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===

According to a summary of the DICE and RICE models prepared by Stephen Newbold,&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt; the earliest precursor to DICE was a [[linear programming]] model of energy supply and demand in two 1977 papers of William Nordhaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m26/m26-08.pdf|title = Strategies for the control of carbon dioxide (Cowles Foundation discussion paper no. 443|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|year =  1977|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/carbondixoideproblem.pdf|title = Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem|last = Nordhaus|first = Wiliam|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = February 1977|accessdate = February 19, 2014|pages = 341–346|publisher = [[American Economic Review]]|volume = 67|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dynamic (in that it considered the changing levels of supply of fuel based on supply and demand and the consequence impact on carbon dioxide emissions) the model did not attempt to measure the economic ''impact'' of climate change.&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt; A 1991 paper by Nordhaus developed a steady-state model of both the economy and climate, coming quite close to the DICE model.&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2233864?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103423736481|title = To Slow or Not to Slow: The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect.|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|accessdate = February 19, 2014|journal = [[The Economic Journal]]|volume = 101|number = 407|date = July 1991|doi=10.2307/2233864|pages=920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The model===

The model appears to have first been proposed by economist [[William Nordhaus]] in a discussion paper for the [[Cowles Foundation]] in February 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d10a/d1009.pdf|title = The "Dice" Model: Background and Structure of a Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model of the Economics of Global Warming (Cowles Foundation discussion paper no. 1009)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = February 1992|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a brief note outlining the main ideas in an article for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/%7Enordhaus/homepage/Optimal.science.1192.pdf|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume = 258|date = November 20, 1992|accessdate = February 19, 2014|doi=10.1126/science.258.5086.1315|pages=1315–1319}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent revised model was published in ''[[Resource and Energy Economics]]'' in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_II.html|title = Original DICE and RICE models|accessdate = February 19, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Rolling the 'DICE': An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|volume = 15|year = 1993|journal = [[Resource and Energy Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordhaus published an improved version of the model in the October 1994 book ''Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = October 4, 1994|publisher = [[MIT Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first chapter as well as an appendix containing a computer program both freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/manageapp.htm|title = Appendix.

In 1996, Nordhaus and Zili Yang published an article titled ''A regional dynamic general-equilibrium model of alternative climate-change strategies'' at [[The American Economic Review]], established the RICE (Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) model.&lt;ref&gt;WD Nordhaus, Z Yang - A regional dynamic general-equilibrium model of alternative climate-change strategies The American Economic Review, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1998, Nordhaus published a revised version of the DICE model in multiple papers, one of which was coauthored with Joseph Boyer in order to understand the effects of the proposed [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_III.html|title = III. Research Papers Using revised DICE and RICE Models|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/Kyoto.pdf|title = Requiem for Kyoto: An Economic Analysis of the Kyoto Protocol|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|last2 = Boyer|first2 = Joseph|authorlink2 = Joseph Boyer|date = February 8, 1999|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Nordhaus published computer programs and spreadsheets implementing a revised version of the DICE model as well as a variant called the RICE model (RICE stands for ''Regional Integrated Climate-Economics'', signifying that the modeling of economics and climate are being done only for a particular region rather than the whole world).&lt;ref name=section-iv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_IV.html|title = GAMS Computer Programs for RICE-99|last = Nordhaus|first = William|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=section-v&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_V.html|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|title = Spreadsheet Versions of DICE-99 and RICE-99 models|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Nordhaus and Boyer co-authored a book published by [[MIT Press]] titled ''Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming'' with a detailed description of the updated DICE and RICE models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/web%20table%20of%20contents%20102599.htm|title = Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming (hardcover)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|last2 = Boyer|first2 = Joseph|date = August 21, 2000|accessdate = February 19, 2014|publisher = [[MIT Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Nordhaus published revised spreadsheets for the RICE model.&lt;ref name=section-vi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_vi.html|title = Spreadsheet Version of RICE-2001 Model Used for Science Article|accessdate = February 19, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Nordhaus published a new version of the DICE model with updated data, and used it to review the [[Stern Review]].&lt;ref name=dice-till-2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/D_111606_alt_base.GMS|title = DICE model recalibrated to data for November 2006|date = November 16, 2006|accessdate = February 19, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/DICE_documentation_111706.pdf|title = Documentation for DICE-2006, November 2006 round|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = November 17, 2006|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, updated RICE and DICE models were published, and the new RICE model was explained by Nordhaus in an article for the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/Nordhaus_Copenhagen_2010_text.pdf|title = Economic aspects of global warming in a post-Copenhagen environment|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = May 10, 2010|accessdate = February 19, 2014|doi=10.1073/pnas.1005985107 |journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|volume=107|pages=11721–11726|pmid=20547856|pmc=2900661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/RICEmodels.htm|title = RICE-2010 and DICE-2010 Models (as of March 20, 2012)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|date = March 20, 2012|accessdate = February 19, 2014|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the book ''The Climate Casino'' by Nordhaus, with updated discussion of the DICE and RICE models and the broader policy implications, was published by [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = October 22, 2013|publisher = [[Yale University Press]]|isbn = 978-0300189773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A background on the latest version of the models as used in the book was published on Nordhaus' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/ClimateCasino.htm|title = Background on the DICE Models For Readers of ''The Climate Casino'' (2013)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/DICE-science.htm|title = Scientific and Economic Background on DICE-2013R Model as of January 22, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|date = January 22, 2014|accessdate = February 19, 2014|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic reception===

A number of variants of the DICE model have been published by researchers working separately from Nordhaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2270473|title = A 4-Stated Dice: Quantitatively Addressing Uncertainty Effects in Climate Chan|last = Traeger|first = Christian|date = December 1, 2013|accessdate = February 19, 2014|publisher = [[Social Science Research Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Popp |first=David |title=Entice: Endogenous Technological Change In The DICE Model Of Global Warming |journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management |year=2004 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=742–768 |doi=10.1016/j.jeem.2003.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DICE model is also included in advanced university coursework related to environmental and energy economics and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://are.berkeley.edu/~traeger/Lectures/ClimateChangeEconomics/Slides/6%20Integrated%20Assessment%20-%201%20Integrated%20Assessment%20of%20Climate%20Change%20and%20DICE.pdf|title = The Economics of Climate Change -C175|last = Traeger|first = Christian|publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception in the public policy world===

The DICE and RICE models have received considerable attention from others studying the economic impact of climate change. it is one of the models used by the Environmental Protection Agency for estimating the [[social cost of carbon]].&lt;ref name=epa-record/&gt;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; Stephen Newbold of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] in the [[United States]] reviewed the models in 2010.&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt;

The [[Basque Centre for Climate Change]], in an October 2009 review of [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment models]] for climate change, discussed the DICE model in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc3research.org/working_papers/downpubli_6.html|title = Integrated Impact Assessment Models of Climate Change with an Emphasis on Damage Functions: a Literature Review|author = Ramon Arigoni Ortiz|author2 = Anil Markandya|date = October 2009|accessdate = February 19, 2014|publisher = [[Basque Centre for Climate Change]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the [[Heritage Foundation]], a [[conservatism (politics)|conservative]] [[think tank]] in the [[United States]], called the DICE model "flawed beyond use for policymaking" on account of its extreme sensitivity to initial assumptions.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/11/loaded-dice-an-epa-model-not-ready-for-the-big-game|title = Loaded DICE: An EPA Model Not Ready for the Big Game|last = Dayaratna|first = Kevin|last2 = Kreutzer|first2 = David|date = November 21, 2013|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticisms, including criticisms of the specific choice of discount rates chosen in the model, have been made by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realclimateeconomics.org/briefs/Stanton_Towards_Greater_Transparency.pdf |title=Towards Greater Transparency in Climate Economics: Deconstructing DICE-2007 (a brief prepared for Economics for Equity and the Environment Network) |last=Stanton |first=Elizabeth |date=April 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723012842/http://realclimateeconomics.org/briefs/Stanton_Towards_Greater_Transparency.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/EconomicModels.htm|title = Criticism of economic models|publisher = Lomborg-errors.dk|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''double layer''' ('''DL''', also called an '''electrical double layer''', '''EDL''') is a structure that appears on the surface of an object when it is exposed to a fluid. The object might be a solid particle, a gas bubble, a liquid [[droplet]], or a [[porous media|porous body]]. The DL refers to two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object. The first layer, the [[surface charge]] (either positive or negative), consists of ions [[adsorbed]] onto the object due to chemical interactions.   The second layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the [[Coulomb force]], electrically [[Electric-field screening|screening]] the first layer. This second layer is loosely associated with the object. It is made of free ions that move in the fluid under the influence of [[Electromagnetism|electric attraction]] and [[thermal motion]] rather than being firmly anchored.  It is thus called the "diffuse layer".

[[Interface (chemistry)|Interfacial]] DLs are most apparent in systems with a large surface area to volume ratio, such as a [[colloid]] or porous bodies with particles or pores (respectively) on the scale of micrometres to nanometres. However, DLs are important to other phenomena, such as the [[electrochemical]] behaviour of [[electrode]]s.

DLs play a fundamental role in many everyday substances. For instance, homogenized milk exists only because fat droplets are covered with a DL that prevents their [[coagulation (milk)|coagulation]] into butter. DLs exist in practically all [[heterogeneous]] fluid-based systems, such as blood, paint, ink and ceramic and cement [[slurry]].

The DL is closely related to [[electrokinetic phenomena]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

== Development of the (interfacial) double layer ==

=== Helmholtz ===
[[File:EDLC-Potentialdistribution.png|thumb|right|200px|Simplified illustration of the potential development in the area and in the further course of a Helmholtz double layer.]]
When an ''electronic'' conductor is brought in contact with a solid or liquid ''ionic'' conductor (electrolyte), a common boundary ([[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]) among the two [[Phase (matter)|phases]] appears. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=H.|periodical=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|title=Ueber einige Gesetze der Vertheilung elektrischer Ströme in körperlichen Leitern mit Anwendung auf die thierisch-elektrischen Versuche |volume=165|issue=6|year=1853|pages=211–233|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650603|last1=Helmholtz|bibcode=1853AnP...165..211H}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to realize that [[Electric charge|charged]] electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions repel the co-ions of the charge while attracting counterions to their surfaces. Two layers of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] form at the interface between electrode and electrolyte.
In 1853 he showed that an electrical double layer (DL) is essentially a [[molecule|molecular]] dielectric and stores charge electrostatically.&lt;ref name="EDL"&gt;{{cite web | title = The electrical double layer | year = 2011 | url = http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110531014449/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | archivedate = 31 May 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the electrolyte's decomposition voltage, the stored charge is linearly dependent on the voltage applied.

This early model predicted a constant [[differential capacitance]] independent from the charge density depending on the [[dielectric constant]] of the electrolyte [[solvent]] and the thickness of the double-layer.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite web |author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A survey of electrochemical supercapacitor technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |accessdate= 2012-12-10 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141222044332/http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |archivedate= 2014-12-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;Srinivasan S. (2006) Fuel cells, from Fundamentals to Applications, Springer eBooks, {{ISBN|978-0-387-35402-6}}, [https://www.springer.com/chemistry/electrochemistry/book/978-0-387-25116-5 Chapter 2, Electrode/electrolyte interfaces: Structure and kinetics of charge transfer.] (769&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9780387251165-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-351700-p52496949 Electrochemical double-layer capacitors using carbon nanotube electrode structures.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This model, with a good foundation for the description of the interface, does not consider important factors including diffusion/mixing of ions in solution, the possibility of [[adsorption]] onto the surface and the interaction between solvent [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moments]] and the electrode.

=== Gouy-Chapman ===
[[Louis Georges Gouy]] in 1910 and [[David Chapman (scientist)|David Leonard Chapman]] in 1913 both observed that capacitance was not a constant and that it depended on the applied potential and the ionic concentration. The "Gouy-Chapman model" made significant improvements by introducing a [[Diffusion|diffuse]] model of the DL. In this model the charge distribution of ions as a function of distance from the metal surface allows [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] to be applied. Thus the [[electric potential]] [[Exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] away from the surface of the fluid bulk.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Ehrenstein  | first = Gerald  | title = Surface charge  | year = 2001  | url = http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | accessdate = 30 May 2011  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073500/http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | archive-date = 2011-09-28  | dead-url = yes  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stern ===
The Gouy-Chapman model fails for highly charged DLs. In 1924 [[Otto Stern]] suggested combining the Helmholtz model with the Gouy-Chapman model: In Stern's model, some ions adhere to the electrode as suggested by Helmholtz, giving an internal Stern layer, while some form a Gouy-Chapman diffuse layer.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, O. ''Z.Electrochem'', 30, 508 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stern layer accounts for ions' finite size and consequently an ion's closest approach to the electrode is on the order of the ionic radius. The Stern model has its own limitations, namely that it effectively treats ions as point charges, assumes all significant interactions in the [[diffuse layer]] are [[Coulomb]]ic,  and assumes [[dielectric permittivity]] to be constant throughout the double layer and that fluid viscosity is constant plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = SMIRNOV  | first = Gerald  | title = Electric Double Layer  | year = 2011| url = http://web.nmsu.edu/~snsm/classes/chem435/Lab14/double_layer.html   | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. C. Grahame modified the Stern model in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Grahame, Chem. Rev., 41 (1947) 441&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that some ionic or uncharged species can penetrate the Stern layer, although the closest approach to the electrode is normally occupied by solvent molecules. This could occur if ions lose their [[solvation shell]] as they approach the electrode. He called ions in direct contact with the electrode "specifically adsorbed ions". This model proposed the existence of three regions. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) passes through the centres of the specifically adsorbed ions. The outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) passes through the centres of solvated ions at the distance of their closest approach to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nakamura et al., "Outer Helmholtz Plane of the Electrical Double Layer Formed at the Solid Electrode–Liquid Interface" ChemPhysChem, 12 (2011) 1430&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Bockris/Devanathan/Müller (BDM) ===
In 1963 [[John Bockris|J. O'M. Bockris]], M. A. V. Devanathan and [[Klaus Müller (chemist)|Klaus Müller]]&lt;ref&gt;J. O'M. Bockris, M. A. V Devanathan, and K. Mueller, Proc. Roy. Soc, Ser. A. 274, 55 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the BDM model of the double-layer that included the action of the solvent in the interface. They suggested that the attached molecules of the solvent, such as water, would have a fixed alignment to the electrode surface. This first layer of solvent molecules displays a strong orientation to the electric field depending on the charge. This orientation has great influence on the [[permittivity]] of the solvent that varies with field strength. The IHP passes through the centers of these molecules. Specifically adsorbed, partially solvated ions appear in this layer. The solvated ions of the electrolyte are outside the IHP. Through the centers of these ions pass the OHP. The diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Trasatti/Buzzanca ===
Further research with double layers on ruthenium dioxide films in 1971 by Sergio Trasatti and Giovanni Buzzanca demonstrated that the electrochemical behavior of these electrodes at low voltages with specific adsorbed ions was like that of capacitors. The specific adsorption of the ions in this region of potential could also involve a partial charge transfer between the ion and the electrode. It was the first step towards understanding pseudocapacitance.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt;

=== Conway ===
[[File:Bockris Group At Imperical College, London 1947.png|thumb|left|Ph.D., Brian Evans Conway within the [[John Bockris]] Group At [[Imperial College]], London 1947]]

Between 1975 and 1980 [[Brian Evans Conway]] conducted extensive fundamental and development work on [[ruthenium oxide]] electrochemical capacitors. In 1991 he described the difference between 'Supercapacitor' and 'Battery' behavior in electrochemical energy storage. In 1999 he coined the term supercapacitor to explain the increased capacitance by surface redox reactions with faradaic charge transfer between electrodes and ions.&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"&gt;{{citation|last1=Conway|first1=B.E.|periodical=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|title=Transition from 'Supercapacitor' to 'Battery' Behavior in Electrochemical Energy Storage |volume=138|issue=6|pages=1539–1548|date= May 1991|language=German|doi=10.1149/1.2085829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.K.

Kumar, Electrochemistry Encyclopedia, [http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p05-pillars-of-ec.htm Pillars of modern electrochemistry: A brief history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820095410/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p05-pillars-of-ec.htm |date=August 20, 2013 }} Central Electrochemical Research Institute, (November, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

His "supercapacitor" stored electrical charge partially in the Helmholtz double-layer and partially as the result of faradaic reactions with "pseudocapacitance" charge transfer of electrons and protons between electrode and electrolyte. The working mechanisms of pseudocapacitors are redox reactions, intercalation and electrosorption.

=== Marcus ===

The physical and mathematical basics of electron charge transfer absent chemical bonds leading to pseudocapacitance was developed by [[Rudolph A. Marcus]]. [[Marcus Theory]] explains the rates of electron transfer reactions—the rate at which an electron can move from one chemical species to another. It was originally formulated to address [[outer sphere electron transfer]] reactions, in which two chemical species change only in their charge, with an electron jumping. For redox reactions without making or breaking bonds, Marcus theory takes the place of [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]]'s [[transition state theory]] which was derived for reactions with structural changes. Marcus received the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1992 for this theory.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1992/index.html Rudolph A.

[[File:DoubleLayer.gif|thumb|360px|detailed illustration of interfacial DL]]

As stated by Lyklema, "...the reason for the formation of a "relaxed" ("equilibrium") double layer is the non-electric affinity of charge-determining ions for a surface..."&lt;ref name="Lyklema"&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This process leads to the buildup of an [[electric surface charge]], expressed usually in C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface charge creates an electrostatic field that then affects the ions in the bulk of the liquid. This electrostatic field, in combination with the thermal motion of the ions, creates a counter charge, and thus screens the electric surface charge. The net electric charge in this screening diffuse layer is equal in magnitude to the net surface charge, but has the opposite polarity. As a result, the complete structure is electrically neutral.

The diffuse layer, or at least part of it, can move under the influence of [[tangential]] [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. There is a conventionally introduced slipping plane that separates mobile fluid from fluid that remains attached to the surface. Electric potential at this plane is called [[electrokinetic potential]] or [[zeta potential]] (also denoted as ζ-potential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ian D.|last1=Morrison|first2=Sydney|last2=Ross|title=Colloidal dispersions : suspensions, emulsions, and foams|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-471-17625-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Jingkun|last2=Oberdörster|first2=Günter|last3=Biswas|first3=Pratim|title=Characterization of size, surface charge, and agglomeration state of nanoparticle dispersions for toxicological studies|journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research|date=25 June 2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1007/s11051-008-9446-4|bibcode=2009JNR....11...77J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric potential on the external boundary of the Stern layer versus the bulk electrolyte is referred to as [[Stern potential]]. Electric potential difference between the fluid bulk and the surface is called the electric surface potential.

Usually [[zeta potential]] is used for estimating the degree of DL charge. A characteristic value of this electric potential in the DL is 25 mV with a maximum value around 100 mV (up to several volts on electrodes&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.S. Bogotsky, Fundamentals of Electrochemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;). The chemical composition of the sample at which the ζ-potential is 0 is called the [[point of zero charge]] or the [[iso-electric point]]. It is usually determined by the solution pH value, since protons and hydroxyl ions are the charge-determining ions for most surfaces.&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyklema /&gt;

Zeta potential can be measured using [[electrophoresis]], [[electroacoustic phenomena]], [[streaming potential]], and [[electroosmotic flow]].

The characteristic thickness of the DL is the [[Debye length]], κ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is reciprocally proportional to the square root of the ion concentration ''C''. In aqueous solutions it is typically on the scale of a few nanometers and the thickness decreases with increasing concentration of the electrolyte.

The electric field strength inside the DL can be anywhere from zero to over 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V/m. These steep electric potential gradients are the reason for the importance of the DLs.

The theory for a flat surface and a symmetrical electrolyte&lt;ref name="Lyklema" /&gt; is usually referred to as the Gouy-Chapman theory. It yields a simple relationship between electric charge in the diffuse layer σ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and the Stern potential Ψ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.A.H.| last2=Ghadiri| first2=M.

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma^d = -\sqrt{{8\varepsilon_0}{\varepsilon_m}CRT}\sinh \frac{F\Psi^d}{2RT}&lt;/math&gt;

There is no general analytical solution for mixed electrolytes, curved surfaces or even spherical particles. There is an asymptotic solution for spherical particles with low charged DLs. In the case when electric potential over DL is less than 25 mV, the so-called Debye-Huckel approximation holds. It yields the following expression for electric potential'' Ψ'' in the spherical DL as a function of the distance ''r'' from the particle center:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Psi}(r) = {\Psi^d}\frac{a}{r}\exp({-\kappa}(r-a))&lt;/math&gt;

There are several asymptotic models which play important roles in theoretical developments associated with the interfacial DL.

The first one is "thin DL". This model assumes that DL is much thinner than the colloidal particle or capillary radius. This restricts the value of the Debye length and particle radius as following:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &gt;&gt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model offers tremendous simplifications for many subsequent applications. Theory of [[electrophoresis]] is just one example.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Foundations of Colloid Science", Oxford University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[electroacoustic phenomena]] is another example.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |editor= |others= |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=33 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/psd/modeltheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin DL model is valid for most aqueous systems because the Debye length is only a few nanometers in such cases. It breaks down only for nano-colloids in solution with ionic strengths close to water.

The opposing "thick DL" model assumes that the Debye length is larger than particle radius:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &lt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model can be useful for some nano-colloids and non-polar fluids, where the Debye length is much larger.

The last model introduces "overlapped DLs".&lt;ref name="Dukhin" /&gt; This is important in concentrated dispersions and emulsions when distances between particles become comparable with the Debye length.

== Electrical double layers ==
The '''electrical double layer''' ('''EDL''') is the result of the variation of [[electric potential]] near a surface, and has a significant influence on the behaviour of [[colloid]]s and other surfaces in contact with [[solution]]s or solid-state [[fast ion conductor]]s. 

The primary difference between a double layer on an electrode and one on an interface is the mechanisms of [[surface charge]] formation. With an electrode, it is possible to regulate the surface charge by applying an external electric potential. This application, however, is impossible in colloidal and porous double layers, because for colloidal particles, one does not have access to the interior of the particle to apply a potential difference.

EDLs are analogous to the [[double layer (plasma)|double layer]] in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. 

=== Differential capacitance ===
{{Main article|Differential capacitance}}
EDLs have an additional parameter defining their characterization: [[differential capacitance]]. Differential capacitance, denoted as ''C'', is described by the equation below:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{d \sigma}{ d \Psi}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is the [[surface charge]] and ψ is the [[electric surface potential]].

[[Image:Dropsonde delivery system.jpg|thumb|Dropsonde delivery system on a NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter.]]
A '''dropsonde''' is an expendable [[weather]] reconnaissance device created by the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), designed to be dropped from an [[aircraft]] at altitude over water to measure (and therefore track) storm conditions as the device falls to the surface. The sonde contains a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver, along with [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[humidity]] (PTH) [[sensor]]s to capture [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] profiles and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[data]]. It typically relays these data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission.

== Usage ==
[[File:Dropsonde.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A diagram of an NCAR GPS Dropsonde]]
Since the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/sounding-groups/history&lt;/ref&gt; [[hurricane hunters]] have employed dropsondes while flying over the ocean to obtain meteorological data on the structure of [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] deemed to be of possible concern to land locations in the northern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific oceans.  Dropsonde instruments are typically the only way to measure the wind and pressure near the sea surface within the core of such cyclones, allowing meteorologists to reliably establish the storm's intensity and size.  The data obtained is typically fed into supercomputers for [[numerical weather prediction]], enabling forecasters to better track and predict what will happen to the hurricane.  During a typical hurricane season, the [[53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]] Hurricane Hunters deploys 1000 to 1500 sondes on training and storm missions.

Aircraft reconnaissance missions are also sometimes requested to investigate the broader atmospheric structure over the ocean when cyclones may pose a significant threat to the United States.  These interests include not only potential hurricanes, but also possible snow events (like [[nor'easters]]) or significant [[tornado outbreak]]s.  The dropsondes are used to supplement the large gaps over oceans within the global network of [[Radiosonde#Routine radiosonde launches|daily radiosonde launches]].  Typically satellite data provides an estimate of conditions in such areas, but the increased precision of sondes can improve forecasts, particularly of the storm path.

Dropsondes may also be employed during meteorological research projects.

== Device and Launch Details ==

The sonde is a lightweight system designed to be operated by one person and is launched through a chute installed in the measuring aircraft.  The device's descent is slowed and stabilized by a small square-cone [[Parachute#Round|parachute]], allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the ocean surface.  The parachute is designed to immediately deploy after release so as to reduce or eliminate any [[pendulum]] effect, and the device typically drops for three to five minutes.  The sonde has a casing of stiff cardboard to protect electronics and form a more stable aerodynamic profile.

To obtain data in a tropical cyclone, an aircraft (in the US, operated either by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] or the [[U.S. Air Force]]) flies into the system. A series of dropsondes are typically released as the plane passes through the storm, typically launched with greatest frequency near the center of the storm, including into the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]] and [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] (center), if one exists.  Most drops are performed at a flight level of around 10,000 feet (approx. 3,000 meters).

The dropsonde sends back coded data, which includes:
# The date and time of the drop. Time is always in [[UTC]].
# Location of the drop, indicated by the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[Marsden square]].
# The height, temperature, [[dewpoint depression]], [[wind speed]], and [[wind direction]] recorded at any standard isobaric surfaces encountered as the dropsonde descends, which are from the set of: 1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250 [[Pascal (unit)#Hectopascal and millibar units|hectopascals]] (hPa), and at the sea surface.
# The temperature and dewpoint depression at all other atmospheric pressure deemed significant due to important changes or values in the atmospheric conditions found
# Air pressure, temperature, dewpoint depression, wind speed and wind direction of the [[tropopause]].

Also included in the report is information on the aircraft, the mission, the dropsonde itself, and other remarks.

==Driftsondes==
[[File:Dropsonde U.S. Air Force.jpeg|thumb|Dropsonde (source [[US Air Force]])]]
A driftsonde is a high altitude, durable [[weather balloon]] holding a transmitter and a bank (35 in the first models) of miniature dropsonde capsules which can then be dropped at automatic intervals or remotely.  The water-bottle-sized transmitters in the dropsondes have enough power to send information to the balloon during their parachute-controlled fall. The balloon carries a larger transmitter powerful enough to relay readings to a satellite.  The single-use sensor packages cost US$300 to $400 each.&lt;ref name="SciDay"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/0405-balloons_track_storms_and_save_lives.htm | title=Balloons Track Storms And Save Lives: Atmospheric Scientists And Meteorologists Use Driftsondes For Hurricane Forecasts | publisher=Science Daily | date=April 1, 2007 | accessdate=2013-05-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514132957/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/0405-balloons_track_storms_and_save_lives.htm | archivedate=May 14, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being introduced in April 2007, around a thousand a year are expected to be used to track winds in hurricane breeding grounds off of West Africa, which are outside the operating region of Hurricane Hunter planes.&lt;ref name="SciDay"/&gt;

'''Dry stone''', sometimes called '''drystack''' or, in Scotland, '''drystane''', is a building method by which structures are constructed from [[Rock (geology)|stones]] without any [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to bind them together.&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Seymour | first = John | title = The Forgotten Arts A practical guide to traditional skills | publisher = Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers | date = 1984 &lt;!--copyright by Dorling Kindersley Limited, London.

Dry stone construction is best known in the context of [[stone wall]]s, traditionally used for the boundaries of fields and [[churchyard]]s, or as [[retaining wall]]s for terracing, but dry stone sculptures, buildings, bridges, and other structures also exist.

The art of dry stone walling, was inscribed in 2018 on the [[UNESCO]] representative [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity]], for dry stone walls in countries such as [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Croatia]] and [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/art-of-dry-stone-walling-knowledge-and-techniques-01393|title=Art of dry stone walling, knowledge and techniques - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[File:Mycenae lion gate dsc06382.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]] of the [[Mycenae]] acropolis, Greece, is dry stone.]]

Some dry-stone wall constructions in north-west Europe have been dated back to the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] Age. Some Cornish hedges are believed by the Guild of Cornish Hedgers to date from 5000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.cornishhedges.co.uk/PDF/prehistoric.pdf | title = Prehistoric Hedges in Cornwall (5000BC - AD450) | publisher = Guild of Cornish Hedgers | website = www.cornishhedges.co.uk | author = Robin Menneer | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2011-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there appears to be little dating evidence. In [[County Mayo]], Ireland, an entire field system made from dry-stone walls, since covered in peat, have been carbon-dated to 3800 BC. The [[cyclopean]] walls of the [[acropolis]] of [[Mycenae]], Greece, have been dated to 1350 BC and those of [[Tiryns]] slightly earlier. In [[Belize]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Lubaantun]] illustrate use of dry stone construction in architecture of the 8th and 9th centuries AD.

== Location and terminology ==

Terminology varies regionally. When used as field boundaries, dry stone structures often are known as dykes, particularly in [[Scotland]].  Dry stone walls are characteristic of upland areas of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] where rock outcrops naturally or large stones exist in quantity in the soil. They are especially abundant in the West of Ireland, particularly [[Connemara]]. They may also be found throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including retaining walls used for terracing. Such constructions are common where large stones are plentiful (for example, in [[The Burren]]) or conditions are too harsh for hedges capable of retaining livestock to be grown as reliable field boundaries. Many thousands of miles of such walls exist, most of them centuries old.

In the [[United States]] they are common in areas with rocky soils, such as [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] and are a notable characteristic of the [[bluegrass region]] of central [[Kentucky]] as well as [[Virginia]], where they are usually referred to as ''rock fences'' or ''stone fences'', and the [[Napa Valley]] in north central [[California]]. The technique of construction was brought to America primarily by [[English people|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants. The technique was also taken to [[Australia]] (principally western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and some parts of [[Tasmania]] and [[New South Wales]]) and [[New Zealand]] (especially [[Otago]]).

[[File:DryStoneArt.jpg|thumb|[[Mosaic]] embedded in a dry stone wall in Italian [[Switzerland]]]]

Similar walls also are found in the Swiss-Italian border region, where they are often used to enclose the open space under large natural boulders or outcrops.

The higher-lying rock-rich fields and pastures in [[Bohemia]]'s South-Western border range of [[Šumava]] (e.g. around the mountain river of Vydra) are often lined by dry stone walls built of [[fieldstone|field-stones]] removed from the arable or cultural land. They serve both as cattle/sheep fences and the lot's borders. Sometimes also the dry stone terracing is apparent, often combined with parts of stone [[masonry]] (house foundations and shed walls) that are held together by a clay-cum-needles {{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} "composite" [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. {{Elucidate|date=May 2016}} {{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

In [[Peru]] in the 15th century AD, the [[Inca]] made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building dry stone walls to create [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]]. They also employed this mode of construction for freestanding walls. Their [[ashlar]] type construction in [[Machu Picchu]] uses the classic [[Inca architecture|Inca architectural style]] of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar. Many junctions are so perfect that not even a knife fits between the stones. The structures have persisted in the high earthquake region because of the flexibility of the walls and that in their double wall architecture, the two portions of the walls incline into each other.

== Construction ==

[[File:Dry stone globe.jpg|thumb|Boundary wall of a pub featuring a dry stone sculpture, in the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Gloucestershire]], UK]]

A wall's style and method of construction will vary, depending on the type of stone available, its intended use and local tradition. Most older walls are constructed from stones and [[boulders]] cleared from the fields during preparation for agriculture&lt;ref&gt;See "The Character of a Wall. The changing construction of agricultural walls on the island of Gozo", http://www.omertaa.org/archive/omertaa0006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (''field stones'') but many also from stone quarried nearby. For modern walls, quarried stone is almost always used. The type of wall built will depend on the nature of the stones available.
[[File:3.-Pedra en sec (26051155523).jpg|350px|thumb|left|Construction work on dry stone. Illustration of the [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]]]]
One type of wall is called a "double" wall and is constructed by placing two rows of stones along the boundary to be walled. The foundation stones are ideally set into the ground so as to rest firmly on the subsoil. The rows are composed of large flattish stones, diminishing in size as the wall rises. Smaller stones may be used as chocks in areas where the natural stone shape is more rounded. The walls are built up to the desired height layer-by-layer (''course by course'') and, at intervals, large [[Perpend|tie-stones]] or ''through stones'' are placed which span both faces of the wall and sometimes project. These have the effect of bonding what would otherwise be two thin walls leaning against each other, greatly increasing the strength of the wall. Diminishing the width of the wall as it gets higher, as traditionally done in Britain, also strengthens the wall considerably. The voids between the facing stones are carefully packed with smaller stones (''filling'', ''hearting'').

The final layer on the top of the wall also consists of large stones, called ''capstones'', ''coping stones'' or ''copes''. As with the tie stones, the capstones span the entire width of the wall and prevent it breaking apart. In some areas, such as South Wales, there is a tradition of placing the coping stones on a final layer of flat stones slightly wider than the top of the wall proper (''coverbands'').

In addition to gates a wall may contain smaller purposely built gaps for the passage or control of wildlife and [[livestock]] such as sheep. The smaller holes usually no more than 8&amp;nbsp; inches in height are called 'Bolt Holes' or 'Smoots'. Larger ones may be between eighteen and 24 inches in height, these are called a 'Cripple Hole'.&lt;ref&gt;See the "Cripple hole" and "Smoot" entries in the glossary at the end of ''Dry Stone Walling'', https://www.conservationhandbooks.com/dry-stone-walling/glossary/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulder walls are a type of single wall in which the wall consists primarily of large boulders, around which smaller stones are placed. Single walls work best with large, flatter stones. Ideally, the largest stones are being placed at the bottom and the whole wall tapers toward the top. Sometimes a row of capstones completes the top of a wall, with the long rectangular side of each [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] perpendicular to the wall alignment.

[[File:Galloway Dyke on Fetlar.jpg|thumb|Galloway dyke on [[Fetlar]], [[Shetland Islands]], [[UK]]]]

[[Galloway]] dykes consist of a base of double-wall construction or larger boulders with single-wall construction above. They appear to be rickety, with many holes, which deters livestock (and people) from attempting to cross them. These dykes are principally found in locations with exceptionally high winds, where a solid wall might be at risk of being unsettled by the buffeting. The porous nature of the wall significantly reduces wind force but takes greater skill to construct. They are also found in grazing areas where they are used to maximize the utility of the available stones (where ploughing was not turning up ever more stones).

Another variation is the "[[Cornish hedge]]" or Welsh ''clawdd'', which is a stone-clad earth bank topped by turf, scrub, or trees and characterised by a strict inward-curved [[Batter (walls)|batter]] (the slope of the "hedge"). As with many other varieties of wall, the height is the same as the width of the base, and the top is half the base width.

Different regions have made minor modifications to the general method of construction — sometimes because of limitations of building material available, but also to create a look that is distinctive for that area. Whichever method is used to build a dry stone wall, considerable skill is required. Correcting any mistakes invariably means disassembling down to the level of the error. Selection of the correct stone for every position in the wall makes an enormous difference to the lifetime of the finished product, and a skilled waller will take time making the selection.

As with many older crafts, skilled wallers, today, are few in number. With the advent of modern wire fencing, fields can be fenced with much less time and expense using wire than using stone walls; however, the initial expense of building dykes is offset by their sturdiness and consequent long, low-maintenance lifetimes. As a result of the increasing appreciation of the landscape and heritage value of dry stone walls, wallers remain in demand, as do the walls themselves. A nationally recognised certification scheme is operated in the UK by the Dry Stone Walling Association, with four grades from Initial to Master Craftsman.

Notable examples include:
* [[Mourne Wall]]: twenty-two mile long wall in the [[Mourne Mountains]] location in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]]
* [[Ottenby]] nature reserve, built by [[Charles X Gustav]] in mid 17th century, [[Öland]], Sweden

== Other uses ==
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|Intihuatana ritual buildings of dry stone at [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]]]]

While the dry-stone technique is generally used for field enclosures, it also was used for buildings. The traditional turf-roofed Highland [[blackhouse]] was constructed using the double wall dry stone method. When buildings are constructed using this method, the middle of the wall is generally filled with earth or sand in order to eliminate draughts. During the Iron Age, and perhaps earlier, the technique also was used to build fortifications such as the walls of [[Eketorp Castle]] ([[Öland]], [[Sweden]]), [[Maiden Castle, North Yorkshire]], [[Reeth]], [[Dunlough Castle]] in southwest Ireland and the rampart of the Long Scar Dyke. Many of the dry-stone walls that exist today in Scotland can be dated to the 14th century or earlier when they were built to divide fields and retain livestock. Some extremely well built examples are found on the lands of [[Muchalls Castle]].

Dry stone walls can be built against embankments or even vertical terraces. If they are subjected to lateral earth pressure, they are retaining walls of the type gravity wall. The weight of the stones resists the pressure from the retained soil, including any surcharges, and the friction between the stones causes most of them to act as if being a monolithic gravity wall of the same weight. Dry stone retaining walls were once built in great numbers for agricultural terracing and also to carry paths, roads and railways. Although dry stone is seldom used for these purposes today, a great many are still in use and maintained. New ones are often built in gardens and nature conservation areas. Dry stone retaining structures continue to be a subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/C0C88DB0-86CB-4262-BDCC-2DA9E7CFCC45#tabPublications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olandalbymedbridge.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval]] dry stone bridge in [[Alby, Öland|Alby, Sweden]]]]

Since at least the [[Middle Ages]] some bridges capable of carrying horse or carriage traffic have been constructed using drystone techniques. An example of a well-preserved bridge of this type is a double arched [[limestone]] bridge in [[Alby, Öland|Alby, Sweden]] on the island of [[Öland]], ''(shown at right)''.

In northeastern [[Somalia]], on the coastal plain 20&amp;nbsp;km to [[Aluula]]'s east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia.&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burial sites near [[Burao]] in the northwestern part of the country likewise feature a number of old [[stela]]e.&lt;ref name="Shaanm"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums|url=http://www.somaliheritage.org/museums.php|publisher=Somali Heritage and Archaeology|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DryStoneMarkingA.jpg|thumb|Dry stone marking or [[cairn]]]]

In Great Britain, Ireland and Switzerland, it is possible to find small dry stone structures built as signs, marking mountain paths or boundaries of owned land. In many countries, [[cairn]]s, as they are called in Scotland, are used as road and mountain top markers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3261">An '''energy certificate''' is a transferable certificate, record or guarantee, in any form (including electronic) in relation to the amount of a specific type of [[energy]] or material goods consumed by an [[energy conversion device]] in the production of a quantity of energy or material goods and/or the attributes of the method and quality of its [[Production (economics)|production]].

Energy certificates for renewable energy are also referred to as:
* Tradable Renewable Energy Certificates (TRECs)
* [[Tradable Renewable Certificates]] (TRCs)
* [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs)
* [[Guarantee of origin]] (GO)
* [[Green tags]]
* [[Renewable Energy Credits]].

Energy certificates issued under national legislation are normally used to provide evidence of compliance with an obligation on electricity producers, suppliers or consumers to use energy of a specific type or in order to qualify for financial support: qualifying plant are often high-quality cogenerators, or produce electricity from renewable sources. Examples of this within Europe are the Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) issued under the [[Renewables Obligation]], and Levy Exemption Certificates (LECs) issued under the [[Climate Change Levy]] - originally part of the [[Finance Act 2001]] - within the UK; Certificati Verdi within Italy; Elcerts within Sweden; and also within the three regions (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia) of Belgium. At the time of writing, almost all such support schemes are national in character only, the transfer of certificates to and from other countries not being the intention of the policymakers. A notable exception is the [[Climate Change Levy]]: LECs are issued by the UK regulator to electricity producers both in the UK and in a number of European countries and exported to the UK, where they are purchased as proof of production of renewable energy production.

The European Union has also created internationally-transferable "guarantees of origin" to provide proof to consumers of the source of their electricity, as required by [[Internal Market in Electricity Directive|Directive 2009/72/EC]]: these are used by electricity suppliers when calculating the proportions of energy sources (e.g. fossil, nuclear etc.) in their supplied energy; and by government in calculating the "residual mix" (i.e. the blend of different sources of electricity produced in a country, adjusted for imports and exports. [[Directive 2009/28/EC]] and [[Directive 2012/27/EC]] give life to (respectively) guarantees of origin for renewable energy and highly-efficient cogeneration, for use within the European Union and those countries with which it is bound by treaty (currently the [[European Economic Area]] and [[Energy Community]] of South East Europe countries). The international transfer of guarantees of origin is facilitated by the [[Association of Issuing Bodies]]' [[European Energy Certificate System]]. 

Energy certificates are also used in other countries, including the United States of America, Australia, Turkey and Japan.

'''Energy in Armenia''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, import and consumption in [[Armenia]]. 

Armenia has no proven reserves of oil or [[natural gas]] and currently imports nearly all gas it from [[Russia]]. The [[Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline]] has the capacity to provide twice the country's 2008 natural gas consumption and has the potential to provide energy security for Armenia as an alternative to the Russian-dominated imports that flow through the Georgian border.

Despite a lack of fossil fuel, Armenia has significant domestic electricity generation resources. The Armenian electrical energy sector has had a surplus capacity ever since emerging from a severe post-Soviet crisis in the mid-1990s thanks to the reopening of the nuclear power station at Metsamor.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Dec-21-2010"&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2255270.html "New Armenian Power Plant Set For Launch"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] provides 42.9% of the country's electricity. Armenia has plans to build a new NPP in order to replace the aging Metsamor which was built in 1979. The country also has eleven hydroelectric power plants and has plans to build [[Jermaghbyur Geothermal Power Plant|a geothermal power plant]] in [[Syunik Region|Syunik]]. Most of the rest of Armenia's electricity is generated by the natural gas-fired thermal power plants in [[Yerevan Thermal Power Plant|Yerevan]] (completed in 2010) and [[Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant|Hrazdan]].

Upon gaining independence, Armenia signed the European Energy Charter in December 1991, the charter is now known as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] which promotes integration of global energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | Last = |First = |title=Energy Charter Treaty Members|url=https://energycharter.org/who-we-are/members-observers/countries/armenia/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia is also a partner country of the [[European Union|EU]] [[INOGATE]] energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing [[energy security]], [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of member state [[energy market]]s on the basis of [[Internal energy market|EU internal energy market]] principles, supporting [[sustainable energy]] development, and attracting [[investment]] for energy projects of common and regional interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inogate.org INOGATE website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Armenia holds observer member status in the EU's [[Energy Community]].

It is estimated that nearly 80 percent of Armenia's energy system is under Russian control.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Oct-17-2008"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101708.shtml ''ARMENIA: NEW PROJECTS A STAB AT INDEPENDENCE FROM MOSCOW?''], EurasiaNet.org, October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason= The source is missing, claim is unreliable|18=June 2018|date=June 2018}}

== History and Geopolitics ==
Before collapse of USSR oil imports made up for about 50% primary energy supply in Armenia, which were as high as 8000 ktoe compared to some 3100 ktoe in 2016 .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/ARMENIA5.pdf|title=Total primary energy supply in Armenia (1990-2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armstat.am/file/doc/99506908.pdf|title=Energy balance of the Republic of Armenia, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Back then oil imports made its way to Armenia via a direct rail link from Armenia-Georgia-Russia, but since the [[Abkhaz–Georgian conflict|Abkhazia-Georgia border]] is closed fuel is transported across the Black Sea to Georgia from where it makes its way to Armenia via rail cars.  Further restriction to Armenian oil imports represents economic blockade maintained by [[Azerbaijan]] to the East, and [[Turkey]] to the West. The blockade began shortly after break-out of [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno-Karabakh struggle for independence]] and was upheld ever since, despite a cease fire agreement in 1994.&lt;ref name="DOE-Cauc-Energy"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Caucasus/LocalIssues.html Official Energy Statistics from the U.S. Government - Caucasus Region], [[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary energy supply ==
Total primary energy supply in Armenia in 2016 amounted to 3121 ktoe (1000 tonnes of oil equivalent).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This roughly matches or surpasses production of previous years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Natural reserves ==
[[Armenia]] has no proven oil or gas reserves.  Earlier explorations failed to deliver satisfactory results in the past .

In 2018 new permits for oil and gas exploration were issued to [[Tashi Group|Tashir Group]] affiliated companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecolur.org/en/news/mining/positive-opinion-to-tashir-capital-company-will-search-for-oil-and-gas-in-shirak-lori-and-tavush/9914/|title=Positive Opinion to 'Tashir Capital': Company Will Search for Oil and Gas in Shirak, Lori, and Tavush - HOT LINE - Ecolur|last=Ecolur|website=www.ecolur.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecolur.org/en/news/mining/tashir-capital-intends-to-search-for-oil-and-gas-in-yerevan/9882/|title='Tashir Capital' Intends to Search for Oil and Gas in Yerevan - HOT LINE - Ecolur|last=Ecolur|website=www.ecolur.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hetq.am/eng/news/85400/billionaire-samvel-karapetyan-exploring-for-oil-and-gas-around-yerevan.html|title=Billionaire Samvel Karapetyan Exploring for Oil and Gas Around Yerevan - Hetq - News, Articles, Investigations|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil==
According to [[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|ArmStat]] no oil was imported in 2016, but rather its refinement products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Proposed Iran-Armenia oil pipeline===
Armenian and Iranian authorities have for years been discussing an oil pipeline (distinct from the existing Iran-Armenia natural gas pipeline) that will pump Iranian oil products to Armenia; however, as of early 2011, no concrete dates have been set for the construction.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Feb-15-2011"&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2310373.html "No Firm Date Set For Work On Another Armenian-Iranian Pipeline"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Armenian Energy Minister Armen Movsisian has said that the construction will take two years and cost Armenia about $100 million.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Feb-15-2011"/&gt;  Earlier Iran's Oil Minister has said that the 365-kilometer pipeline could go on stream by 2014.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Feb-15-2011"/&gt;  Iran plans to export 1.5 million liters of gasoline and diesel fuel a day to Armenia through the pipeline; Armenia’s annual demand for refined oil products stands at around 400,000 metric tons.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Feb-15-2011"/&gt;

==Natural Gas==
[[File:Headquarters of ArmRosGazprom.JPG|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Gazprom Armenia]] in [[Yerevan]]'s [[Kanakerr|Kanakerr district]]]]
Natural gas represents a large portion of total energy consumption in Armenia, accounting for 50% and is the primary means of winter heating in the country.  

[[Gazprom Armenia]] (owned by the Russian gas giant [[Gazprom]]) owns the natural gas pipeline network within Armenia and holds a monopoly over the import and distribution of natural gas to consumers and businesses.  

Armenia's [[thermal power station]]s (which supply approximately 24% of Armenia's electricity needs) run on natural gas, making Armenia (at the present time) dependent on imported Russian gas.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Jul-28-2008"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/07/9fe18bdd-bd7e-4231-9253-1716e191f7c4.asp "Armenian Power Utility Rules Out Price Rise"], Armenian Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), July 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Russia-Georgia-Armenia pipelines ===
The Russian gas export monopoly [[Gazprom]] supplies Armenia with gas through a pipeline that runs through Georgia.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Apr24-08"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav042408.shtml "ARMENIA: GAS PRICE HIKE POSES CHALLENGE FOR GOVERNMENT"], EurasiaNet, April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Gazprom provided Armenia with just under 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas.  As a transit fee, Armenia pays [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] approximately 10% of the gas that was destined to reach Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/383827cb-b4db-4f24-a5fe-a9dbef3f6f72.html "Georgia/Russia: Both Sides Move Closer On Gas Issues"], Armenian Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), December 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian natural gas supplies to Georgia and Armenia are provided by two main pipelines: the North Caucasus-Transcaucasus pipeline (1,200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) and the [[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia-Alania|Mozdok]]-[[Tbilisi]] pipeline (700&amp;nbsp;mm diameter).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/365698/russian_gas_supplies_to_georgia_armenia_cut_over_pipeline_blasts/index.html ''Russian Gas Supplies to Georgia, Armenia Cut Over Pipeline Blasts - Ministry''], RIA Novosti, January 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Armenia imported 2.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia.&lt;ref name=gasrus&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/28443/ Armenia to import gas from Iran], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (December 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran-Armenia gas pipeline ===
A new gas pipeline, the [[Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline]], was completed in October, 2008. It is owned and operated by [[Gazprom Armenia]] and links Armenia to neighboring [[Iran]], which has the world's second largest natural gas reserve after Russia.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-April-7-2006"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/07/business/worldbusiness/07gas.html ''Resolving a Supply Dispute, Armenia to Buy Russian Gas''], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a capacity to pump 2.3-2.5 billion cubic meters of Iranian gas per year.  However, although Iran is ready to export gas to Armenia, the [[Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources|Armenian Ministry of Energy]] claimed in October 2008 that it "does not yet have a need" for Iranian gas.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Oct-17-2008" /&gt;  Analysts have said that Armenia's reluctance to import Iranian gas is a result of pressure from Russia which maintains a monopoly over Armenia's natural gas market.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-Oct-17-2008" /&gt;

Gazprom wholly owns a crucial 24-mile section of the pipeline which Armenia surrendered in exchange for natural gas supplies from Russia at prices well below the European average until 2009.  According to an analyst, Armenia "effectively bargained away its future prospects for energy sources in return for cheaper prices now."  While Armenia could diversify its gas supply, with control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline, Gazprom now controls the competitors' supply.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-April-7-2006" /&gt;

In 2009 Armenia was importing 1-1.5 million cubic meters of Iranian natural gas, paying for this by electricity exports.&lt;ref name="gasrus" /&gt; In 2010 Iran will sell about 150 million cubic meters of natural gas to Armenia. A natural gas measuring center was installed late 2009/early 2010 at the Armenian-Iranian border to replace a provisional gas measuring station.&lt;ref name="gasrus" /&gt;

In 2018 as part of gas for electricity swap deal Armenia receives about 370 million cubic meters of gas a year from Iran, which is converted into electricity and is shipped back to Iran. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenian_government_is_looking_into_chances_to_have_gas_price_reduced/|title=Armenian government is looking into chances to have gas price reduced|website=arka.am|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the agreements reached in 2017 by [[Karapetyan government]] gas import price stands at $150 for one thousand cubic meters throughout year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.am/eng/news/475227.html|title=New Armenia energy minister comments on gas price|website=news.am|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gazprom Armenia sells it to Armenian households at almost $300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/business/pashinyan_creates_task_force_to_look_into_natural_gas_price/|title=Pashinyan creates task force to look into natural gas price|website=arka.am|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination done by the working group set by the instruction of PM [[Nikol Pashinyan|Pashinyan]] revealed in October 2018 that gas tariffs can be reduced by at least 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/949790.html|title=Gas and electricity tariffs in Armenia can be cut - working group reveals|work=armenpress.am|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
{{Main article|Electricity sector in Armenia}}Since 1996 three main energy sources for electricity generation in Armenia were natural gas, nuclear power and hydropower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/WebGraphs/ARMENIA2.pdf|title=Electricity generation by fuel in Armenia (1990-2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Electricity Production in Armenia by Power Plant 2006.png|thumbnail|right|350px]]
Despite a lack of fossil fuel, Armenia has significant domestic electricity generation resources.  In 2006, non-thermal domestic electricity generation accounted for 76% of total generation: 43% nuclear and 33% hydroelectric.  In comparison, in 2002, these numbers were 56%, 32%, and 26%.

In 2006, Armenia's power plants generated a total of 5,940.9 million KWh of electricity of which 5,566.7 million KWh were delivered (374.2 million KWh – or 6.3% – was consumed by the producing plants).&lt;ref name="PSRC-Q42006-Energy-Main-Indicators"&gt;[http://www.psrc.am/download.php?fid=6533 ''2006Q4 Electric Power: Main Indicators''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531152903/http://www.psrc.am/download.php?fid=6533 |date=2011-05-31 }}, Public Services Regulatory Commission of The Republic of Armenia, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in 2006, Armenia's power plants ''on average'' generated 678.2 MW of power, while the country's electricity consumption rate ''on average'' was 635.5 MW.

Armenia has a total of 11 power stations and 17 220 kV substations.  A map of Armenia's National Electricity Transmission Grid can be found at the website of the [[Global Energy Network Institute]] here [http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/armenia/index.shtml].

===Nuclear Power Plant and Nuclear Fuel===
{{Main article| Armenian Nuclear Power Plant}}
[[File:Metsamor aerien.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Armenia's [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] ]]
Armenia's [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]] has an installed capacity of 815 MW, though only one unit of 407.5 MW is currently in operation.&lt;ref name="ElPowerAM-2001-2002-UNESCAP"/&gt;  

Because Turkey despite of its [[WTO]] obligation illegally blockades Armenian borders nuclear fuel must be flown in from Russia.&lt;ref name="DOE-Cauc-Energy"/&gt;  Used fuel is sent back to Russia.

Despite an abundance of renewable energy sources in the country,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} the government of Armenia is currently discussing the issue of constructing a new nuclear power plant.

===Thermal Power Plants===
[[File:Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant, Armenia.JPG|thumb|300x300px|The Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant in central Armenia|alt=]]
During 2010-2017 thermal power plants (running on imported natural gas from Russia and Iran) provided about one-third of Armenia's electricity.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2020632.html "Armenia Inaugurates New Power Plant"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), April 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New thermal power plants====

In April 2010, a new natural gas-fired thermal power plant was inaugurated in Yerevan, making it the first major energy facility built in the country since independence.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt;  The plant will reportedly allow Armenia to considerably cut back on use of natural gas for electricity production, because officials say it will also be twice as efficient as the plant’s decommissioned unit and four other Soviet-era facilities of its kind functioning in the central Armenian town of Hrazdan.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt;  With a capacity of 242 megawatts, its gas-powered turbine will be able to generate approximately one-quarter of Armenia’s current (as of 2010) electricity output.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt;  The state-of-the-art plant was built in Yerevan in place of an obsolete facility with a $247 million loan provided by the Japanese government through the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC). The long-term loan was disbursed to the Armenian government on concessional terms in 2007.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt;

Armenia’s energy sector will expand further after the ongoing construction of the Hrazdan thermal plant’s new and even more powerful Fifth Unit.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt; Russia’s Gazprom monopoly acquired the incomplete facility in 2006 as part of a complex agreement with the Armenian government that raised its controlling stake in the Armenian gas distribution network to a commanding 80 percent. The Russian giant pledged to spend more than $200 million on finishing its protracted construction by 2011.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt;

The new Yerevan and Hrazdan TPP facilities will pave the way for large-scale Armenian imports of natural gas from neighboring Iran through a pipeline constructed in late 2008. Armenia began receiving modest amounts of Iranian gas in May 2009. With Russian gas essentially meeting its domestic needs, it is expected that the bulk of that gas will be converted into electricity and exported to the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Apr-20-2010"/&gt;

In late December 2010, the Armenian Energy Ministry announced that the fifth block of the Hrazdan thermal power plant will go online by April 2011.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Dec-21-2010"/&gt;  Although construction on the fifth block began in the late 1980s, the Armenian government tried to unsuccessfully finish it in the late 1990s.  The current project is part of a 2006 deal between Gazprom and the Armenian government, in which Gazprom acquired the incomplete facility and increased its stake in Armenia's gas distribution network, in turn pledging to spend $200 million in completing the project by 2011.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-Dec-21-2010"/&gt;

===Hydroelectric Power Plants===
[[File:Arabkir Hydroelectric power plant.jpg|600x600px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The [[Kanaker]] hydroelectric power plant along the [[Hrazdan river]] just north of [[Yerevan]]'s [[Arabkir (district)|Arabkir]] district&lt;/center&gt;|alt=]]
[[File:Atarbekyan Hydro Power Plant.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Atarbekyan Hydro Power Plant]] in [[Hrazdan]]]]
Hydropower plants have an established capacity of 1,038 MW.&lt;ref name="ElPowerAM-2001-2002-UNESCAP"/&gt;

The economically justified hydropower potential of Armenia is around 3.600 [[GWh]]/year. From this amount, 1.500 GWh/year (or about 42% of economically justified hydropower potential) has been developed already.&lt;ref name="RenEnAM-Hydro-Potential"&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyarmenia.am/content/view/41/112/lang,en/ "Hydropower Potential of Armenia"], Renewable Energy Armenia (Danish Energy Management A/S).&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia has 9 hydroelectric power plants which together accounted for 33% of its domestic electricity generation.  The plants are grouped along two cascades:  the [[Sevan–Hrazdan Cascade]] and the [[Vorotan Cascade]].&lt;ref name="RenEnAM-Hydro-Potential"/&gt;  The following table lists the details of each cascade:&lt;ref name="GENI-Elec-Map"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RenEnAM-Hydro-Potential"/&gt;

====Planned projects====
By 2020, it is expected that the [[Meghri Dam|Meghri HPP]] (also known as the Araks Hydro Power Plant) with 140 MW capacity and the [[Loriberd HPP]] with 60 MW capacity will be built with the cumulative generation of 1,012 million kWh/year.&lt;ref name="USAID-National-Renewable-Energy-Program-2007"&gt;[http://www.minenergy.am/files/level1/National%20Program_English.pdf ''National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy of Republic of Armenia''], Scientific Research Institute of Energy for the Alliance to Save Energy, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Meghri Hydro Power Plant is a joint Armenian-Iranian project to be constructed on the [[Araks River]] near Armenia's southern border town of [[Meghri]].&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet-June-21-2007"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav062107a.shtml ''US CONCERNED BY ARMENIA’S ENERGY TIES WITH IRAN''], EurasiaNet, June 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the energy ministers of Armenia and Iran signed a document on the long-anticipated construction of two hydropower stations on the Arax River. The agreement stipulates that the $323 million project will be fundamentally financed and operated by Iran, 793 million kWh of energy transported to Iran annually, and the stations transferred to Armenia’s ownership 15 years later. Construction was expected to commence in 2011 and take five years to complete.&lt;ref name="Armenia_in_2010"&gt;{{Armenia in 2010. A Year of Uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018 construction is not completed.

===Small hydroelectric power plants===
According to a [[USAID]] sponsored report, 313 small hydroelectric power plants (small HPPs) with an installed capacity of 243.366 [[Megawatt|MW]] and an average yearly electricity production of 737.38 [[GWh]] are installed in the country.&lt;ref name="USAID-National-Renewable-Energy-Program-2007"/&gt;  In 2006, the small HPPs produced 166.6 GWh of electricity.&lt;ref name="PSRC-Q42006-Energy-Main-Indicators"/&gt;

===Wind power===
[[File:Wind Power in Armenia at Pushkin Pass.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Lori 1 Wind Power plant at Pushkin Pass]]
According to a study sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) in 2002-2003, the ''theoretical'' [[wind power]] potential of Armenia is 4,900 MWe in 4 zones with a total area of 979&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="RenEnAM-WindPowerPot"&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyarmenia.am/content/view/37/99/lang,en/ "Wind Power Potential"], Renewable Energy Armenia (Danish Energy Management A/S).&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, the Lori 1 Wind power plant is Armenia's only [[wind power plant]].  Completed in December 2005 by the Iranian company "Sunir" with funding from [[Iran]], it consists of 4 [[wind turbines]] and has a capacity of 2.64 MWe.  It is located along the [[Bazum Mountains]] at [[Pushkin Pass]] ({{coord|40|54|41.36|N|44|25|52.86|E|display=inline}}) in Armenia's northern region of [[Lori Province|Lori]].  In 2006, the Lori 1 WPP generated only 2.6 [[GWh]] of electricity (a yearly average of 296.8 KWe—about 11% of installed capacity).&lt;ref name="PSRC-Q42006-Energy-Main-Indicators"/&gt;

[[Wind power]] in Armenia is underdeveloped and as of 2008, Armenia has only one wind power farm located in the [[Lori Province|Lori marz]]. The Armenian and Iranian energy sectors are currently jointly constructing the [[Iran-Armenia Wind Farm]] which is set to become the country's largest [[wind farm]], having an installed electric capacity of 90 [[Megawatt|MW]].&lt;ref name="armiran wind"&gt;[http://www.ebrdrenewables.com/sites/renew/Lists/Projects/DispForm.aspx?ID=19&amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eebrdrenewables%2Ecom%2Fsites%2Frenew%2Fcountries%2FArmenia%2Fdefault%2Easpx Iran-Armenia Wind Farm], Renewable Development Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar power===
According to the report of Renewable Energy Roadmap for Armenia (&lt;ref name="Renewable-Energy-Roadmap-for-Armenia"&gt;[http://r2e2.am/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Renewable-Energy-Roadmap-for-Armenia.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) the technical potential of the solar energy in the country is exceeding 1000 MW, or around 2% of the country's annual energy consumption. Solar energy utilization in the country remains low due to solar's tendency for less efficient and less reliable energy generation in comparison with nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric energy. 

===Geothermal power===
Armenia is constructing the [[Jermaghbyur Geothermal Power Plant]] which will be the country's largest [[geothermal power plant]] having an installed electric capacity of 150 MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrdrenewables.com/sites/renew/Lists/Projects/DispForm.aspx?ID=1763&amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eebrdrenewables%2Ecom%2Fsites%2Frenew%2Fcountries%2FArmenia%2Fdefault%2Easpx New Geothermal Plant for Armenia], Renewable Development Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermal Energy ==
In addition to generating electricity, both the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant and the Hrazdan Thermal Power Plants can provide thermal energy to consumers and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psrc.am/am/?nid=193 ''Thermal Energy: Licensed companies''], Public Services Regulatory Commission of The Republic of Armenia, 2008. {{hy icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==

[[Oman]] is a country in the [[Middle East]]. Its current [[GDP per capita]] has expanded continuously over the past 50 years. It grew 339% in the 1960s and reached a peak growth of 1,370% in 1976.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Oman both imports and exports energy.

When Oman declined as an entrepot for arms and [[Slavery|slaves]] in the mid-19th century, much of its former prosperity vanished; the economy turned almost exclusively to [[agriculture]], camel and goat herding, fishing, and traditional [[handicraft]]s. Today, [[petroleum]] (oil) exports fuel the economy. Revenues from petroleum products have enabled Oman's dramatic development and modernization over the past 300 years.&lt;ref name="Economy of Oman"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-16|title=Economy of Oman|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Oman&amp;oldid=800977356|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil ==

Oil was first discovered in 1964, near [[Fahud]] in the western desert. [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO) began production in August 1967. The Omani Government owns 60% of PDO, and foreign interests own 40% ([[Royal Dutch Shell]] owns 34%; the remaining 6% is owned by [[Total S.A.|Total]] and [[Partex]]). In 1976, Oman's oil production rose to 366,000 barrels (58,000 m³) per day but declined to about 285,000 barrels (45,000 m³) per day in the late 1980s due to the depletion of recoverable reserves. From 1981 to 1986, Oman compensated for [[1980s oil glut|declining oil prices]] by increasing production levels to 600,000 b/d; however, when oil prices collapsed in 1986, revenues dropped dramatically. Production was cut back temporarily in coordination with the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC). Production levels again reached 600,000 b/d by mid-1987, which helped increase revenues. [[Oman]]'s economic performance improved significantly in 1999 due largely to the mid-year upturn in [[oil price]]s. The government moved ahead with [[privatization]] of its utilities, and the development of the commercial law to encourage foreign investment. Oman [[Liberalization|liberalized]] its markets in an effort to join the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and was accepted in 2000. By the mid-2000s, production had climbed to more than 900,000 b/d and where they remain. 
Oman is not a member of OPEC.&lt;ref name="Economy of Oman"/&gt;

:[[Yibal]] is the largest [[oilfield]] in Oman, and is operated primarily by [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

:Since production started in 1968, Oman's maximum production has been 250,000 barrels a day. As of 2005, production declined to 88,000 barrels a day.

In November 2017, Oman Oilfield received steam generated from 1,021 MW Solar Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://interestingengineering.com/oman-oilfield-to-receive-steam-generated-from-1021-mw-solar-plant|title=Oman Oilfield to Receive Steam Generated from 1,021 MW Solar Plant|date=2017-11-13|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gas ==
[[Oman LNG]] is an [[LNG plant]] in operation since September 2000. It is supplied with gas in central Oman from Saih Rowl, the gas field is operated by [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO).

'''Energy in Yemen''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Yemen]]. [[Energy policy of Yemen]] will describe the [[politics of Yemen]] related to energy more in detail. Yemen n is net energy exporter.

Primary energy use in Yemen was 87 TWh and 4 TWh/million people in 2008 and 88 TWh (4 TWh/M) in 2009.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] and [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2011/key_world_energy_stats.pdf 2011] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

According to the World Bank, Yemen has the lowest level of electricity connection in the Middle East, with only 40% of the population having access to electricity. Rural areas are particularly badly affected. Industrial concerns, hospitals and hotels have their own back-up generators. To address these shortages, a 340-MW gas-fired power plant is currently under construction-and close to completion-at [[Marib]]. Further expansion to the facility, which will add an additional 400 MW of output, is already planned. Yemen has received considerable support for the development of its power generation network in recent years, with contributions coming from [[Saudi Arabia]], [[France]], the US, as well as multilateral donors such as the [[World Bank]]. Consequently, a National [[Rural Electrification Program]] is now in place and the construction of three substations, along with the necessary transmission lines, is currently under way. Yemen is also looking into the development of [[wind power]], although plans for the construction of a nuclear power generating facility have been shelved. Electrical production is 5.665 billion kWh (2007 estimate). Electrical consumption is about 4.133 billion kWh.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. 2012.

'''Glacier growing''', '''artificial glaciation''' or [[glacier]] [[grafting]],&lt;ref&gt;Khan, S. (2005): ''Glacier Grafting'', The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme 16, Skardu, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; is a practice carried out in the [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Himalaya]] regions aimed at creating small new glaciers to increase water supply for crops and in some cases to sustain [[micro hydro]] power. In order to encourage the growth of a glacier local farmers acquire ice from naturally occurring glaciers, and carry it to high altitude areas where the ice is put inside a small cave dug out in a [[scree]]-slope. Along with the ice other ingredients such as water, salt, sawdust, wheat husks and charcoal are also placed at the site.&lt;ref name="tveiten"&gt;Tveiten, I. (2007): ''Glacier Growing - A Local Response to Water Scarcity in Baltistan and Gilgit'', The Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Master of Science Thesis ([http://www.umb.no/statisk/noragric/publications/master/2007_ingvar_tveiten.pdf Abstract, pdf 65 Kb])&lt;/ref&gt; The use of glacier grafting is an old skill of the mountain farmers of [[Baltistan]] and [[Gilgit]], where it is used for irrigation purposes since at least the 19th century. This technique was described by Lieutenant [[David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer]] (1876–1962) in the 1920s. Allegedly glacier grafting also has been used to block [[mountain pass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtnforum.org/sites/default/files/pub/icimod-apmn_bulletins2007.pdf Inayatullah Faizi: ''Artificial glacier grafting: Indigenous knowledge of the mountain people of Chitral'', Asia Pacific Mountain Network (APMN) Bulletin 8, Nr. 1. 2007, pdf, 600 Kb])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Glacier growing 3.jpg|thumb|Transporting ice to the grafting site]]

In the high Himalaya water is the limiting factor for [[agriculture]] and many farmers experience scarcity of water in late autumn - a period critical to the maturation of crops. Farmers living in [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s without glaciers are especially vulnerable since they largely depend on snow melt for irrigation, in contrast to other areas where glaciers are a reliable source of water. In such communities glacier grafting is often attempted as a means to encourage the growth of new glaciers and thus ensure the existence of water resources.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Procedures==
[[Image:glacier growing 2.jpg|thumb|Difficult transport of ingredients for an artificial glacier]]

The first step involves looking for a suitable location to glacier growing. The preferred terrain, according to glacier growers in Baltistan and Gilgit, is in shadowed scree-slopes overlooked by steep [[headwall]]s.&lt;ref name="tveiten" /&gt; Commonly the sites are located between 4,000-5,000&amp;nbsp;metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Such locations are susceptible to snowfall and [[avalanche]]s during winter and spring, creating an environment conducive to the accumulation of ice.

Ice is transported in baskets of woven willow twigs by teams of two and two, who take turns to carry the baskets. This usually involves ascents from lower lying valleys (around 2,000-3,000 metres above sea level) up to the site selected for the glacier growing.

Similar efforts are being carried out by the noted engineer [[Chewang Norphel]], in the adjacent [[Ladakh]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian engineer 'builds' new glaciers to stop global warming|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/globalwarming/6449982/Indian-engineer-builds-new-glaciers-to-stop-global-warming.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest building of the [[Archaeological Park of Dion]] in northern Greece is the '''[[Hellenistic]]-era theatre'''. It is located in the south of the village of [[Dion, Pieria]] and is often used during the summer for performances of the [[Olympus Festival]].

==Location==
The theatre is located approximately 180 meters south of the entrance to the archaeological park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.de/maps/@40.1723342,22.4911989,212m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!10m1!1e2|title=Birdeyes view of the ancient theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of construction==
{{main|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Konzert in Dion.jpg|thumb|An event of the Olympus Festival at the ancient theatre]]
The form of the theatre corresponds to the typical theatre of Greek antiquity. It is an open-air structure that was built in a northeastern direction on the slope of a low, natural (partially heaped) hill. The  ''orchestra'' was built on mashed soil and was surrounded by a drainage construction, to drain the rainwater. The drainage is uncovered, over two bridges it could be crossed by the actors. The ''orchestra'' has a diameter of about 26 meters. The stage was probably made of wood and was a bit higher than the current stage. Underneath the ''orchestra'' was an underground corridor, connecting two rooms.

Unique to Hellenistic theatres was the type of seats of the auditorium, the ''[[cavea]]''; The semicircular rows of seats were covered with 50 by 50 by 7 centimeters of mud bricks, the seats were a half brick width high. Before the beginning of the Roman period, the seats were covered with marble. The current form of the theater is the result of a modern reconstruction on the antique foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diazoma.gr/en/theaters/hellenistic-theatre-of-ancient-dion/|title=The Hellenistic theater of the ancient Dion (Description)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seats in the spectator area are now covered with wooden boards.

The gable of the theater building was adorned with a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[entablature]]; the roof was covered with tiles in the Laconic style.

==History==
[[File:Hellenistisches Theater Dion.jpg|thumb|The Hellenistic theatre of Dion]]
[[Archelaus I of Macedon|King Archelaos]] held a nine-day festival in honor of the nine [[Muses|Pieric Muses]], which also included theatre competitions. He invited [[Euripides]] to Dion, who wrote the plays of Archelaos and the [[Bacchae]]. Both plays were probably also performed in Dion.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus XVII,16, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The current theatre was built during the [[Hellenistic period]], presumably during the reign of King [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]]. An earlier theatre occupied the same site, presumably destroyed during the assault of the [[Aetolian League]], around 220 BC. Philip V immediately rebuilt the city of Dion, the shrines and the theatre. Within the structure was found a large quantity of coins depicting Philip V. In [[Roman Greece|Roman times]] (from 168 BC) were removed useful building materials of the theatre and built a Roman theater near the sanctuary of [[Zeus]].

After completion of renovation work, the theatre has been regularly hosting performances of the Olympus Festival since 1991.

==Excavation history==
The theatre was discovered in 1806 by the English explorer [[William Martin Leake|William M. Leake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/9861441/Dion_1_The_Fortification_Abstract_|title=Theodosia Stefanidou-Tiveriou, Excavations at Dion (Anaskafi Diou), 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 the find was confirmed by the French archaeologist [[Léon Heuzey]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Heuzey et H. Daumet, Mission Archeologique de Macedoine (1876)&lt;/ref&gt; The first test excavations were carried out in 1970 under the direction of Professor G. Bakalakis. The regular excavation work began in 1973 under the direction of Professor [[Dimitrios Pandermalis|Pandermalis]]. After the works rested for two years, they were resumed in 1977 by the architect and archaeologist Professor G. Karadedos. Since the building in the Roman period, was not paid any further attention, its basic structure remained unchanged. The excavations were carried out very carefully; thus, valuable information was obtained to allow conclusions about the original condition of the complex. The orchestra, the stage, the drainage, parts of the theater building and the main part of the Cavea were found. After the excavations were completed in 1988, Karadedos implemented a study for the “Conservation, Promotion and Temporary Re-operation of the Hellenistic Theatre of Dion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diazoma.gr/en/theaters/hellenistic-theatre-of-ancient-dion/|title=The Hellenistic theater of the ancient Dion (Scientific Bulletin)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Le Maire''' (c. 1585, [[Antwerp]] or [[Amsterdam]] - 22 December 1616, at sea) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] mariner who circumnavigated the earth in 1615 and 1616. The strait between [[Tierra del Fuego]] and [[Staten Island, Argentina|Isla de los Estados]] was named the [[Le Maire Strait]] in his honor, though not without controversy. It was Le Maire himself who proposed to the council aboard ''Eendracht'' that the new passage should be called by his name and the council unanimously agreed with Le Maire. The author or authors of ''The Relation''&lt;ref&gt;''The Relation of a Wonderfull Voiage made by Willem Cornelison Schouten of Horne. Shewing how South from the Straights of Magelan in Terra Delfuego: he found and discovered a newe passage through the great South Seaes, and that way sayled round about the world''.  London: Imprinted by T.D. for Nathanaell Newbery, 1619 [Facsimile of the first edition in English. London: George Rainbird Limited for The World Publishing Company, Cleveland, Ohio, 1966].  “Translation thereof out of the Dutch, wherein it was written” by William Philip&lt;/ref&gt; took ''Eendracht'' captain Schouten’s side by proclaiming:
:“ ... our men had each of them three cups of wine in signe of ioy for our good hap ... [and the naming of] the ''Straights of Le Maire'', although by good right it should rather have been called ''Willem Schouten Straight'', after our Masters Name, by whose wise conduction and skill in sayling, the same was found.”.&lt;ref&gt;''THE RELATION'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eendracht'' then rounded [[Cape Horn]], proving that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was not a continent.

==Biography==
Jacob Le Maire was one of 22 children of Maria Walraven of  Antwerp and [[Isaac Le Maire]] (1558–1624) of [[Tournai]], who was then already a prosperous merchant in Antwerp. Isaac and Maria married shortly before the Spanish siege of Antwerp in 1585 after which they fled to settle in [[Amsterdam]]. Jacob is thought to have been the oldest son, born perhaps the same year. Isaac was very successful in Amsterdam, and became one of the founders of the [[Dutch East Indies Company]] (VOC). However, in 1605 Isaac Le Maire was forced to leave the company after a dispute and for the next decade tried to break the company's monopoly on the trade to the East Indies.

By 1615 Isaac had established a new company (the ''Australian Company'') with the goal to find a new route to the Pacific and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], thereby evading the restrictions of the VOC. He contributed to the outfitting of two ships, the ''Eendracht'' and ''Hoorn'', and put his son Jacob in charge of trading during the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;"chiefe Marchant and principall factor"&lt;/ref&gt; The experienced ship master [[Willem Schouten]] was captain of the ''Eendracht'' and a participant of the enterprise in equal shares with Isaac Le Maire.&lt;ref&gt;''THE RELATION'', The Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 1615 Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten sailed from [[Texel]] in the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. On 29 January 1616 they rounded [[Cape Horn]], which they named for the ''Hoorn'', which was lost in a fire.  The Dutch city of [[Hoorn]] was also the birthplace of Schouten. After failing to moor at the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] in early March, the ships crossed the Pacific in a fairly straight line, visiting several of the [[Tuamotus]]. Between 21 and 24 April 1616 they were the first Westerners to visit the (Northern) [[Tonga]] islands: "Cocos Island" ([[Tafahi]]), "Traitors Island" ([[Niuatoputapu]]), and "Island of Good Hope" ([[Niuafo'ou]]). On 28 April they discovered the [[Hoorn Islands]] ([[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna]] and [[Alofi]]), where they were very well received and stayed until 12 May. They then followed the north coasts of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[New Guinea]] and visited adjacent islands, including, on 24 July, what became known as the [[Schouten Islands]].

They reached the Northern Moluccas in August and finally [[Ternate]], the headquarters of the VOC, on 12 September 1616. Here they were enthusiastically welcomed by [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies|Governor-General]] [[Laurens Reael]], admiral [[Steven Verhagen]], and the governor of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], Jasper Jansz.

The ''Eendracht'' sailed on to [[Java (island)|Java]] and reached  [[Jakarta|Batavia]] on 28 October with a remarkable 84 of the original 87 crew members of both ships on board. Although they had opened an unknown route, [[Jan Pietersz Coen]] of the VOC claimed infringement of its monopoly of trade to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. Le Maire and Schouten were arrested and the ''Eendracht'' was confiscated. After being released, they returned from Batavia to Amsterdam in the company of [[Joris van Spilbergen]], who was on a circumnavigation of the earth himself, be it via the traditional [[Strait of Magellan]].

Le Maire was aboard the ship ''Amsterdam'' on this journey home, but died en route. Van Spilbergen was at his deathbed and took Le Maire's report of his trip, which he included in his book ''Mirror of the East and West Indies''. The rest of the crew arrived in the Netherlands on 1 July 1617, two years and 17 days after they departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Historical Account of the Circumnavigation of the Globe: And of the Progress of Discovery in the Pacific Ocean, from the Voyage of Magellan to the Death of Cook|date=1837|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|pages=100|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=nbkBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob's father Isaac challenged the confiscation and the conclusion of the VOC, but it took him until 1622 until a court ruled in his favor. He was awarded 64,000 pounds and retrieved his son's diaries (which he then published as well), and his company was allowed trade via the newly discovered route. Unfortunately, by then, the [[Dutch West Indies Company]] had claimed the same waters.

There are a number of commonly occurring [[weed]]s or [[Invasive species|invasive plant species]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. These plants typically produce large numbers of [[seed]]s, often excellent at surviving and reproducing in disturbed environments and are commonly the first species to colonise and dominate in these conditions. Weeds may reduce native [[biodiversity]], affect [[agricultural productivity]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[health|human health]] and amenity.

== Common weeds ==
Some of the more common weeds of Queensland are listed below. Weeds that are not yet common or established but pose a significant threat are identified by an asterix. Weeds that are identified as [[Weeds of National Significance]] are noted as "WoNS".

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Mexico]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 40 highest major summits of México by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 40 most prominent summits of México.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 40 most isolated major summits of México.

__TOC__{{clear}}

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the 40 highest major summits of Mexico, three peaks exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, eight peaks exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 28 peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

Of these 40 peaks, five are located in Jalisco, five in Coahuila, four in Oaxaca, six in Puebla, four in the state of Mexico, three in Chiapas, two in Nuevo León, two in Veracruz, two in Michoacán, two in Querétaro, two in Durango, two in Chihuahua, two in San Luis Potosí, and one each in Morelos, Tlaxcala, Distrito Federal, Colima, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Zacatecas, Baja California, Aguascalientes, Sinaloa, and Sonora. Volcán Tacaná lies on the international border between Chiapas and Guatemala, and nine other peaks lie on a state border.

[[Image:oceanic spreading.svg|thumb|250px|right|Oceanic crust is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at trenches.]]

'''Marine geology''' or '''geological oceanography''' is the study of the history and structure of the ocean floor. It involves [[geophysical]], [[geochemistry|geochemical]], [[sedimentology|sedimentological]] and [[paleontological]] investigations of the [[ocean floor]] and [[coastal zone]]. Marine geology has strong ties to [[geophysics]] and to [[physical oceanography]].

Marine geological studies were of extreme importance in providing the critical evidence for [[sea floor spreading]] and [[plate tectonics]] in the years following World War II. The deep ocean floor is the last essentially unexplored frontier and detailed mapping in support of both military (submarine) objectives and economic ([[petroleum]] and [[metal]] [[mining]]) objectives drives the research.

==Overview==
[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|left|A trench forms at the boundary where two tectonic plates meet]]

The [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] around the [[Pacific Ocean]] with its attendant intense [[volcanism]] and [[seismic]] activity poses a major threat for disastrous [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s and volcanic eruptions. Any ''early warning'' systems for these disastrous events will require a more detailed understanding of marine geology of coastal and [[island arc]] environments.

The study of [[littoral]] and deep sea sedimentation and the precipitation and dissolution rates of [[calcium carbonate]] in various marine environments has important implications for global [[climate change]].

The discovery and continued study of [[Mid-oceanic ridge|mid-ocean rift]] zone volcanism and [[hydrothermal vent]]s, first in the [[Red Sea]] and later along the [[East Pacific Rise]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] systems were and continue to be important areas of marine geological research. The [[extremophile]] organisms discovered living within and adjacent to those hydrothermal systems have had a pronounced impact on our understanding of life on Earth and potentially the [[origin of life]] within such an environment.

[[Oceanic trench]]es are hemispheric-scale long but narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor. They also are the deepest parts of the ocean floor.

The [[Mariana Trench]] (or Marianas Trench) is the deepest known submarine trench, and the deepest location in the Earth's crust itself. A [[subduction zone]] where the [[Pacific Plate]] is being subducted under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. The bottom of the trench is further below sea level than [[Mount Everest]] is above sea level.

'''Maris Pacifici''' is more accurately named the ''Descriptio Maris Pacifici'', Description of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was the first dedicated map of the [[Pacific]] to be printed and is considered an important advancement in [[cartography]].

This map was drawn by [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1589, based upon a map of [[United States|America]] from the same year that was drawn by [[Frans Hogenberg]]. Some details of the map may have been influenced by a 1568 description of [[Japan]] in a manuscript by [[Fernão Vaz Dourado|Vaz Dourado]], rather than a map, hence its peculiar shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5847">'''Matthew 3:11''' is the eleventh verse of the third chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. The verse occurs in the section relating the preachings of [[John the Baptist]]. In this verse he predicts that he will be followed by someone much greater than himself. The main theme of this verse is that John will soon be supplanted by a much greater figure and that John's water [[baptism]] is just a preparation for the much greater [[baptism by fire]] and spirit that will occur under the [[Parousia|second coming]] of the Christian [[Christ|messiah Jesus]], an original Christian concept that, according to Jewish scholars, lacks any fundament in the [[torah|Hebrew scripture]].

==Text==
In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:I indeed baptize you with water unto
:repentance. but he that cometh after
:me is mightier than I, whose shoes I
:am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize
:you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:

The [[New International Version]] translates the passage as:
:"I baptize you with water for repentance.
:But after me will come one who is more
:powerful than I, whose sandals I am not
:fit to carry. He will baptize you
:with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=3:11&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 3:11]

==Notes==
This verse links up with the [[Gospel of Mark]] for the first time since [[Matthew 3:6]]. In Mark this verse is mirrored by [[Mark 1:7]] and [[Mark 1:8|8]]. This verse is also found in Luke at [[Luke 3:16]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; However the context is somewhat different in Luke John is addressing a receptive multitude in Matthew it is assumed he is still speaking to the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] introduced in [[Matthew 3:7]]. Schweizer notes that despite this, the verse is still written as though it is addressing all Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Schweizer|Schweizer, Eduard]]. ''The Good News According to Matthew.'' Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew has also entirely skipped the content found in [[Luke 3:10]]-[[Luke 3:14|14]]. This is understandable as the response from the crowd is not in keeping with the hostile and unrepentant Pharisees and Sadducees.

France notes that the word translated as ''after'' is not chronological, rather it means the one who is a follower or disciple. This links in with the reference to [[shoe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;France, R.T. ''The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary.'' Leicester: Inter-Varsity, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the disciple of a Rabbi would be expected to perform menial chores. However shoes, a word perhaps better translated as [[sandal (footwear)|sandal]]s, were considered unclean, a tradition that persists in the Middle East today. Thus the disciple would not deal with them, and such a task would be left to the lowest slave. Thus John the Baptist is presenting himself as very lowly indeed. Matthew slightly differs from the wording found in Luke and Mark. In those two gospels John is not worthy of untying the messiah's sandals, in Matthew he is unworthy of carrying them.

John predicts a much stronger form of baptism by the Holy Spirit and by fire. It is from this verse that the expression "[[baptism by fire]]" comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Howard W. ''The Gospel of Matthew and its Readers: A Historical Introduction to the&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes for many years scholars felt that linking the [[Holy Spirit]] with fire, a symbol of God's wrath, clashed with the portrayal of the Spirit elsewhere in the New Testament, which saw it as a purely loving and helpful force incompatible with a destructive judgement. A number of theories were proposed to address this, some translations dropped the word fire to create a less destructive image. Another option is that ''Holy Spirit'' should actually read ''wind'', as the same word can be used for wind and spirit in Greek. This would also link it to the next verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Schnackenburg|Schnackenburg, Rudolf]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2002 pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This all changed with the discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] found at [[Qumran]], near where John the Baptist was said to be preaching. In a number of the texts the Holy Spirit is linked to God's wrath and judgement leading most scholars to include that the wording here is original and that there were different views of the Holy Spirit circulating in the first century.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, David. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Nolland notes that many scholars have attempted to use this verse as evidence for the Christian baptism ritual, but he does not believe that Jesus' baptism by fire and holy spirit can be so linked.&lt;ref&gt;Nolland, John. ''The Gospel of Matthew: a commentary on the Greek text.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2005 pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the more powerful one coming after is a reference to God or Jesus is a matter of debate. After this verse Jesus immediately enters the narrative, and the corporeal metaphor of carrying his shoes would seem to describe a human figure. On the other hand, this violent imagery contradicts the idea of the Messiah as a bringer of peace. Schnackenburg argues the wording in this passage is deliberately obscure between the two options.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Schnackenburg|Schnackenburg, Rudolf]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2002 pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

===Relative species abundance===
[[File:Hollow curve beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''. Relative species abundance of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing the universal "hollow curve". (derived from data presented in Magurran (2004)&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; and collected by [[C.B. Williams]] (1964)&lt;ref name=Williams64&gt;Williams, C.B. 1964. ''Patterns in the balance of nature and related problems in quantitative ecology''. Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
Relative species abundance and species richness describe key elements of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Relative species abundance refers to how common or rare a species is relative to other species in a given location or community.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=McGill&gt;McGill, B. J., Etienne R. S., Gray J. S., Alonso D., Anderson M. J., Benecha H. K., Dornelas M., Enquist B. J., Green J. L., He F., Hurlbert A. H., Magurran A. E., Marquet P. A., Maurer B. A., Ostling A., Soykan C. U., Ugland K. I., White E. P. 2007. "Species abundance distributions: moving beyond single prediction theories to integration within an ecological framework". ''Ecology Letters'' 10: 995–1015&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually relative species abundances are described for a single [[trophic level]]. Because such species occupy the same [[trophic level]] they will potentially or actually compete for similar resources.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; For example, relative species abundances might describe all terrestrial birds in a forest community or all [[planktonic]] [[copepods]] in a particular marine environment.

Relative species abundances follow very similar patterns over a wide range of ecological communities. When plotted as a histogram of the number of species represented by 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals usually fit a hollow curve, such that most species are rare, (represented by a single individual in a community sample) and relatively few species are abundant (represented by a large number of individuals in a community sample)(Figure 1).&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt; This pattern has been long-recognized and can be broadly summarized with the statement that "most species are rare".&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H. G.; Birch L. C. 1954. ''The Distribution and Abundance of Animals''. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Charles Darwin]] noted in 1859 in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' that "... rarity is the attribute of vast numbers of species in all classes...."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 2004 (1859). ''The Origin of Species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. Castle Books, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Species abundance patterns can be best visualized in the form of relative abundance distribution plots. The consistency of relative species abundance patterns suggests that some common macroecological "rule" or process determines the distribution of individuals among species within a trophic level.

===Distribution plots===
[[File:PrestonPlot beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. ''Preston plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a strong right-skew.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
[[File:Rank abundance beetles.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Whittaker plot'' of beetles sampled from the river Thames showing a slight "s"-shape.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;]]
Relative species abundance distributions are usually graphed as frequency histograms ("Preston plots"; Figure 2)&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite journal | author = Preston, F. W. | year = 1948 | title = The Commonness, and Rarity, of Species | journal = Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–283 | url = http://www.bgu.ac.il/desert_agriculture/Vegecology/Papers/Preston48.pdf | doi = 10.2307/1930989}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[rank abundance curve|rank-abundance diagrams]] ("Whittaker Plots"; Figure 3).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1965. "Dominance and diversity in land plant communities", ''Science'' 147: 250–260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frequency histogram (Preston plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': logarithm of abundance bins (historically log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a rough approximation to the natural logarithm)

::'''''y''-axis''': number of species at given abundance

'''Rank-abundance diagram (Whittaker plot)''':

::'''''x''-axis''': species list, ranked in order of descending abundance (i.e. from common to rare)

::'''''y''-axis''': logarithm of % relative abundance

When plotted in these ways, relative species abundances from wildly different data sets show similar patterns: frequency histograms tend to be right-skewed (e.g. Figure 2) and rank-abundance diagrams tend to conform to the curves illustrated in Figure 4.

==Understanding relative species abundance patterns==
Researchers attempting to understand relative species abundance patterns usually approach them in a descriptive or mechanistic way. Using a descriptive approach biologists attempt to fit a mathematical model to real data sets and infer the underlying biological principles at work from the model parameters. By contrast, mechanistic approaches create a mathematical model based on biological principles and then test how well these models fit real data sets.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1999. ''Species coexistence: ecological and evolutionary perspectives''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive approaches===

====Geometric series (Motomura 1932)====
[[File:Common descriptiveWhittaker.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. Generic Rank-abundance diagram of three common mathematical models used to fit species abundance distributions: Motomura's geometric series, Fisher's logseries, and Preston's log-normal series (modified from Magurran 1988)&lt;ref name=Magurran88&gt;Magurran, A. E. 1988. ''Ecological Diversity and Its Measurement''. Princeton Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Succession.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Plant succession in abandoned fields within Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY. Species abundances conform to the geometric series during early succession but approach lognormal as the community ages. (modified from Whittaker 1972&lt;ref name=Whittaker72&gt;Whittaker, R. H. 1972. "Evolution and measurement of species diversity". ''Taxon'' 21:213&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt;)]]
I. Motomura developed the geometric series model based on benthic community data in a lake.&lt;ref name=Motomura&gt;Motomura, I. 1932. "A statistical treatment of associations", ''Japanese Journal of Zoology''. 44: 379–383 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the geometric series each species' level of abundance is a sequential, constant proportion (''k'') of the total number of individuals in the community. Thus if ''k'' is 0.5, the most common species would represent half of individuals in the community (50%), the second most common species would represent half of the remaining half (25%), the third, half of the remaining quarter (12.5%) and so forth.

Although Motomura originally developed the model as a statistical (descriptive) means to plot observed abundances, the "discovery" of his paper by Western researchers in 1965 led to the model being used as a [[niche apportionment models|niche apportionment model]] &amp;ndash; the "niche-preemption model".&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt; In a mechanistic model ''k'' represents the proportion of the resource base acquired by a given species.

The geometric series rank-abundance diagram is linear with a slope of –''k'', and reflects a rapid decrease in species abundances by rank (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Motomura/&gt; The geometric series does not explicitly assume that species colonize an area sequentially, however, the model fits the concept of niche preemption, where species sequentially colonize a region and the first species to arrive receives the majority of resources.&lt;ref name=He_Tang&gt;He , F., Tang D. 2008. "Estimating the niche preemption parameter of the geometric series" ''Acta Oecologica'' 33 (1):105&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt; The geometric series model fits observed species abundances in highly uneven communities with low diversity.&lt;ref name=He_Tang/&gt; This is expected to occur in terrestrial plant communities (as these assemblages often show strong dominance) as well as communities at early successional stages and those in harsh or isolated environments (Figure 5).&lt;ref name=Whittaker65/&gt;

====Logseries (Fisher ''et al'' 1943)====

: &lt;math&gt;S=\alpha\ln{\left(1+{N\over{\alpha\,\!}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

''where'':

:''S'' = the number of species in the sampled community

:''N'' = the number of individuals sampled

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = a constant derived from the sample data set

The logseries was developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to fit two different abundance data sets: British moth species (collected by [[Carrington Bonsor Williams|Carrington Williams]]) and Malaya butterflies (collected by [[Alexander Steven Corbet]]).&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal&gt;Fisher, R. A; Corbet, A. S.; Williams, C. B. 1943. "The relation between the number of species and the number of individuals in a random sample of an animal population". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 12: 42&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The logic behind the derivation of the logseries is varied&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. L.; Adrienne, W. K.; Kotz, S. (2005). ''Univariate and Discrete Distributions'', 3rd edn. John Wiley and Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; however Fisher proposed that sampled species abundances would follow a negative binomial from which the zero abundance class (species too rare to be sampled) was eliminated.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; He also assumed that the total number of species in a community was infinite. Together, this produced the [[logarithmic series distribution|logseries distribution]] (Figure 4). The logseries predicts the number of species at different levels of abundance (''n'' individuals) with the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;S_n= {\alpha\,\!x^n \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:S = the number of species with an abundance of ''n''

:''x''&amp;nbsp;= a positive constant (0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1) which is derived from the sample data set and generally approaches 1 in value

The number of species with 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'' individuals are therefore:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha, {\alpha\,\!x^2\over{2}}, {\alpha\,\!x^3\over{3}}, \dots, {\alpha\,\!x^n\over{n}} &lt;/math&gt;

=====Fisher’s constants=====
[[File:R. A. Fischer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ronald Fisher]]
The constants ''α'' and ''x'' can be estimated through iteration from a given species data set using the values ''S'' and ''N''.&lt;ref name=Magurran04&gt;Magurran, A. E. 2004. ''Measuring biological diversity''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher's [[dimensionless]] ''α'' is often used as a measure of biodiversity, and indeed has recently been found to represent the fundamental biodiversity parameter ''θ'' from neutral theory ([[Relative species abundance#Fisher.E2.80.99s alpha and Hubbell.E2.80.99s theta .E2.80.93 an interesting convergence|see below]]).

====Log normal (Preston 1948)====
[[File:Prestonsveil copy.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. An example of Preston's veil. Fish species abundances sampled using repeated trawling over a one-month (blue bars), two month (gold bars) and one-year period (yellow). One year of sampling indicates that the fish community is log-normally distributed. (derived from Magurran 2004&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;)]]
Using several data sets (including breeding bird surveys from New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) [[Frank W. Preston]] (1948) argued that species abundances (when binned logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a [[Gaussian function|Normal (Gaussian) distribution]], partly as a result of the [[Central Limit Theorem]] (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; This means that the abundance distribution is [[Lognormal]]. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher ''et al.'' (1943)&lt;ref name=Fisher_etal/&gt;) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the ''x''-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt; The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed ''Preston's veil line''. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magurran88/&gt;(Figure 6).  Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams64/&gt;

=====Calculating theoretical species richness=====
Preston's theory has an application: if a community is truly lognormal yet under-sampled, the lognormal distribution can be used to estimate the true species richness of a community. Assuming the shape of the total distribution can be confidently predicted from the collected data, the normal curve can be fit via statistical software or by completing the [[Gaussian function|Gaussian formula]]:&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n = n_0 e^{-(aR)^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

''where:''

:''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of species in the modal bin (the peak of the curve)
 
:''n'' is the number of species in bins ''R'' distant from the modal bin

:''a'' is a constant derived from the data

It is then possible to predict how many species are in the community by calculating the total area under the curve&amp;nbsp;(''N''):

: &lt;math&gt;N= {n_0\sqrt{\pi}\over a}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of species missing from the data set (the missing area to the left of the veil line) is simply ''N'' minus the number of species sampled.&lt;ref name=Magurran04/&gt; Preston did this for two lepidopteran data sets, predicting that, even after 22 years of collection, only 72% and 88% of the species present had been sampled.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

====Yule model (Nee 2003) ====
The Yule model is based on a much earlier, [[Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process|Galton&amp;ndash;Watson model]] which was used to describe the distribution of species among [[genera]].&lt;ref&gt;Yule, G. U. 1924. "A mathematical theory of evolution based on the conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, FRS". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B'' 213: 21–87&lt;/ref&gt; The Yule model assumes random branching of species trees, with each species (branch tip) having the equivalent probability of giving rise to new species or becoming extinct. As the number of species within a genus, within a clade, has a similar distribution to the number of individuals within a species, within a community (i.e. the "hollow curve"), Sean Nee (2003) used the model to describe relative species abundances.&lt;ref name=McGill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nee&gt;Nee, S. 2003. "The unified phenomenological theory of biodiversity". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways this model is similar to [[niche apportionment models]], however, Nee intentionally did not propose a biological mechanism for the model behavior, arguing that any distribution can be produced by a variety of mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Nee/&gt;

===Mechanistic approaches: niche apportionment===
''Note'': This section provides a general summary of niche apportionment theory, more information can be found under [[niche apportionment models]].

Most mechanistic approaches to species abundance distributions use niche-space, i.e. available resources, as the mechanism driving abundances. If species in the same [[trophic level]] consume the same resources (such as nutrients or sunlight in plant communities, prey in carnivore communities, nesting locations or food in bird communities) and these resources are limited, how the resource "pie" is divided among species determines how many individuals of each species can exist in the community. Species with access to lots of resources will have higher carrying capacities than those with little access. Mutsunori Tokeshi&lt;ref&gt;Tokeshi, M. 1990. "Niche apportionment or random assortment: species abundance patterns revisited". ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 59: 1129&amp;ndash;1146&lt;/ref&gt; later elaborated niche apportionment theory to include niche filling in unexploited resource space.&lt;ref name=Tokeshi99/&gt; Thus, a species may survive in the community by carving out a portion of another species' niche (slicing up the pie into smaller pieces) or by moving into a vacant niche (essentially making the pie larger, for example, by being the first to arrive in a newly available location or through the development of a novel trait that allows access previously unavailable resources). Numerous [[niche apportionment models]] have been developed. Each make different assumptions about how species carve up niche-space.

====Unified neutral theory (Hubbell 1979/2001)====
{{main|Unified neutral theory of biodiversity}}

The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) is a special form of mechanistic model that takes an entirely different approach to community composition than the niche apportionment models.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt; Instead of species populations reaching equilibrium within a community, the UNTB model is dynamic, allowing for continuing changes in relative species abundances through drift.

A community in the UNTB model can be best visualized as a grid with a certain number of spaces, each occupied with individuals of different species.  The model is [[zero-sum]] as there are a limited number of spaces that can be occupied: an increase in the number of individuals of one species in the grid must result in corresponding decrease in the number of individuals of other species in the grid. The model then uses birth, death, immigration, extinction and speciation to modify community composition over time.

;Hubbell's theta

The UNTB model produces a dimensionless "fundamental biodiversity" number,&amp;nbsp;''θ'', which is derived using the formula:

: ''θ'' = 2''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;''v''

''where'':

: ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the size of the metacommunity (the outside source of immigrants to the local community)

:''v'' is the speciation rate in the model

Relative species abundances in the UNTB model follow a zero-sum multinomial distribution.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake&gt;Hubbell, S. P.; Lake J. 2003. "The neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity: and beyond". In T. Blackburn and K. Gaston, editors, ''Macroecology: concepts and consequences''. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of this distribution is a function of the immigration rate, the size of the sampled community (grid), and&amp;nbsp;''θ''.&lt;ref name=Hubbell_Lake/&gt; When the value of ''θ'' is small, the relative species abundance distribution is similar to the geometric series (high dominance). As ''θ'' gets larger, the distribution becomes increasingly s-shaped (log-normal) and, as it approaches infinity, the curve becomes flat (the community has infinite diversity and species abundances of one). Finally, when ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the community described consists of only one species (extreme dominance).&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

===== Fisher's alpha and Hubbell's theta – an interesting convergence=====

An unexpected result of the UNTB is that at very large sample sizes, predicted relative species abundance curves describe the [[metacommunity]] and become identical to Fisher's logseries. At this point ''θ'' also becomes identical to Fisher's &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for the equivalent distribution and Fisher's constant ''x'' is equal to the ratio of birthrate : deathrate. Thus, the UNTB unintentionally offers a mechanistic explanation of the logseries 50 years after Fisher first developed his descriptive model.&lt;ref name=Hubbell01/&gt;

[[File:Riparian strip.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved natural riparian strip on a tributary to [[Lake Erie]]]]

A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. '''Riparian''' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial [[biome]]s of the Earth. Plant habitats and communities along the river margins and [[Bank (geography)|banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plant|hydrophilic plants]]. Riparian zones are important in [[ecology]], [[environmental resource management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their habitat [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, or even non-vegetative areas.  In some regions the terms '''riparian woodland''', '''[[riparian forest]]''', '''[[riparian buffer]] zone,''' '''riparian corridor''' and '''riparian strip''' are used to characterize a riparian zone. The word ''riparian'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:ripa|ripa]]'', meaning river bank.

==Characteristics==
Riparian zones may be natural or engineered for soil stabilization or [[Land rehabilitation|restoration]]. These zones are important natural [[biofilter]]s, protecting aquatic environments from excessive [[sediment]]ation, polluted [[surface runoff]] and [[erosion]]. They supply shelter and food for many [[aquatic animal]]s and shade that limits stream temperature change. When riparian zones are damaged by [[construction]], [[agriculture]] or [[silviculture]], biological restoration can take place, usually by human intervention in [[erosion control]] and revegetation. If the area adjacent to a watercourse has standing water or saturated soil for as long as a season, it is normally termed a [[wetland]] because of its [[hydric soil]] characteristics. Because of their prominent role in supporting a [[biodiversity|diversity of species]], riparian zones are often the subject of national protection in a [[biodiversity action plan]]. These are also known as a "Plant or Vegetation Waste Buffer".

Research shows that riparian zones are instrumental in [[water quality]] improvement for both surface runoff and water flowing into streams through subsurface or [[groundwater]] flow. Riparian zones can play a role in lowering nitrate contamination in surface runoff, such as manure and other [[fertilizer]]s from [[Field (agriculture)|agricultural fields]], that would otherwise damage [[ecosystem]]s and human health. Particularly, the attenuation of [[nitrate]] or [[denitrification]] of the nitrates from [[fertilizer]] in this buffer zone is important. The use of wetland riparian zones shows a particularly high rate of removal of nitrate entering a stream and thus has a place in agricultural management.

==Roles and functions==
[[File:Pisuerga2.JPG|thumb|right|Thick riparian vegetation along the [[Pisuerga|Pisuerga River]] in [[Spain]]]]
Riparian zones dissipate stream energy. The [[meander]]ing curves of a river, combined with vegetation and root systems, slow the flow of water, which reduces soil erosion and flood damage. Sediment is trapped, reducing suspended solids to create less [[turbidity|turbid]] water, replenish soils, and build stream banks. Pollutants are filtered from surface runoff, enhancing water quality via biofiltration.

The riparian zones also provide [[wildlife]] [[habitat]], increased biodiversity, and [[wildlife corridor]]s, enabling aquatic and riparian organisms to move along river systems avoiding isolated communities. Riparian vegetation can also provide [[Fodder|forage]] for wildlife and livestock.

Riparian zones are also important for the fish that live within rivers, such as brook and charr. Impacts to riparian zones can affect fish, and restoration is not always sufficient to recover fish populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Hale |first2=Robin |last3=Morrongiello |first3=John R. |title=Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management |journal=Freshwater Biology |date=March 2017 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=445–457 |doi=10.1111/fwb.12888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide native [[landscape]] irrigation by extending seasonal or perennial flows of water. Nutrients from terrestrial vegetation (e.g. [[plant litter]] and insect drop) are transferred to aquatic food webs. The vegetation surrounding the stream helps to shade the water, mitigating [[thermal pollution|water temperature changes]].  The vegetation also contributes wood debris to streams, which is important to maintaining [[geomorphology]].

From a social aspect, riparian zones contribute to nearby property values through amenity and views, and they improve enjoyment for footpaths and bikeways through supporting [[Greenway (landscape)#Foreshoreway|foreshoreway]] networks. Space is created for riparian sports such as fishing, swimming and launching for vessels and paddlecraft.

The riparian zone acts as a sacrificial erosion buffer to absorb impacts of factors including [[climate change]], increased runoff from [[urbanization]] and increased [[Wake#Wake pattern of a boat|boat wake]] without damaging structures located behind a setback zone.

==Role in logging==
The protection of riparian zones is often a consideration in [[logging]] operations.  The undisturbed soil, soil cover, and vegetation provide shade, plant litter, and woody material, and reduce the delivery of [[soil erosion|soil eroded]] from the harvested area. Factors such as soil types and [[root]] structures, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and vegetative cover determine the effectiveness of riparian buffering.

==Vegetation==
[[File:Willow Creek, Trout Creek Mountains, Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Riparian zone along Trout Creek in the [[Trout Creek Mountains]], part of the Burns Bureau of Land Management District in southeastern [[Oregon]]. The creek provides critical habitat for [[trout]].]]

The assortment of riparian zone trees varies from those of wetlands and typically consists of plants that are either emergent aquatic plants, or [[herb]]s, [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s that thrive in proximity to water.

==Repair and restoration==
Land clearing followed by floods can quickly erode a riverbank, taking valuable grasses and soils downstream, and later allowing the sun to bake the land dry. [[Natural Sequence Farming]] techniques have been used in the [[Upper Hunter Shire|Upper Hunter]] Valley of [[New South Wales]], Australia, in an attempt to rapidly restore eroded farms to optimum productivity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Natural Sequence Farming technique involves placing obstacles in the water's pathway to lessen the energy of a flood, and help the water to deposit soil and [[Seep (hydrology) |seep]] into the flood zone. Another technique is to quickly establish [[ecological succession]] by encouraging fast-growing plants such as "weeds" ([[pioneer species]]) to grow. These may spread along the watercourse and cause environmental degradation, but may stabilize the soil, place carbon into the ground, and protect the land from drying. The weeds will improve the streambeds so that trees and grasses can return, and later ideally replace the weeds. There are several other techniques used by government and non-government agencies to address riparian and streambed degradation, ranging from the installation of bed control structures such as log sills to the use of pin groynes or rock emplacement.

'''Samandere Waterfall''' ({{lang-tr|Samandere Şelalesi}}) is a [[waterfall]] in [[Düzce Province]], northwestern Turkey. It is the first ever registered [[natural monument]] of the country.

==Location and access==
The waterfall is located in Samandere village of [[Beyköy, Düzce|Beyköy]] district, {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Düzce]]. It is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from Beyköy, {{convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state highway {{TUR-D|100}} and {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the motorway {{TUR-O|4}}.&lt;ref name="dktm"/&gt; The road to the waterfall on a length of {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} was widened and asphalted for easy access in 2015.&lt;ref name="h4"/&gt;

In 2016, the municipality of Düzce launched free-of-charge transportation by bus to the waterfall from the city center on daily basis during the summer months.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

==Waterfall==
The waterfall is on a tributary of Uğur Creek, which flows into Lake  Efteni. There is a cave in upstream of the waters forming the waterfall, which submerge and outcrop there. The area consists of monumental trees along the {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}-long stream, three waterfalls and a deep canyon called "Cadı Kazanı" (literally: Witches Cauldron).&lt;ref name="dktm"/&gt; The site is a popular visitor attraction,&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; which offers [[campsite]]s, [[picnic|picnicing]] areas and [[hiking]] trails for [[outdoor recreation]].&lt;ref name="dktm"/&gt; The waterfall site features a [[footbridge]] and [[observation deck]]s with railing.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; 

On December 10, 1988, the waterfall and its surroundings covering an area of {{convert|109.96|da|sqft|abbr=on}}, was registered by the Nature Reserve and Nature Parks Administration of the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]] as the first ever natural monument of the country.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dosim"/&gt; The natural monument is run by the Municipality of Düzce according to a protocol signed later by the parts.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt;

The waterfall sustained great damage following a flood disaster occurred on July 16-17, 2009. It was restored after maintenance works in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref name="dosim"/&gt;

'''Scintillation''' is a flash of [[light]] produced in a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material by the passage of a particle (an [[electron]], an [[alpha particle]], an [[ion]], or a high-energy [[photon]]). See [[scintillator]] and [[scintillation counter]] for practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birks|first=John B.|title=The theory and practice of scintillation counting|year=1964|publisher=Pergamon Press, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knoll|first=Glenn F.|title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-07338-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The process of scintillation is one of [[luminescence]] whereby light of a characteristic spectrum is emitted following the absorption of [[radiation]].  The emitted radiation is usually less energetic than that absorbed.  Scintillation is an inherent molecular property in [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] and [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] organic molecules and arises from their electronic structures.   Scintillation also occurs in many inorganic materials, including salts, gases, and liquids.

==Scintillation of inorganic crystals==
{{detail|Scintillation_counter#Detection_materials}}
For photons such as gamma rays, thallium activated [[NaI]] crystals (NaI(Tl)) are often used. For a faster response (but only 5% of the output) [[CsF]] crystals can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Introductory Nuclear Physics. Krane. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211}}

==Scintillation of organic scintillators==
[[File:Pistates.svg|thumb|350px|right|π-electronic energy levels of an organic molecule. S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ground state. S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are excited singlet states. T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are excited triplet states. S&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; etc. are vibrational sublevels.]]

In organic molecules scintillation is a product of [[pi bond|π-orbitals]].  Organic materials form molecular crystals where the molecules are loosely bound by [[Van der Waals force]]s.  The ground state of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  In valence bond theory, when carbon forms compounds, one of the 2s electrons is excited into the 2p state resulting in a configuration of 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  To describe the different valencies of carbon, the four valence electron orbitals, one 2s and three 2p, are considered to be mixed or hybridized in several alternative configurations.  For example, in a tetrahedral configuration the s and p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals combine to produce four hybrid orbitals.   In another configuration, known as trigonal configuration, one of the p-orbitals (say p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) remains unchanged and three hybrid orbitals are produced by mixing the s, p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals.  The orbitals that are symmetrical about the bonding axes and plane of the molecule (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are known as σ-electrons and the bonds are called σ-bonds.  The p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is called a π-orbital.  A π-bond occurs when two π-orbitals interact.  This occurs when their nodal planes are coplanar.

In certain organic molecules π-orbitals interact to produce a common nodal plane.  These form delocalized π-electrons that can be excited by radiation.  The de-excitation of the delocalized π-electrons results in luminescence.

The excited states of π-electron systems can be explained by the perimeter free-electron model (Platt 1949).  This model is used for describing polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of condensed systems of benzenoid rings in which no C atom belongs to more than two rings and every C atom is on the periphery.

The ring can be approximated as a circle with circumference l.  The wave-function of the electron orbital must satisfy the condition of a plane rotator:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\psi(x+l) \,&lt;/math&gt; 

The corresponding solutions to the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]] are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \psi_0    &amp;= \left( \frac{1}{l} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
 \psi_{q1} &amp;= \left( \frac{2}{l} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos{\left( \frac{2\pi\ qx}{l} \right)} \\
 \psi_{q2} &amp;= \left( \frac{2}{l} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \sin{\left( \frac{2\pi\ qx}{l} \right)} \\
 E_q       &amp;= \frac{q^2\hbar^2}{2m_0l^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where q is the orbital ring quantum number; the number of nodes of the wave-function.  Since the electron can have spin up and spin down and can rotate about the circle in both directions all of the energy levels except the lowest are doubly degenerate.

The above shows the π-electronic energy levels of an organic molecule.  Absorption of radiation is followed by molecular vibration to the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state.  This is followed by a de-excitation to the S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; state called fluorescence.  The population of triplet states is also possible by other means.  The triplet states decay with a much longer decay time than singlet states, which results in what is called the slow component of the decay process (the fluorescence process is called the fast component). Depending on the particular energy loss of a certain particle (dE/dx), the "fast" and "slow" states are occupied in different proportions. The relative intensities in the light output of these states thus differs for different dE/dx. This property of scintillators allows for pulse shape discrimination: it is possible to identify which particle was detected by looking at the pulse shape. Of course, the difference in shape is visible in the trailing side of the pulse, since it is due to the decay of the excited states.

{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Solar water heating''' ('''SWH''') is the conversion of [[sunlight]] into heat for [[water heating]] using a [[solar thermal collector]]. A variety of configurations are available at varying cost to provide solutions in different climates and latitudes. SWHs are widely used for residential and some industrial applications.&lt;ref name="C. Marken 2009" /&gt;

A sun-facing collector heats a [[working fluid]] that passes into a storage system for later use. SWH are active (pumped) and passive ([[Natural convection|convection]]-driven). They use water only, or both water and a working fluid. They are heated directly or via light-concentrating mirrors. They operate independently or as hybrids with electric or gas heaters.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869-8778&lt;/ref&gt; In large-scale installations, mirrors may concentrate sunlight into a smaller collector.

The global solar thermal market is dominated by China, Europe, Japan and [[Solar power in India|India]], although Israel was one of the first countries to mandate installation of SWH in 1980, leading to a flourishing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Wei|last2=Rubin|first2=Tzameret H.|last3=Onyina|first3=Paul A.|date=2013-05-01|title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations|journal=Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=160–170|doi=10.1002/sd.1547|issn=1099-1719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 Clarence Kemp of Baltimore enclosed a tank in a wooden box, thus creating the first 'batch water heater' as they are known today. [[Frank Shuman]] built the world’s first solar thermal power station in [[Maadi, Egypt]], using parabolic troughs to power a 60-70 horsepower engine that pumped 6,000 gallons of water per minute from the [[Nile|Nile River]] to adjacent cotton fields.

Flat-plate collectors for solar water heating were used in Florida and Southern California in the 1920s. Interest grew in North America after 1960, but especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]].

Solar water heating systems are popular in China, where basic models start at around 1,500 [[Renminbi|yuan]] (US$235), around 80% less than in Western countries for a given collector size. At least 30 million Chinese households have one. The popularity is due to efficient evacuated tubes that allow the heaters to function even under gray skies and at temperatures well below freezing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm?newsid=36636 Energy-Hungry China Warms to Solar Water Heaters] discusses [[China Himin Solar Energy Group]] in [[Dezhou]]. Reuters article, posted on [[Planet Ark]] site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design requirements==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}

The type, complexity and size of a solar water heating system is mostly determined by:

* Changes in ambient temperature and solar radiation between summer and winter
* Changes in ambient temperature during the day-night cycle
* Possibility of the potable water or collector fluid overheating or freezing

The minimum requirements of the system are typically determined by the amount or temperature of hot water required during winter, when a system's output and incoming water temperature are typically at their lowest. The maximum output of the system is determined by the need to prevent the water in the system from becoming too hot.

===Freeze protection===

Freeze protection measures prevent damage to the system due to the expansion of freezing transfer fluid. Drainback systems drain the transfer fluid from the system when the pump stops. Many indirect systems use [[antifreeze]] (e.g., [[propylene glycol]]) in the heat transfer fluid.

In some direct systems, collectors can be manually drained when freezing is expected. This approach is common in climates where freezing temperatures do not occur often, but can be less reliable than an automatic system as it relies on an operator.

A third type of freeze protection is freeze-tolerance, where low pressure water pipes made of silicone rubber simply expand on freezing. One such collector now has European Solar Keymark accreditation.

===Overheat protection===

When no hot water has been used for a day or two, the fluid in the collectors and storage can reach high temperatures in all non-drainback systems. When the storage tank in a drainback system reaches its desired temperature, the pumps stop, ending the heating process and thus preventing the storage tank from overheating.

Some active systems deliberately cool the water in the storage tank by circulating hot water through the collector at times when there is little sunlight or at night, losing heat. This is most effective in direct or thermal store plumbing and is virtually ineffective in systems that use evacuated tube collectors, due to their superior insulation. Any collector type may still overheat. High pressure, sealed solar thermal systems ultimately rely on the operation of [[Safety valve#Water heaters|temperature and pressure relief valves]]. Low pressure, open vented heaters have simpler, more reliable safety controls, typically an open vent.

==Systems==
Simple designs include a simple glass-topped insulated box with a flat solar absorber made of sheet metal, attached to [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper heat exchanger pipes]] and dark-colored, or a set of metal tubes surrounded by an evacuated (near vacuum) glass cylinder. In industrial cases a [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] can concentrate sunlight on the tube. Heat is stored in a [[hot water storage tank]]. The volume of this tank needs to be larger with solar heating systems to compensate for bad weather{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} and because the optimum final temperature for the solar collector{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} is lower than a typical immersion or combustion heater. The heat transfer fluid (HTF) for the absorber may be  water, but more commonly (at least in active systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing [[anti-freeze]] and a [[corrosion inhibitor]] delivers heat to the tank through a [[heat exchanger]] (commonly a coil of [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper heat exchanger tubing]] within the tank). [[Copper in renewable energy#Solar water heaters (solar domestic hot water systems)|Copper is an important component in solar thermal heating and cooling systems]] because of its high heat conductivity, atmospheric and water corrosion resistance, sealing and joining by soldering and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks).&lt;ref&gt;2011 global status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another lower-maintenance concept is the 'drain-back'. No anti-freeze is required; instead, all the piping is sloped to cause water to drain back to the tank. The tank is not pressurized and operates at atmospheric pressure. As soon as the pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty before freezing can occur.

[[File:Solar Hot Water Diagram.png|thumb|How a solar hot water system works]]
Residential solar thermal installations fall into two groups: passive (sometimes called "compact") and active (sometimes called "pumped") systems. Both typically include an auxiliary energy source (electric heating element or connection to a gas or fuel oil central heating system) that is activated when the water in the tank falls below a minimum temperature setting, ensuring that hot water is always available. The combination of solar water heating and back-up heat from a wood stove chimney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodheat.org/heating-water-with-a-wood-stove.html|title=Heating water with a wood stove|date=|publisher=Wood Heat Organization Inc.|last1=Gulland|first1=John|work=woodheat.org|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates, without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar water heating system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.

When a solar water heating and hot-water central heating system are used together, solar heat will either be concentrated in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the [[central heating]], or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for central heating is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric [[concentrating solar thermal]] systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems ([[solar combisystem]]s) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|storage]], large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual heat consumption for [[district heating]].&lt;ref name="drake1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Wong|first=Bill|title=Drake Landing Solar Community|date=June 28, 2011|series=IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto|pages=1–30|contribution=Drake Landing Solar Community|contribution-url=http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ing2015-06-14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/verdens-stoerste-damvarmelager-indviet-i-vojens-176776|title=Verdens største damvarmelager indviet i Vojens|date=14 June 2015|first1=Sanne|last1=Wittrup|work=[[Ingeniøren]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019125824/http://ing.dk/artikel/verdens-stoerste-damvarmelager-indviet-i-vojens-176776|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat transfer===

====Direct====
[[Image:DirectSolarSystems.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4| Direct systems: (A) Passive CHS system with tank above collector. (B) Active system with pump and controller driven by a photovoltaic panel.]]

''Direct'' or ''open loop'' systems circulate potable water through the collectors. They are relatively cheap. Drawbacks include:
* They offer little or no overheat protection unless they have a heat export pump.
* They offer little or no freeze protection, unless the collectors are freeze-tolerant.
* Collectors accumulate [[Fouling|scale]] in hard water areas, unless an ion-exchange softener is used.

The advent of freeze-tolerant designs expanded the market for SWH to colder climates. In freezing conditions, earlier models were damaged when the water turned to ice, rupturing one or more components.

====Indirect====
''Indirect'' or ''closed loop'' systems use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the "heat-transfer fluid" (HTF) fluid to the potable water. The most common HTF is an antifreeze/water mix that typically uses non-toxic [[propylene glycol]]. After heating in the panels, the HTF travels to the heat exchanger, where its heat is transferred to the potable water. Indirect systems offer freeze protection and typically overheat protection.

===Propulsion===

====Passive====

''Passive'' systems rely on heat-driven convection or heat pipes to circulate the working fluid. Passive systems cost less and require low or no maintenance, but are less efficient. Overheating and freezing are major concerns.

====Active====
''Active'' systems use one or more pumps to circulate water and/or heating fluid''.'' This permits a much wider range of system configurations.

Pumped systems are more expensive to purchase and to operate. However, they operate at higher efficiency can be more easily controlled.

Active systems have controllers with features such as interaction with a backup electric or gas-driven water heater, calculation and logging of the energy saved, safety functions, remote access and informative displays.

===Passive direct systems===
[[Image:Batch solar thermal collectorColour.jpg|thumb|An integrated collector storage (ICS) system]]

An ''integrated collector storage'' (ICS or batch heater) system uses a tank that acts as both storage and collector. Batch heaters are thin rectilinear tanks with a glass side facing the sun at [[Solar noon|noon]]. They are simple and less costly than plate and tube collectors, but they may require bracing if installed on a roof (to support {{convert|400|-|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;lbs of water), suffer from significant heat loss at night since the side facing the sun is largely uninsulated and are only suitable in moderate climates.

A ''convection heat storage unit'' (CHS) system is similar to an ICS system, except the storage tank and collector are physically separated and transfer between the two is driven by convection. CHS systems typically use standard flat-plate type or evacuated tube collectors. The storage tank must be located above the collectors for convection to work properly. The main benefit of CHS systems over ICS systems is that heat loss is largely avoided since the storage tank can be fully insulated. Since the panels are located below the storage tank, heat loss does not cause convection, as the cold water stays at the lowest part of the system.

===Active indirect systems===

''Pressurized antifreeze'' systems use a mix of [[antifreeze]] (almost always non-toxic propylene glycol) and water mix for HTF in order to prevent freeze damage.

Though effective at preventing freeze damage, antifreeze systems have drawbacks:
* If the HTF gets too hot the glycol degrades into acid and then provides no freeze protection and begins to dissolve the solar loop's components.
* Systems without drainback tanks must circulate the HTF – regardless of the temperature of the storage tank – to prevent the HTF from degrading. Excessive temperatures in the tank cause increased scale and sediment build-up, possible severe burns if a tempering valve is not installed, and if used for storage, possible thermostat failure.
* The glycol/water HTF must be replaced every 3–8 years, depending on the temperatures it has experienced.
* Some jurisdictions require more-expensive, double-walled heat exchangers even though propylene glycol is non-toxic.
* Even though the HTF contains glycol to prevent freezing, it circulates hot water from the storage tank into the collectors at low temperatures (e.g. below {{convert|40|F|C}}), causing substantial heat loss.

A ''drainback system'' is an active indirect system where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the collector, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reseervoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, must drain via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems are not subject to freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.&lt;ref name="Lane&amp;Olson"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lane, T.  |author2=Olson, K.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002|title= Solar hot water for cold climates: Part II – Drainback systems|journal=Homepower Magazine|volume=86|pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar thermal collectors capture and retain heat from the sun and use it to heat a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3hLHBAAAQBAJ}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two important physical principles govern the technology of solar thermal collectors:
* Any hot object ultimately returns to thermal equilibrium with its environment, due to heat loss from [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], [[convection]] and radiation.&lt;ref name="W.M. Rohsenow, J.P. Harnett 1998"&gt;W.M. Rohsenow, J.P. Harnett, Y.I. Cho (1998). ''Handbook of heat transfer 3rd Ed.''. McGraw-Hill, Chicago, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency (the proportion of heat energy retained for a predefined time period) is directly related to heat loss from the collector surface. Convection and radiation are the most important sources of heat loss. Thermal insulation is used to slow heat loss from a hot object. This follows  the [[Second law of thermodynamics]] (the 'equilibrium effect').
* Heat is lost more rapidly if the temperature difference between a hot object and its environment is larger. Heat loss is predominantly governed by the thermal gradient between the collector surface and the ambient temperatures. Conduction, convection and radiation all occur more rapidly over large thermal gradients&lt;ref name="W.M. Rohsenow, J.P. Harnett 1998" /&gt; (the delta-''t'' effect).

[[File:Flatplate.png|thumb|Flat-plate solar thermal collector, viewed from roof-level]]

====Flat plate====
Flat plate collectors are an extension of the idea to place a collector in an 'oven'-like box with glass directly facing the Sun.&lt;ref name="C. Marken 2009" /&gt; Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors' bottom header, and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the top header. Serpentine flat plate collectors differ slightly from this "harp" design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.

The type of glass used in flat plate collectors is almost always low-iron, [[Toughened glass|tempered glass]]. Such glass can withstand significant hail without breaking, which is one of the reasons that flat-plate collectors are considered the most durable collector type.

Unglazed or formed collectors are similar to flat-plate collectors, except they are not thermally insulated nor physically protected by a glass panel. Consequently, these types of collectors are much less efficient. For pool heating applications, the water to be heated is often colder than the ambient roof temperature, at which point the lack of thermal insulation allows additional heat to be drawn from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="LanePt1"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Solar pool heating basics, Part 1|journal=HomePower|volume=94|pages=70–77|author=D. Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evacuated tube====
[[File:Sistema por Hidroneumatico (Calentador solar para alta presión).JPG|thumb|Evacuated tube solar water heater on a roof]]
Evacuated tube collectors (ETC) are a way to reduce the heat loss,&lt;ref name="C. Marken 2009" /&gt; inherent in flat plates. Since heat loss due to convection cannot cross a vacuum, it forms an efficient isolation mechanism to keep heat inside the collector pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Thermal performances comparisons of the glass evacuated tube solar collectors with shapes of absorber tube|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=32|issue=5|pages=772|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2006.03.016|author1=Yong Kim|author2=Taebeom Seo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since two flat glass sheets are generally not strong enough to withstand a vacuum, the vacuum is created between two concentric tubes. Typically, the water piping in an ETC is therefore surrounded by two concentric tubes of glass separated by a vacuum that admits heat from the sun (to heat the pipe) but that limits heat loss. The inner tube is coated with a thermal absorber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Selective absorbing surface for evacuated solar collector tubes|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=16|pages=632–634|doi=10.1016/S0960-1481(98)00240-7|author1=Shi Yueyan|author2=Yang Xiaoji}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vacuum life varies from collector to collector, from 5 years to 15 years.

Flat plate collectors are generally more efficient than ETC in full sunshine conditions. However, the energy output of flat plate collectors is reduced slightly more than ETCs in cloudy or extremely cold conditions.&lt;ref name="C. Marken 2009" /&gt;  Most ETCs are made out of annealed glass, which is susceptible to [[hail]], failing given roughly golf ball -sized particles. ETCs made from "coke glass," which has a green tint, are stronger and less likely to lose their vacuum, but efficiency is slightly reduced due to reduced transparency. ETCs can gather energy from the sun all day long at low angles due to their tubular shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Saidur|first2=R.|last3=Mekhilef|first3=Saad|last4=Mahian|first4=Omid|date=1 November 2015|title=Progress and latest developments of evacuated tube solar collectors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115006632|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=51|pages=1038–1054|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.07.016|via=ScienceDirect|first1=M. A.|last1=Sabiha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pump ===

====PV pump====
One way to power an active system is via a [[photovoltaic]] (PV) [[PV module|panel]]. To ensure proper pump performance and longevity, the (DC) pump and PV panel must be suitably matched. Although a PV-powered pump does not operate at night, the controller must ensure that the pump does not operate when the sun is out but the collector water is not hot enough.

PV pumps offer the following advantages:
* Simpler/cheaper installation and maintenance
* Excess PV output can be used for household electricity use or put back into the grid.
* Can dehumidify living space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/guest-blogs/getting-hot-water-part-1 Getting into Hot Water — Part 1 - Marc Rosenbaum]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Can operate during a power outage.
* Avoids the carbon consumption from using grid-powered pumps.

====Bubble pump====
[[File:Bubble pump.ogv|thumb|The bubble separator of a bubble-pump system]]
A bubble pump (also known as geyser pump) is suitable for flat panel as well as vacuum tube systems. In a bubble pump system, the closed HTF circuit is under reduced pressure, which causes the liquid to boil at low temperature as the sun heats it. The steam bubbles form a geyser, causing an upward flow. The bubbles are separated from the hot fluid and condensed at the highest point in the circuit, after which the fluid flows downward toward the heat exchanger caused by the difference in fluid levels.&lt;ref&gt;A van Houten (Sunnovations), [http://www.sunnovations.com/content/how-sunnovations-system-works How a Geyser Pump works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114224043/http://www.sunnovations.com/content/how-sunnovations-system-works |date=2011-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried C. Sorensen (1985) [http://www.google.com/patents?id=pjkyAAAAEBAJ Autogeneous solar water heater], US Patent 4607688.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bubbleactionpumps.com/overview/pumpovr1.htm Bubble pump description] at bubbleactionpumps.com&lt;/ref&gt; The HTF typically arrives at the heat exchanger at 70&amp;nbsp;°C and returns to the circulating pump at 50&amp;nbsp;°C. Pumping typically starts at about 50&amp;nbsp;°C and increases as the sun rises until equilibrium is reached.

===Controller===
A ''differential controller'' senses temperature differences between water leaving the solar collector and the water in the storage tank near the heat exchanger. The controller starts the pump when the water in the collector is sufficiently about 8–10&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than the water in the tank, and stops it when the temperature difference reaches 3–5&amp;nbsp;°C. This ensures that stored water always gains heat when the pump operates and prevents the pump from excessive cycling on and off. (In direct systems the pump can be triggered with a difference around 4&amp;nbsp;°C because they have no heat exchanger.)

===Tank===
The simplest collector is a water-filled metal tank in a sunny place. The sun heats the tank. This was how the first systems worked.&lt;ref name="CSC" /&gt; This setup would be inefficient due to the equilibrium effect: as soon as heating of the tank and water begins, the heat gained is lost to the environment and this continues until the water in the tank reaches ambient temperature. The challenge is to limit the heat loss.
* The storage tank can be situated lower than the collectors, allowing increased freedom in system design and allowing pre-existing storage tanks to be used.
* The storage tank can be hidden from view.
* The storage tank can be placed in conditioned or semi-conditioned space, reducing heat loss.
* Drainback tanks can be used.

====Insulated tank====
ICS or batch collectors reduce heat loss by thermally insulating the tank.&lt;ref name="C. Marken 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Marken |year=2009|title= Solar collectors: Behind the glass|journal=HomePower|volume=133|pages=70–76|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-collectors-behind-glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C. Schmidt |author2=A. Goetzberger A. |doi=10.1016/0038-092X(90)90033-9|title=Single-tube integrated collector storage systems with transparent insulation and involute reflector|year=1990|journal=Solar Energy|volume=45|issue=2|pages=93|bibcode=1990SoEn...45...93S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by encasing the tank in a glass-topped box that allows heat from the sun to reach the water tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Smyth |author2=P.C. Eames |author3=B. Norton |year=2006|title= Integrated collector storage solar water heaters|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2004.11.001|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=10|issue=6|pages=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other walls of the box are thermally insulated, reducing convection and radiation.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The box can also have a reflective surface on the inside. This reflects heat lost from the tank back towards the tank. In a simple way one could consider an ICS solar water heater as a water tank that has been enclosed in a type of 'oven' that retains heat from the sun as well as heat of the water in the tank. Using a box does not eliminate heat loss from the tank to the environment, but it largely reduces this loss.

Standard ICS collectors have a characteristic that strongly limits the efficiency of the collector: a small surface-to-volume ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Y. Tripanagnostopoulos |author2=M. Souliotis |author3=T. Nousia |doi=10.1016/S0960-1481(98)00248-1|title=Solar ICS systems with two cylindrical storage tanks|year=1999|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=16|pages=665–668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the amount of heat that a tank can absorb from the sun is largely dependent on the surface of the tank directly exposed to the sun, it follows that the surface  size defines the degree to which the water can be heated by the sun. Cylindrical objects such as the tank in an ICS collector have an inherently  small surface-to-volume ratio. Collectors attempt to increase this ratio for efficient warming of the water. Variations on this basic design include collectors that combine smaller water containers and evacuated glass tube technology, a type of ICS system known as an Evacuated Tube Batch (ETB) collector.&lt;ref name="C. Marken 2009"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Evacuated tube===

ETSCs can be more useful than other solar collectors during winter season. ETCs can be used for heating and cooling purposes in industries like pharmaceutical and drug, paper, leather and textile and also for residential houses, hospitals nursing home, hotels swimming pool etc.

An ETC can operate at a range of temperatures from medium to high for solar hot water, swimming pool, air conditioning and solar cooker.

ETCs higher operational temperature range (up to {{convert|200|C|F}}) makes them suitable for industrial applications such as steam generation, heat engine and solar drying.

===Swimming pools===
[[File:Modulo colector solar de piscinas.jpg|alt=Solar Pool Heater|thumb|Solar Pool Heater]]
[[Swimming pool#Covers|Floating pool covering systems]] and separate STCs are used for pool heating.

Pool covering systems, whether solid sheets or floating disks, act as insulation and reduce heat loss. Much heat loss occurs through evaporation, and using a cover slows evaporation.

STCs for nonpotable pool water use are often made of plastic. [[Swimming pool|Pool]] water is mildly corrosive due to chlorine. Water is circulated through the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are used in conjunction with a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple [[#Active systems with intelligent controllers|differential temperature controller]] is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a diverter valve is used to return water directly to the pool without heating.&lt;ref name="D. Lane 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Lane|year=2003|title= Solar pool heating basics, Part 2|journal=HomePower |volume=95|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.

The collector panels are usually mounted on a nearby roof, or ground-mounted on a tilted rack. Due to the low temperature difference between the air and the water, the panels are often formed collectors or unglazed flat plate collectors. A simple rule-of-thumb for the required panel area needed is 50%  of the pool's surface area.&lt;ref name="D. Lane 2003"/&gt; This is for areas where pools are used in the summer season only. Adding solar collectors to a conventional outdoor pool, in a cold climate, can typically extend the pool's comfortable usage by months and more if an insulating pool cover is used.&lt;ref name=LanePt1/&gt; Most solar hot water systems are capable of heating a pool by around 5-8 °C and often by as much as 10 °C. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.superiorsolar.com.au/solar-pool-heater-guide/|title=Solar Pool Heating System Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[active solar]] energy system analysis program may be used to optimize the solar pool heating system before it is built.

==Energy production==
[[Image:Laundromat-SolarCell.png|thumb|A laundromat in [[California]] with panels on the roof providing hot washing water]]

The amount of heat delivered by a solar water heating system depends primarily on the amount of heat delivered by the sun at a particular place ([[insolation]]). In the tropics insolation can be relatively high, e.g. 7&amp;nbsp;kWh/m² per day, versus e.g., 3.2&amp;nbsp;kWh/m² per day in [[temperate]] areas. Even at the same latitude average insolation can vary a great deal from location to location due to differences in local weather patterns and the amount of overcast. Calculators are available for estimating [[insolation]] at a site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunbird.jrc.it/pvgis/imaps |title=interactive maps |publisher=Sunbird.jrc.it |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719103622/http://sunbird.jrc.it/pvgis/imaps |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ |title=A Performance Calculator for Grid-Connected PV Systems |publisher=Rredc.nrel.gov |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118101606/http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Home Page |publisher=Nrel.gov |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a table that gives a rough indication of the specifications and energy that could be expected from a solar water heating system involving some 2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of absorber area of the collector, demonstrating two evacuated tube and three flat plate solar water heating systems. Certification information or figures calculated from those data are used. The bottom two rows give estimates for daily energy production (kWh/day) for a tropical and a [[temperate]] scenario. These estimates are for heating water to 50&amp;nbsp;°C above ambient temperature.

With most solar water heating systems, the energy output scales linearly with the collector surface area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070220142041/http://www.solar-rating.org/certification/certification.htm SRCC Certification Programs]. solar-rating.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are fairly similar between the above collectors, yielding some 4&amp;nbsp;kWh/day in a temperate climate and some 8&amp;nbsp;kWh/day in a tropical climate when using a collector with a 2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; absorber. In the [[temperate]] scenario this is sufficient to heat 200 litres of water by some 17&amp;nbsp;°C. In the tropical scenario the equivalent heating would be by some 33&amp;nbsp;°C. Many thermosiphon systems have comparable energy output to equivalent active systems. The efficiency of evacuated tube collectors is somewhat lower than for flat plate collectors because the absorbers are narrower than the tubes and the tubes have space between them, resulting in a significantly larger percentage of inactive overall collector area. Some methods of comparison&lt;ref&gt;ISO 9806-2:1995. Test methods for solar collectors – Part 2: Qualification test procedures. International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; calculate the efficiency of evacuated tube collectors based on the actual absorber area and not on the space occupied as has been done in the above table. Efficiency is reduced at higher temperatures.

==Costs==
In sunny, warm locations, where freeze protection is not necessary, an ICS (batch type) solar water heater can be cost effective.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Souliotis |author2=S. Kalogirou |author3=Y. Tripanagnostopoulos |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2008.09.007|title=Modelling of an ICS solar water heater using artificial neural networks and TRNSYS|year=2009|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=34|issue=5|pages=1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In higher latitudes, design requirements for cold weather add to system complexity and cost.
This increases ''initial'' costs, but not life-cycle costs. The biggest single consideration is therefore the large initial financial outlay of solar water heating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=H. M. Healey|year=2007|title= Economics of Solar|journal=Cogeneration &amp; Distributed Generation Journal|volume =22|pages=35–49|doi=10.1080/15453660709509122|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offsetting this expense can take years.&lt;ref name="H. Crawford 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R. H. Crawford |author2=G. J. Treloar |author3=B. D. Ilozor |author4=P. E. D.

The payback period is longer in temperate environments.&lt;ref name=Marken&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C. Marken |author2=J. Sanchez |year=2008|title= PV vs. Solar Water Heating: Simple Solar Payback|journal=HomePower|volume= 127|pages=40–45|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/pv-vs-solar-water-heating}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since solar energy is free, operating costs are small.
At higher latitudes, solar heaters may be less effective due to lower insolation, possibly requiring larger and/or dual-heating systems.&lt;ref name=Marken/&gt; In some countries government incentives can be significant.

Cost factors (positive and negative) include:
* Price of solar water heater (more complex systems are more expensive)
* Efficiency
* Installation cost
* Electricity used for pumping
* Price of water heating fuel (e.g. gas or electricity) saved per kWh
* Amount of water heating fuel used
* Initial and/or recurring government subsidy
* Maintenance cost (e.g. antifreeze or pump replacements)
* Savings in maintenance of conventional (electric/gas/oil) water heating system

Payback times can vary greatly due to regional sun, extra cost due to frost protection needs of collectors, household hot water use etc.
For instance in central and southern Florida the payback period could easily be 7 years or less rather than the 12.6 years indicated on the chart for the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_hot_water/homes/calculator/index.htm Simplified Residential Solar Hot Water System Calculator], Florida Solar Energy Center (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The payback period is shorter given greater insolation. However, even in temperate areas, solar water heating is cost effective. The payback period for photovoltaic systems has historically been much longer.&lt;ref name=Marken/&gt; Costs and payback period are shorter if no complementary/backup system is required.&lt;ref name="H. Crawford 2003"/&gt; thus extending the payback period of such a system.

===Subsidies===
Australia operates a system of Renewable Energy Credits, based on national renewable energy targets.&lt;ref name="environment.gov.au" /&gt;

The [[Toronto Solar Neighbourhoods Initiative]] offers subsidies for the purchase of solar water heating units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidetoronto.com/Article/50574] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719115247/http://www.insidetoronto.com/Article/50574|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy footprint and life cycle assessment==

===Energy footprint===
The source of electricity in an active SWH system determines the extent to which a system contributes to atmospheric carbon during operation. Active solar thermal systems that use mains electricity to pump the fluid through the panels are called 'low carbon solar'. In most systems the pumping reduces the energy savings by about 8% and the carbon savings of the solar by about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;C. Martin and M. Watson (2001). DTI publication URN 01/1292. London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; However, low power pumps operate with 1-20W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lainginc.itt.com/LG-pump-DC-Solar-Pumps.asp |title=DC Solar Pumps |work=lainginc.itt.com |accessdate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119014925/http://lainginc.itt.com/LG-pump-DC-Solar-Pumps.asp |archivedate=January 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a solar collector panel delivering 4&amp;nbsp;kWh/day and a pump running intermittently from mains electricity for a total of 6 hours during a 12-hour sunny day, the potentially negative effect of such a pump can be reduced to about 3% of the heat produced.

However, PV-powered active solar thermal systems typically use a 5–30 W PV panel and a small, low power [[diaphragm pump]] or [[centrifugal pump]] to circulate the water. This reduces the operational carbon and energy footprint.

Alternative non-electrical pumping systems may employ thermal expansion and phase changes of liquids and gases.

===Life cycle energy assessment===
Recognised standards can be used to deliver robust and quantitative [[life cycle assessment]]s (LCA). LCA considers the financial and environmental costs of acquisition of raw materials, manufacturing, transport, using, servicing and disposal of the equipment. Elements include:
* Financial costs and gains
* Energy consumption
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other emissions
In terms of energy consumption, some 60% goes into the tank, with 30% towards the collector&lt;ref name="G. Tsilingiridis, G 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. Tsilingiridis, G. Martinopoulos  |author2=N. Kyriakis |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2003.12.007|title=Life cycle environmental impact of a thermosyphonic domestic solar hot water system in comparison with electrical and gas water heating|year=2004|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (thermosiphon flat plate in this case). In Italy,&lt;ref name="F. Ardente, G. Beccali 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F. Ardente |author2=G. Beccali |author3=M. Cellura |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2004.05.006|title=Life cycle assessment of a solar thermal collector: Sensitivity analysis, energy and environmental balances|year=2005|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=30|issue=2|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 11 giga-joules of electricity are used in producing SWH equipment, with about 35% goes toward the tank, with another 35% towards the collector. The main energy-related impact is emissions. The energy used in manufacturing is recovered within the first 2–3 years of use (in southern Europe).

By contrast the energy payback time in the UK is reported as only 2 years. This figure was for a direct system, retrofitted to an existing water store, PV pumped, freeze tolerant and of 2.8 sqm aperture. For comparison, a PV installation took around 5 years to reach energy payback, according to the same comparative study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Integrated appraisal of micro-generators: Methods and applications|journal=Proceedings of the ICE – Energy|volume=161|issue=2|page=5, Fig. 1|doi=10.1680/ener.2008.161.2.73|author=S.R. Allen, G.P. Hammond, H. Harajli1, C.I. Jones, M.C. McManus and A.B. Winnett|citeseerx=10.1.1.669.9412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, a large fraction of the emissions saved is dependent on the degree to which gas or electricity is used to supplement the sun. Using the Eco-indicator 99 points system as a yardstick (i.e. the yearly environmental load of an average European inhabitant) in Greece,&lt;ref name="G. Tsilingiridis, G 2004" /&gt; a purely gas-driven system may have fewer emissions than a solar system. This calculation assumes that the solar system produces about half of the hot water requirements of a household.

A test system in Italy produced about 700&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, considering all the components of manufacture, use and disposal. Maintenance was identified as an emissions-costly activity when the heat transfer fluid (glycol-based) was replaced. However, the emissions cost was recovered within about two years of use of the equipment.&lt;ref name="F. Ardente, G. Beccali 2005" /&gt;

In Australia, life cycle emissions were also recovered. The tested SWH system had about 20% of the impact of an electrical water heater and half that of a gas water heater.&lt;ref name="H. Crawford 2003" /&gt;

Analysing their lower impact retrofit freeze-tolerant solar water heating system, Allen ''et al.'' (qv) reported a production CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact of 337&amp;nbsp;kg, which is around half the environmental impact reported in the Ardente ''et al.'' (qv) study.

==System specification and installation==
* Most SWH installations require backup heating.
* The amount of hot water consumed each day must be replaced and heated. In a solar-only system, consuming a high fraction of the water in the reservoir implies significant reservoir temperature variations. The larger the reservoir the smaller the daily temperature variation.
* SWH systems offer significant [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] in collector and tank costs.&lt;ref name="G. Tsilingiridis, G 2004"/&gt; Thus the most economically efficient scale meets 100% of the heating needs of the application.
* Direct systems (and some indirect systems using heat exchangers) can be retrofitted to existing stores.
* Equipment components must be insulated to achieve full system benefits. The installation of efficient insulation significantly reduces heat loss.
* The most efficient PV pumps start slowly in low light levels, so they may cause a small amount of unwanted circulation while the collector is cold. The controller must prevent stored hot water from this cooling effect.
* Evacuated tube collector arrays can be adjusted by removing/adding tubes or their heat pipes, allowing customization during/after installation.
* Above 45 degrees latitude, roof mounted sun-facing collectors tend to outproduce wall-mounted collectors. However, arrays of wall-mounted steep collectors can sometimes produce more useful energy because gains in used energy in winter can offset the loss of unused (excess) energy in summer.

In [[glaciology]], '''starvation''' occurs when a [[glacier retreat]]s, not because of [[temperature]] increases, but due to [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] so low that the ice flow downward into the [[zone of ablation]] exceeds the replenishment from snowfall. Eventually, the ice will move so far down that it either [[Ice calving|calve]]s into the [[ocean]] or melts.

When starvation does occur, however, it can almost always be reversed by slight changes in precipitation, such as are brought about by [[mountain]] ranges. Thus, even if glaciers do not cover a lowland due to low precipitation, glaciation is almost certain to occur at higher elevations.

==Occurrences==

Starvation of continental [[ice sheets]] is known to have occurred during the period ''before'' the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] in many areas of [[Canada]] and the [[West Siberian Plain]].

It is thought that, after the end of the [[Eemian Stage]], continental ice sheets first formed near or beyond their northern margins (that is, in the extreme northwest of [[Siberia]] and the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]], [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] in [[North America]]). However, as an ice sheet advances, precipitation at its centre (known as a ''dome'') tends to become very low because [[high-pressure cell|high-pressure systems]] form due to the very cold temperatures above the ice. This meant that at the northern edge of the ice sheets, there was almost no replenishment of the ice, and as it fell to lower elevations, even if it did not melt, it was not being replaced.

Thus, as the continental ice sheets of [[Quaternary]] [[glaciations]] advanced south according to each [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch cycle]], their northern edges were starved and it is believed that starvation caused them to retreat substantially ''southward'' by the time the southern limits of maximum glaciation were approached. Of course, in areas such as the [[Russian Far East]], eastern Siberia and [[Beringia]], glaciers were, in effect, starved before they could form at all.

Some have also argued that starvation, as well as increasing temperatures, played a significant role in the decay of continental ice sheets after the LGM. The argument is that as fresh water from the melting edges of the ice sheet reached the sea, the flow of warm water which fed the ice sheets was stopped and deglaciation during the summer accelerated. This, however, is a highly controversial position.

Starvation of glaciers is believed to have occurred during the [[Little Ice Age]] in parts of [[Alaska]], the [[Himalaya]]s and the [[Karakoram]]. This is because these glaciers do not follow the general global patterns of glacial advance during warm periods and retreat during cold periods, which would imply that their size is ''controlled'' by the amount of precipitation they receive (because temperatures are so low that the increases deemed from [[global warming]], for example, would fail to melt them to any degree whatsoever).

The '''Williams tube''', or the '''Williams–Kilburn tube''' after inventors [[Frederic Calland Williams|Freddie Williams]] (26 June 1911&amp;nbsp;– 11 August 1977), and [[Tom Kilburn]] (11 August 1921&amp;nbsp;– 17 January 2001),&lt;ref name="Kilburn-CCS"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kilburn | first = Tom | author-link = Tom Kilburn | title = From Cathode Ray Tube to Ferranti Mark I | journal = Resurrection | publisher = The Computer Conservation Society | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 1990 | url = http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res02.htm#e | issn = 0958-7403 | access-date = 15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Napper-C50"&gt;{{Cite web | author=Brian Napper | date=25 November 1998  | title=Williams Tube |  url=http://curation.cs.manchester.ac.uk/computer50/www.computer50.org/kgill/williams/williams.html | publisher=University of Manchester | access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an early form of [[computer memory]]. It was the first [[Random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Early computers at Manchester University |journal=Resurrection |volume=1 |issue=4 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1992 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g |issn=0958-7403 |access-date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used successfully in several early computers.

The Williams tube works by displaying a grid of dots on a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). Due to the way CRTs work, this creates a small charge of [[static electricity]] over each dot. The charge at the location of each of the dots is read by a thin metal sheet just in front of the display. Since the display faded over time, it was periodically refreshed. In comparison to the contemporary acoustic [[delay line memory]], the Williams–Kilburn tube was much faster, since the cycling took place at the speed of the electrons inside the vacuum tube, as opposed to the [[speed of sound]] within the delay line. However, the system was adversely affected by any nearby electrical fields, and required constant alignment to keep operational. Williams–Kilburn tubes were used primarily on high-speed computer designs.

Williams and Kilburn applied for British patents on 11 December 1946,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikipatents.com/GB-Patent-645691/improvements-in-or-relating-to-electrical-information-storing-means GB Patent 645,691]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 October 1947,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikipatents.com/GB-Patent-657591/improvements-in-or-relating-to-electrical-storage-apparatus GB Patent 657,591]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by United  States patent applications on 10 December 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2951176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2777971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working principle==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The Williams tube depends on an effect called [[secondary emission]] that occurs on [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs). When the electron beam strikes the [[phosphor]] that forms the display surface, it normally causes it to light up; however, if the beam energy is above a given threshold (depending on the phosphor mix) it also causes [[electron]]s to be struck out of the phosphor. These electrons travel a short distance before being attracted back to the CRT surface and falling on it a short distance away. The overall effect is to cause a slight positive charge in the immediate region of the beam where there is a deficit of electrons, and a slight negative charge around the dot where those electrons land. The resulting [[Potential well|charge well]] remains on the surface of the tube for a fraction of a second while the electrons flow back to their original locations.&lt;ref name="Kilburn-CCS"/&gt; The lifetime depends on the [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] of the phosphor and the size of the well.

The process of creating the charge well is used as the write operation in a computer memory, storing a single binary digit, or [[bit]]. A collection of dots or spaces, often one horizontal row on the display, represents a computer word. There is a relationship between the size and spacing of the dots and their lifetime, as well as the ability to reject crosstalk with adjacent dots. This places an upper limit on the [[Areal density (computer storage)|memory density]], and each Williams tube could typically store about 1024 to 2560 bits of data. Because the electron beam is essentially inertia-free and can be moved anywhere on the display, the computer can access any location, making it a random access memory. Typically, the computer would load the address as an X and Y pair into the driver circuitry and then trigger a [[time base generator]] that would sweep the selected locations, reading from or writing to the internal registers, normally implemented as [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s.

Reading the memory took place via a secondary effect caused by the writing operation. During the short period when the write takes place, the redistribution of charges in the phosphor creates an electrical current that induces voltage in any nearby conductors. This is read by placing a thin metal sheet just in front of the display side of the CRT. During a read operation, the beam writes to the selected bit locations on the display. Those locations that were previously written to are already depleted of electrons, so no current flows, and no voltage appears on the plate. This allows the computer to determine there was a "1" in that location. If the location had not been written to previously, the write process will create a well and a pulse will be read on the plate, indicating a "0".&lt;ref name="Kilburn-CCS"/&gt;

Reading a memory location creates a charge well whether or not one was previously there, destroying the original contents of that location, and so any read has to be followed by a write to reinstate the original data. In some systems this was accomplished using a second electron gun inside the CRT that could write to one location while the other was reading the next. Since the display would fade over time, the entire display had to be periodically refreshed using the same basic method. However, as the data is read and then immediately written, this operation can be carried out by external circuitry while the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) was busy carrying out other operations. This refresh operation is similar to the [[memory refresh]] cycles of [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] in modern systems.

Since the refresh process caused the same pattern to continually reappear on the display, there was a need to be able to erase previously written values. This was normally accomplished by writing to the display just beside the original location. The electrons released by this new write would fall into the previously written well, filling it back in. The original systems produced this effect by writing a small dash, which was easy to accomplish without changing the master timers and simply producing the write current for a slightly longer period. The resulting pattern was a series of dots and dashes. There was a considerable amount of research on more effective erasing systems, with some systems using out-of-focus beams or complex patterns.

Some Williams tubes were made from [[radar]]-type cathode ray tubes with a [[phosphor]] coating that made the data visible, while other tubes were purpose-built without such a coating. The presence or absence of this coating had no effect on the operation of the tube, and was of no importance to the operators, since the face of the tube was covered by the pickup plate. If a visible output was needed, a second tube connected in parallel with the storage tube, with a phosphor coating, but without a pickup plate, was used as a display device.

==Development==
Developed at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in England, it provided the medium on which the first electronically stored-memory program was implemented in the [[Manchester Baby]] computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Napper | first = Brian | title = Computer 50: The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer | url = http://www.computer50.org/ | accessdate = 26 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120504133240/http://www.computer50.org/ | archivedate = 4 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was a [[testbed]] to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|title=Electronic Digital Computers|journal=Nature|volume=162|pages=487|date=Sep 1948|doi=10.1038/162487a0|issue=4117|postscript=.}} Reprinted in ''The Origins of Digital Computers''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|last3=Tootill|first3=G.C.|title=Universal High-Speed Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine|url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/ssem.html|journal=Proc. IEE|date=Feb 1951|volume=98|issue=61|pages=13–28|postscript=.|doi=10.1049/pi-2.1951.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Kilburn wrote a 17-line program to calculate the highest [[proper factor]] of 2&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;. Tradition at the university has it that this was the only program Kilburn ever wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams tubes tended to become unreliable with age, and most working installations had to be "tuned" by hand. By contrast, mercury [[delay line memory]] was slower and not truly random access, as the bits were presented serially, which complicated programming. Delay lines also needed hand tuning, but did not age as badly and enjoyed some success in early digital electronic computing despite their data rate, weight, cost, thermal and toxicity problems.  However, the [[Manchester Mark 1]], which used Williams tubes, was successfully commercialised as the [[Ferranti Mark 1]]. Some early computers in the United States also used Williams tubes, including the [[IAS machine]] (originally designed for [[Selectron tube]] memory), the [[UNIVAC 1103]], [[Whirlwind I]], [[IBM 701]], [[IBM 702]] and the [[SWAC (computer)|Standards Western Automatic Computer]] (SWAC). Williams tubes were also used in the Soviet [[Strela computer|Strela-1]] and in the Japan TAC (Tokyo Automatic Computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_onrASurveyomputers1953_8778395|title=A survey of automatic digital computers|last1=Research|first1=United States Office of Naval|date=1953|publisher=Office of Naval Research, Dept. of the Navy|p=87|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:YamunaRiver.jpg|thumb|River Yamuna near [[Agra]]]] THIS IMAGE IS ACTUALLY by the Taj at AGRA, and we already have another image below--&gt;

The '''Yamuna''' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]: {{IPA-hi|jəmʊnaː|pron}}), also known as the '''Jumna''' or '''Jamuna''' (not to be mistaken with the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] of [[Bangladesh]]), is the second largest [[tributary]] [[river]] of the [[Ganges]] (Ganga) and the longest tributary in [[Rivers of India|India]]. Originating from the [[Yamunotri]] Glacier at a height of {{convert|6387|m}} on the southwestern slopes of [[Bandarpunch| Banderpooch]] peaks of the [[Lower Himalayan Range|Lower Himalaya]] in [[Uttarakhand]], it travels a total length of {{convert|1376|km|mi}} and has a [[Drainage system (Geomorphology) |drainage system]] of {{convert|366223|km2|mi2}}, 40.2% of the entire [[Ganges Basin]]. It merges with the Ganges at [[Triveni Sangam]], [[Allahabad]], which is a site of the [[Kumbha Mela|Kumbh Mela]], a Hindu festival held every 12 years.

It crosses several states: [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], passing by [[Uttarakhand]] and later [[Delhi]], and meeting its tributaries on the way, including [[Tons River|Tons]], its largest tributary, [[Chambal River|Chambal]], its longest tributary which has its own large basin, followed by [[Sindh River|Sindh]], the [[Betwa]], and [[Ken River|Ken]]. The Yamuna does not pass across [[Himachal Pradesh]], but receives water from that state via the Tons. It helps create the highly fertile [[Alluvium|alluvial]] Yamuna-Ganges [[Doab]] region between itself and the Ganges in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. Nearly 57&amp;nbsp;million people depend on the Yamuna's waters. With an annual flow of about 10,000 cubic billion metres (cbm; 8.1 billion acre⋅ft) and usage of 4,400 cbm (of which irrigation constitutes 96 per cent), the river accounts for more than 70 per cent of Delhi's water supply. Like the Ganges, the Yamuna is highly venerated in [[Hinduism]] and worshipped as the goddess Yamuna. In [[Hindu mythology]] she is the daughter of the Sun God, [[Surya]], and the sister of [[Yama]], the God of Death, hence also known as [[Yami]]. According to popular legends, bathing in its sacred waters frees one from the torments of death.&lt;ref name=hy&gt;{{cite book |title= Hydrology and water resources of India—Volume 57 of Water science and technology library |last= Jain |first= Sharad K.|authorlink=

At the [[Hathni Kund Barrage]], its waters are diverted into two large canals: the Western Yamuna Canal flowing towards Haryana and the Eastern Yamuna Canal towards Uttar Pradesh. Beyond that point the Yamuna is joined only by the [[Somb]], a seasonal rivulet from Haryana, and by the highly polluted [[Hindon River]] near Noida, so that it continues only as a trickling sewage-bearing drain before joining the [[Chambal River| Chambal]] at [[Pachnada]] in the [[Etawah District]] of Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref name=nowater1&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20071118/spectrum/main1.htm And filthy flows the Yamuna], [[The Tribune (Chandigarh) |The Tribune]], 18 Nov 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The water of Yamuna is of "reasonably good quality" through its length from Yamunotri in the Himalayas to [[Wazirabad barrage]] in Delhi, about {{convert|375|km|mi}}; below this, the discharge of wastewater through 15 drains between Wazirabad barrage and Okhla barrage renders the river severely polluted. 

One official described the river as a "sewage drain" with [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) values ranging from 14 to 28&amp;nbsp;mg/l and high [[coliform]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 'Ganga is the most polluted river' |url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/11/23/stories/2003112300531100.htm |date= Nov 23, 2003 |publisher= [[The Hindu]] |page= |access-date= 12 February 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915043255/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/11/23/stories/2003112300531100.htm |archive-date= 15 September 2008 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main sources of pollution in the river: household and municipal disposal sites, soil erosion resulting from deforestation occurring to make way for agriculture, and resulting chemical wash-off from fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides and run-off from commercial activity and industrial sites. The Yamuna from its origin at [[Yamunotri]] to Okhla barrage is called the Upper Yamuna.&lt;ref name="okhla5"&gt;

===Palaeochannels===
The present [[Sarsuti]] river which originates in the Shivalik hills in [[Himachal]] and [[Haryana]] border and merges with [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar River]] near [[Pehowa]] is the [[palaeochannel]] of Yamuna.&lt;ref name=sarsuti1&gt;[http://cgwb.gov.in/Ground-Water/Final%20print%20version_Palaeochannel%20Expert%20Committee_15thOct2016.pdf PALAEOCHANNELS OF NORTH WEST INDIA], Central Ground Water Board, last page of prefce.&lt;/ref&gt; Yamuna changed its course to the east due to a shift in the slope of the [[Continental crust|earth's crust]] caused by [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref name=sarsuti1/&gt;

===Source===
The source of Yamuna lies in the [[Yamunotri]] Glacier at an elevation of {{convert|6387|m|ft}}, on the south-western slopes of Banderpooch peaks, which lie in the [[Mussoorie]] range of the [[Lower Himalayan Range|Lower Himalayas]], north of [[Haridwar]] in [[Uttarkashi district]], [[Uttarakhand]].&lt;ref name=hy/&gt; Yamunotri temple, a shrine dedicated to the goddess Yamuna, is one of the holiest shrines in [[Hinduism]], and part of the [[Chota Char Dham]] [[Yatra]] circuit. Also standing close to the temple, on its {{convert|13|km|mi|0|adj=on}} trek route that follows the right bank of the river, lies Markendeya Tirtha, where the sage [[Markandeya]] wrote the [[Markandeya Purana]].&lt;ref name=utt&gt;[http://uttarkashi.nic.in/aboutDistt/Temple.htm Yamunotri Temple] [[Uttarkashi district]] website. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731232226/http://uttarkashi.nic.in/aboutDistt/Temple.htm |date=31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The holy Himalaya: a geographical interpretation of Garhwal - Yamuna Drainage System|last=Nand|first=Nitya  |authorlink= |author2=Kamlesh Kumar |year=1989|publisher=Daya Books|location= |isbn=81-7035-055-7|page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmNGKpcE83cC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Yamuna#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current course===
From Markendeya Tirtha, the river flows southwards for about {{convert|200|km|mi}}, through the Lower Himalayas and the [[Shivalik Hills]] Range. [[Morainic]] deposits are found along the steep Upper Yamuna, highlighted with [[geomorphic]] features such as [[interlocking spur]]s, steep rock [[Bench (geology)|benches]], gorges and [[stream terrace]]s. Large terraces formed over a long period of time can be seen in the lower course of the river, such as those near Naugoan. An important part of its early [[Water catchment area|catchment area]], totalling {{convert|2320|km2|mi2}}, lies in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The [[Tons River|Tons]], Yamana's largest tribuary, drains a large portion of the upper catchment area and holds more water than the main stream. It rises from the Hari-ki-dun valley and merges after Kalsi near [[Dehradun]]. The drainage system of the river stretches between Giri-[[Sutlej]] catchment in Himachal and Yamuna-[[Bhilangna]] catchment in [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]], also draining the ridge of [[Shimla]]. [[Kalanag]] ({{convert|6387|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}) is the highest point of the Yamuna basin. Other tributaries in the region are the Giri, Rishi Ganga, Kunta, Hanuman Ganga and Bata, which drain the upper catchment area of the Yamuna basin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webindia123.com/himachal/land/rivers.htm#R General outline of rivers in Himachal @ webindia123]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chandigarh river.jpg|thumb|Yamuna river between [[Saharanpur]] and Yamunanagar]]
From the upper catchment area, the river descends onto the plains of [[Doon Valley]], at [[Dak Pathar]] near Dehradun. Flowing through the [[Dakpathar Barrage]], the water is diverted into a canal for power generation. Further downstream, the Assan River joins the Yamuna at the [[Asan Barrage]], which hosts a bird sanctuary. After passing the [[Sikh]] pilgrimage town of [[Paonta Sahib]], the Yamuna reaches [[Tajewala]] in [[Yamuna Nagar district]] (named after the river) of [[Haryana]]. A dam built here in 1873 is the origin of two important canals, the Western and Eastern [[Yamuna Canal]]s, which irrigate the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) crosses [[Yamuna Nagar]], [[Karnal]] and [[Panipat]] before reaching the Haiderpur treatment plant, which contributes to [[Delhi]]'s municipal water supply. The Yamuna receives wastewater from Yamuna Nagar and Panipat cities; beyond this it is replenished by seasonal streams and groundwater [[accrual]]. During the dry season, the Yamuna remains dry in many stretches between the Tajewala dam and Delhi, where it enters near the [[Palla barrage]] after traversing {{convert|224|km|mi}}.

The Yamuna defines the state borders between Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and between Haryana, Delhi and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. When the Yamuna reaches the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]], it runs almost parallel to the Ganges, the two rivers creating the Ganges-Yamuna [[Doab]] region. Spread across {{convert|69000|km2|mi2}}, one-third of the [[alluvial]] plain, the region is known for its agricultural output, particularly for the cultivation of [[basmati]] rice. The plain's agriculture supports one-third of India's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeology of Lower Ganga-Yamuna Doab (circa 1200 B.C. to 1200 A.D.)|last=Sharma|first=Deo Prakash  |authorlink= |year=2006|publisher=Bharatiya Kala Prakashan|location= |isbn=81-8090-033-9 |pages=10, 214 |url= |ref= |quote="[[Doab]] is a [[Persian language|Persian]] word, from ''Do-Ab'', literally meaning 'two rivers', or land between two rivers".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Yamana flows through the states of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh] before merging with the [[Ganges]] at a sacred spot known as [[Triveni Sangam]] in [[Allahabad]]. Pilgrims travel by boats to platforms erected in midstream to offer prayers. During the [[Kumbh Mela]], held every 12 years, large congregations of people immerse themselves in the sacred waters of the confluence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798222,00.html At the Three Rivers] ''[[TIME]]'', February 23, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Baghpat]], Delhi, [[Noida]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], [[Agra]], [[Firozabad]], [[Etawah]], [[Kalpi]], [[Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh|Hamirpur]], and Allahabad lie on its banks. At Etawah, it meets it another important tributary, [[Chambal River|Chambal]], followed by a host of [[tributaries]] further down, including, Sindh, the [[Betwa]], and [[Ken River|Ken]].&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/crisis/River-yamuna.htm State of River Yamuna]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Important tributaries===
[[File:Jamuna_catchment.jpg|thumb|Catchment boundary of the Yamuna]]
Along its {{convert|1376|km|mi|adj=on}} length, the Yamuna has many notable tributaries:
* [[Tons River]], Yamuna's largest tributary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=ZKs1gBhJSWIC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;dq=Tons+River,+Yamuna%27s+largest+tributary#v=onepage&amp;q=Tons%20River%2C%20Yamuna's%20largest%20tributary&amp;f=false|title=Hydrology and Water Resources of India Volume 57 of Water Science and Technology Library|last1=Sharad K.|first1= Jain|last2=Pushpendra K.|first2= Agarwal|last3= Vijay P.|first3= Singh|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2007|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; which rises in the {{convert|6315|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} Bandarpoonch mountain, and has a large basin in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. It meets Yamuna below Kalsi near [[Dehradun]], Uttarakhand.
* [[Hindon River]], which originates in the [[Saharanpur District]], from Upper [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] in the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]. It is entirely rainfed and has a [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of {{convert|7083|km2|mi2}}, traverses {{convert|400|km|mi}} through [[Muzaffarnagar District]], [[Meerut District]], [[Baghpat District]], [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]], [[Noida]] and [[Greater Noida]], before joining Yamuna just outside [[Delhi]].
* [[Ken River]], which flows through the [[Bundelkhand]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and Uttar Pradesh. It originates near Ahirgawan village in [[Jabalpur district]] and travels a distance of {{convert|427|km|mi}} before merging with the Yamuna at Chilla village, near [[Fatehpur, Fatehpur|Fatehpur]] in Uttar Pradesh. It has an overall [[drainage basin]] of {{convert|28058|km2|mi2}}.
* [[Chambal River]], known as Charmanvati in ancient texts, which is Yamuna's longest tributary. It flows through Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and traverses a total distance of {{convert|960|km|mi}} from its source in [[Vindhya Range]], near [[Mhow]]. With a drainage basin of {{convert|143219|km2|mi2}}, it supports hydro-power generation at [[Gandhi Sagar dam]], [[Rana Pratap Sagar dam]] and Jawahar Sagar dam, before merging into the Yamuna south east of Sohan Goan, in [[Etawah district]].
* [[Sindh River]], which joins the Yamuna shortly after the Chambal.
* [[Sasur Khaderi River]], {{a.k.a.}} Sasur Khaderi, which is a tributary in [[Fatehpur district|Fatehpur]] district.

=={{anchor|Ancient literature and history}}History==
[[File:Krishna carried over river yamuna.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Vasudeva|Vasudev]] carrying baby Lord [[Krishna]] across the Yamuna, an important legend of [[Bhagavata Purana]].]]

The name ''Yamuna'' seems to be derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word "yama", meaning 'twin', and it may have been applied to the river because it runs parallel to the Ganges. The Yamuna is mentioned at many places in the [[Rig Veda]], which was composed during the [[Vedic period]] {{circa|1700–1100}}&amp;nbsp;CE, and also in the later [[Atharvaveda]], and the [[Brahmana]]s including [[Aitareya Brahmana]] and [[Shatapatha Brahmana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vedic Index of Names and Subjects (V-208-1333-2|page=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5GaKHfNzScC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna%20River&amp;f=false|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rigveda]], the story of the Yamuna describes her "excessive love" for her twin, [[Yama]], who in turn asks her to find a suitable match for herself, which she does in [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=oAHhdczi9CcC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=story+of+the+Yamuna+describes+her+%22excessive+love%22+for+her+twin,+Yama,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S2odOiJc-9&amp;sig=XzuRSWcjTvwPUoMFao6oJcNqoCU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiauPa_u-DdAhXjsYsKHW9uBDEQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=story%20of%20the%20Yamuna%20describes%20her%20%22excessive%20love%22%20for%20her%20twin%2C%20Yama%2C&amp;f=false|title=Troubled Waters: Religion, Ethics, and the Global Water Crisis|last=Gary|first= Chamberlain|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008|page=18|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale is further detailed in the 16th century [[Sanskrit]] hymn, ''Yamunashtakam'', an ode by the philosopher [[Vallabhacharya]]. Here the story of her descent to meet her beloved Krishna and to purify the world has been put into verse. The hymn also praises her for being the source of all spiritual abilities. And while the Ganges is considered an epitome of asceticism and higher knowledge and can grant ''[[Moksha]]'' or [[liberty|liberation]], it is Yamuna, who, being a holder of infinite love and compassion, can grant freedom, even from death, the realm of her elder brother. Vallabhacharya writes that she rushes down the Kalinda Mountain, and describes her as the daughter of Kalinda, giving her the name ''Kalindi'', the backdrop of Krishna Leela. The text also talks about her water being of the colour of Lord Krishna, which is dark (Shyam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Earth democracy: justice, sustainability and peace-G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |last=Shiva|first= Vandana |authorlink=Vandana Shiva |year=2006|publisher=Zed Books|location= |isbn=1-84277-777-7|pages=172–173 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQzwwzBYGDkC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Yamuna#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Troubled waters: religion, ethics, and the global water crisis |last=Chamberlain|first=Gary|authorlink= |year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-5245-4|page=18|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oAHhdczi9CcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna%20River&amp;f=false|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is referred to as Asita in some historical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 72|editor=K.S.

Greek traveller and geographer [[Megasthenes]] visited India sometime before 288&amp;nbsp;BCE (the date of [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]'s death) and mentioned the river in his ''[[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]]'', where he described the region around it as the land of Surasena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Megasthenes and Indian Religion- Volume 11 of History and Culture Series |last=Dahlaquist |first=Allan  |authorlink= |year=1996|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publ.|location= |isbn=81-208-1323-5|page=386 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xp35-8gTRDkC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=Yamuna#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Pandava]] capital of [[Indraprastha]] was situated on the banks of Yamuna, considered to be the site of modern Delhi.

Geological evidence indicates that in the distant past the Yamuna was a tributary of the [[Ghaggar River]] (also known as the [[Vedic Sarasvati River]]), but that it later changed its course eastward due to a [[tectonic]] event, becoming a tributary of the Ganges. This may have led to the Sarasvati River drying up, the end of many [[Harappan civilisation]] settlements, and creation of the [[Thar desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Archaeology |last=Ghosh |first=A. |authorlink= |year=1991|publisher=BRILL |location= |isbn=90-04-09264-1|page= 214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=yamuna+ghaggar+tributary |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of the Cradle of Civilization |last=Feuerstein |first=Georg |authorlink= |author2=Subhash Kak |author3=David Frawley  |year=2001|publisher=Quest Books|location= |isbn=0-8356-0741-0 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ermk_FmwcS4C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods, Sages and Kings: Vedic Secrets of Ancient Civilization|last=Frawley|first=David |authorlink=David Frawley |year=2000|publisher=Lotus Press|location= |isbn=0-910261-37-7|page=95|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DM58BhuR2KwC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent geological research suggests that the diversion of the Yamuna to the Ganges may have occurred during the [[Pleistocene]], and thus could not be connected to the decline of the Harappan civilisation in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Clift et al. 2012.

Most of the great empires which ruled over a majority of India were based in the highly fertile Ganges–Yamuna basin, including the [[Magadha]] ({{circa|600&amp;nbsp;BCE}}), [[Maurya Empire]] (321–185&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Shunga Empire]] (185–73&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Kushan Empire]] (1st–3rd centuries&amp;nbsp;CE), and [[Gupta Empire]] (280–550&amp;nbsp;CE), and many had their capitals here, in cities like [[Pataliputra]] or [[Mathura]]. These rivers were revered throughout these kingdoms that flourished on their banks; since the period of [[Chandragupta II]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}}&amp;nbsp;375–415&amp;nbsp;CE), statues both the Ganges and Yamuna became common throughout the Gupta Empire. Further to the South, images of the Ganges and Yamuna are found amidst shrines of the Chalukyas, [[Rashtrakutas]] (753–982), and on their royal seals; prior to them, the [[Chola Empire]] also added the river into their architectural motifs. The Three River Goddess shrine, next to the Kailash rock-cut Temple at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]], shows the Ganges flanked by the Yamuna and Saraswati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lives of Indian images |last=Davis|first=Richard H.  |authorlink= |year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00520-6|pages=74–76|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5OGFrDcLbogC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna%20River&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
{{main|Yamuna in Hinduism}}
[[File:Yamuna, personificazione del fiume sacro yamuna, IX sec.JPG|right|thumb|The goddess Yamuna]]

The goddess of the river, also known as Yami, is the sister of [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the god of [[death]], and the daughter of [[Surya]], the [[Sun god]], and his wife [[Saranyu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]] 8.13.9&lt;/ref&gt; Yamuna, referred to respectfully as Yamunaji, holds a very important position in [[Pushtimarg|Pushti Marga]], a large sect of Hinduism based on the [[Shuddhadvaita|ShuddhAdvaita]], in which [[Krishna|Shri Krishna]] is the main deity, propagated by [[Vallabhacharya|VallabhAcharya / MahaPrabhuji]].

The river Yamuna is connected to the religious beliefs surrounding [[Krishna]] and various stories of the two are found in [[Hindu religious texts]], especially the [[Puranas]]. One such story is ''Kaliya Daman'' about the subduing of [[Kaliya]], a ''[[Naga (mythology)|Nāga]]'' which had inhabited the river and terrorised the people of [[Braja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Hindu mythology: a reader in the Sanskrit Purānas |last=Dimmitt|first=Cornelia|authorlink= |year=1978|publisher=Temple University Press|location= |isbn=0-87722-122-7 |page=329 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmFOX7q2IqgC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna%20River&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celextel.org/stotrasother/yamunashtakam.html Yamunashtakam Text and Translation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625023157/http://www.celextel.org/stotrasother/yamunashtakam.html |date=25 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamuna, according to the legends, is closely related to Lord Krishna and Mahabharata. Krishna was taken across the Yamuna on the night of his birth. Krishna's maternal uncle [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had planned to kill all his nephews, as his eighth nephew was predicted to be his [[Kāla (time)|Kāla]]. When [[Vasudeva]], carrying Krishna in a basket, reached the river Yamuna, on the stormy night of Krishna's birth, Yamuna is said to have parted to make way for Vasudeva. Krishna and the [[Gopi]]s also used to play on the banks of the Yamunaji as children.[[File:Taj Mahal-11.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taj Mahal]] is situated on the banks of river Yamuna.]]

==Management==
The stretch of the river from its origin at [[Yamunotri]] to [[Okhla barrage]] in [[Delhi]] is called "Upper Yamuna". A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed amongst the five basin states (Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi) on 12&amp;nbsp;May 1994 for sharing of its waters. This led to the formation of Upper Yamuna River Board under India's [[Ministry of Water Resources (India)|Ministry of Water Resources]], whose primary functions are: regulation of the available flows amongst the beneficiary states and monitoring the return flows; monitoring conservation and upgrading the quality of surface and groundwater; maintaining hydro-meteorological data for the basin; overviewing plans for watershed management; and monitoring and reviewing the progress of all projects up to and including Okhla barrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uyrb.nic.in/ Upper Yamuna River Board] Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood forecasting systems are established at Poanta Sahib, where Tons, Pawar and Giri tributaries meet. The river take 60&amp;nbsp;hours to travel from Tajewala to Delhi, thus allowing a two-day advance flood warning period.&lt;ref name=hy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=India's Water Wealth - Flood Forecasting system of Yamuna |last=Rao |first=K.L.|authorlink= |year=1979|publisher=Orient Blackswan|location= |isbn=81-250-0704-0 |page= 163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZNrXuA2y3MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=Yamuna#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Himalayan rivers, lakes, and glaciers |last=Negi |first=Sharad Singh  |authorlink= |year=1991|publisher=Indus Publishing|location= |isbn=81-85182-61-2 |pages= 141–142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YtUShKY8zcC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Yamuna#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Water Commission started flood-forecasting services in 1958 with its first forecasting station on Yamuna at Delhi Railway Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100824191017/http://mowr.gov.in/searchdetail.asp?lid=357&amp;skey=yamuna&amp;langid=1 Flood Forecasting Network in India] [[Ministry of Water Resources (India)|Ministry of Water Resources]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrigation===
[[File:Agra_canal_headworks1871a.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|[[Agra Canal]] headworks at [[Okhla]] barrage, Delhi, 1871.]]

Use of the Yamuna's waters for irrigation in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s is enhanced by its many canals, some dating to the 14th century [[Tughlaq dynasty]], which built the ''Nahr-i-Bahisht'' (Paradise) parallel to the river. The ''Nahr-i-Bahisht'' was restored and extended by the [[Mughals]] in the first half of the 17th century, by engineer Ali Mardan Khan, starting from Benawas where the river enters the plains and terminating near the Mughal capital of [[Shahjahanabad]], the present city of Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of cartography, Volume 2, Part 1 |last=Woodward |first=David  |authorlink= |author2=John Brian Harley  |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press US|location= |isbn=0-226-31635-1|page=438 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocoV2iI4vcoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA311&amp;dq=Yamuna+River#v=onepage&amp;q=Yamuna&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Yamuna Canal====
{{Main|Western Yamuna Canal}}
The Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) was built in 1335 CE by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]]. Excessive silting caused it to stop flowing {{circa|1750}}, when the [[British Raj]] undertook a three-year renovation in 1817 by [[Bengal Engineer Group]]. The [[Tajewala Barrage]] dam was built in 1832–33{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018|stated above this was built in 1873}} to regulate the flow of water, and was replaced by the modern [[Hathni Kund Barrage]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="WYC"/&gt;

The main canal is {{convert|86|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref name="WYC"/&gt; When including its branches and many major and minor irrigation channels, it has a total length of {{convert|325|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="IW"&gt;[http://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/On%20The%20Brink_Water%20Governance_Yamuna%20River%20Basin_Haryana_PEACE_SPWD_2010.pdf India Water Portal]&lt;/ref&gt; The WYC begins at the Hathni Kund Barrage about {{convert|38|km|mi}} from Dakpathar and south of [[Doon Valley]]. The canals irrigate vast tracts of land in the region in [[Ambala district|Ambala]], [[Karnal district|Karnal]], [[Sonepat district|Sonepat]], [[Rohtak district|Rohtak]], [[Jind district|Jind]], [[Hisar district|Hisar]] and [[Bhiwani district]]s.&lt;ref name="WYC"&gt;[http://india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Western_Yamuna_Canal_Major_Irrigation_Project_JI01653 Western yaumna Canal Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The major branch canals are:

* [[Agra Canal]], built in 1874, which starts from the [[Okhla]] barrage beyond the Nizamuddin bridge, joining the Banganga river about {{convert|32|km|mi}} below [[Agra]]. During the dry summer season, the stretch above Agra resembles a minor stream.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;

===The Sutlej–Yamuna Link===
{{main|Sutlej Yamuna link canal}}
A proposed heavy freight canal, the Sutlej–Yamuna Link (SYL), is being built westwards from near the Yamuna's headwaters through the [[Punjab region]] near an ancient caravan route and highlands pass to the navigable parts of the [[Sutlej]]–[[Indus]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. This will connect the [[Ganges]], which flows to the east coast of the subcontinent, with points west (via Pakistan). When completed, the SYL will allow shipping from India's east coast to the west coast and the [[Arabian sea]], shortening important commercial links for north-central India's large population. The canal starts near Delhi, and is designed to transfer Haryana's share of {{convert|4.3|km3|acre.ft|lk = in|abbr = on}} from the [[Indus]] Basin.

==Pollution==
[[File:Yamuna river near the Himalayas.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Yamuna near the Himalayas, just as it reaches the plains, beyond [[Dehradun]] in [[Uttarakhand]]]]

In 1909, the waters of the Yamuna were distinguishable as clear blue, when compared to the silt-laden yellow of the Ganges.&lt;ref name=imp&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V01_053.gif The Ganges and the Jumna] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], 1909 v. 1, ''p. 23.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to high-density population growth and rapid industrialisation, Yamuna has become one of the most-polluted rivers in the world. The Yamuna is particularly polluted downstream of [[New Delhi]], the capital of India, which dumps about 58% of its waste into the river. A recent{{when|date=November 2018}} study shows that there is 100% [[urban metabolism]] of River Yamuna as it passes through the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Govind|last2=Deb|first2=Mihir|last3=Ghosh|first3=Chirashree|title=Urban Metabolism of River Yamuna in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, India.

===Causes===
New Delhi generates {{convert|1900|e6l|USgal}} per day (MLD) of sewage. Though many attempts have been made to process it, these efforts have proven futile. Although the government of India has spent nearly $500 million{{clarify|date=November 2018|note=first mention of $. If US$, specify, but perhaps better to use INR.}} to clean up the river, the Yamuna continues to be polluted with garbage while most sewage treatment facilities are underfunded or malfunctioning. In addition, the water in the river remains stagnant for almost nine months a year, aggravating the situation. Delhi alone contributes around 3,296 MLD of sewage to the river. The government of India over the next five years{{when|date=November 2018}} has prepared plans to rebuild and repair the sewage system and the drains that empty into the river.

To address river pollution, measures have been taken by the [[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] (MoEF) in 12 towns of Haryana, 8 towns of Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, under the [[Yamuna Action Plan]] (YAP) which has been implemented since 1993 by the MoEF's National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is participating in the YAP in 15 of the towns (excluding 6 towns of [[Haryana]] included later on the direction of the [[Supreme Court of India]]) with soft loan assistance of 17.773 billion [[Japanese yen]] (equivalent to about {{INR}}700 crore [7&amp;nbsp;billion rupees]) while the government of India is providing the funds for the remaining 6 towns. In 2007, the Indian government's plans to repair sewage lines were predicted to improve the water quality of the river 90% by the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pepper | first = Daniel | title = India's "flush-and-forget" mindset | work = SFGate.com | pages = A17-A18 | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | date = 2007-07-27 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/27/MNGMJR7G6S1.DTL&amp;hw=yamuna&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CAG castigates Delhi Govt over Yamuna river pollution |url= http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20000408/ina08010.html|date=April 8, 2000 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India's rivers are drowning in pollution |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/06/11/100083453/index.htm |date= June 4, 2007|publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |page=|author=Daniel Pepper}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=November 2018}}

The last barrage across the Yamuna river is the [[Mathura barrage]] at [[Gokul]] for supply of drinking water to that city. Downstream of this barrage, many pumping stations are constructed to feed the river water for irrigation needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Headworks_(Dam,_Barrage,Weir,_Anicut,_Lift)|title=list of head works (Dams,_Barrages, Weirs, Anicuts, Lifts) on Yamuna/Ganga river|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pumping stations are near Pateora Danda {{Coord|25|55|09|N|80|13|27|E|type:landmark_region:IN-UP}}, Samgara {{Coord|25|41|13|N|80|46|27|E|type:landmark_region:IN-UP}}, Ainjhi {{Coord|25|43|35|N|80|49|33|E|type:landmark_region:IN-UP}}, Bilas Khadar {{Coord|25|31|35|N|81|02|43|E|type:landmark_region:IN-UP}}, and Samari {{Coord|25|27|19|N|81|11|43|E|type:landmark_region:IN-UP}}. Depletion of the [[Baseflow|base flows]] available in the river during the non-monsoon months by these pump houses is exacerbating river pollution from Mathura to [[Allahabad]] in the absence of adequate fresh water to dilute the polluted drainage from habitations and industries.

In 2009, the Union government announced to the [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament), the failure of the [[Pollution of the Ganges|Ganga Action Plan]] and the YAP, saying that "rivers Ganga and Yamuna are no cleaner now than two decades ago" despite spending over {{INR}}1,700 crore (17&amp;nbsp;billion rupees) to control pollution. According to a [[Centre for Science and Environment]] (CSE) official, these plans adopted the [[Thames Tideway Scheme|Thames model]], based on a centralised sewage treatment system. This meant that a huge sum of money and a 24-hour power supply were needed to manage the treatment plants, while only an 8-hour power supply was available, contributing to the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Failure of Ganga, Yamuna projects.. |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-04/chennai/28093527_1_cooum-treatment-plants-sewage-treatment|work=[[The Times of India]] |date= September 2009 |first1=Ajitha |last1=Karthikeyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) initiated its plan for resuscitating the Yamuna's {{convert|22|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch in Delhi by constructing interceptor sewers, at the cost of about {{INR}}1,800 crore (18&amp;nbsp;billion rupees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Inflow to Yamuna to be cleaned up at last |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/inflow-to-yamuna-to-be-cleaned-up-at-last/509240/ |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date=Aug 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114221756/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/inflow-to-yamuna-to-be-cleaned-up-at-last/509240/ |archivedate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation zone==
On 25 April 2014, the [[National Green Tribunal Act]] (NGA) recommended the government to declare a {{convert|52|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch of the Yamuna in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as a conservation zone. A report prepared by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) panel was submitted to the NGA on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Panel--Scrap-Yamuna-riverfront-project-1398490017/ Conservation Zone recommended]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Yamuna Action Plan]] (YAP-I and YAP-II), pollution cleanup of Yamuna was conducted in line with the biological oxygen demand of Yamuna. Under these two phases, 286 schemes, including 39 sewage treatment plants, were completed in 21 towns of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana at a cost of {{INR}}1,453.17 crore (14.5&amp;nbsp;billion rupees). Sewage treatment capacity of 767.25&amp;nbsp;million litres per day was created by these efforts.

* "By taking bath in the Yamuna River people are liberated and become Krishna conscious." (Caitanya Caritamrita Antya 4.98 purport)
* "There are many devotees in Vrindavana who regularly bathe in the Yamuna, and this cleanses all the contamination of the material world." (Srimad Bhagavatam 5.8.31)
* "One should not give up the process of austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the water of the Yamuna. This is an item of austerity. Therefore, our Krishna consciousness movement has established a center in Vrindavana so that one may bathe in the Yamuna, chant the Hare Krishna mantra and then become perfect and return back to Godhead." (Srimad Bhagavatam 6.5.28 purport)
* "The Yamuna River washed Krishna's lotus feet when the Lord appeared in Vrindavana five thousand years ago. Lord Krishna sported daily with His boys and girlfriends in the Yamuna River and consequently, that river is also caranamrita." (Srimad Bhagavatam 11.6.19)
* "According to the Varaha Purana as quoted by Srila Jiva Gosvami, there is no difference between the water of the Ganges and the Yamuna, but when the water of the Ganges is sanctified one hundred times, it is called the Yamuna. Similarly, it is said in the scriptures that one thousand names of Vishnu are equal to one name of Rama and three names of Lord Rama are equal to one name of Krishna." (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.19.6 purport)

'''Yer Tanrı''' is the goddess of earth in [[Turkic mythology]]. Also known as '''Yer Ana'''.

With her father [[Tengri|Gök Tengri]] and her brother and husband [[Kayra]], she was the parent of [[Ay Tanrı]], [[Umay]], [[Ülgen]], [[Koyash]], and [[Erlik]]. As a [[List of fertility deities|fertility goddess]], she was recognized as the giver of crops and abundance. In the Spring and in the Autumn — before the beginning of the agricultural season and after the harvest — she was worshiped with sacrifices of food.

Yer Tanry was considered to be both a mother and wife to Gök Tengri. She appeared as a force of nature. In ancient Turkic mythology there was a theory that mortals were the product of the union of Tengri and Yer (Earth). In the [[Orkhon inscriptions]] it says: "In the beginning there was a blue sky above, a dark land below, and human sons in-between." (''Üze kök tengri asra yagiz yir kilindukda ikin ara kişi oğlı kılınmış.'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilimiz.com/dil/kultiginceviri.htm Kültigin Abidesi (Kultigin Monument)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkic people revered the Earth Goddess (Yer Ana) as a giver of crops and abundance. In the Spring, before the beginning of the agricultural season and in the Autumn, after the harvest, as a sign of gratitude for the abundance of food and happiness, the ancient Turkic peoples and Mongols made a sacrifice to the Earth Goddess. Milk, [[Kumis|kumys]] and tea were offered, and pleas were made for a fertile land and a rich yield.
