[[File:32 - 36 Dominick Street.jpg|thumb|300px|(2012)]]

The '''32, 34 &amp; 36 Dominick Street Houses''' are three [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] row houses on Dominick Street between [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson]] and [[Varick Street (Manhattan)|Varick]] Streets in the [[Hudson Square]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

==History==
Around 1826, twelve [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] brick [[row houses]] were constructed on the south side of Dominick Street from Nos. 28 to 50. Five of these houses &amp;ndash; Nos. 28 to 36 &amp;ndash; were built by Smith Bloomfield. Each house was {{convert|20|ft}} wide, except for No. 28 which was {{convert|20.8|ft}}. Nos. 40, 42 and 44 were demolished around 1922, and later on the empty lots were cleared and used as one of the {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} wide entrances to the [[Holland Tunnel]]. In 1926, No. 28 was demolished to make way for a building designed to be [[loft]]s.  No. 32 was used after 1878 as a rectory for the Church of Our Lady of Vilnius; it is now the one of the four remaining houses which is most intact, retaining much of its original architectural fabric.  Nos. 34 and 36 had an additional story added to it with an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] [[cornice]] c.1866, a typical alteration for the time.  Al three buildings were constructed the [[Flemish brick|Flemish bond brick]] pattern.&lt;ref name=desrep32&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2480.pdf|title=32 Dominick Street House Designation Report|last=Danza|first=Cynthia|date=March 27, 2012|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desrep34&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2481.pdf|title=34 Dominick Street House Designation Report|last=Danza|first=Cynthia|date=March 27, 2012|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desrep36&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2482.pdf|title=36 Dominick Street House Designation Report|last=Danza|first=Cynthia|date=March 27, 2012|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2012, the three houses were officially designated as landmarks by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], examples of row houses built in this style being exceptionally rare in New York City. The fourth surviving row house, 38 Dominick Street, was originally proposed for designation as well, but was ultimately declined by the commission because it had been renovated too far from its original style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citylandnyc.org/three-federal-rowhouses-on-dominick-street-designated/|title=Three Federal rowhouses on Dominick Street designated|last=Dobbs|first=Frank|date=May 2, 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali Ghaleb Himmat''' ({{lang-ar|علي غالب همت}}; born 16 June 1938 in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman who lives in [[Campione d'Italia]], Italy, near [[Youssef Nada]].&lt;ref name="leseprobe"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110808122640/http://www.freitag.de/buch-der-woche/die-vierte-moschee/die-parallelen-sind-frappierend Frappierende Parallelen] Leseprobe "Die vierte Moschee" von Ian Johnson, Internetseite der Zeitung [[Freitag]] [broken link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eu_866"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R0866:EN:HTML Commission Regulation (EC) No. 866/2003 of 19 May 2003 amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden] EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt;

== Personal life ==

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Himmat and Nada lived in the United States.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;"Capitalism's Achilles heel: dirty money and how to renew the free-market system" Raymond W. Baker, Verlag John Wiley and Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0471644889}} .

His daughter [[Huda Himmat]] was deputy chair of the [[Forum of European Muslim Youth and Student Organizations]] (FEMYSO).&lt;ref name="Samir Khalil Samir"/&gt;

== Business activities ==

Himmat was managing director and co-founder of [[al Taqwa Bank]], a company founded in [[Lugano]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/11057111 Brothers at bay - Egypt's government battles with the Muslim Brotherhood] [[The Economist]] 17.

== Religious activities ==

According to [[Ian Denis Johnson]], author of the book ''[[A Mosque in Munich]]'', Himmat is a member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="leseprobe"/&gt; From 1973 to 2002 Himmat ran the [[Islamic Community of Germany]] (IGD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-g-d.com/alles/uber%2Bunss2.htm |title=Über uns |accessdate=2017-07-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216113340/http://i-g-d.com/alles/uber%2Bunss2.htm |archivedate=February 16, 2006 }} IGD Webseite.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-20660202.html Guter Muslim] Beat Balzli, [[Der Spiegel]] 46/2001, 12 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibrahim El-Zayat]], a former shareholder of the al Taqwa Bank, succeeded Himmat as Chairman of the IGD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelspecial/d-56323061.html Wendiger Weltmann] Andrea Brandt, [[Der Spiegel]] Spezial 2/2008, 25 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accusations of criminal activity ==
In early 2005, [[Al Taqwa Bank]] was accused of supporting [[al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="swissinfo"&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/Home/Archiv/Verdacht_gegen_Al_Taqwa_nicht_erhaertet.html?cid=4537874 Verdacht gegen Al Taqwa nicht erhärtet] [[swissinfo]] 2 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/ita/multimedia/video/Telegiornale.html?cid=4512796 Nada scagionato]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Telegiornale, swissinfo.ch 1 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 the [[Attorney General of Switzerland]] canceled the criminal proceedings against the two Al Taqwa leaders [[Youssef Nada]] and Ghaleb Himmat.&lt;ref name="swissinfo"/&gt;

On 6 July 2009 [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] recommended removing Himmat and al-Taqwa Bank from the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267|UNSCR 1267]] sanctions list.&lt;ref name="09STATE69814"&gt;Clinton, Hillary. 09STATE69814.

In April 2008 an Egyptian military court sentenced Himmat [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] to ten years in prison for money laundering and supporting a banned organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6718001.stm Egyptian Brethren appear in court] BBC, 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/04/15/egypt-military-court-convicts-opposition-leaders Egypt: Military Court Convicts Opposition Leaders] [[Human Rights Watch]] 15 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 2012, [[Egyptian President]] [[Mohamed Morsi]] pardoned Himmat along with other [[Muslim Brotherhood]] officials sentenced by the [[Mubarak]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The former '''American Congress on Surveying and Mapping''' (ACSM) was an international [[professional association]] representing the interests of those engaged in measuring and communicating spatial data relating to the Earth's surface. Until recently, ACSM was composed of only two autonomous professional societies, namely:

* The [[American Association for Geodetic Surveying]] (AAGS)
* The [[National Society of Professional Surveyors]], Inc. (NSPS)

In 2012, ACSM legally merged into the NSPS. But it still considers AAGS to be a closely affiliated member organization. During the 2000s two previous member organizations of ACSM, namely the [[Cartographic and Geographic Information Society]] (CaGIS,) first, and then later on, the [[Geographic and Land Information Society]] (GLIS) removed themselves more or less from ACSM. 

However, GLIS still has some affiliation with NSPS, via their occasional contributions to a former ACSM publications: the quarterly Surveying and Land Information Science (SaLIS) technical journal which is now officially published by the NSPS but also continues to publish submissions from AAGS as well. They also previously contributed to the bimonthly ''Bulletin'', which is no longer in publication.

The '''Battle of the Grapevine Creek''' was a short battle between two large armed groups of the Hatfield family and the McCoy family which was the last offensive event during the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]] and marked the beginning of the Hatfields' defeat in the feud between the two families.

==Battle==
Shortly after the capture and murder of Jim Vance in January 1888, the Hatfield family, led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield]], prepared for one last major offensive against the McCoy family in order to gain revenge for the killing of Jim Vance and to achieve victory over the McCoy family to end the feud. When news of the Hatfields' preparations for war reached the McCoy side, the Hatfields were already en route to invade the McCoy territory, so Frank Phillips, the leader of the McCoy posse, rounded up every able man he could and led his posse to intercept the invading Hatfields. Both sides eventually met around the area of the Grapevine Creek on the West Virginia side of the [[Tug Fork River]] and began exchanging shots at each other. One group of the McCoy side managed to lure the Hatfields into one area of the battlefield while another group of McCoys moved to outflank them, which caused the Hatfields to suffer multiple casualties and made them retreat. A number of Hatfields did not manage to escape and were taken prisoner by the McCoys.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the McCoys scoring victory over the Hatfields and taking multiple prisoners both from the battle and prior to the battle, they put all of the Hatfield prisoners on trial with the permission of the Kentucky government for the various crimes they had committed during the feud, mainly the murder of the [[Randall McCoy]]'s sons for killing Ellison Hatfield and the killing of one of his daughters during the New Year's Eve massacre. All the Hatfields were found guilty and sent to prison except for Cottontop Ellison Mounts, the illegitimate son of Ellison Hatfield, who was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] as it was he who was proved to have killed Randall McCoy's daughter.

== History ==

The history of [http://www.businessnz.org.nz BusinessNZ] dates back more than 100 years.

In 1902 several regional [[employers' association]]s came together to form the '''New Zealand Employers Federation'''.

The motivation for the formation was to present a unified [[employer]] voice in [[collective bargaining]] and [[labour dispute]]s arbitrated by the [[Employment Court of New Zealand|Arbitration Court]].  While the impetus for its founding was to defend employer interests in bargaining and labour disputes, the Federation emphasised that this did not entail opposition to workers seeking to advance their legitimate interests, and that it supported [[profit-sharing]], [[copartnership|co-partnership]] and the work of labour organisations in working for fair terms and conditions for their members.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Federation was founded for the overall purpose of ongoing advocacy on behalf of business, economic and community wellbeing.

In 1905 the constitution of the Employers Federation of New Zealand was formally adopted.

By 1908 the Federation represented around 6,000 members.

Throughout the Great War (1914-1918), the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, [[World War II]] (1939-1945) and the ensuing post-war boom, the Federation advocated for business, economic and community wellbeing, and worked constructively with all successive governments.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 1951 the Employers Federation became an incorporated society and by 1971 represented around 10,000 members.

In 2001 the New Zealand Employers Federation merged with the '''New Zealand Manufacturers Federation''' to form Business New Zealand (BusinessNZ),&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:BPWFoundationlogocolor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Business and Professional Women's Foundation logo.]]
'''Business and Professional Women's Foundation (BPW)''' is an organization focused on creating successful workplaces. 

The work of BPW Foundation is supporting workforce development programs and workplace policies that recognize the needs of working women, communities and businesses. 

BPW Foundation houses The Rawalt Online Resource Center, a clearinghouse for information focused on working women and families.

==Current issues==
* Successful Workplaces Movement
* [[Pay equity]]
* Support for women veterans
* [[Contraceptive]] equity
* Family time flexible leave
* [[Equal Rights Amendment]]

==Structure==
The work of BPW Foundation is supported through corporate partnerships, grants and individual philanthropic donations.  Its Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) number is 10506. It is governed by a Board of Trustees.

==History==
The legacy of Business and Professional Women/USA began in 1919.

While mobilizing for [[World War I]], the U.S. Government recognized the need for a cohesive group to coordinate identification of women's available skills and experience. A [[Women's War Council]], financed through a federal grant, was established by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to organize the resources of professional women. It was guided principally by executives of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA). The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs was founded on July 16, 1919, at a meeting led by [[Lena Madesin Phillips]] of Kentucky. In the 1930s it became a charter member of the [[International Federation of Business and Professional Women]].

BPW/USA became the first organization created to focus on the issues of working women. BPW worked throughout the 1930s to prohibit legislation or directives denying jobs to married women and lobbied successfully to legislatively end the legal practice of workplace preference for unmarried persons and, in the case of married persons, preference for males. BPW/USA was one of the first women's organizations to endorse the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1937. 

At the advent of [[World War II]], BPW developed a classification system for women with specialized skills critical to the war effort and supported the formation of women's branches of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. While [[wage discrimination]] has existed in the U.S. since women and minorities first entered the paid workforce, its prevalence was not felt until the massive influx of women sought work during World War II. Immediately following the war, the [[Women's Pay Act of 1945]] - the first ever legislation to require equal pay - was introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]]. It was another 18 years before an equal pay bill made its way to the [[President of the United States|President]]'s desk to be signed into law.

BPW Foundation was incorporated in 1956 as the first foundation dedicated to providing resources to and about working women.  It included research, information, career development programs, workshops and other training opportunities.  The '''Marguerite Rawalt Resource Center''', established in 1980 and put on-line 2006, is a major resource for information and documents on the history of women and women in the workplace.
 
The establishment of "Status of Women" commissions in the U.S. in 1963 was due largely to BPW efforts. President [[John F. Kennedy]] recognized BPW's leading role in securing passage of the Equal Pay Act by giving BPW's National President the first pen he used when signing the Act into law.

[[Virginia Allan]] initiated the "Young Careerist" Program to develop the business and presentation skills of young women between 25–35 years of age. The first National Legislative Conference, held in 1963 in D.C., later developed into BPW's current Policy &amp; Action Conference, where members lobby Congress and the Administration on BPW's legislative issues.

BPW tackled "comparable worth" by calling for newspapers to stop the occupational segregation in classified ads (clustering of women in a few restricted occupations of low-paying, dead-end jobs). Numerous state and municipal governments revamped their pay scales, recognizing dissimilar jobs may not be identical, but may be composed of tasks, educational requirements, experience and other characteristics that are equivalent or comparable. In 1986, [[San Francisco]] became the first city in the nation to approve a pay equity referendum, implementing $34 million in increases for employees in female and minority-dominated jobs.  Continuing with BPW's focus on workplace issues, BPW lobbied Congress for passage of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], which finally passed in 1993.
     
Discussions on [[comparable worth]] were expanded to include enforcement and strengthening of existing Equal Pay legislation. The [[Pay Equity Employment Act of 1994]], followed by the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] (introduced in 1994) and the [[Paycheck Fairness Act]] (introduced in 1997) became BPW's focus legislation through the '90s. Then-Secretary of Labor, [[Elizabeth Dole]], and First Lady [[Barbara Bush]] addressed BPW's members at the White House Briefing during the 1990 "Lobby Day" event. Subsequent speakers have included Senator [[Tom Harkin]], First Lady (Senator) [[Hillary Clinton]] and Congresswomen [[Rosa DeLauro]] and [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]].

In 2005, BPW used its grassroots power to continue the [[Bureau of Labor and Statistics]]' (BLS) Working Women Series and to re-instate [[Lifetime TV]] on the [[DISH Network]] programming.  During this same year in October, BPW/USA launched Women Joining Forces:Closing Ranks, Opening Doors (WJF), a program to support women veterans as they transition from military to civilian life. This commitment made BPW/USA the first and only non-governmental agency to offer programming that supports women veterans. 

 
Workplace equity issues including [[sexual harassment]], opportunities for women [[veteran]]s, [[work-life balance]], [[health care reform]], [[dependent care]], [[tort reform]], increasing the [[minimum wage]], lifetime economic security and pay equity continue to be BPW's targeted issues.

In 2009 BPW Foundation merged with its sister organization BPW/USA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10184">In computer [[software]], '''business logic''' or '''domain logic''' is the part of the program that encodes the real-world [[business rule]]s that determine how data can be [[Create, read, update and delete|created, stored, and changed]].  It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a [[database]] or displaying the [[user interface]], system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.

==Details and example==
Business logic:
* Prescribes how [[business objects]] interact with one another
* Enforces the routes and the methods by which business objects are accessed and updated

Business rules:
* Model [[Real life|real-life]] business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)

Business logic comprises:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/bpm/features/5757.html?&amp;pp=1|title=The Challenge of BPM Adoption|date=2005-03-27|author=Steven Minsky|publisher=eBizQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Workflow]]s that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another.

Business logic should be distinguished from business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BusinessLogicDefinition|title=Definition of business logic|date=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business logic is the portion of an enterprise system which determines how data is transformed or calculated, and how it is routed to people or software (workflow). Business rules are formal expressions of business policy. Anything that is a process or procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. Welcoming a new visitor is a process (workflow) consisting of steps to be taken, whereas saying every new visitor must be welcomed is a business rule. Further, business logic is procedural whereas business rules are declarative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/br/Ulrich.pdf|author=William Ulrich|title=OMG Business Rules Symposium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224094752/http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/mn/special-events/br/Ulrich.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, an [[e-commerce]] website might allow visitors to add items to a shopping cart, specify a shipping address, and supply payment information.  The business logic of the website might include a workflow such as:
* The sequence of events that happens during checkout, for example a multi-page form which first asks for the shipping address, then for the billing address, next page will contain the payment method, and last page will show congratulations.

There will be also business rules of the website:
* Adding an item more than once from the item description page increments the quantity for that item.
* Specific formats that the visitor's address, email address, and credit card information must follow.
* A specific communication protocol for talking to the credit card network

The web site software also contains other code which is not considered part of business logic nor business rules:
* Peripheral content not related to the core business data, such as the [[HTML]] that defines the colors, appearance, background image, and navigational structure of the site
* Generic error-handling code (e.g. which displays the HTTP Error Code 500 page)
* Initialization code that runs when the web server starts up the site, which sets up the system
* Monitoring infrastructure to make sure all the parts of the site are working properly (e.g. the billing system is available)
* Generic code for making network connections, transmitting objects to the [[database]], parsing user input via HTTP POST events, etc.

==Business logic and tiers/layers==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
[[Image:Overview of a three-tier application vectorVersion.svg|thumb|right|Business logic in theory occupies the middle tier of a 3-tier architecture.]]

Business logic could be anywhere in a program.  For example, given a certain format for an address, a database table could be created which has columns that correspond exactly to the fields specified in the business logic, and type checks added to make sure that no invalid data is added.

Business logic often changes.  For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country.  Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or [[coupling (computer science)|loosely coupled]].  This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code.  Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the necessary changes and miss part of the system, leading to incorrect operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24260&amp;seqNum=3|chapter=Introduction to Enterprise Software|author1=Khawar Zaman Ahmed  |author2=Cary E. Umrysh |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Addison-Wesley|date=2001-10-17|isbn=0-201-73829-5|title=Developing Enterprise Java Applications with J2EE and UML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[multitier architecture]] formalizes this decoupling by creating a '''business logic layer''' which is separate from other tiers or layers, such as the [[data access layer]] or [[service layer]].  Each layer "knows" only a minimal amount about the code in the other layers - just enough to accomplish necessary tasks. For example, in a [[model–view–controller]] paradigm, the controller and view layers, might be made as small as possible, with all the business logic concentrated in the model.  In the e-commerce example, the controller determines the sequence of web pages in the checkout sequence, and is also responsible for validating that email, address, and payment information satisfy the business rules (rather than leaving any of that up to the database itself or lower-level database access code).

Alternative paradigms are possible.  For example, with relatively simple business entities, a generic view and controller could access database objects which themselves contain all the relevant business logic about what formats they accept and what changes are possible (known as the [[database model]]).

Some tiered schemes use either a distinct [[application layer]] or a [[service layer]], or consider the business logic layer to be the same as one of those.

==Tools and techniques==
Business logic can be extracted from procedural code using a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bring business logic to light: JRules 4.5 tames business rules with friendly tools|author=James Owen|publisher=JavaWorld|date=2003-09-19|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0919-iw-jrules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[business rules approach]] of software development uses BRMSs and enforces a very strong separation of business logic from other code.  [[User interface management systems]] are another technology used to enforce a strong separation between business logic and other code.  The [[magic pushbutton]] is considered an "anti-pattern": a technique that in this case creates undesirable constraints which make it difficult to code business logic in an easy-to-maintain way.

A [[domain model]] is an abstract representation of the data storage types required by business rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4056">'''Carman George Blough''' (November 11, 1895 – March 9, 1981) was an American accountant, professor of accounting, and civil servant. He is described as "one of the most influential 'high priests' of the profession in the Twentieth Century."&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Moonitz. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/246745 Memorial: Carman George Blough 1895–1981],"  ''The Accounting Review,'' Vol. 57, No. 1 (Jan., 1982), pp. 147–160&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Burns]], and [[Edward N. Coffman]]. ''The Accounting Hall of Fame: profiles of thirty-six members.'' College of Administrative Science, Ohio State University, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], to Silas S. and Mary Wertz Blough, Blough obtained his BA in economics in 1917 from [[Manchester College (Indiana)|Manchester College]], and his MA in 1922 from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin]]. In the same year he obtained his CPA certification for the state of Wisconsin. In the year 1932–33 he did graduate work at Harvard University.&lt;ref name="AHF 2015"&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/carman-george-blough/ Carman George Blough] in ''The Accounting Hall of Fame.'' Accessed 11.02.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation in 1917 Blough started as lecturer at the [[Bridgewater College]] in 1917, spent two years at Fond du Lac, Wisconsin High School as head of the commercial department, and was instructor in accounting at the University of Wisconsin from 1920 to 1922. From 1922 to 1929 he was employed in the state of Wisconsin civil administration. In 1929 he was appointed professor at the [[University of North Dakota]] and head of its accounting department, and in 1933 he moved to the [[Armour Institute of Technology]], where he was professor and head of the social science department for another year.&lt;ref name="AHF 2015"/&gt;

In 1934 Blough was among the first to join the new [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. He started as staff member, and became the first Chief Accountant of the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Grant.

From 1938 to 1942 he joined [[Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.]] as partner, but resigned when the United States entered [[World War II]], serving in several federal functions. In 1944 he became research director at the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]], and was an adjunct professor of accounting at [[Columbia University]] from 1947 until his retirement in 1961.&lt;ref name="AHF 2015"/&gt;

'''David Cowan''' (1742 &amp;ndash; 24 September 1808) was a Scottish farmer, naval officer, ship's captain, ferry operator and political figure in [[Upper Canada]]. He represented Essex County in the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] from 1804 to 1808.

He was born in [[Lanarkshire]] and emigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in 1770, serving as gardener for [[George Washington]] at [[Mount Vernon]].&lt;ref name="soundings"&gt;[http://www.provincialmarine.org/PM-Oct08News.pdf ''Marine Soundings'', a publication of the Provincial Marine Re-enactment Group, Amherstburg] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan served as a lieutenant in the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[American Revolution]] and went on to serve in the [[Provincial Marine]] for Upper Canada, commanding ships on the [[Great Lakes]]. He lived in [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] and then [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]]. Cowan also owned property in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].

Cowan is credited with bringing the first [[apple]] trees to the state of [[Michigan]] in 1796, a variety similar to the [[Red Calville]] which he brought to [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc1JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=history+apple+michigan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fVVuTu3zHsf4sgaBgY29BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20apple%20michigan&amp;f=false ''Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Horticultural Society of Michigan'', 1873]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowan died on board the ''Camden'' in Fort Erie harbour.&lt;ref name="soundings"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6289">The '''drawdown''' is the measure of the decline from a historical peak in some variable (typically the cumulative profit or total open equity of a financial trading strategy).

Somewhat more formally, if &lt;math&gt;X = (X(t), t \ge 0)&lt;/math&gt; is a random process with ''X''(0) = 0, the drawdown at time ''T'', denoted &lt;math&gt;D(T)&lt;/math&gt;,
is defined as

&lt;math&gt; D(T)=\max \left\{ 0, \max_{t \in (0,T)} X(t)- X(T) \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

The '''maximum drawdown''' (MDD) up to time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
is the maximum of the Drawdown over the history of the variable. More formally,

&lt;math&gt; \text{MDD}(T)=\max_{\tau\in (0,T)}\left[\max_{t \in (0,\tau)} X(t)- X(\tau) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Trading definitions==
{|class="wikitable floatright" | width="200"
|- style="font-size:75%"
|-align="center"
|colspan="1" | Pseudocode
|-
| rowspan="2" |

The following [[pseudocode]] computes the Drawdown ("DD") and Max Drawdown ("MDD") of the variable "NAV", the Net Asset Value of an investment. Drawdown and Max Drawdown are calculated as percentages:

 MDD = 0
 peak = -99999
 for i = 1 to N step 1
   # peak will be the maximum value seen so far (0 to i), only get updated when higher NAV is seen
   if (NAV[i] &gt; peak) 
     peak = NAV[i]
   endif
   DD[i] = 100.0 * (peak - NAV[i]) / peak
   # Same idea as peak variable, MDD keeps track of the maximum drawdown so far. Only get updated when higher DD is seen.
   if (DD[i] &gt; MDD) 
     MDD = DD[i]
   endif
 endfor
|}

There are two main definitions of a drawdown:

===1. How low it goes (the magnitude)===

:Putting it plainly, a '''drawdown''' is the “pain” period experienced by an investor between a peak (new highs) and subsequent valley (a low point before moving higher).{{cn|date=June 2015}}
:Next, the '''Maximum Drawdown''', or more commonly referred to as Max DD. This is pretty much self explanatory, as the Max DD is the worst (the maximum) peak to valley loss since the investment’s inception.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

In finance, the use of the maximum drawdown as an indicator of risk is particularly popular in the world of [[commodity trading advisor]]s through the widespread use of three performance measures: the [[Calmar ratio]], the [[Sterling ratio]] and the [[Burke ratio]]. These measures can be considered as a modification of the [[Sharpe ratio]] in the sense that the numerator is always the excess of mean returns over the risk-free rate while the standard deviation of returns in the denominator is replaced by some function of the drawdown.

===2. How long it lasts (the duration)===

:The '''Drawdown Duration''' is the length of any peak to peak period, or the time between new equity highs.
:The '''Max Drawdown Duration''' is the worst (the maximum/longest) amount of time an investment has seen between peaks (equity highs).

Many assume Max DD Duration is the length of time between new highs during which the Max DD (magnitude) occurred. But that isn’t always the case. The Max DD duration is the longest time between peaks, period. So it could be the time when the program also had its biggest peak to valley loss (and usually is, because the program needs a long time to recover from the largest loss), but it doesn’t have to be.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

When ''X'' is [[Brownian motion#Mathematics|Brownian motion]] with drift, the expected behavior of the MDD as a function of
time is known. If ''X'' is represented as
&lt;math&gt;X(t)=\mu t+ \sigma W(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;W(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a standard [[Wiener process]], then: when &lt;math&gt;\mu &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; the MDD grows logarithmically with time; when &lt;math&gt;\mu = 0&lt;/math&gt; the MDD grows as the square root of time; and when
&lt;math&gt;\mu &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; the MDD grows linearly with time (Magdon-Ismail et al. 2004).&lt;ref&gt;http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~amir/drawdown-jrnl.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking or other finance definitions==
===Credit offered===
Where an amount of credit is offered, a drawdown against the [[line of credit]] results in a debt (which may have associated interest terms if the debt is not cleared according to an agreement.)  

===Funds offered===
Where funds are made available, such as for a specific purpose, drawdowns occur if the funds - or a portion of the funds - are released when conditions are met.  &lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/drawdown&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Financial District''' in [[Orlando, Florida]] is the area of [[Downtown Orlando|downtown]] along Orange Avenue and Magnolia Avenue.
It also stretches over to Orange Blossom Trail to the west on the opposite side of the Downtown Industrial District and Paramore. The Orlando Financial District is still under a tremendous amount of preplanning and doesn't yet exist.

The financial district is one of the things that will serve as the mecca of [[Downtown Orlando|New Orlando]] [[New Urbanism]].

Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (CGC) at [[Seoul National University]] has developed the Government Competitiveness (GC) index which evaluates government achievements in the various fields and furthermore provides policy recommendations to increase competitiveness of government in the future.

== Description ==
'''Government competitiveness''' ('''GC''') is often confounded with similar [[concepts]]. One of the prominent examples is national competitiveness. A variety of institutions have developed indices measuring the level of national competitiveness. Two indices, the World Competitiveness Scoreboard (WCS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.org/wcc/wcy-world-competitiveness-yearbook/|title=World Competitiveness Scoreboard|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.org/|title=International Institute for Management Development|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Global Competitiveness Report|the Global Competitiveness Index]] (GCI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2014 and 2015|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  built by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/|title=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have come to dominate the field of competitiveness studies.

The [[International Institute for Management Development]] [[International Institute for Management Development#MD World Competitiveness Center (WCC)|WCS]] and the [[World Economic Forum]] [[Global Competitiveness Index|the Global Competitiveness Index]] view national competitiveness akin to how business-friendly a nation is, and focus upon economic and market indicators. As such, if a nation is a good place for foreign firms to do business and make money, it will, as a result, be viewed as competitive. Following this logic, the role played by a government then, is mainly restricted to constructing an environment that is attractive to businesses.&lt;ref&gt;For the general assessment on the two indices, see Ochel, W &amp; Rohn, O. (2006). Ranking of countries – the WEF, IMD, Fraser and Heritage Indices. CESifo DICE Report Vol. 4 no. 2. pp. 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressing the broader fields of government activities, several institutions have started to develop indicators emphasizing the role of government in driving development and national competitiveness. Prominent examples include [[Worldwide Governance Indicators|The World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators]] (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home|title=World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicator}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Quality of Government Institute|the Quality of Government Institute’s]] (QGI) (the University of Gothenburg) Quality of Government indicators(QoG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qog.pol.gu.se/|title=Quality of Government indicators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these two indices constitute important steps toward improving our understanding of how government contributes toward competitiveness, they have also revealed numerous theoretical and methodological shortcomings related to the study of governments’ role in fostering national competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;(2007){{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/4149.htm/|title=The Worldwide Governance Indicators Project: Answering the Critics. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4149}} For the critics on the WGI and its responses, see Kaufmann, D, Kraay, A, &amp; Mastruzzi, M.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (director: [[Tobin Im]]) has developed the GC index mainly focusing on government capacities and roles in national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net|title=Government Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After investigating the limited capabilities of existing competitiveness indicators to define and measure the level of GC, the CGC has tried to develop a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring GC.&lt;ref&gt;Im, T. (2014). Government Competitiveness 2013. Seoul: CM Press (in Korean); Im, T., Kim, S., Ko, G., &amp; Jo, W. (2014). Government Competitiveness: Theory and Evaluation Index. Seoul: Bakyoungsa (In Korean).&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Ho and Im (2012), the concept of GC can be defined as “the power of government to, in light of various constraints, take resources from in and outside of the country and improve social, economic and cultural conditions of the nation in order to sustainably enhance citizens’ quality of life.”  Moreover, the concepts of ‘constraints’ and ‘quality of life’&lt;ref&gt;Ho, A., &amp; Im, T. (2012). Defining a new concept of government competitiveness. The Korean Journal of Public Administration, 50 (3), p. 13 (In Korean).&lt;/ref&gt; can be interpreted in various ways, depending on a nation's unique environments.

By considering different experiences and policy practices between developed countries and developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arp.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/09/16/0275074013501856.full.pdf+html|title=Ho, A. &amp; Im, T. (2013). Challenges in Building Effective and Competitive Government in Developing Countries: An Institutional Logics Perspective, The American Review of Public Administration, first published online.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CGC measures the level of government competitiveness by applying different criteria to OECD and non-OECD countries. The seven fields of government activities both OECD and non-OECD countries have in common are followings: economy, education, health and welfare, agriculture and food, ICT, energy and environment, and governance. For OECD countries, three more fields are added: research and development, culture and tourism, and disaster management. Meanwhile, non-OECD countries have nine fields of government activities in total including infrastructure and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net|title=Government Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGC builds the GC index based on David Easton's system theory as a theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, D. (1953). The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the GC Index first analyzes competitiveness through each of the four levels- input, throughput (public management capacity), output, and outcome. The index then aggregates results from each level to produce an overall competitiveness score. This approach generates a variety of policy implications at each systemic level. The following are some sub-categories for each stage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net/data/ranking/Government%20Competitiveness%20Report_2016pdf.pdf|title= Center for Government Competitiveness. (2016) Government Competitiveness Report 2016, Graduate School of Public Administration. Seoul National University.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Input: ''' resources, infrastructure, government expenditure, environment &lt;br&gt;
''' Throughput: ''' human, fiscal, organizational capacity, policy, system, process &lt;br&gt;
''' Output: ''' production, growth rate, improvement level, immediate goal achievement &lt;br&gt;  
''' Outcome: ''' quality of life, satisfaction, social capital, ultimate goal achievement

'''Health Level-7''' or '''HL7''' refers to a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various healthcare providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is "layer 7" in the [[OSI model]]. The HL7 standards are produced by the [[Health Level Seven International]], an international [[standards organization]], and are adopted by other standards issuing bodies such as [[ANSI|American National Standards Institute]] and [[ISO|International Organization for Standardization]].

Hospitals and other healthcare provider organizations typically have many different computer systems used for everything from billing records to patient tracking.  All of these systems should communicate with each other (or "interface") when they receive new information, or when they wish to retrieve information, but not all do so.

[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Rodrigues|title=Health Information Systems: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnBJsRtfVbYC&amp;pg=PR39|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60566-988-5|year=2010|page=xxxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] considers the following standards to be its primary standards – those standards that are most commonly used and implemented:&lt;ref name="HL7 Primary Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Primary Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=1|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Continuity of Care Document]] (CCD) – a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.
* [[Structured Product Labeling]] (SPL) – the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3
* [[Clinical Context Object Workgroup]] (CCOW) – an interoperability specification for the visual integration of user applications
 
Other HL7 standards/methodologies include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Standards|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/index.cfm?ref=nav|publisher=[[Health Level Seven International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]] (FHIR) – a draft standard for the exchange of resources

* Claims Attachments – a Standard Healthcare Attachment to augment another healthcare transaction
* Functional Specification of [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) / [[Personal health record|Personal Health Record]] (PHR) systems – a standardized description of health and medical functions sought for or available in such software applications
* [[Gello Expression Language|GELLO]] – a standard expression language used for clinical decision support

==Primary standards==
HL7's primary standards are those standards that [[Health Level Seven International]] considers to be most commonly used and implemented.&lt;ref name="HL7 Primary Standards"/&gt;

===Version 2 messaging===
The HL7 version 2 standard (also known as Pipehat) has the aim to support hospital workflows. It was originally created in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 FAQs|url=http://www.hl7.org/about/FAQs/index.cfm?ref=nav|publisher=[[HL7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HL7 version 2 defines a series of electronic messages to support administrative, logistical, financial as well as clinical processes. Since 1987 the standard has been updated regularly, resulting in versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. The v2.x standards are [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] (e.g., a message based on version 2.3 will be understood by an application that supports version 2.6).

HL7 v2.x messages use a non-[[XML]] encoding syntax based on segments ([[Line (text file)|line]]s) and one-character [[delimiter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding HL7 Messages|url=http://www.interfaceware.com/understanding_hl7_messages.html|publisher=iNTERFACEWARE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segments have composites ([[Field (computer science)|field]]s) separated by the composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (components) separated by the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters are [[carriage return]] for the segment separator, vertical bar or pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) for the field separator, caret (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) for the component separator, ampersand (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;) for the subcomponent separator, and hashtag/pound (#) is the default truncation separator. The tilde (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) is the default repetition separator. Each segment starts with a 3-character string that identifies the segment type. Each segment of the message contains one specific category of information. Every message has &lt;code&gt;MSH&lt;/code&gt; as its first segment, which includes a field that identifies the message type. The message type determines the expected segment types in the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Messages and Descriptions|url=http://healthstandards.com/blog/2007/09/24/hl7-separator-characters/|publisher=Health Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segment types used in a particular message type are specified by the segment grammar notation used in the HL7 standards.

The following is an example of an admission message.  &lt;code&gt;MSH&lt;/code&gt; is the header segment, &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; the Patient Identity, &lt;code&gt;PV1&lt;/code&gt; is the Patient Visit information, etc. The 2nd field in the &lt;code&gt;PID&lt;/code&gt; segment is the patient's name, in the order, family name, given name, second names (or their initials), suffix, etc. Depending on the HL7 V2.x standard version, more fields are available in the segment for additional patient information.

HL7 v2.x has allowed for the [[interoperability]] between electronic Patient Administration Systems (PAS), Electronic Practice Management (EPM) systems, Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), Dietary, Pharmacy and Billing systems as well as [[Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR) or [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems.  Currently, the HL7 v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major medical information systems vendor in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards Organizations|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/standards.html|publisher=Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), [[Health and Human Services]] (HHS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3 messaging===
The HL7 version 3 standard has the aim to support all healthcare workflows. Development of version 3 started around 1995, resulting in an initial standard publication in 2005. The v3 standard, as opposed to version 2, is based on a formal methodology (the HDF) and object-oriented principles.

'''RIM - ISO/HL7 21731'''

The Reference Information Model&lt;ref name="RIM"&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Reference Information Model|url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/rim.cfm|publisher=[[HL7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RIM) is the cornerstone of the HL7 Version 3 development process and an essential part of the HL7 V3 development methodology. RIM expresses the data content needed in a specific clinical or administrative context and provides an explicit representation of the [[semantic]] and [[lexicon|lexical]] connections that exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tools &amp; Resources – V3 Modeling &amp; Methodology Tools|url=http://www.hl7.org/participate/toolsandresources.cfm|publisher=[[HL7]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HL7 Development Framework - [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/HL7 27931'''

The HL7 Version 3 Development Framework (HDF) is a continuously evolving process that seeks to develop specifications that facilitate interoperability between healthcare systems.  The HL7 RIM, vocabulary specifications, and model-driven process of analysis and design combine to make HL7 Version 3 one methodology for development of consensus-based standards for healthcare information system [[interoperability]].  The HDF is the most current edition of the HL7 V3 development methodology.

The HDF not only documents messaging, but also the processes, tools, actors, rules, and artifacts relevant to development of all HL7 standard specifications. Eventually, the HDF will encompass all of the HL7 standard specifications, including any new standards resulting from analysis of electronic health record architectures and requirements.

HL7 specifications draw upon codes and vocabularies from a variety of sources.  The V3 vocabulary work ensures that the systems implementing HL7 specifications have an unambiguous understanding of the code sources and code value domains they are using.

'''V3 Messaging'''

The HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of Secure Text messages (called ''interactions'') to support all healthcare workflows.

HL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax, as shown in this example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Spronk|editor-first=René|title=HL7 Message examples: version 2 and version 3|url=http://www.ringholm.de/docs/04300_en.htm|work=Ringholm|publisher=Ringholm bv|date=16 November 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2.2.1}}

&lt;/POLB_IN224200&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)===
{{main|Clinical Document Architecture}}

The HL7 [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) is an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The CDA Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwa6DDB4jY8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard was jointly published with ISO as ISO/HL7 27932.

===Continuity of Care Document (CCD)===
{{main|Continuity of Care Document}}
CCD is a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA.

===Structured Product Labeling (SPL)===
{{main|Structured Product Labeling}}

SPL describes the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3.

===CCOW===
{{main|CCOW}}
[[CCOW]], or "Clinical Context Object Workgroup," is a standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to share user context and patient context in real-time, and at the user-interface level.  CCOW implementations typically require a CCOW vault system to manage user security between applications.

==Other standards and methods==

===Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)===
{{main|Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources}}
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a draft standard from [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] designed to be easier to implement, more open and more extensible than version 2.x or version 3.  It leverages a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a [[HTTP]]-based [[RESTful]]  protocol, [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for user interface integration, a choice of [[JSON]] or [[XML]] for data representation, [[OAuth]] for authorization and [[ATOM]] for query results.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news

 | title=Setting Healthcare Interop On Fire
 | work=[[Forbes]]
 | author=Dan Munro
 | date=2014-03-30
 | accessdate=2014-11-22 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services Aware Interoperability Framework===
{{main|HL7 Services Aware Interoperability Framework}}

The HL7 Services-Aware Enterprise Architecture Framework (SAIF) provides consistency between all HL7 artifacts, and enables a standardized approach to Enterprise Architecture (EA) development and implementation, and a way to measure the consistency.

SAIF is a way of thinking about producing specifications that explicitly describe the governance, conformance, compliance, and behavioral semantics that are needed to achieve computable semantic working interoperability. The intended information transmission technology might use a messaging, document exchange, or services approach.

SAIF is the framework that is required to rationalize interoperability of other standards. SAIF is an architecture for achieving interoperability, but it is not a whole-solution design for enterprise architecture management.

=== Arden syntax ===
{{main|Arden syntax}}
The [[Arden syntax]] is a language for encoding medical knowledge. [[Health Level Seven International|HL7 International]] adopted and oversees the standard beginning with Arden syntax 2.0. These [[Medical logic module|Medical Logic Modules]] ([[Medical logic module|MLM]]s) are used in the clinical setting as they can contain sufficient knowledge to make single medical decisions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  They can produce alerts, diagnoses, and interpretations along with quality assurance function and administrative support.  An [[Medical logic module|MLM]] must run on a computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has the correct program installed.  Then, the MLM can give advice for when and where it is needed.

===MLLP===
A large portion of HL7 messaging is transported by Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP), also known as Lower Layer Protocol (LLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLP - Lower Layer Protocol|url=http://www.interfaceware.com/llp.html|publisher=iNTERFACEWARE}}&lt;/ref&gt; For transmitting via TCP/IP, header and trailer characters are added to the message to identify the beginning and ending of the message because TCP/IP is a continuous stream of bytes. Hybrid Lower Layer Protocol (HLLP) is a variation of MLLP that includes a checksum to help verify message integrity. Amongst other software vendors, MLLP is supported by Microsoft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLLP Receive and Send Components|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee409260%28BTS.10%29.aspx|publisher=[[MSDN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oracle Application Server Integration B2B User's Guide, Supported Protocols|url=http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B14099_19/integrate.1012/b19370/supp_protos.htm#BACIFDJG|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cleo (company)|Cleo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Secure Managed File Transfer Protocol is Right for You?|url=https://www.cleo.com/solutions/compare-protocols/|publisher=[[Cleo (company)|Cleo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional EHR and PHR specifications===
Functional specifications for an [[electronic health record]].

===The ORB Segment===
An ORB Segment carries information about an exam, diagnostic study/observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The HL7 OBR segment|url=https://corepointhealth.com/resource-center/hl7-resources/hl7-obr-segment/|publisher=Corepoint Health | accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a required segment in an ORM (order message)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/calendarofevents/FirstTime/Glossary%20of%20terms.pdf|title=HL7 Glossary of Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hl7.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an ORU (Observation Result) message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthstandards.com/blog/2006/10/05/what-is-an-oru-message/|title=What Is an ORU Message?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Health Standards|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Hutzler Brothers Palace Building''' is a historic [[flagship]] [[department store]] building located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]] and built by [[Hutzler's]]. It was constructed in 1888, with a south bay added in 1924. 

The original limestone [[Romanesque Revival|Romanesque]] eclectic façade is three bays wide and five stories in height. The ground floor façade was redesigned in 1931 in the [[Art Moderne]] style.  Hutzler's is believed to hold the record for longevity in an original location among American department stores, having been founded on this site in 1858.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-800.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Hutzler Brothers Palace Building|date=March 1983|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Peter Kurtze and Edward Perlman|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ingram Micro''' is an American distributor of information technology products. The company ranked 64th in the 2016 [[Fortune 500]].

In December 2016, Tianhai Investment (now known as [[HNA Technology]]), an associate company of [[HNA Group]], acquired Ingram Micro in an all-cash transaction {{fact span|text= with an [[equity value]] of approximately $6 billion.|date=July 2018}}

==History == 
[[File:Logo Softeurop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Softeurop logo 1989]]
Ingram Micro's origins trace back to the founding of distributor Micro D, Inc. in July 1979 by husband and wife team, Geza Czige and Lorraine Mecca, who were both teachers. The company started in [[Southern California]] and in its first year of business achieved approximately $3.5 million in sales. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corp.ingrammicro.com/About-Us/History/Company-Beginnings-Story.aspx |title=Company Beginnings Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rapidly expanded nationwide and held its public offering in 1983. Ingram Industries became a majority stockholder of Micro D in February 1986 when it acquired all of the common stock held by the company's founders, followed by the purchase of the remaining Micro D shares in March 1989.

Meanwhile in 1982, just three years after the founding of Micro D, entrepreneurs Ronald Schreiber, Irwin Schreiber, Gerald Lippes and Paul Willax founded Software Distribution Services in [[Buffalo, N.Y.]] Ingram Distribution Group, a unit of the privately held Ingram Industries, acquired Software Distribution Services in the spring of 1985 and renamed it Ingram Software. Ingram Software expanded in December 1985 with the purchase of Softeam, a [[Compton, California|Compton]], Calif.-based distributor. The operation was renamed Ingram Computer in February 1988.

After acquiring the remaining publicly traded shares of Micro D in 1989, Ingram Industries merged these two former competitors to create the microcomputer industry's first $1 billion computer products wholesale distribution company, renaming it Ingram Micro D &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corp.ingrammicro.com/About-Us/History.aspx |title=Company Beginnings Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The new company established headquarters in Santa Ana, Calif., and retained an East Coast operations center for sales, credit, technical support and customer service in Buffalo, N.Y. The “D” was dropped from the company's name in January 1991, creating Ingram Micro.

In 1996, 17 years after the founding of Micro D, Ingram Micro once again became a [[public company]], listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). That year, the company’s revenues totaled more than $12 billion.In 1989 Ingram Micro, then called "Ingram Micro-D", was a [[subsidiary]] of the privately owned [[Ingram Industries]] group, took over the Belgian Softinvest and its three Softeurop subsidiaries active on the Belgian, the French and the Dutch markets from [[Brussels]], [[Lille]] and [[Utrecht]]. This was Ingram's first foray outside the United States other than a few Ingram Industries subsidiaries. The company embarked on an active merge, acquisitions and foundation strategy in the European market.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In August 1993, Ingram Micro Belgium acquired [[Zaventem]] Electronic Dealer Distribution (Zedd) and much of its assets, including the right to distribute [[Hewlett Packard]] products.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In July 2005 Ingram Micro purchased AVAD, LLC, a wholesale distributor for home automation and A/V gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/stories/2005/07/11/daily13.html|title=Ingram Micro buys AVAD assets|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It sold this subsidiary in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/avad_acquired_by_private_equity_firm_former_klipsch_harman_execs_to_lead_th|title=AVAD Acquired by Private Equity Firm; Former Klipsch/Harman Execs to Lead the Co.|last=Jacobson|first=Julie|website=www.cepro.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shared Services Center in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], began operations in May 2009.

Ingram Micro built a presence in areas adjacent to its traditional distribution business, including enterprise computing, [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC); point-of-sale (POS); managed, professional and warranty maintenance services; mobility; physical security; and [[consumer electronics]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Other ventures in 2014 included entry into cloud computing, or software-, platform- and infrastructure-as-a-service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spring|first=Tom|url=http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300072375/ingram-micro-ups-cloud-ante-adds-partnerships-channel-enhancements-hosted-services.htm|publisher=CRN|accessdate=28 April 2014|title=Ingram Micro Ups Cloud Ante: Adds Partnerships, Channel Enhancements, Hosted Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Ingram Micro changed their logo and introduced a new tagline: "Ingram Micro helps businesses realize the promise of technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocbj.com/news/2014/jun/23/new-logo-ingram-micro/ |title=New Logo for Ingram Micro |publisher=ocbj.com |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Ingram Micro acquired Odin Service Automation platform from Parallels &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ingram-micro-completes-acquisition-of-odin-service-automation-platform-and-associated-technologies-solidifying-leadership-position-in-the-cloud-300195626.html |title=Ingram Micro Completes Acquisition of Odin Service Automation Platform and Associated Technologies, Solidifying Leadership Position in the Cloud |publisher=prnewswire.com | date=2015-12-21| accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $163.9 mln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018003/000101800316000071/im201510k.htm |title=Ingram Micro Annual 10K report for the fiscal year ending Jan 2, 2016; Note 4 — Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets |publisher=sec.gov | date=2016-02-25| accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Ingram Micro announced its agreement to be acquired by the Chinese company Tianjin Tianhai Investment, an associate company of mega-conglomerate [[HNA Group]], for $6 billion; upon completion, Ingram Micro would become part of Tianjin Tianhai Investment and therefore a subsidiary of HNA Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usa.ingrammicro.com/Pages/IngramMicro-HNAGroup.aspx | date=February 17, 2016 |title=Ingram Micro Enters Into Agreement to be Acquired by Tianjin Tianhai to Become a Part of HNA Group |accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the time that [[Alain Monié]], Ingram's chief executive, would remain in place.&lt;ref name=GFreport2016/&gt; [[Bharat Bhisé]], indirect minority owner of HNA Group at that time, as well as HNA Group director [[Tan Xiangdong]], were also elected into the 7-men board directors of Ingram Micro.&lt;ref name=GFreport2016&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/2016-12-12/600751_20161212_1.pdf|title=天津天海投资发展股份有限公司重大资产购买暨关联交易实施情况报告书|date=12 December 2016|publisher=GF Securities c/o Tianhai Investment|language=Chinese|via=Shanghai Stock Exchange|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction reportedly made Ingram the biggest revenue generator for HNA Group.

'''Jean Baptiste August Kessler''' (15 December 1853 – 14 December 1900) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] entrepreneur and oil explorer who was largely responsible for the growth and development of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., now known as [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

==Early life and career==

Kessler, who was known by his middle name August, was born in a family of 12 children, four of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Clercq|2010|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became managing director of the Royal Dutch nearly from its inception. [[Aeilko Jans Zijlker]] acquired the original oil concession in Indonesia and the "Royal" imprimatur but died suddenly of a tropical disease in 1890. The board of directors turned to Kessler, who was a son-in-law of Geldolph Adriaan De Lange, one of the directors, to head a committee of inquiry into whether the faltering enterprise was still viable. He took the post with the understanding he would be made managing director and run the company. Kessler had vast experience in the Dutch East Indies, having abandoned his studies at the [[Delft University]] at the age of 23 to seek his fortune there. He had become partner in Tiedeman &amp; Van Kerchem, an important business firm, but after financial difficulties in 1888 "returned broken and shattered in health to Europe, where he sought and found recovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|p=127, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Builder of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company==

Kessler literally built the Royal Dutch almost from scratch, under very difficult circumstances: "an inclement climate, a hostile jungle and ineradicable lalang (sharp, tough grass), local crews difficult to manage, equipment that did not fit, tropical diseases, operational set-backs such as fires, and absence of adequate geological know-how", wrote J. Ph. Poley in ''Eroica: The Quest for Oil in Indonesia (1850-1898)''. "There were also financial, regulatory and procedual hurdles to overcome...The Company survived mainly thanks to the turn-around effected by Jean Baptiste August Kessler."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Poley|2000|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Anthony Sampson put it, the company's origins belonged "to the world of [[Joseph Conrad]] rather than [[Anthony Trollope]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sampson|1975|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kessler arrived in [[Sumatra]] in October 1891, after a two-month sea voyage, he found that the works manager had disappeared in a huff. He discovered that the drilling site was in terrible shape, with essential supplies disappearing or strewn about in the constantly approaching jungle. But he plunged into his work with enormous energy. Due to his ability to quickly solve all kinds of technical problems and his incredible energy, he was accepted by his subordinates as "Toean Besor"—the Big Boss—not withstanding what many would describe as a difficult, high-strung personality.

[[Daniel Yergin]], in his history of oil [[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power]] wrote that "more than any other man", Kessler was responsible for the survival of the Royal Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yergin|1991|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "Kessler was a born leader, with an iron will, and with the ability to concentrate all his own energy and that of those around him on a single objective."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yergin|1991|p=58.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoting from Kessler's letters to his wife, Yergin illustrates the obstacles faced by the daring oil explorer: "Half-heartedness, ignorance, indifference, dilapidation, disorder, and vexation are everywhere apparent," Kessler reported. "If things go wrong, my job and my name are gone and perhaps my sacrifices and my extraordinary exertions will be repaid with censure in the bargain. Heaven preserve me from all that misery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yergin|1991|pp=74–75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In constant rain, Kessler attempted to connect the drilling site and refinery with a pipeline. Steamkettles were transported through a jungle path on rails, which were removed after the kettles had been pulled up in order to be used for the next stretch. A storm interrupted the supply of rice, resulting in severe food shortages. The drilling produced barely any oil.

Kessler, suffering from a fever, worked day and night and was everywhere with improvisations, giving instructions and managing the overall operation. With the greatest difficulty, Kessler and his team were able to get the supplies for a second tower. This one was a "spouter" and on Feb. 28, 1892, the first oil flowed through the new pipe to the refinery. The Dutch flag was raised.

Kessler returned to the Netherlands, nearly nine months after his "inspection trip" began, and focused on trying to secure the necessary capital for the still shaky enterprise. But within two years, oil production had dramatically declined, the new on-site works manager had quit and the company was nearly bankrupt. Kessler again returned to Sumatra to save the infant company. With a small group of workers--"I demand the nearly impossible but there is no choice; everything rests on my shoulders"—Kessler again managed to turn things around and tripled oil production within a year. He stayed in Indonesia until 1895, before returning to the Netherlands to focus on the commercial end of the business.

Under Kessler, the company relaunched its principal product under the brand name "Crown Oil," expanded refining capacity, built a fleet of tankers and constructed several tank farms. In 1897, Royal Dutch increased its capital to 5 million guilders (in 1890, the nominal capital had been 1.3 million guilders) and paid a dividend of 52 percent.  He also started nascent joint venture talks with [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|Marcus Samuel]], an important trader in oil products based in London under the "Shell" name, but a merger did not take place until 1907, with Royal Dutch taking a dominant role by owning 60 percent of the new holding company. Even mighty [[Standard Oil]] began to get concerned about the new rival in the business.

Dr. F.C. Gerretson, in his four-volume ''History of the Royal Dutch'', heaped praise on Kessler, describing his leadership as necessary for the building of one of the world's major companies: "He was high-strung and passionate, forceful and impervious, a man of strong prepossessions and often difficult to get along with. He was a born leader of men. Few knew so well how to concentrate all available resources upon a single purpose; how to inspire their fellow workers with their own enthusiasm and energy. Few were capable of such absolute devotion to the task once it has been undertaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|pp=127–128, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another book, Joost Jonker's and Jan Luiten van Zanden's ''A History of Royal Dutch Shell'', lauds Kessler's "unbelievable capacity for hard work...Kessler's sometimes strained behavior emanated from the inner tension between his formal training as a gentleman and his leadership drive, from the necessity to sustain polite discussion whilst craving to go into action". Kessler was a novice at oil and did not have much technical training, but "quickly developed a remarkable, intuitive grasp of the industry in all its aspects, founded on his keen sense for figures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=29, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unexpected death==

The hard work amid difficult surroundings led to Kessler's death one day shy of his 47th birthday. In 1898, oil production in the overworked oil field dropped precipitously. Kessler managed to get a concession for a new oil field from the local Sumatran king and in 1900 he went back to Dutch East Indies one last time. When he arrived he was sick and after only a few days he telegraphed the head office in The Hague that he needed to recuperate and would take the next boat back. He died from a heart attack when his ship made port in Naples, the first stop after the Suez Canal.

Kessler, according to Jonker and van Zanten, was "really Royal Dutch's founding father, the man who created the business and sustained it against the odds, perhaps even against economic common sense. His absolute firmness of purpose had built solid foundations" before his untimely death from exhaustion in the effort to create the nascent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=54, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerretson summed up: "It was Kessler's audacity, Kessler's faith, and Kessler's indomitable pertinacity in the hour of trial which brought the Company to where it stood when it lost him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerretson|1953|p=172, Vol. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

After his death, he was succeeded by a man he had hired as his deputy, [[Henri Deterding]], in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutch Biographical Dictionary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterding would later declare, "As a pioneer in oil, the part played by J.B. August Kessler stands second to none."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1938|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August and his wife Margo had four sons and two daughters. One of their sons, [[Jean Baptiste August "Guus" Kessler Jr.]], eventually became director-general of Royal Dutch Shell after Deterding resigned in 1936; he also played tennis for the Netherlands in the [[1906 Olympics]] in Athens. Their oldest son, [[Geldolph Adriaan Kessler]], also worked for the Royal Dutch before he left to help form and run the [[Koninklijke Hoogovens|Hoogovens]], the Dutch steel company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=357, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolf Kessler and his brother [[Boelie Kessler]] played football for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national side]].

'''John R Charman''' (born 1953) is an English businessman, who has made his career in insurance. He is currently CEO and chairman at [[Bermuda]] based Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd, which has been bought by Sompo Holding (Japan ) in March of 2017.

Nicknamed "King of the London Insurance Market", Charman was described as "famously strong-willed and opinionated" by the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref name="Charman speech - OneLimeStreet"&gt;[http://www.namesline.com/ubb/Forum5/HTML/000213.html Charman speech – OneLimeStreet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814174856/http://www.namesline.com/ubb/Forum5/HTML/000213.html |date=14 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charman is ranked in the top 100 people in the global finance industry;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/2004_06/coverstory/257-1.html 100 Most Influential People In Finance « Treasury&amp;Risk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124044036/http://www.treasuryandrisk.com/issues/2004_06/coverstory/257-1.html |date=24 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inside the top ten richest people in the [[City of London]]; and 321st overall in the 2004 [[Sunday Times Rich List]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,33923,00.html Sunday Times – Rich List&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006 in what is believed to be the largest sum awarded to an English wife in a contested case, Charman was ordered to pay his ex-wife by the [[High Court of Justice]] a sum of £48 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2298508.html This is so unfair, says tycoon as he counts the cost of his £48m divorce – Britain – Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It beat the £30 million awarded to WPP Group chief executive [[Martin Sorrell]]'s ex-wife in 2005 after their 32-year marriage ended in divorce.&lt;ref name="LawFuel - The Law News Network"&gt;[http://www.lawfuel.com/show-article.asp?ID=83891638 LawFuel – The Law News Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021182848/http://www.lawfuel.com/show-article.asp?ID=83891638 |date=21 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Charman made his fortune in the 1990, during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], offering war risk insurance on a 24-hour basis. Charman was the chief executive officer of Tarquin plc (a joint venture company among Insurance Partners, [[Harvard University]] and the Charman Group), the parent company of the Charman Underwriting Agencies at [[Lloyd's of London]]. He was also a deputy chairman of the Council of Lloyd's and a member of the Lloyd's Core Management Group and Lloyd's Market Board between 1995 and 1997.

Nicknamed "King of the London Insurance market", Charman earned the loathing of employees by banning entertainment of clients in company time, and refusing to indulge in long business lunches himself. One critic claimed Charman was so intimidating that colleagues ''"half-expect the theme from [[The Godfather]] to greet him as he arrives at his office."'' In 2002 Axis settled out of court with a woman who claimed Charman barred her from a meeting, saying: ''"We are discussing something we decided when you were having babies."''&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=398965&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ico=Homepage&amp;icl=TabModule&amp;icc=NEWS&amp;ct=5 Millionaire to appeal record £48 million divorce pay-out | the Daily Mail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charman made more money when he sold Tarquin/Charman Underwriting Agencies for £350 million in 1998 to the Bermuda-based ACE International Group, receiving £70.6 million in ACE shares.&lt;ref name="Charman speech - OneLimeStreet"/&gt;

Charman was made chief executive officer at ACE Global Markets (the merger of Charman Underwriting and assets of ACE), and in January 2001 was named group president and chief executive officer of [[Bermuda]] based ACE International Group, but left the company in March 2001 due to personal differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2001/03/20/12800.htm John Charman To Leave ACE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was paid £3,597,241 in lieu of notice, and £500,000 in a one-off pension contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contracts.onecle.com/ace/charman.sep.2001.05.16.shtml Sample Contracts – Severance Agreement – ACE London Services Ltd. and John Charman – Competitive Intelligence for Investors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charman immediately set up Axis Capital, a [[Bermuda]]-based reinsurance and insurance business with offices in London, [[Dublin]], Zurich and New York that is listed on the [[NYSE]]. The company aimed to cash in on the surge in insurance premiums after the 11 September terrorist attacks. In the financial year 2005 he was paid $7,741,762, and had stock options of $42,027,204 in Axis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/personinfo/FromMktGuideIdPersonTearsheet.jhtml?passedMktGuideId=382184 John Charman Profile – Forbes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Charman has informed the company that he will retire at the end of December 2008, he finally left Axis in 2012. 

In May 2013 he became CEO and Chairman of Endurance Specialty Holdings, another NYSE-listed, Bermuda-based reinsurance and insurance business with offices in Bermuda, London, Singapore, Zurich, New York and other locations. He invested $30'000'000 of his private fortune in Endurance at the beginning of his tenure. 

==Divorce==
Charman met his ex-wife Beverly in 1969 at school. When they married in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/charman_divorce John Charman Divorce Settlement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; neither had significant resources and the couple lived initially in her parents' home, and then in his mother's home in [[Strood]] near [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], Kent.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; The couple eventually moved to [[Sevenoaks]], where they bought a home now worth £2.75 million. The couple have two children: Nicholas (born 1981) and Michael (born 1986).

As Charman's wealth built, the couple created the Bermuda-based '''Dragon Trust''' in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/5242294.stm BBC NEWS | England | Kent | Wife wins 'biggest' divorce award&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which by 2006 had grown to a value of £65 million. The aim of the trust was according to Charman in his court papers agreed by the couple to preserve wealth for future generations.

After failing to secure a new house in England, in November 2003 Charman told his [[magistrate]] wife that he was taking up permanent residence in [[Bermuda]] and that their marriage was over. He has since set up home in a £2.1 million home in Bermuda, and has started a relationship with another woman.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Charman initially offered his ex-wife their home in Sevenoaks plus £6 million cash, but Mrs Charman, who was represented by Helen Ward, of [[Manches]], argued that the length of the marriage together with her substantial contributions did not justify such a significant departure from equality. Charman eventually offered his wife a package valued at £20 million. However, his wife still believed that the sum was not enough, and appealed the sum through the UK legal process, declaring the assets of the couple in her legal papers as:
* £52.8 million in her husband's sole name
* £5.4 million in her sole name
* £2.1 million in their joint names
* £64.6 million in the Dragon Trust

Mrs Charman also declared that a separate £25 million trust catered for the needs of their sons, and so therefore Dragon Trust was an asset under the control of Charman.

On 2 August 2006, Mr Justice Coleridge decreed in the [[High Court of Justice]] that a fair settlement would involve Charman giving his wife around 37 per cent of his assets, which would involve not only agreeing transfer of assets worth £8 million already under his wife's control, but also an additional one-off lump sum of £40 million. In his written judgement, Mr Justice Coleridge said: ''"The husband is genuinely bemused that the wife should regard his £20 million offer as anything other than reasonable, even generous. Her refusal to compromise on his terms has led him to deploy every available point to protect what he regards as his wealth generated entirely by his efforts. In the narrow, old-fashioned sense, that perspective is understandable, if somewhat anachronistic. Nowadays it must attract little sympathy."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120715174723/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1128032006 ''The Scotsman''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charman said: "This judgement is poor and blatantly discriminatory. By any reasonable standards this is an extraordinary decision. I made a fair and open offer to my wife of £20 million, which would be impossible for any reasonable person to spend in their lifetime." Charman later commented that he would be launching an immediate appeal, calling the High Court award "grotesque and unfair".{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In review, the amount of 37% was slightly less than the wife received in White v White, the House of Lords case in 2000. That case established the principle that for long marriages the courts should begin their deliberations on how to divide marital assets from the standpoint of a 50:50 split between husband and wife, regardless of who earned the money.&lt;ref name="LawFuel - The Law News Network"/&gt;

Charman began selling shares in Axis on the NYSE to meet the interim legal arrangements, prior to his appeal. If required to complete full payment, then it is calculated that he will need to sell off his shares in Axis.&lt;ref name="Charman speech - OneLimeStreet"/&gt;

Charman and his representatives, Withers, mounted a high-profile media campaign, arguing that White and subsequent decisions are discriminatory towards wealthy husbands. Charman and his legal team have been widely quoted in the British press.
On 9 March 2007, Mrs Charman was tied up and robbed of jewellery worth £300,000 at her home, in an incident police believe could have been motivated by the press coverage the case has attracted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2031763,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeal===
In a judgment handed down on 24 May 2007, the Court of Appeal dismissed John Charman's appeal against the award of £48 million made to his wife Beverley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=personalFinanceNews&amp;storyID=2007-05-24T100343Z_01_NOA436057_RTRUKOC_0_BRITAIN-DIVORCE.xml Reuters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108151152/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=personalFinanceNews |date= 8 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court reviewed the law as it stood at the end of May 2006 following the judgment of the House of Lords in the combined cases of Miller and McFarlane, interpreting and refining the guidance provided by the judgments in those cases.

The Court has provided clarity in a number of areas connected with the distribution of assets on divorce, particularly in three aspects: 
* The treatment of trust assets
* Guidance on the principles which apply when redistributing wealth between parties, particularly that property should be shared in equal proportions unless there is a good reason to depart from equality
* Guidance on the concept of a special contribution which either party can be found to have made to a marriage and how that should be quantified when redistributing assets on divorce

The Court has also called for a far-reaching review and reform of the law in this area in England and Wales.

Helen Ward of Manches, who has represented Mrs Charman throughout these proceedings, said, "This is a significant judgment and brings welcome clarity to a number of important aspects of the law relating to the distribution of assets on divorce."&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1834030.ece Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Solicitors profession will positively embrace the Court's suggestion for a broad review and reform in this area to create modern law reflecting today's modern society."

===Statement from Beverley Charman in response to Court of Appeal judgment===
"I acknowledge that the sum awarded to me is huge by any standards but the Court of Appeal has decided that it fairly reflects the contributions made by John and me during our twenty eight-year marriage.

The breakdown of our marriage has been a painful experience for all concerned.  Our divorce proceedings started nearly three years ago.  It has been a difficult time, not just for me but for our family.  I have been particularly concerned for our sons who have had to bear the discussion in public of our lives, our marriage and our divorce.

I am relieved that the appeal is over and I hope that John and I can now concentrate on building our new lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6686803.stm BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Connolly''' (19 January 1885 – 18 January 1961) was an Irish [[Fianna Fáil]] politician.&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1928&amp;MemberID=1891&amp;ConstID=215|title=Mr. Joseph Connolly |work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born 41 Alexander Street West [[Belfast]] in 1885, parallel to the Falls Road. He was educated at Milford Street School and at [[St Malachy's College]]. Joseph Connolly was an ardent nationalist and became a member of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].&lt;ref name=Gaughan&gt;Gaughan Rev. Anthony (1996), ''Memoirs of Senator Joseph Connolly.'' Dublin, Irish Academic Press. pp.27–42&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a personality clash with his father he decided not to join the family business and became apprenticed as an engineer with Coombe, Barbour &amp; Coombe Ltd. After a number of months he gave in his notice and secured a new post in the furniture trade of Maguire &amp; Edwards Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; He would subsequently establish a furniture business of his own in the city.

== Political life ==
Connolly was a co-founder of the first Freedom Club to propagate [[Sinn Féin]]'s message in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.74-5&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leader of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in Belfast between 1914 and 1916. On 31 January 1916 he married his fiancé, Róisín McGavock, who had completed an Arts Degree at [[Queen's University Belfast]], and they set up home together at Divis Drive near Falls Park. They had eight children together. He was in Dublin for [[Easter 1916 Dublin Rising|Easter 1916]] and [[Eoin MacNeill]] sent him to deliver his countermanding order to [[Drogheda]], [[Belfast]] and other planned areas of Volunteer mobilisation. After the [[Easter Rising]] went ahead anyway in Dublin Connolly was arrested in Belfast and was interned in [[Knutsford]] Prison and [[Reading Gaol]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, pp. 92–129&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release he helped re-organise Sinn Féin in Belfast. He was selected as a candidate for the party in the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]] for [[Mid Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Antrim]]. Though unsuccessful he polled 2,791 first preferences and saved his deposit.&lt;ref name=ark.ac&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm|title=The Irish General Election of 1918 |work=Nicholas Whyte|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland which had been set up by the [[First Dáil]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.165&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1921 to November 1922 he served as Consul General of the Irish Republic to the United States in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; He disposed of his business in Belfast at this time. One of his chief roles was to combat propaganda from Britain unfavourable to Sinn Féin and the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–22)|IRA]]. When the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was signed he was very cautious in forming an immediate public opinion on it though was nervous about splits in the wider organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Irish general election, 1922|1922 general election]], and the arrival of Professor [[Timothy Smiddy]] as an accredited Ambassador in Washington, he was informed that he no longer held any recognition in the eyes of the US Government and so he returned home to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; His family had at this time moved to Dublin and they set up home at Harold's Cross, never returning to Belfast. The [[Irish Civil War]] had then commenced and he formally tendered his resignation to the [[Irish Free state|Free State Government]].

In February 1923, he joined the [[National Land Bank]] for some months and was persuaded to assist Sinn Féin with the [[Irish general election, 1923|1923 general election]]. For economic reasons he retreated from politics and established a business in New York and spent some months there each year which he operated from 1923 to 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, pp.259–260.&lt;/ref&gt; He was aware of political developments in Ireland, however, and would join [[Fianna Fáil]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Connolly was elected a member of the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Free State Seanad]] for nine years and would serve until the Seanad's abolition in 1936. He was the leader of the Fianna Fáil delegation and the Leader of the Opposition.&lt;ref name=O&gt;O'Sullivan, Donal (1940), ''The Irish Free State and Its Senate.'' London, Faber and Faber. pp.240–1&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 general election]] [[Éamon de Valera]] appointed him as [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]] in his [[Government of Ireland|government]] and he became the first person to be a Minister while not a member of [[Dáil Éireann]].&lt;ref name="otoole-dooney" /&gt; (He was the only member of the Free State Seanad to serve as a minister, but two members of it successor [[Seanad Éireann]] served as ministers: [[Seán Moylan]] in 1957, and [[James Dooge]] in 1981–82.&lt;ref name="otoole-dooney" /&gt;)

As a minister, he accompanied de Valera to [[Geneva]] and the [[League of Nations]] where he attended many sessions. It was at this time that de Valera had voiced his concerns for the future of the League.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, pp.293–312&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Irish general election, 1933|1933 general election]] he was appointed as [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|Minister for Lands and Fisheries]] and was sent on a special mission by de Valera to the USA to repay the Republican bonds which had been bought in the USA during the [[Irish War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, pp.317–328&lt;/ref&gt; He represented the Government and spoke at the [[World Economic Conference (London)|World Economic Conference in London]] that year but the Conference was not a success partly because the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|Economic War]] was in progress between Ireland and the United Kingdom. His chief responsibility was overseeing the work of the [[Land Commission]] whose purpose was to re-distribute land to tenants. He transferred his Department of Fisheries to [[James Ryan (Irish politician)|James Ryan]], the then [[Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Minister for Agriculture]], in exchange for the Department of Forestry and oversaw increased planting throughout the state. He ceased being a Minister with the abolition of the Seanad.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.358-372&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 until 1950 he served as Chairman of the [[Office of Public Works]] (OPW), initially focusing on arterial drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Gaughan, p.389&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1939 he was appointed [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland#Mail|Controller of Censorship]] by de Valera. He acted in this role for two years until September 1941 serving under his former Cabinet colleague, [[Frank Aiken]]. He was based at Upper Yard, [[Dublin Castle]] and would in time be the subject of criticism from Opposition politicians and the press as lacking the necessary objectivity, discretion, tact and judgment for such a position. Similar criticism would also be levelled at Aiken.&lt;ref name="O Drisceoil"&gt;O Drisceoil, Donal (1996), ''Censorship in Ireland, 1939–45: Neutrality, Politics and Society.'' Cork, Cork University Press. pp.14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly argued for a strict censorship to prevent any comment that favoured either the British or German forces. This power extended to the press and to the reporting of Dáil speeches.&lt;ref name=Fisk&gt;Fisk, Robert (1996), ''In Time of War: Ireland, Ulster and the Price of Neutrality.'' Dublin, Gill and Macmillan. pp.162–3&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly was highly zealous at his work and his chief opposition came from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper and its editor, [[R. M. Smyllie]], and the [[Fine Gael]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]], [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]] who both viewed Connolly as an Anglophobe.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, p.167-9&lt;/ref&gt;

He resumed his work in the OPW in 1941 and retired from the Civil Service on 19 January 1950 when he was sixty-five. He wrote a number of plays including ''The Mine Land'' and ''Master of the House.'' Connolly also served as a director of ''[[The Irish Press]]'' newspaper for a time. He died in 1961, one day before his seventy-sixth birthday.

*draw out or receive back any part of their contributions to the partnership during its lifetime; or
*take part in the management of the business or have power to bind the firm.

If they do, they become liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm up to the amount drawn out or received back or incurred while taking part in the management, as the case may be.

Generally speaking, an individual or a legal body such as a company may be a partner in a limited partnership, either as a general or as a limited partner. A person cannot be both a general and a limited partner at the same time. 

==Registration process==

A ''limited partnership'' must be registered under the [[Limited Partnership Act 1907]]. To register, you must deliver a statement (Form LP5), signed by all the partners, to the [[Registrar of Companies]]. Partnerships whose principal place of business is situated [or proposed to be situated] in England and Wales should send their forms to the Cardiff office; those whose principal place of business is situated or proposed to be situated in Scotland to the Edinburgh office; and those whose principal place of business is situated or proposed to be situated in Northern Ireland to the Belfast office. 

The information supplied on the form must include the following:

#the firm's name;
#the general nature of the business;
#the address of the principal place of business;
#the full name of each partner, listing general and limited partners separately;
#the term (if any) for which the partnership is entered into;
#the date of its commencement;
#a statement that the partnership is limited and the description of every partner as such; and
#the sum contributed by each limited partner, and whether it is paid in cash or otherwise.

If all these particulars are in order, the Registrar will issue a certificate of registration, subject to the acceptability of the name. The Registrar will advise against the use of any name which is the 'same as' the name of a limited company, other legal body, or another limited partnership already on the register. In addition, the names of limited partnerships are controlled by the [[Business Names Act 1985]].

The general partners are responsible for the delivery of Forms LP5 and LP6 whether or not the preparation of the documents was delegated to accountants or to anyone else. 

The Limited Partnership Act 1907 provides for the imposition of penalties for various defaults in carrying out the requirements of the Acts and for failing to send to the Registrar the required forms. 

Notice of any arrangement or transaction under which a general partner will become a limited partner in the firm must be advertised in the [[London Gazette|London]], [[Edinburgh Gazette|Edinburgh]] or [[Belfast Gazette|Belfast]] Gazette, as the case may be. Notice must also be advertised in the Gazette of any arrangement or transaction under which a limited partner's share in the firm will be assigned to somebody else. Until this is done these arrangements or transactions have no effect.

==Limit on the number of partners==

A limited partnership may not normally consist of more than 20 [[person]]s. However, under section 717 of the [[Companies Act 1985]] there are a number of exceptions to this rule, including:

*a partnership carrying on practice as solicitors and consisting of persons each of whom is a solicitor;
*a partnership carrying on practice as accountants where the partnership is eligible for appointment as a company auditor;
*a partnership carrying on business as members of a recognised stock exchange and consisting of persons each of whom is a member of that exchange;
*a partnership carrying on business as surveyors, auctioneers, valuers, estate agents, land agents, or estate managers and consisting of persons of whom at least three-quarters are members of the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] and of whom not more than one-quarter are limited partners;
*a partnership carrying on business as insurance brokers and consisting of persons each of whom is a registered insurance broker or an enrolled body corporate. (For the meaning of 'registered insurance broker' and 'enrolled body corporate' see section 29(1) of the [[Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977]].);and
*a partnership which is a [[collective investment scheme]] the operator of which, or the manager of the investments of which, is an authorised person under Part IV of the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]] or a [[European Economic Area]] firm or a Treaty firm with permission under the Act to operate the scheme or manage the investments.

According to Indian Partnership Act of 1932, Section 4, "  Partnership is defined as the relation between two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of business run by all or any one of them acting for all ".

During his term as President and CEO OF RCBC, Tan also served as Executive Vice Chairman of RCBC, Vice-Chairman of RCBC Savings Bank, Director of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., and a Director of RCBC Capital Corporation.

====Bangladesh Bank Heist Controversy====

In February 2016, RCBC became involved in the [[2016 Bangladesh Bank heist|Bangladesh bank heist]] when one of the bank's branches was used by still unidentified hackers to transfer US$81 million, of the total US$951million that was initially stolen from the Bangladesh Central Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://nypost.com/2016/03/22/congresswoman-wants-probe-of-brazen-81m-theft-from-new-york-fed/ |title= Congresswoman wants probe of brazen $81M theft from New York Fed | access-date= 2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the incident, Tan went on voluntary leave in order to give the bank a free hand in its investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/2016/03/15/1562976/lorenzos-rep |title= Lorenzo’s ‘rep’ |access-date= 2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even after being cleared by the bank's independent investigation, Tan still chose to resign as head of RCBC on May 6, 2016 to take "full moral responsibility" for the incident. He was also subsequently cleared by all other investigating government  agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.canadianinquirer.net/2016/05/07/rcbc-prexy-lorenzo-tan-resigns-rcbc-board-clears-wrongdoing/ |title= RCBC prexy Lorenzo Tan resigns, RCBC Board clears him of any wrongdoing |date=2016-05-07 |website= Philippine Canadian Inquirer |access-date= 2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://interaksyon.com/business/134562/amlc-files-money-laundering-charges-vs-rcbc-execs |title= AMLA files charges vs RCBC execs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=TopStory&amp;title=dirty-money-watchdog-files-more-charges-for-bangladesh-heist&amp;id=136767 |title= Dirty money watchdog files more charges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan filed civil and criminal cases against the former RCBC bank manager at the center of the controversy for libel and perjury after she dragged his name into the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/national/rcbc-president-lorenzo-tan-resigns-after-bank-probe-clears-him-of-complicity-in-money-laundering/ar-BBsHSyj?li=AAb280R |title=Tan resigns after bank clears him of complicity in heist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/08/17/16/ex-rcbc-branch-manager-deguito-arrested |title=EX RCBC BRANCH MANAGER ARRESTED FOR PERJURY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manager admitted to lying in her statements given to the committee conducting an investigation in the Philippine Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/04/19/1574593/maia-deguito-admits-lying-rcbc |title= Maia Deguito admits to lying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent investigations into the hacking, which are being conducted by the Federal prosecutors in the United States, have revealed that the government of North Korea may have possibly had a role in the theft of the US$81 Million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/business/dealbook/north-korea-said-to-be-target-of-inquiry-over-81-million-cyberheist.html?_r=0  |title=North Korea Said to Be Target of Inquiry Over $81 Million Cyberheist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI is examining the totalitarian state’s link to the hack, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-03/a-baccarat-binge-helped-launder-the-world-s-biggest-cyberheist |title=A Baccarat Binge Helped Launder the World’s Biggest Cyberheist}}&lt;/ref&gt; US [[National Security Agency]] Deputy Director Rick Ledgett was also quoted as saying that, “If that linkage from the Sony actors to the Bangladeshi bank actors is accurate — that means that a nation state is robbing banks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/21/nsa-official-suggests-north-korea-was-culprit-in-bangladesh-bank-heist/ |title= NSA official suggests North Korea was culprit in Bangladesh bank heist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. has charged a North Korean computer programmer with the 2016 [[Bangladesh Bank heist|cyber-heist of Bangladesh's central bank]], among other celebrated global hacking attacks, alleging they were carried out on behalf of the regime in Pyongyang. The hacks also included the [[WannaCry ransomware attack|WannaCry 2.0 virus]], the [[Sony Pictures hack|2014 Sony Pictures attack]]. The hack of the central bank of Bangladesh saw at least $81 million stolen and transferred between a number of accounts in the Philippines and elsewhere, rendering most of it unrecoverable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/09/07/18/us-charges-north-korean-in-bangladesh-central-bank-sony-hacks |title = US charges North Korean in Bangladesh Central Bank Hack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun Life of Canada (Philippines)===
From 2005 to 2007, Tan was responsible for the business growth and leadership of Sun Life Financial in the Philippines. This consisted of three businesses: insurance, pre-need and mutual funds.

The insurance company was the second largest in the Philippines in 2005 with total assets in excess of Php60 billion, with a more than 2,300 strong agency force, and 53 branches and sales offices nationwide. By year-end 2006, Sun Life pre-need leapt to the number one position (from 6th), its mutual funds business overtook its main competitor, and its life insurance unit remained a strong second. That same year he was awarded the Insurance CEO (CEO EXCEL Awards) of the year by IABC/Phils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunlife.com.ph/philippines/About+us/Newsroom/Press+releases/Archives/2006/Pres++CEO+Lorenzo+Tan+Receives+CEO+Excel+Award?vgnLocale=en_CA|title=Sun Life Financial Philippines:  Pres. &amp; CEO Lorenzo Tan Receives CEO Excel Award|website=www.sunlife.com.ph|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine National Bank===
At 40 years old, Tan became the youngest president in the bank's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/156827/lorenzo-tan-new-pnb-prexy|title=Lorenzo Tan is new PNB prexy|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as President and CEO of the [[Philippine National Bank]], Tan was responsible for managing the fourth largest private bank in the Philippines with 324 domestic branches and 99 overseas offices with total assets in excess of Php 200 billion.

Tan joined the PNB on April 10, 2002 upon the invitation of its two major shareholders, namely, the government-owned [[Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation|Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC)]] and the [[Lucio Tan|Lucio Tan Group]]. At that time, the PDIC had just infused P7.8 billion in equity, in the form of preferred shares in the bank, in line with its five-year rehabilitation program. Tan was given the "principal mandate to lead the five-year rehabilitation efforts and turn around the financial performance from losses to profits." He is credited with the adoption of the "good bank-bad bank" strategy, which resulted in the early recovery of government funds, including premium in just the third year of the five-year rehabilitation prorgram. During his term as president of PNB, Tan was able to steer the bank to its first profitability in 6 years with Php 168 million net income in 2003 versus P2 billion projected loss, reversing Php 33 billion losses in 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/banking/272778/pnb%C2%92s-lorenzo-tan-resigns | title= Lorenzo Tan's Good Bank-Bad Bank strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finex.org.ph/publications/column/manila-bulletin/138-july-22-2010-philippine-national-bank-the-bank-with-a-glorious-a-humbling-history-and-with-a-bright-future | title=PNB: Humbling history, bright future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mr. Turnaround==

Lorenzo Tan is known in the banking industry as "Mr. Turnaround" for his knack of improving the economic performances of the various corporations he has headed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; When he was appointed president and chief executive officer of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) on February 1, 2007, the institution was under capitalized and its asset quality was poor.

Just one year later, following some structural, operational and capital changes, RCBC was able to report a 56% jump in unaudited net income to P3.21 billion (US$77.2 million); the steepest profit growth among the country's top 10 banks for that year. Before taking charge at RCBC, Tan was at the helm of Sun Life of Canada (Philippines) for 18 months, during which time he took the company to higher levels in insurance, the pre-need industry and mutual funds.

Prior to that, he was able to reverse the fortunes of the formerly state-owned [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB). One year under Tan's watch, PNB was able to go from five straight years of losses to enter the black in 2003. It then doubled net income in 2004 and was ready for privatization the following year, two years ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pnb.com.ph/index.php/about/history|title=History - Philippine National Bank|website=www.pnb.com.ph|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions, including being named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) for Banking in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orosa.org/TOYM%20List%20of%20Awardees%20-%20Ramon%20S.%20Orosa,%201971.htm|title=TOYM List of Awardees|last=|first=|date=|website=TOYM List of Awardees|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Manuel "Manda" Cadwallader Elizalde Jr.''' (November 8, 1936 - May 2, 1997) was a Filipino businessman. He was most known for claiming to discover a '[[Stone-Age]]' tribe called the [[Tasadays]] which was later exposed as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/tasaday|title=The Stone Age tribe that never was {{!}} 31 years of amnesia|last=Bolando|first=By AJ|website=newslab.philstar.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Elizalde was born in [[Manila]] on November 8, 1936 to [[Manolo Elizalde|Manuel "Manolo" Elizalde Sr.]] and Mary Cadwallader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/13/archives/tribesmens-mentor.html|title=Tribesmen's Mentor|first=|last=|work=The New York Times|date=13 August 1970|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to María del Carmen Marti and the couple had three children, Miguel, Manuel III, María del Carmen ("Mia"). The couple later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/scresolutions/resolutions/2002/january/149567.php|title=[G.R. No. 149567.January 28, 2002] NATAS-YA ENTERPRISES, INC., vs. INTESTATE ESTATE OF ELIZALDE, JR.|first=|last=|work=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|date=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasaday hoax==
In June 1971, Elizalde claimed discovery to a primitive tribe untouched by civilization, who lived in caves and survived by hunting and gathering. The "[[Tasadays]]" were found in a forest in [[South Cotabato]], [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Benjamin|date=2000|title="NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC", PANAMIN AND THE STONE-AGE TRIBE|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=25|issue=1|pages=77–88|jstor=29790625}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained traction in international media, some complimenting him as "a visionary idealist who cared more about the hard-pressed national minorities than about his family fortune".  However, all visits from foreign media and scholars were supervised by the [[PANAMIN|Presidential Assistance on National Minorities (PANAMIN)]] which was led by Elizalde himself. Independent anthropologists were prohibited to enter the Tasaday reservation area, thus at the time there was no scholarly paper published on the Tasaday. It was only after the Marcos downfall that a Swiss journalist, Oswald Iten, entered the area and found the so-called Paleolithic tribe dressed in T-shirts and living in huts. Many other local and foreign anthropologists decried Elizalde's claims, calling it an elaborate hoax.

==Other controversies==
Elizalde was regarded as a [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|crony]] of former President and dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Ricardo.|first=Manapat,|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=9719128704|location=New York|oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his brother Fred J. Elizalde became involved in many businesses such as mining, abaca farming, sugar centrals, tin plate manufacturing, paints, foods, distillery, real estate, rural banking, and agri-business. They both came into conflict with many of his laborers due to exploitation of sugar workers, refusing to pay livable wages and bonuses, and oppression of cultural minorities. Elizalde was the chief executive of several steel companies, which were favored and accommodated by the Marcos regime in funding, and guarantee of lucrative markets. He monopolized sales of tin plates, and raised prices at will, which rippled in the market with price increases. In one instance, Elizalde raised the price for tin plates by 17% in 1980, and threatened to increase it with another 7.5% unless the government continued to charge tax on imported raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28428684|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Ricardo.|first=Manapat,|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=9719128704|location=New York|oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Elizalde died on May 3, 1997. His family did not disclose the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/08/world/manuel-elizalde-60-dies-defender-of-primitive-tribe.html|title=Manuel Elizalde, 60, Dies; Defender of Primitive Tribe|last=Jr|first=Robert McG Thomas|date=1997-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Moon Tycoon''''' is a [[city-building game|city-building]] computer game released in 2001 by [[Anarchy Enterprises]] and [[Unique Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="moby"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moon Tycoon (Windows)|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/moon-tycoon|website=mobygames.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on the creation of a [[lunar colony]] or city.  Anarchy Enterprises described it as the "first 3-D Sim game ever", and noted that it has similarities to [[SimCity]] (which at the time was 2-dimensional).

==Gameplay==
Moon Tycoon has three campaigns to play through, each with its own story-line and placed around the year 2021.

Campaign 1: Earth is in a global energy crisis, and the only thing that can stop it is a precious ore called Helium 3 that can only be found on the moon.

Campaign 2: The energy crisis is over, but competition begins to heat up as corporations battle for lunar domination as space borne epidemics, discontent over living conditions and space disasters become more frequent.

Campaign 3: Mankind makes yet another leap as it begins the next stage of space exploration: the colonization of the asteroid belt beyond Mars.

Each campaign has ten levels to play through each with varied levels of difficulty.  All three campaigns make up a larger story, so they can only be played in order and starting with the first.
There is also a sandbox mode; where you can set the starting money, terrain type, ore quantity and average building life; it also lets you select the moon or asteroid.

The game is played on the Play Area, on which completed and under-construction structures are displayed.  Players also use this screen to begin construction of buildings and alter the terrain. The play area is raised up from the surrounding view and can also have a grid.

To the right of the Play Area is the Building Menus, Colony Management, Disasters, and Options.

The building menu display the various types of structures available for construction.  These buildings are divided into different categories: Housing and Medical, Tourism, Research, Rewards (earned by different objectives), utilities, and Industry.

The spiritual sequel, ''Deep Sea Tycoon'', often confused with ''[[Atlantis Underwater Tycoon]]'', is a [[2003 in video gaming|2003]] [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by Anarchy Enterprises and [[video game publisher|published]] by Unique Entertainment.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlantis Underwater Tycoon|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/atlantis-underwater-tycoon/mobyrank|website=mobygames.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game involves you building an underwater city in [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. It has a sequel, ''[[Deep Sea Tycoon 2]]'', developed by Pixel after Pixel.

=== Gameplay ===

The gameplay of ''Deep Sea Tycoon'' involves choosing one of 24 different characters and creating an underwater city filled with different buildings and features, from Mermaid Palaces to Seafood Restaurants. Through the character they choose and the choices they make in their city, the player can become a ruthless oil-tycoon, or something similar, or an [[environmentalist]].

The gameplay is similar to Moon Tycoon. The player creates buildings on a flat piece of land, that must be connected to other buildings by a "tunnel". The only major differences is the scenario, and the types of buildings each game uses.

The '''New Jersey Generals''' were a franchise of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL) established in 1982 to begin play in the spring and summer of 1983. The team played three seasons from 1983 to 1985, winning 31 regular-season games and losing 25 while going 0–2 in postseason competition. Home games were played at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], which was called [[Meadowlands Sports Complex|The Meadowlands]] for Generals games.

==Uniforms==
Team colors were scarlet, white, royal blue and sunflower gold. The primary logo was a gold five-star general wreath. Team helmets were solid scarlet with the logo decal on each side and a white face-mask. Home uniforms featured red jerseys with white numbers trimmed in royal blue, with numbers on the sleeves and no striping; pants were white with a single wide red stripe trimmed in blue down the sides from hip to knee. Road jerseys were white with red numbers trimmed in blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/tag/new-jersey-generals/|title=New Jersey Generals Archives - Fun While It Lasted|work=Fun While It Lasted}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was the second in the New York metropolitan area to be known as "Generals," since there was a professional soccer team in the late 1960s known as the [[New York Generals]].

==History==

===1983===
From the beginning, USFL founder [[David Dixon (businessman)|David Dixon]] placed a premium on putting a team in the New York area. Initially, real estate magnate and future U. S. president [[Donald Trump]] was tapped to own the team. However, he backed out after paying an initial installment on the franchise fee, hoping instead to buy the struggling [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Needing a credible owner with the means to front a team in the nation's biggest market, Dixon persuaded Oklahoma oil magnate [[J. Walter Duncan]] to step in. Duncan had originally been slated to own the USFL's [[Chicago Blitz|Chicago franchise]], as he'd grown up in Chicago. However, he readily agreed to shift to New York.&lt;ref name=Reeths&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Football League, 1982-1986|last=Reeths|first=Paul|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|date=2017|isbn=1476667446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan took on former [[New England Patriots]] coach [[Chuck Fairbanks]] as a minority partner; Duncan knew Fairbanks from his days as head coach at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Fairbanks also served as general manager and head coach. They initially had an uphill battle to get a lease at Giants Stadium, but were able to obtain one on condition that they brand their team as "New Jersey" rather than "New York."  They named the team the "Generals" after the large number of generals based in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name=Reeths/&gt;

The team made a big splash by signing [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning underclassman [[Herschel Walker]], a running back from the [[University of Georgia]]. While the USFL had followed the NFL's lead in banning underclassmen from playing, league officials were certain that this rule would never withstand a court challenge.  In an even more ominous development, Walker did not sign a standard player contract. Rather, he agreed to a three-year personal-services contract with Duncan.  The contract was valued at $4.2 million—more than double the USFL's salary cap of $1.8 million.  Nonetheless, the other owners knew having the incumbent Heisman winner in their fold would lend the USFL instant credibility, and allowed the contract to stand.  

Despite the signing of Walker, who rushed for 1,812 yards and 17 touchdowns, the Generals finished their inaugural season with a 6–12 record.  This was largely due to a porous defense which gave up the third-most points in the league (437).

===1984===
At 66 years old, Duncan soon tired of flying 2,000 miles from Oklahoma to New York to see his team play. He was not willing to be an absentee owner, and decided to sell to a local buyer. After the 1983 season, he found one in Trump, who had initially angled for the franchise in 1982 before backing out.&lt;ref name=Buck&gt;{{cite book|title=Football For A Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL|last=Pearlman|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|date=2018|isbn=978-0544454385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Trump tried to lure legendary coach [[Don Shula]] from the [[Miami Dolphins]]. Once Shula declined, the Generals hired former [[New York Jets]] head coach [[Walt Michaels]].&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt;  

The Generals responded to their poor 1983 showing with an influx of veteran NFL talent for 1984, including [[wide receiver]] [[Tom McConnaughey]], [[quarterback]] [[Brian Sipe]], [[defensive back]] [[Gary Barbaro]], and [[linebacker]]s [[Jim LeClair]] and [[Bobby Leopold]]. Both Walker and [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Maurice Carthon]] rushed for over 1,000 yards (Walker 1,339; Carthon 1,042) as the Generals went 14–4, defeating the eventual champion [[Philadelphia Stars (football)|Philadelphia Stars]] twice for that franchise's only two losses of the season. The Stars defeated the Generals 28–7 in a first round playoff game.

===1985===
The 1985 season saw the heralded signing of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback [[Doug Flutie]] of [[Boston College]]. Despite Flutie's inexperience, the Generals traded Sipe to the [[Jacksonville Bulls]] to ensure Flutie would start.&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt; Flutie struggled at times but played well overall until he suffered a broken collarbone against the [[Memphis Showboats]] in the season's 15th game and did not play again. The 1985 Generals finished 11–7 behind Walker's pro-football record 2,411 rushing yards but lost again to the Stars (transplanted to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]) in the first round of the playoffs, 20–17.

===1986===
Almost from the moment Trump bought the Generals, he sought to use them as a vehicle to get an NFL team. To this end, he began advocating moving the USFL from a spring schedule to a fall schedule, directly opposite NFL. His long-term plans called for moving the Generals across the [[Hudson River]] to New York, which had not had a team play within its borders since the Jets moved from [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens]] to the Meadowlands. He intended to have the Generals play at Shea until the construction of a new 80,000-seat "Trump Stadium" in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt;

In 1984, he convinced most of his fellow owners to move to a fall schedule in 1986. Trump contended that if the USFL were to hold its own against the NFL, it would eventually force a merger with the more established league—in which the owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment more than double.

The Generals acquired the assets of one of the teams displaced by the vote to move to the fall, the [[Houston Gamblers]], during the extended offseason. This was widely reported as a merger, since the Generals inherited all of the Gamblers' player contracts–including those of quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] and wide receiver [[Ricky Sanders]].  Michaels was fired, replaced with former Gamblers coach [[Jack Pardee]], who planned to bring Kelly and the Gamblers' high-powered [[run and shoot offense]] with him.  Fans immediately dubbed the Kelly-Walker led Generals as the USFL's "Dream Team." 

However, the revamped Generals never played a down. The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won a minimal verdict in an [[antitrust]] lawsuit against the NFL; the league folded soon afterward.

Numerous Generals players, including Flutie, Walker and center [[Kent Hull]] went on to productive NFL careers. Flutie also starred in the [[Canadian Football League]]; Hull (with Gambler quarterback Kelly) played in four [[Super Bowl]]s with the [[Buffalo Bills]], and Flutie was the last quarterback to have led the Bills to the NFL playoffs until the 2017 season.

'''Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates''' (commonly known as '''"Out &amp; Equal"''') is a [[United States]] lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) workplace equality [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]].

Out &amp; Equal describes its organizational vision as, "To achieve workplace equality for all regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, or characteristics ." Out &amp; Equal provides training and resources to LGBT employees and corporations alike through advocacy, training programs and events.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://outandequal.org/mission-vision Mission/Vision &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt;

Out &amp; Equal achieved 501(c)(3) status in 2004.

==Mission==

Out &amp; Equal's mission is to "educate and empower organizations, human resource professionals, [[Employee Resource Groups]] (ERGs) and individual employees through programs and services that result in equal policies, opportunities, practices, and benefits in the workplace regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, or characteristics".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==History==

Out &amp; Equal's founder, [[Selisse Berry]], was hired in December 1996 by the [[United Way of America|United Way]] of the Bay Area as director of the Building Bridges&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversity-executive.com/article.php?article=427 Who’s Who in Diversity and Inclusion]&lt;/ref&gt; training program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://outandequal.org/history History &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt; The Building Bridges program developed partnerships with fellow LGBT organizations around the Bay Area. Berry ran the program and built coalitions as a single-person staff working out of the [[Pacific Center in Berkeley]], California, and by September 1997 she moved into the United Way Bay Area (UWBA) offices in San Francisco.

[[File:Pride2010.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Out &amp; Equal at San Francisco Pride 2010|Out &amp; Equal at ''[[San Francisco]]'' Pride 2010.]]

By 1998, three LGBT workplace organizations merged in an effort to effectively collaborate on their common mission of creating safe and affirming workplaces for LGBT individuals—called the Pride Collaborative. These organizations included Building Bridges, [[A Group of Groups]] (AGOG), and Progress.

In 1999 [[The Pride Collaborative]] merged with [[COLLEAGUES]], a national organization that sponsored the annual Out &amp; Equal Conference aimed at human resource professionals and LGBT employees, to form Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates, and the current organizational structure was born. That same year, [[Progress's Leadership Summit]] and COLLEAGUES' Out &amp; Equal Conference combined resources to produce the annual Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit, one of the keystone programs of the organization.

In January 2004, after years of being supported by the United Way of the Bay Area, Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates became an independent 501 [c] 3 organization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Out &amp; Equal is headquartered in San Francisco's Financial District and in 2015 announced the opening of a second office in Washington, DC.

Out &amp; Equal annually holds a training and networking event called the [[Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit]] in rotating locations around the United States. The Workplace Summit hosts thousands of LGBT employees, human resource professionals and organizational representatives each year for a few days of training and networking. The Workplace Summit includes an award ceremony aimed at recognizing leaders in LGBT workplace equality called [[The Outies]].

Out &amp; Equal's Workplace Summit is considered to be appropriate for federal training in compliance with [[5 U.S.C. Chapter 41]].

===Global LGBT Workplace Summit===
In 2012 Out &amp; Equal held their first international Summit in London. This dynamic event brought together people from around the world to consider ways to build greater equality in the workplace for LGBT people and allies. Attendees came together to share best practices, engage with colleagues from around the world, and strengthen the diversity of global workplaces. Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, IBM Europe Chairman Harry van Dorenmalen, and organizational consultant John Amaechi were among the speakers at the Global LGBT Workplace Summit. The conference featured 24 workshops covering a broad range of topics focused on LGBT workplace issues around the world.[[File:Walllogo.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Out &amp; Equal at Workplace Summit | Out &amp; Equal in Dallas, TX]]

===Momentum Gala===
The Momentum Gala is Out &amp; Equal's annual celebration and gala dinner held in San Francisco which honors prominent activists in the LGBT movement, organizations dedicated to diversity and inclusion in their workplace, and features LGBT entertainers and inspirational speakers.

===Training===
Out &amp; Equal offers diversity training, educational resources and consulting services to senior management, human resource professionals, employee resource groups and individual employees to promote LGBT workplace equality.

LGBTCareerLink allows users to upload job ads, articles and tips, as well as other career-building resources .

==Workplace Policies==
===ENDA===
As a workplace equality advocacy organization, Out &amp; Equal has publicly supported the passage of [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|ENDA]] . Out &amp; Equal has issued public statements urging constituents to contact their United States House Representatives to proceed with the passage of ENDA. During San Francisco Pride Parades, Out &amp; Equal has provided signage to parade participants displaying support for ENDA.

===DADT===
Considering the military a workplace, Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates took an early stance against [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]] policies. In February 2008, Selisse Berry wrote in an open letter to Congress and [[Nancy Pelosi]] stating, "We believe that in these times of international crisis (and at all times), the military has a duty to recruit and retain the most qualified people, foster genuine teamwork, and set an example that ALL American citizens matter. We believe that Congress has a moral obligation to repeal policies that have prevented the military from achieving these goals."

===Marriage Equality===
Leading up the 2015 [[Supreme Court of the United States|SCOTUS]] ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates was one of 379 employer organizations that signed on to an ''amicus curiae'' brief&lt;ref&gt;"BRIEF OF 379 EMPLOYERS AND ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING EMPLOYERS AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS [http://www.outandequal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MLB_Employees_Amicus_Brief-Obergefell-v.-Hodges-FINAL-FINAL.pdf " http://www.outandequal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MLB_Employees_Amicus_Brief-Obergefell-v.-Hodges-FINAL-FINAL.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; which urged the High Court to consider the burdens imposed on both employers and employees by a fractured legal landscape with no uniform rule on same-sex marriage.

Out &amp; Equal's "Business Case for Marriage Equality" was penned in 2010 and remains a critical tenant of the organization's overall work.

===Immigration===
In light of national outcry for immigration reform, Out &amp; Equal joined a coalition of LGBT organizations around the United States in a public statement to support the [[Uniting American Families Act]] (UAFA) which protects the rights of same-sex couples during the immigration process into the United States. In a partnership with organizations including [[The Council for Global Equality]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], Out &amp; Equal publicly stated that, "An estimated 17,000 young children are being raised by LGBT parents in binational families and those children face the very real possibility of losing a parent, or leaving the only country they have ever called home."

===Other===

== Life ==
In Innsbruck, he completed his [[Matura]] at a Handelsakademie in 1959. He studied law. In 1964, he founded Sitour Austria in Innsbruck and produced panorama and slope marking boards as well as slope guidance systems ("signalisation touristique"). His second company, Feratel Media Technologies AG, founded in 1978, developed in the early 1990s panoramic image, live broadcast weather panorama television as a tourist marketing tool, which is broadcast by various television networks. At the same time, the company develops eTourism products for the European market.

From 1978 to 1990, Peter Schröcksnadel was an instructor for general skiing in the Austrian Schiverband and from 1987 to 1990 was vice president, and then president. In 1992, he was awarded the title of professor by the Federal Ministry of Science.

As a result of the doping scandal during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], Schröcksnadel resigned from his post as Vice President of the Austrian Olympic Committee (ÖOC) the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,485410,00.html Doping im Wintersport: Ausschluss für Österreicher, Sperre für Langläufer]''. &lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia, Peter Schröcksnadel spoke in a newspaper interview about the political discussions surrounding Russia's policy. He criticized a boycott of the games demanded by politicians, and was pleased that the Chancellor and the Minister of Sport of Austria wanted to visit the games. He did not want to judge the human rights violations in Russia, and advised athletes not to speak out politically. He interpreted the release of political prisoners as a positive impact of the Winter Olympics in Sochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Würde keinem Sportler raten, sich politisch zu äußern"|periodical=Der Standard|publisher=|url=http://derstandard.at/1388650057170/Ich-wuerde-keinem-Sportler-raten-sich-politisch-zu-aeussern|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-11-28|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2014-01-03|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the stadium|Pride Park Stadium}}
[[File:Office Building and Pride Park Stadium - geograph.org.uk - 1058487.jpg|Office building on Pride Park, with [[Pride Park Stadium]] in the background|thumbnail]]'''Pride Park''' is a [[business park]] on the outskirts of the city centre of [[Derby]], England. Developed in the 1990s, It covers 80 hectares of former industrial land between the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] and railway lines. [[Pride Park Stadium]] and [[Derby Arena]] are both located in Pride Park.

==History==
The site was formerly part of the railway yards, and was derelict for many years. It was the original site of Derby's railway manufacturing industry, but land here had also been used for gas and coke works, gravel abstraction and landfill. These uses left behind a cocktail of contaminants, including tars, phenols, heavy metals, ammonia and boron. Extensive redevelopment took place over 10 years to reclaim the site, including the building of a new access road to open the area up. Part of the site has been transformed into a nature reserve called [[The Sanctuary (Derby)|The Sanctuary]], in conjunction with [[Derby City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prideparksanctuary.com/background.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupants==
[[File:Pride Park.jpg|thumb|Pride Park Stadium]]
[[File:Frontage of Derby Velodrome at Pride Park, Derby, England.JPG|thumb|Derby Arena]]
* It has been home of [[Derby County F.C.]]'s [[Pride Park Stadium]] since 1997 when they relocated from the [[Baseball Ground]] in the [[Normanton, Derbyshire|Normanton]] district.
* [[Derby Arena]] is a multi-purpose sports and events venue adjacent to Pride Park Stadium, which opened in 2015.
* A Park &amp; Ride car park for access to Derby city centre is located next to the stadium.
* Internet bank [[Egg plc]] had its headquarters and call centre in the business park until 2011 when it was taken over by Barclaycard, and closed. The building was subsequently occupied by HEROtsc, retaining its function as a [[call centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Derby-held-HERO-ve-end-line-year/story-18099872-detail/story.html retrieved 6/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* The business park also houses a [[Holiday Inn Express]] hotel and several car dealerships.
* The sports goods retailer [[JJB Sports]] has offices on the Park.
* [[Derby Manufacturing UTC]], a [[university technical college]] opened in September 2015.

==Expansion Plan==
Derby County Football Club are proposing to expand facilities on offer around the football stadium with a £20 million development plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derbycounty-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&amp;id=336236&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the club being unsuccessful in their bid to include the stadium as a venue in England's bid to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/8414235.stm | work=BBC News | title=Milton Keynes picked for 2018 bid | date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2011, Derby County Football Club announced that they had submitted plans to [[Derby City Council]] for a £7 million development of land outside Pride Park Stadium, which the club named "The Plaza @ Pride Park".&lt;ref name="Plaza 2 statement"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2468631,00.html| publisher = dcfc.co,uk| title = Press Release: The Plaza @ Pride Park| date = 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These plans include five [[Coffeehouse|cafes]]/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of [[Office|office space]]. These plans have been scaled down from the planned £20 million pound development proposed in 2007.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-15147480| publisher = BBC News| title = Derby County submits plans for new Pride Park plaza| date = 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby County CEO Tom Glick, said that these plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations which will be introduced in the [[The Football League|Football League]] from 2012, as revenue from the Plaza will be reinvested back into the club.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2 statement"/&gt;

This planned development also coincides with a plan from the City Council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed Plaza.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2"/&gt;

'''Robert Trunz''' (born 3 April 1954) is a Swiss born music producer, businessman and sound expert. A Native of [[Lucerne]] from the valley of the lakes [[Seetal]] [[Switzerland]], Robert Trunz's love for music and sounds was triggered at an early age. His introduction to High End audio came with his work for exclusive distributors of well known Hifi brands in the mid 70’s. In his spare time Trunz helped in organizing a series of Jazz concerts at the Aula in Baden (Switzerland) where he met artists like Ian Carr, Klaus Doldinger, Alphonse Mouzon and [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], Trunz gained retail experience by building up the High End Hifi section of a shop in wealthy Lachen on the Lake of Zurich. It was here in 1979 when he first met John Bowers who hired him as an independent marketing and product consultant. In 1981 Trunz moved to England where he took over the Marketing of B&amp;W Loudspeakers turning the ailing manufacturer into a profit making and fast expanding export orientated loudspeaker company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roberttrunz.ch/2010s.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/artist/Robert+Trunz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

After John Bowers premature departure in December 1986 Robert Trunz became majority shareholder and president of B&amp;W Loudspeakers. This was also the time when he conceptualized and founded the record label B&amp;W Music which later became MELT 2000. An experienced organiser of people, musicians and events, Trunz is passionate about indigenous (jazz, world, African) music  and has worked with different artists from around the world. Many visits to South Africa has seen him discovering new talent like the late [[Moses Taiwa Molelekwa]] and producing for seasoned artists like Pops Mohammad, [[Busi Mhlongo]], Airto Moreira, Flora Purim, [[Madala Kunene]], Brice Wassy, Mabi Gabriel Thobejane, Thabang Tabane, Frank Magongwa, Gontse Makhene, Bafana Nhlapo, Amampondo and [[Sipho Gumede]] to name a few. telling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roberttrunz.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melt2000.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melt2000.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music business==

1987 Robert Trunz collaborated with [[Claude Nobs]] launching the "B&amp;W Platinum Music Club" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] that later became the Q (Quincy Jones) and expanded into the Miles Davis Hall. Trunz’s initiation of a multi million  Pounds research and development project headed by Laurence Dickie, led in 1994 to the launch of new ground breaking technologies wrapped up in the world-famous reference speaker NAUTILUS only to be topped ten years later by the same engineer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roberttrunz.ch/1980s.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/04/bowers-and-wilkins-and-peter-gabriel-push-audiophile-bandw-music-clu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://geardiary.com/2008/09/20/review-bw-music-club/&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1996 after having suffered set backs with his health, Robert Trunz sold his shares and left B&amp;W to carry on his love and dedication to music, its recording techniques and reproduction. "B&amp;W Music" became "Melt 2000" with sub-labels "Electric Melt" und "Blueroom Released" with the associated Blueroom Loudspeakers manufacturing the range of POD speaker (now Scandyna). 1997 Robert Trunz assists his friend and engineer Laurence Dickie who also left [[Bowers &amp; Wilkins|B&amp;W]] to work on his own projects establishing his own small research and development lab.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundstageultra.com/index.php/features-menu/general-interest-interviews-menu/264-searching-for-the-extreme-laurence-dickie-of-vivid-audio-part-two&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.randolphjordan.com/schizophone/interview-with-laurence-dickie-of-vivid-audio/&lt;/ref&gt;

==MELT 2000 years==

After his move to South Africa in the year 2002 Trunz relaunched MELT 2000 and focused more on Indigenous Jazz, World and African music. Artist collaborations from around the world have been recorded by MELT since its inception in South Africa. The type of music produced by MELT 2000 is influenced by African rhythms and has elements of Jazz, oral history and story telling. With the assistance of Robert Trunz Vivid Audio was born 2002 in Durban South Africa under the leadership of Laurence Dickie and Philip Guttentag. Dic's genius and intense work led to the launch of the proud successor of Nautilus – the GIYA G1 that signaled Robert’s return to a more active role in the company. in 2009 after a personal friend fell victim of crime in South Africa and after being away for 30 years, Robert Trunz returned with his son Nico Tando to his native Switzerland where he formed a consultancy company with  the help of his friends Andreas Meyer and Beatrice Pistor to distribute and promote VIVID AUDIO products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electricmelt.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vividaudio.ch/music/world-of-music/melt-2000.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africanjazz.info/molelekwa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Trunz started FOREST JAM SCHWEIZ an educational non profit organisation that puts together music students and master musicians who are willing to pass on their knowledge and tradition. After a successful first gathering in Melchtal Switzerland Trunz has taken the project to Madagascar in March 2015. In November 2015 several artists from Southern Africa together with Trunz formed a Non Profit organization called Forest Jam Southern Africa which is based in Durban, South Africa.

'''Ronald William Miller''' (born April 17, 1933) is an American businessman and former professional [[American football]] player.&lt;ref name="nfl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/ronmiller/profile?id=MIL542718|title=NFL Roster for Ron Miller|publisher=[[National Football League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president and CEO of [[The Walt Disney Company]] from 1978 to 1984 and is president of the board of directors of the [[Walt Disney Family Museum]]. Miller is the son-in-law of [[Walt Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://waltdisney.org/about/board-of-directors/ron-miller|title=Ron Miller|date=2015-08-31|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ronald William Miller was born near Los Angeles, California, on April 17, 1933, only eight months before his future wife [[Diane Disney Miller|Diane Marie Disney]]. His mother, who worked in a candy factory, and father, a tire salesman, emigrated from Canada before his birth.

A student athlete at the [[University of Southern California]], a 21-year-old Miller was introduced to 20-year-old student [[Diane Disney Miller|Diane Disney]] on a [[blind date]] after playing in a football game. They married in a small Episcopal church ceremony in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] on May 9, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/ron-and-diane-get-married|title=Ron and Diane Get Married|last=brianne|date=2017-05-08|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then served in the [[United States Army|Army]] and played professional football before he was knocked unconscious during a game—one where [[Walt Disney]] was in attendance.

"My father-in-law saw me play in two [[American football|football]] games when I was with the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. In one of them, I caught a pass and [[Night Train Lane|Dick 'Night Train' Lane]] let me have it from the rear. His forearm came across my nose and knocked me unconscious. I woke up in about the third quarter. At the end of the season, Walt came up to me and said, 'You know, I don't want to be the father to your children. You're going to die out there. How about coming to work with me?' I did and it was a wise decision on my part.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite video|title=Walt - The Man Behind the Myth|medium=video|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; I'm really very proud of having been a professional athlete. I think it teaches you to be competitive, to accept challenges and to see things through. I realize the image some people have of jocks, but I think that certainly has changed over the years," Miller told entertainment reporter [[Dale Pollock]] in August 1984.

==Early history at Disney==
Miller initially worked at Walt Disney Productions for a few months in 1954 as a liaison between [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]] and [[Disneyland]] before he was drafted into the army later that year. When he came home from the army, he played professional football, however later he was prompted by Disney to return to work for him.&lt;ref name=video/&gt;

Disney sponsored his son-in-law and got him into the [[Directors Guild of America|Screen Director's Guild]] and Miller worked as a second assistant on ''[[Old Yeller (film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957). He soon rose up the ranks to a variety of producer positions and also directed some of Disney lead-ins for the popular weekly [[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disney television series]].

In 1958, [[Clint Walker]] walked out of the popular [[Warner Bros.]] television Western ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' for a variety of reasons. Bill Orr, who was [[Jack L. Warner]]'s son-in-law, called in Miller to [[audition]] as Walker's replacement, and was impressed enough to schedule a screen test. Disney stepped in and told Miller to forget [[acting]], that Disney was grooming him for the position of [[Film producer|producer]]. Walker resolved his differences with Warner Bros. and returned to the show in 1959. As a result, Miller never attempted acting again.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Walt Disney: An American Original|publisher=Disney Editions|ISBN=0-7868-6027-8|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Miller spent his time in the film division and his co-producer credits appear on such Disney films as ''[[Son of Flubber]]'', ''[[Summer Magic]]'', and ''[[That Darn Cat!]]''. His first movie with full producer credit was ''[[Never a Dull Moment (1968 film)|Never a Dull Moment]]'' (1968).

Miller was credited as producer on films including ''[[Tron]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', and ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]''.

==President of Walt Disney Productions==
Miller became president of [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] in 1978 and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] in 1983. Miller pushed the Company to expand and explore, creating the [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] label and the [[Disney Channel]] in 1983. Much like Walt before him, Miller was an innovator—experimenting in early computer animation with films, such as ''[[Tron]]'' (1982); funding an upstart [[Tim Burton]] for stop-motion animation shorts ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'' (1982) and [[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|''Frankenweenie'' (1984)]]; and planting the seeds for future projects, including ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988).

Under his leadership, Disney became the target of [[corporate raid]]ers and takeover attempts, and many influential shareholders criticized Miller's leadership. In 1984, fellow Disney family member [[Roy E. Disney]] (son of Walt Disney's brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]), [[Stanley Gold]], and shareholder [[Sid Bass]] ousted Miller in favor of a trio of non-Disney executives, [[Michael Eisner]], [[Frank Wells]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]].&lt;ref name=disneywar&gt;{{cite book | author=Stewart, James | title=[[DisneyWar]] | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2005 | isbn=0-684-80993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silverado Vineyards Winery==
{{main|Silverado Vineyards Winery}}
After Miller left The Walt Disney Company in 1984, he and Diane resettled in [[Napa Valley]], which became their permanent home. Ron and Diane established [[Silverado Vineyards Winery|Silverado Vineyards]] in 1981,&lt;ref name="Silverado Vineyards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silveradovineyards.com/winery/ron_diane|title=Silverado Vineyards|website=www.silveradovineyards.com|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; four years after the first acreage was purchased near the small town of [[Yountville, California]]. The couple has championed environmental efforts in wine making, including helping to restore local riverbanks and creek beds and adopting [[solar power]] and hybrid-engine technology in the wine industry.&lt;ref name="Silverado Vineyards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/about/board-of-directors/ron-miller|title=Ron Miller|date=2015-08-31|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">'''Sectoral output''' for an industry or combination of industries ("sector") is the value of the sector's [[gross output]] minus the value of shipments within the sector from one establishment to another. 
Value here is measured for a specified time period and usually in units of nominal money.  It may be converted to constant units by multiplying by a [[price index]] to adjust for changes in prices over time and changes in quality of the goods and services produced.
A sectoral output measure is conceptually different from measures of [[gross output]] or [[value added|value-added output]].  Gross output for the sector consists of sales, or receipts, and other operating income, plus commodity taxes and changes in inventories.  Value-added measures exclude the value of intermediate inputs such as material, energy, and services, whether from the same industry or others. Thus gross output is larger than sectoral output which is larger than value-added output.
Sectoral output is the measure of output used in "KLEMS" [[multifactor productivity|multifactor measures of productivity]], which attempt to account for all direct inputs to production: capital services (K), labor services (L), energy (E), materials purchased (M), and services purchased (S)
When calculating [[labor productivity]], a value-added measure of output should be used to avoid counting other inputs (like purchased materials) as if they were created by the labor and capital applied within the sector.
The definition of the sectoral output has been attributed to Frank M. Gollop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/mfp/mprgul95.pdf Gullickson, William. Measurement of productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">The '''Skid Row City Limits Mural''' is an 18-by-50 foot mural displayed on San Julian Street in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It features a map demarcating [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]]'s legally recognized boundaries alongside an official-looking sign, replete with city seal, reading "Skid Row City Limit, Population: Too Many." This is the initial installation of a mural project that will eventually cover the whole wall on the San Julian block north of 6th Street.&lt;ref name="LA Times Mural Story"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Gale|title=For Skid Row Residents and Advocates, Mural is a Sign of Survival|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-skid-row-mural-20140824-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Weekly Mural Story"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romero|first1=Dennis|title=Skid Row Gets City Recognition Through Murals|url=http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/08/06/skid-row-gets-city-recognition-through-murals-photos|website=LA Weekly|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phase 1 of Skid Row Super Mural.jpg|thumbnail|The Skid Row City Limits Mural]]

Installed in compliance with the city's mural ordinance, the project was organized by Skid Row activist [[General Jeff]] Page with local street art crew Winston Death Squad. It was carried out solely with the labor of Skid Row citizens and without the aid of any service organizations. The piece represents a reaction to the growing practice among commercial groups of referring to historic areas of Skid Row with alternative designations. It emphasizes Skid Row's historic and official significance with a citation of the 2006 Jones v. City of Los Angeles court decision that specifies Skid Row's physical boundaries as between Main and Alameda streets to the west and east, and Third and Seventh streets to the north and south. 

[[Los Angeles City Council]]man [[José Huizar]]'s office has hailed the mural, saying, "It's community pride on the one hand, it's cleverly done and it creates conversation and debate, which often great public art does."&lt;ref name="LA Times Mural Story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Weekly Mural Story" /&gt; In its annual street art review, LA Weekly named the Skid Row City Limits mural the city's best new street art mural of 2014. &lt;ref name="LA Weekly Best of"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simpson|first1=Isaac|title=10 Best L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2145">'''Sven Gunnarsson''' (d. 1678) was a founder of the [[New Sweden]] colony, owner of land which today is most of present-day [[Queen Village, Philadelphia|Queen Village]] in [[Philadelphia]], and a progenitor of the [[Du Pont family]] in modern-day [[Delaware]].

==New Sweden colony==
Gunnarsson was sent by the Swedish government in 1639 to work in the new colony, and by 1645 had become a freeman. In 1653, he was one of 22 signers of a petition of grievances against Gov. [[Johan Printz]], which ultimately led to his removal. He volunteered to defend [[Fort Christina]] against the Dutch invasion, but after the colony was surrendered, removed with his family north. They settled on {{convert|1125|acre|km2}} at a place called Wicaco, a former Indian settlement, which would become what is modern-day Queen Village in Philadelphia. His land was home to the first log church in the area, built in 1677, today known as the [[Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Church]].

Sven Gunnarsson died in 1678 and was one of the first buried at the church. He had five children: Anders, Olle, Gertrud, Sven, and a daughter of unknown name. His son [[Sven Svensson]] would go on to serve in the government at [[Upland Court]] and the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]], while the son of Anders, Andrew Swanson, would become a progenitor of the [[Du Pont family]] in modern-day Delaware. The old patronymicon would be anglicized to Swanson in many instances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colonialswedes.org/Forefathers/Swanson.html ''Sven Gunnarsson and his Swanson family'' (New Sweden Colonial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swindon Town==
Brady tried to follow his daughter into football and became chairman of Swindon Town in 2000 for only a few months.  The club was in [[Administration (British football)|administration]].

During his time at Swindon he was involved in discussions to move the club from their [[County Ground (Swindon)|County Ground]] location. Despite involvement of the council and Brady being willing to spend to facilitate the move, the club remains at the same location.&lt;ref name=Cg&gt;{{cite news|title=Terry Brady seeks assurances from council over stadium future|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/archive/2000/04/14/Wiltshire+Archive/7409634.Terry_Brady_seeks_assurances_from_the_council_over_stadium_future_LET_S_TALK_by_JOHN_CARTER__and_SAM/|accessdate=17 May 2000|newspaper=Www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk|date=14 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portsmouth==
After leaving Swindon, Brady was appointed as a non executive club director of [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] by his friend and chairman [[Milan Mandaric]].&lt;ref name=Pfc1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brady Bunch|url=http://www.portsmouth-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/the_brady_bunch_12306/index.shtml|publisher=Www.portsmouth-mad.co.uk|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, following the departure of manager, [[Harry Redknapp]], Brady described his move to bitter local rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] as 'the biggest betrayal possible'.&lt;ref name=Hrbetrayal&gt;{{cite web|title=Portsmouth accuse Redknapp of betrayal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2392598/Portsmouth-accuse-Redknapp-of-betrayal.html|publisher=Www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=17 May 2013|author=Christopher Davies|date=9 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandaric  attempted to recruit former Southampton manager [[Gordon Strachan]] to the job after Redknapp's departure. Strachan declined the  appointment as he felt his association with Southampton would cause him problems in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strachan turns down Portsmouth job|url=http://espnfc.com/print?id=319827&amp;type=story|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the club appointed [[Velimir Zajec]].&lt;ref name=Vz&gt;{{cite web|title=Zajec named as Pompey boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4111337.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Hunt]], the founder of the family dynasty.

Hunt was born in [[Pana, Illinois]]. He served during [[World War II]] in the Pacific with the [[380th Bomb Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. Hunt flew on the first bomber from the 380th to land in Japan, and flew on a [[B-24 Liberator]] representing the 380th during a flyover of [[Tokyo Bay]] to mark the Japanese surrender on the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']].&lt;ref name=DMNObit/&gt;

Hunt attended the [[University of Arkansas]], where he studied [[chemical engineering]], but at his uncle Herbert's suggestion, he worked for the family oil interests in [[Wyoming]], [[North Dakota]],  and in [[Montana]]'s [[Williston Basin]]. He was ultimately assigned to manage the Hunt family operations in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Krauss, Clifford.

Accessed November 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt played a major role in the negotiations of the June 2008 acquisition of Hunt Petroleum by [[Fort Worth, Texas]]-based [[XTO Energy]] for $4.186 billion. Tom Hunt served as the trustee for the family trusts of Margaret Hunt Hill and Hassie Hunt which each owned half of Hunt Petroleum. Al Hill III, grandson of Margaret Hunt Hill, sued his father and other family members to block the sale, including demands that Tom Hunt be removed as trustee.&lt;ref&gt;Souder, Elizabeth.

Hunt spoke at the October 2008 unveiling of plans the Tom Hunt Energy Hall to be located at the [[Museum of Nature &amp; Science]]'s new location in the [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]] development. The name recognizes a contribution of $10 million made to the museum by Hunt Petroleum in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Granberry, Michael.

Accessed November 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of a clan that ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as "a family of great egos", Tom Hunt was a plain-living bachelor, who worked out of a sparse office and answered his own phone. He lived in a modest townhouse in [[University Park, Texas]] and enjoyed gardening and making nut candy. He never amassed the huge personal fortune of many of his relatives.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Hunt died at age 85 on November 11, 2008 in [[Dallas]] at the [[Baylor University Medical Center]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The cause of death was [[leukemia]].&lt;ref name=DMNObit&gt;Peppard, Alan.

[[Image:Vanpool.jpg|thumb|A King County Vanpool]]

'''Vanpools''' are an element of the transit system that allow groups of people to share the ride similar to a [[carpool]], but on a larger scale with concurrent savings in fuel and vehicle operating costs.  Vanpools have a lower operating and capital cost than most transit vehicles in the United States, but due to their relatively low capacity, vanpools often require subsidies comparable to conventional bus service. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/profiles/2012/Transit%20Profiles%202012%20Report%20Year%20Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles may be provided by individuals, individuals in cooperation with various public and private support programs, through a program operated by or on behalf of an element of government, or a program operated by or on behalf of an employer.

The key concept is that people share the ride from home or one or more common meeting locations and travel together to a common destination or work center.  

A number of programs exist (within the United States) to help lower the cost of that shared ride to the end user.  Among these are traditional funding available to public agencies, public-private partnerships, and the Best Work Places for Commuters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwc.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; (Commuter Choice Programs). A tax benefit is available under [http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t26t28+151+2++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2826%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28132%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2026 26 U.S.C. §132(f)] Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit allowances. These public transportation programs seek to reduce the number of cars on the road (with all the attendant environmental benefits). 

Additional benefits include:
* Speed: The van can use the [[HOV]] (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes because normally more than 2-3 people ride.
* Fixed schedule (makes life more predictable).
* Saving the cost of [[gasoline]] (in some cases, it is part of the program).
* Riders often can have significant reductions in the cost of personal [[Vehicle insurance|automobile insurance]] (insurance for the rideshare component is usually provided as part of the vanpool program).
* Incentives from local/federal transportation authorities offset cost.

In many cases, an employer may elect to subsidize the cost of the vanpool and the vehicles' maintenance.  In some cases, the vehicles are provided and maintained by the municipality; in others in partnership with or by a third-party provider. For example, [[UCLA]] operates an extensive network of vans, in which faculty, staff and students are eligible for discounted rates, although anyone commuting to the Westwood area is allowed to participate, with drivers receiving the highest discounts. The vans are centrally maintained, fueled, and cleaned.

The King County Metro Vanpool Program&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.kingcounty.gov/tops/van-car/commutervans.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a successful [[demand responsive transport]] program in the [[Puget Sound]] area, specifically in [[King County, Washington]]. Another successful program is operated by [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] in [[Illinois]].

The oldest multi-employer vanpool program in the country is in Treasure Valley, Idaho. For over 30 years Ada County Highway District’s Commuteride&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commuteride.com|title=Ada County Highway District ~ Commuteride|work=commuteride.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanpools have been crisscrossing the Valley helping commuters go to and from work, with their numerous vanpool routes traveling throughout the Treasure Valley. The Vanpools also service the Military at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB) with multiple routes to and from Ada and Canyon County. ACHD Commuteride serves the cities, Boise, Meridian, Kuna, Garden City, Eagle and Star as well as Ada County.

Private firms operate vanpools for individuals, as well as in cooperation with employers or under contract.

Freitas was born around 1955, and acquired the nickname "Zero" at school.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31874121 Building the world's biggest record collection.] ''[[BBC News]]'', 16 March 2015. Retrieved 28 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was a child, his father bought a [[hi-fi]] stereo that came with 200 albums, thus kindling Freitas's interest in the area. The collection was damaged in a flood and Freitas later recreated it.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/the-brazilian-bus-magnate-whos-buying-up-all-the-worlds-vinyl-records.html The Brazilian Bus Magnate Who’s Buying Up All the World's Vinyl Records.] [[Monte Reel]], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', 8 August 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who had a collection of 400–500 records, also influenced Freitas.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The first record he bought was ''Canta para a Juventude'' by [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], which he acquired around December 1964 or January 1965. By the time Freitas left high school he had 3,000 records.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/27/record-collector-zero-freitas-worlds-largest-vinyl-hoard? Record collector builds world's largest vinyl hoard – six million and counting.] Jonathan Watts, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 March 2015. Retrieved 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas studied music composition at college then took over the family transport business which ran buses in the city of [[São Paulo]]. By the time he was 30, Freitas had acquired about 25–30,000 records.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Expansion==
Until recently, most of Freitas's buying was anonymous. He placed adverts in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine reading "RECORD COLLECTIONS. We BUY any record collection. Any style of music. We pay HIGHER prices than anyone else." and used agents to act on his behalf. He bought the remaining stock of 200,000 records from [[Colony Records]] in New York's [[Times Square]] after the store's 2012 closure and bought the stock of the Rio de Janeiro's Modern Sound store around the same time. Around 2013 he bought the collection of [[Murray Gershenz]], the former proprietor of the Music Man Murray record shop in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Also in 2013, Freitas bought the collection of Paul Mawhinney of [[Record-Rama]], once itself thought to be the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2003/04/28/story6.html Failed deals for fabled musical archive strike sour note with owner.] Tim Schooley, ''[[Pittsburgh Business Times]]'', 28 April 2003. Retrieved 31 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of around three million records took eight [[Semitrailer|semitrailers]] to move.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Publicity==
The extent of Freitas's collection was first revealed to the world after details were published in an article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in August 2014. At that time he was estimated to have "several million" records.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; By March 2015, his collection was estimated at six million, making his the largest record collection in existence.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Freitas was unable to explain why he continues to acquire so many records, saying "I’ve gone to therapy for 40 years to try to explain this to myself".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He collects 33, 45 and 78 rpm records of any style of music or speech. The records are cleaned and cataloged by a team of assistants that he has recruited but he is acquiring new material faster than they can work and only 250,000 records have been processed so far. He keeps 100,000 records at home.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The collection includes many rareties such as "Heartache Souvenirs"/"Chicken Shack," by William Powell but it also includes up to 30% duplication. Those duplicates are now beginning to be sold off.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Ten thousand Brazilian records were given to the [[ARChive of Contemporary Music]] where they form the Zero Freitas Brazilian Music Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcmusic.org/catalogs/special-collections/ Special Collections.] ARChive of Contemporary Music. Retrieved 28 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freitas has become well known, collectors have begun to offer him their collections. In October 2014 alone he acquired one million records from another collector for 200,000 reais. In 2015, Terence McEwan of the [[San Francisco Opera]] gave Freitas 6,500 classical LPs.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Freitas continues to maintain agents around the world, including in Mexico, New York and Nigeria. These enable him to buy a diverse range of material such as the collection of the late [[Bob Hope]] and the 100,000 albums of Cuban music he has acquired. His staff joke that the island of Cuba must be rising due to the weight of material that Freitas has removed.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Future plans==
Freitas is building a warehouse to store his collection which he plans to call the Emporium Musical.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Business activities==
In addition to transport, Freitas runs a business providing audio-visual systems for concerts and other public events.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
