'''''A Briefer History of Time''''' is a [[parody science|science humor]] [[book]] by the American [[astronomer]] [[Eric Schulman]]. In this book, Schulman presents humorous summaries of what he claims are the fifty-three most important events since the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Volume 244, Issue 32 (August 10, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science News]]'', Volume 155, Number 22 (May 29, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mercury Magazine'', Volume 29, Number 2 (March/April 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
The title and cover are a [[parody]] of Stephen Hawking's book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''. Coincidentally, Hawking would later write a "sequel" entitled ''[[A Briefer History of Time (Hawking and Mlodinow book)|A Briefer History of Time]]''. Hawking's publisher [[Bantam Books]] was aware the title had already been used in a popular science book, but went ahead since "The other book was published six years ago, and Professor Hawking is an international figure."
&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Paul. Times Higher Education Supplement (May 27, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walden, Celia. [[The Daily Telegraph]] (May 31, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the author released the book under a [[creative commons license]], [[CC BY-NC-ND]] 1.0,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130085714/http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/bhtes/ A Briefer History of Time] "CC BY-ND-NC 1.0" (archived 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; as free download on his website.

== Description ==
Laughing while learning is the intent of Schulman's book. The book shows why, even though the Universe is expanding, it doesn't get any easier to find a parking space. Furthermore, there is the pulp version of the origin of life (''"It was a dark and stormy night. In the shallow tide pool, a nucleic acid base collided with a sugar molecule.  An [[amino acid]] sank beneath the murky depths . . . ."'').

}}'''Aleksandr Erminingeldovich Arbuzov''' (12 October 1877 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1968) was a [[Russian Empire]] and [[USSR|Soviet]] chemist who discovered the [[Michaelis–Arbuzov reaction]].

A native of [[Bilyar]]sk, Arbuzov studied in the [[Kazan University]] under [[Alexander Mikhaylovich Zaytsev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewis, D.E. | title = The University of Kazan: Provincial Cradle of Russian Organic Chemistry.

After [[World War II]] he was put in charge of the Soviet Institute of Organic Chemistry.

Arbuzov was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] in 1943.

In addition to his scientific research, Arbuzov also wrote ''A Brief Sktech of the Development of Organic Chemistry in Russian'' (1948).

'''Alexander Strauch''' (born 1 March 1832 in [[Saint Petersburg]] – died 14 August 1893 in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany) was a Russian naturalist, most notably an [[herpetologist]].

In 1861 he started work as a [[curator]] of the zoological museum at the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. From 1879 to 1890 he was director of the museum. He is credited with establishing St. Petersburg as a major world center in regard to herpetology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zin.ru/labs/herplab/history.html |title=History |date=2008-09-08 |work=Department of Herpetology of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by ''Alice'' on the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft, the detection of a "[[Heliosphere#Hydrogen wall|hydrogen wall]]" at the outer edges of the [[Solar System]] that was first detected in 1992 by the two [[Voyager program|Voyager spacecraft]] which have detected a surplus of ultraviolet light determined to be coming from hydrogen.&lt;ref name="GRL-20180807"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gladstone, G.

In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]—the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].

In three [[dimensions]], the angular momentum for a [[point particle]] is a [[pseudovector]] '''r''' × '''p''', the [[cross product]] of the particle's [[position vector]] '''r''' (relative to some origin) and its [[momentum vector]] '''p''' = ''m'''''v'''. This definition can be applied to each point in [[Continuum mechanics|continua]] like solids or fluids, or [[field (physics)|physical fields]]. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum vector of a point particle is parallel and directly proportional to the [[angular velocity]] vector '''ω''' of the particle (how fast its angular position changes), where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. For continuous rigid bodies, though,  the spin angular velocity '''ω''' is proportional but not always parallel to the [[Spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]] of the object, making the constant of proportionality '''I''' (called the [[moment of inertia]]) a second-rank [[tensor]] rather than a scalar.

Angular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of a system is the (pseudo)[[vector sum]] of the angular momenta. For continua or fields one uses [[Integral|integration]]. The total angular momentum of any rigid body can be split into the sum of two main components: the angular momentum of the [[centre of mass]] (with a mass equal to the total mass) about the origin, plus the spin angular momentum of the object about the centre of mass.

Torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to [[force]]. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[Coriolis effect]], and [[precession]] of [[Spinning top|tops]] and gyroscopes. Applications include the [[gyrocompass]], [[control moment gyroscope]], [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance systems]], [[reaction wheel]]s, [[Flying disc|flying discs or Frisbees]], and [[Earth's rotation]] to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.

In [[quantum mechanics]], [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum is an operator]] with quantized eigenvalues. Angular momentum is subject to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], meaning that at any time, only one component can be measured with definite precision; the other two cannot. Also, the "[[spin (physics)|spin]]" of [[elementary particle]]s does not correspond to literal spinning motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter |edition=2nd, illustrated, revised |first1=Michael |last1=de Podesta |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-25788-6 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC&amp;pg=PA29 Extract of page 29]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Scalar (physics)|Euclidean vector}}

==== Scalar — angular momentum in two dimensions ====
[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''&lt;sub&gt;∥&lt;/sub&gt;) and perpendicular to (''v''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;) the radius vector ''r''. The '''angular momentum''' of ''m'' is proportional to the [[perpendicular component]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; of the velocity, or equivalently, to the perpendicular distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; from the origin.]]

Angular momentum is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity (more precisely, a [[pseudovector]]) that represents the product of a body's [[moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] and [[angular velocity|rotational velocity]] about a particular axis. However, if the particle's trajectory lies in a single [[plane (geometry)|plane]], it is sufficient to discard the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] (more precisely, a [[pseudoscalar]]).&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of [[momentum|linear momentum]]. Thus, where linear momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and [[speed|linear speed]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;,}}
:&lt;math&gt;p = mv,&lt;/math&gt;

angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to [[moment of inertia]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and [[angular frequency|angular speed]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Worthington"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = I\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter. Unlike linear speed, which occurs in a straight line, angular speed occurs about a center of rotation. Therefore, strictly speaking, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; should be referred to as the angular momentum ''relative to that center''.&lt;ref name="Taylor90"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;I = r^2m&lt;/math&gt; for a single particle and &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt; for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded, &lt;math&gt;L = r^2 m \cdot \frac{v}{r},&lt;/math&gt; and reduced to,
:&lt;math&gt;L = rmv,&lt;/math&gt;

the product of the [[radius]] of rotation &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the [[linear momentum]] of the particle &lt;math&gt;p = mv&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in this case is the equivalent [[speed|linear (tangential) speed]] at the radius (&lt;math&gt;= r\omega&lt;/math&gt;).

This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is [[perpendicular]] to the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]] is considered. In that case,
:&lt;math&gt;L = rmv_\perp,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_\perp = v\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding, &lt;math&gt;L = rmv\sin(\theta),&lt;/math&gt; rearranging, &lt;math&gt;L = r\sin(\theta)mv,&lt;/math&gt; and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,
:&lt;math&gt;L = r_\perp mv,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_\perp = r\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the [[torque#Moment arm formula|''moment arm'']], a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this definition, {{math|(length of moment arm)×(linear momentum)}} to which the term ''moment of momentum'' refers.&lt;ref name="Dadourian"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scalar — angular momentum from Lagrangian mechanics ====
Another approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum (also called '''canonical momentum''') of the angular coordinate &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; expressed in the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of the mechanical system.  Consider a mechanical system with a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; constrained to move in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the absence of any external force field.  The kinetic energy of the system is
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2}ma^2 \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}ma^2 \dot{\phi}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

And the potential energy is
:&lt;math&gt;U = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Lagrangian is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(\phi, \dot{\phi}\right) = T - U = \frac{1}{2}ma^2 \dot{\phi}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''generalized momentum'' "canonically conjugate to" the coordinate &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = ma^2 \dot{\phi} = I\omega = L.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Vector — angular momentum in three dimensions ====
[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between [[force]] ('''F'''), [[torque]] ('''τ'''), [[momentum]] ('''p'''), and angular momentum ('''L''') vectors in a rotating system. '''r''' is the [[Position (vector)|position vector]].]]

To completely define angular momentum in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], it is required to know the [[Angular velocity|angle swept out in unit time]], the direction perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of angular displacement, and the sense (right- or left-handed) of the angular velocity, as well as the [[mass]] involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By retaining this [[Euclidean vector|vector]] nature of angular momentum, the general nature of the equations is also retained, and can describe any sort of three-dimensional [[Motion (physics)|motion]] about the center of rotation – [[Circular motion|circular]], [[Linear motion|linear]], or otherwise. In [[vector notation]], the angular momentum of a [[point particle]] in motion about the origin is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;

where
::&lt;math&gt;I = r^2m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] for a [[Point particle|point mass]],
::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}=\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]] of the particle about the origin,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position (vector)|position vector]] of the particle relative to the origin, &lt;math&gt;r=\left\vert\mathbf{r}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity|linear velocity]] of the particle relative to the origin, and
::&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] of the particle.

This can be expanded, reduced, and by the rules of [[vector calculus|vector algebra]], rearranged:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{L} &amp;= \left(r^2m\right)\left(\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}\right) \\
             &amp;= m\left(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}\right) \\
             &amp;= \mathbf{r}\times m\mathbf{v} \\
             &amp;= \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[cross product]] of the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the linear momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; vector is [[perpendicular]] to both &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;. It is directed perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, as indicated by the [[right-hand rule]] – so that the angular velocity is seen as [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] from the head of the vector. Conversely, the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; vector defines the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; lie.

By defining a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, a [[angular frequency|scalar angular speed]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; results, where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}} = \boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{v_\perp}{r},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v_\perp&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.

The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{L} &amp;= I\boldsymbol{\omega}\\
             &amp;= I\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
             &amp;= \left(r^2m\right)\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
             &amp;= rmv_\perp \mathbf{\hat{u}}\\

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = rmv\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; for circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Discussion ===
Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of [[linear momentum]]. Like linear momentum it involves elements of [[mass]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]]. Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[shape]].

Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point — can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? [[Energy]], the ability to do [[Work (physics)|work]], can be stored in matter by setting it in motion — a combination of its [[inertia]] and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its [[mass]], and displacement by its [[velocity]]. Their product,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\text{amount of inertia}) \times (\text{amount of displacement})&amp;=\text{amount of (inertia·displacement)}\\
\text{mass} \times \text{velocity} &amp;= \text{momentum}\\
m \times v &amp;= p\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the matter's [[momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a [[lever]] of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the ''moment arm''. It has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a [[Moment (physics)|''moment''.]] Hence, the particle's momentum referred to a particular point,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\text{moment arm}) \times (\text{amount of inertia}) \times (\text{amount of displacement})&amp;=\text{moment of (inertia·displacement)}\\
\text{length} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity} &amp;= \text{moment of momentum}\\
r \times m \times v &amp;= L\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''angular momentum'', sometimes called, as here, the ''moment of momentum'' of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation &lt;math&gt;L=rmv&lt;/math&gt; combines a moment (a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; turning moment arm &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) with a linear (straight-line equivalent) speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the angular speed &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; versus the point: &lt;math&gt;v=r\omega,&lt;/math&gt; another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: &lt;math&gt;L=rmr\omega.&lt;/math&gt; Simplifying slightly, &lt;math&gt;L=r^2m\omega,&lt;/math&gt; the quantity &lt;math&gt;r^2m&lt;/math&gt; is the particle's [[moment of inertia]], sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Moment of inertia examples.gif|thumb|right|[[Moment of inertia]] (shown here), and therefore angular momentum, is different for every possible configuration of [[mass]] and [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]].]]

Because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum, it necessarily includes all of the complications of [[moment of inertia]], which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the [[Square (algebra)|squares]] of their [[distances]] from the center of rotation.&lt;ref name="Oberg"&gt;{{cite book

For a [[rigid body]], for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotation axis]] versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the [[center of mass]], or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the [[Solar System]], the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.

In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the [[Torque#Moment arm formula|moment arm]]), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given [[angular velocity]]. In many cases the [[moment of inertia]], and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of gyration]], the distance from the axis at which the entire mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; may be considered as concentrated.
Similarly, for a [[Point particle|point mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the [[moment of inertia]] is defined as,
:&lt;math&gt;I=r^2m&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius]] of the point mass from the center of rotation,
and for any collection of particles &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; as the sum,

Angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its [[Units of measurement|units]] versus linear momentum: [[SI derived unit|kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s]], [[SI derived unit|N·m·s]]  or [[SI derived unit|J·s]] for angular momentum versus [[SI derived unit|kg·m/s]] or [[SI derived unit|N·s]] for linear momentum.

==== Angular momentum and torque ====
{{See also|Torque#Definition and relation to angular momentum}}
[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]] can be expressed mathematically,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;
or [[force]] = [[mass]] × [[acceleration]]. The rotational equivalent for point particles is
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha} + 2rp_{||}\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
Because angular acceleration is the time [[derivative]] of [[angular velocity]], and because the [[moment of inertia]] is &lt;math&gt;mr^2&lt;/math&gt; for point particles, the above formula is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt} + \frac{d{I}}{dt}\boldsymbol{\omega}.&lt;/math&gt; Rearranging into a form suitable for [[Integral|integration]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d(I\boldsymbol{\omega})}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}dt = d(I\boldsymbol{\omega}),&lt;/math&gt; and integrating with respect to time,
:&lt;math&gt;\int \boldsymbol{\tau}dt = I\boldsymbol{\omega} + \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, known as ''angular impulse'', by analogy with [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]], which is defined as the change in [[momentum|translational momentum]]. The constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body, before the torque began to act. In particular, if torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{0},&lt;/math&gt; then angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{0} + \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
or Angular momentum = [[moment of inertia]] × [[angular velocity]], and its time [[derivative]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \frac{dI}{dt}\boldsymbol{\omega} + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

Because the moment of inertia is &lt;math&gt;mr^2&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dt} = 2rp_{||}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt} + 2rp_{||}\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt; which, as above, reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha} + 2rp_{||}\boldsymbol{\omega}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied [[torque]] about that center.&lt;ref name="Taylor90" /&gt; If angular momentum is constant, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and no torque is applied.

A rotational analog of [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]] might be written, "In a [[closed system]], no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque."&lt;ref name="Crew" /&gt; Hence, ''angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, a rotational analog of Newton's second law of motion might be, "A change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque."&lt;ref name="Crew" /&gt; Since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, then if torque is zero, angular momentum is constant.

The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing [[Classical central-force problem|''central force motion'']]. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}, &lt;/math&gt; because in this case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].

For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth–Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[torque]] caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque (since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum). This causes the [[Spinning top|top]] to [[precess]].]]

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an [[Ice skating|ice skater]] as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning [[top]] is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the [[nutation]] axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its [[precession]] axis. Also, in any [[planetary system]], the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.

[[Noether's theorem]] states that every [[conservation law]] is associated with a [[symmetry]] (invariant) of the underlying physics.  The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is [[rotational invariance]].  The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The classical theory of fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|first1= L.

called ''[[Specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]]''. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = m\mathbf{h}.&lt;/math&gt; [[Mass]] is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by [[gravity]]. The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions.

=== Solid bodies ===
For a continuous mass distribution with [[density]] function ''ρ''('''r'''), a differential [[volume element]] ''dV'' with [[position vector]] '''r''' within the mass has a mass element ''dm'' = ''ρ''('''r''')''dV''. Therefore, the [[infinitesimal]] angular momentum of this element is:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times dm \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) dV \mathbf{v} = dV \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

and [[volume integral|integrating]] this [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\int_V dV \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

In the derivation which follows, integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous mass.

=== Collection of particles ===

==== Center of mass ====
[[File:Ang mom vector diagram.png|thumb|The angular momentum of the particles ''i'' is the sum of the cross products '''R''' × ''M'''''V''' + Σ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; × ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

For a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin, it is informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin. Given,
: &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the center of mass vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the center of mass vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the center of mass,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the center of mass,

The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,
:&lt;math&gt;M=\sum_i m_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin. Similar to [[Angular momentum#Single particle|'''Single particle''']], below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass ''M'' at the center of mass moving with velocity '''V'''. The second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to [[Angular momentum#Fixed center of mass|'''Fixed center of mass''']], below. The result is general — the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.

Rearranging equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) by vector identities, multiplying both terms by "one", and grouping appropriately,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{L} &amp;= M(\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{V}) + \sum_i \left[m_i\left(\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{v}_i\right)\right], \\

For the case of the center of mass fixed in space with respect to the origin,

== Angular momentum (modern definition) ==
[[File:Angular momentum bivector and pseudovector.svg|275px|thumb|The 3-angular momentum as a [[bivector]] (plane element) and [[axial vector]], of a particle of mass ''m'' with instantaneous 3-position '''x''' and 3-momentum '''p'''.]]

In modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see [[#Angular momentum in quantum mechanics|below]]) is described using a different formalism, instead of a classical [[pseudovector]]. In this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general [[curved space]]times, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{p} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the [[exterior product]] ∧ replaces the [[cross product]] × (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the '''x''' and '''p'''  vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{L} &amp;= \left(xp_y - yp_x\right)\mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y + \left(yp_z - zp_y\right)\mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z + \left(zp_x - xp_z\right)\mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x\\
             &amp;= L_{xy}\mathbf{e}_x \wedge \mathbf{e}_y + L_{yz}\mathbf{e}_y \wedge \mathbf{e}_z + L_{zx}\mathbf{e}_z \wedge \mathbf{e}_x \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or more compactly in index notation:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{ij} = x_i p_j - x_j p_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''ω&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:&lt;ref&gt;Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161. {{ISBN|978-0-486-63612-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{ij} = I_{ijk\ell} \omega_{k\ell} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Again, this equation in '''L''' and '''ω''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''ω''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.

In [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\alpha\beta} = X_\alpha P_\beta - X_\beta P_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

in the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.

In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.

== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==
{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}
Angular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]]. In [[relativistic quantum mechanics#Relativistic quantum angular momentum|relativistic quantum mechanics]], it differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operator.

=== Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum ===

]]

The classical definition of angular momentum as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; can be carried over to quantum mechanics, by reinterpreting '''r''' as the quantum [[position operator]] and '''p''' as the quantum [[momentum operator]]. '''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''. The components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3). Indeed, these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 17.3&lt;/ref&gt; (See also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)

However, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particle]]s have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s have "spin 1/2" (this actually means "spin [[reduced Planck constant|ħ]]/2") while [[photon]]s   have "spin 1" (this actually means "spin ħ").

Finally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin–orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant.  Electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can also have fractional values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501748|pmid=28861467|title=There are many ways to spin a photon: Half-quantization of a total optical angular momentum|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=4|pages=e1501748|year=2016|last1=Ballantine|first1=K.

=== Quantization ===
In [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in "[[Quantum number|quantum leaps]]" between certain allowed values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Euclidean vector]] such as x, y, or z:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''If you [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measure]]…'''
| '''The result can be...'''

[[File:Circular Standing Wave.gif|thumb|right|In this [[standing wave]] on a circular string, the circle is broken into exactly 8 [[wavelength]]s. A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]
(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)

The [[reduced Planck constant]] &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is tiny by everyday standards, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.

Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his [[Schrödinger equation#Quantization|Schrödinger equation]].

=== Uncertainty ===
In the definition &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s &lt;math&gt;r_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_z&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[momentum operator]]s &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt;. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example &lt;math&gt;L_xL_y \neq L_yL_x&lt;/math&gt;. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)

=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===
As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the "generator of rotations".&lt;ref name=littlejohn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator
:&lt;math&gt;R(\hat{n},\phi) \equiv \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\phi\, \mathbf{J}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; about the axis &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. (The "exp" in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]]) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the [[rotation group SO(3)]] will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.

The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.

== Angular momentum in electrodynamics ==
{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}

When describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' × '''P''' is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called ''kinetic momentum'' (used throughout this article), is (in [[SI units]])

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{P} - e \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and '''A''' the [[magnetic vector potential]] of the electromagnetic field. The [[Gauge theory|gauge-invariant]] angular momentum, that is ''kinetic angular momentum'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}= \mathbf{r} \times ( \mathbf{P} - e\mathbf{A} )&lt;/math&gt;

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on [[canonical commutation relation]]s.

&lt;/math&gt;

The above identities are valid ''locally'',  i.e. in each space point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; in a given moment &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
[[Isaac Newton|Newton]], in the [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the [[Newton's laws of motion|First Law of Motion]],
:''A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the ''Principia'',
:''From such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate every particular that relates to this subject.''&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Axioms; or Laws of Motion, Corollary III&lt;/ref&gt;
However, his geometric proof of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|law of areas]] is an outstanding example of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a [[central force]].

=== The Law of Areas ===
{{Main|Classical central-force problem|Areal velocity}}

==== Newton's derivation ====
[[File:Newton area law derivation.gif|frame|right|Newton's derivation of the area law using geometric means.]]

As a [[planet]] orbits the [[Sun]], the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|second law of planetary motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.

During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.

At point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.

Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.

==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====
The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;rv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}} are constant: if {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;rmv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.

In the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;rmv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.

=== After Newton ===
[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite web

In 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his ''[[Mechanica]]'' without further developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a "moment of rotational motion", possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/correspondence/letters/OO0153.pdf
|title=Euler's Correspondence with Daniel Bernoulli, Bernoulli to Euler, 04 February, 1744}}, at [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/ The Euler Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation — his ''[[invariable plane]]''.

[[Louis Poinsot]] in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the "conservation of moments".

In 1852 [[Léon Foucault]] used a [[gyroscope]] in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.

[[William John Macquorn Rankine|William J. M. Rankine's]] 1858 ''Manual of Applied Mechanics'' defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:
:''...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.''

In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that "The term ''angular momentum'' was introduced by Mr. Hayward,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance, {{cite journal

Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as "momentum of rotation" in English.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance, {{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5638">A '''bibliogram''' is a verbal construct made when [[noun phrase]]s from extended stretches of text are ranked high to low by their [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of [[co-occurrence]] with one or more user-supplied seed terms. Each bibliogram has three components:

* A seed term that sets a [[wiktionary:context|context]].
* Words that co-occur with the seed across some set of records.
* Counts (frequencies) by which co-occurring words can be ordered high to low.

The term was introduced in 2005 by [[Howard D. White]] to name the linguistic object studied, but not previously named, in [[informetrics]], [[scientometrics]] and [[bibliometrics]]. The noun phrases in the [[ranking]] may be authors, journals, subject headings, or other indexing terms. The "stretches of text” may be a book, a set of related articles, a subject bibliography, a set of Web pages, and so on. Bibliograms are always generated from writings, usually from scholarly or scientific literature.

As a family of term-frequency distributions, the bibliogram has frequently been written about under  descriptions such as:

* positive skew distribution
* empirical hyperbolic
* scale-free (see also [[Scale-free network]])
* [[power law]]
* [[size frequency distribution]]
* reverse-J

It is sometimes called a "core and scatter" distribution. The "core" consists of relatively few top-ranked terms that account for a disproportionately large share of co-occurrences overall.

The "scatter” consists of relatively many lower-ranked terms that account for the remaining share of co-occurrences. Usually the top-ranked terms are not tied in frequency, but identical frequencies and tied ranks become more common as the frequencies get smaller. At the bottom of the distribution, a long tail of terms are tied in rank because each co-occurs with the seed term only once.

In most cases bibliograms can be described by [[power law]]s such as [[Zipf's law]] and [[Bradford's law]]. In this regard, they have long been studied by mathematicians and statisticians in information science. However, these treatments typically ignore the qualitative meanings of the ranked terms themselves, which are often of interest in their own right. For example, the following bibliogram was made with an author's name as seed and shows the descriptors that co-occur with her name in the [[ERIC]] database. The descriptors are ranked by how many of her articles they were used to index:

 6   Creativity
 4   Creativity Tests
 3   Divergent Thinking
 2   Elementary School Mathematics
 2   Instruction
 2   Mathematics Education
 2   Problem Solving
 2   Research
 2   Time
 1   Acceleration
 1   Anxiety
 1   Beginning Teachers
 1   Behavioral Objectives
 1   Child Development
 1   Classroom Techniques
 1   Cognitive Development
     etc.

This author is a researcher in education, and it will be seen that the terms profile her intellectual interests over the years. In general, bibliograms can be used to:

* suggest additional terms for search strategies
* characterize the work of scholars, scientists, or institutions
* show who an author cites over time
* show who cites an author over time
* show the other authors with whom an author is co-cited over time
* show the subjects associated with a journal or an author
* show the authors, organizations, or journals associated with a subject
* show library classification codes associated with subject headings and vice versa
* show the popularity of items in the collections of libraries
* model the structure of literatures with title terms, descriptors, author names, journal names  

Bibliograms can be created with the RANK command on Dialog (other vendors have similar commands), ranking options within [[WorldCat]], [[Histcite|HistCite]], [[Google Scholar]], and inexpensive content analysis software.

White suggests that bibliograms have a parallel construct in what he calls ''associograms''. These are the rank-ordered lists of word association norms studied in [[psycholinguistics]]. They are similar to bibliograms in statistical structure but are not generated from writings. Rather, they are generated by presenting panels of people with a stimulus term (which functions like a seed term) and tabulating the words they associate with the seed by frequency of co-occurrence. They are currently of interest to information scientists as a nonstandard way of creating thesauri for document retrieval.

==Examples==
Other examples of bibliograms are the ordered set of an author's [[co-authors]] or the list of authors that are published in a specific journal together with their number of articles. A popular example is the list of additional titles to consider for purchase that you get when you search an item in [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. These suggested titles are the top terms in the "core" of a bibliogram formed with your search term as seed. The frequencies are counts of the times they have been co-purchased with the seed.

Examples of associagrams may be found in the [http://www.eat.rl.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus].

==Other methods==
Similar but different methods are used in [[data clustering]] and [[data mining]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060612215241/http://labs.google.com/sets Google Sets] does also create list of associated terms to a given set of terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5096">[[Image:Coldframe 1.jpg|thumb|250px|A traditional homemade cold frame]]
In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], a '''cold frame''' is a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]-roofed enclosure, built low to the ground, used to protect [[plant]]s from adverse [[weather]], primarily excessive cold or wet. The transparent top admits [[sunlight]] and prevents heat escape via [[convection]] that would otherwise occur, particularly at night. Essentially, a cold frame functions as a miniature [[greenhouse]] to [[season extension|extend the growing season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Frame as Season Extension from Grass to Greens|url=http://www.grass2greens.com/Services___Season_Extension.html|website=www.grass2greens.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, cold frames were built to be used in addition to a heated [[greenhouse]]. The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the warm greenhouse and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse's foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be "hardened-off"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldframe.org.uk/Hardening-Off-8.aspx coldframe.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503011422/http://www.coldframe.org.uk/Hardening-Off-8.aspx |date=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before final planting outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=coldframe.org.uk |url=http://www.coldframe.org.uk/A-brief-history-of-cold-frames-19.aspx |title=A brief history of cold frames}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold frames are similar to some enclosed [[hotbed (gardening)|hotbeds]],&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hotbed merriam-webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; also called hotboxes. The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called "hothouses" to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a [[heater]] or [[HVAC]] system of some kind. 

Cold frames are found in [[home gardens]] and in [[vegetable]] farming. They create [[microclimate]]s that provide several [[degree (temperature)|degree]]s of air and [[soil]] temperature [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and shelter from [[wind]]. In cold-winter regions, these characteristics allow plants to be started earlier in the spring, and to survive longer into the [[autumn|fall]] and winter. They are most often used for growing [[seedling]]s that are later [[transplanting|transplanted]] into open ground, and can also be a permanent home to cold-[[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] vegetables grown for autumn and winter [[harvest]].

==Construction==
Cold frame construction is a common home or [[farm]] building project, although kits and commercial systems are available. A traditional plan makes use of old glass windows: a wooden frame is built, about one to two feet tall, and the window placed on top. The roof is often sloped towards the winter sun to capture more light, and to improve runoff of water, and [[hinge]]d for easy access. Clear plastic, rigid or sheeting, can be used in place of glass. An electric heating cable, available for this purpose, can be placed in the soil to provide additional heat.

==Uses==
Cold frames can be used to extend the growing season for many food and ornamental crops, primarily by providing increased warmth in early spring. This means that it's possible to harvest vegetable crops ahead of their normal season when they are extremely expensive to buy. Some crops suitable for growing in a cold frame include lettuces, parsley, salad onions, spinach, radishes and turnips etc. One vegetable crop can occupy the whole of a cold frame or a combination of crops can be grown so that they mature in rotation in order to get a wide range of different vegetables throughout the year from a single cold frame.

==Bulb frame==
&lt;!--There are wikilinks here, so please leave an anchor if you change the title of the section--&gt;
A "bulb frame" is a specialized kind of cold frame, designed for growing hardy or almost hardy [[ornamental bulbous plant]]s, particularly in climates with wet winters. Typically it is raised further above ground level than a normal cold frame, so that the plants can be seen better when in flower. They are often used for the cultivation of winter-growing bulbs which flower in the autumn or spring. The covers are used in winter to provide some protection from very bad weather, while allowing good ventilation. Then in the summer, the covers provide dry, warm conditions which many such bulbs need.&lt;ref name=Math97&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mathew |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Mathew |year=1997 |title=Growing Bulbs : The Complete Practical Guide |publication-place=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-7134-4920-4 }} Pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27742">In [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], '''digital physics''' is a collection of theoretical perspectives based on the premise that the [[universe]] is describable by [[information]]. It is a form of [[digital ontology]] about the physical reality. According to this theory, the universe can be conceived of as either the output of a deterministic or probabilistic computer program, a vast, digital computation device, or mathematically [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to such a device.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;

==History==
The operations of [[computer]]s must be compatible with the principles of [[information theory]], [[statistical thermodynamics]], and [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1957, a link among these fields was proposed by [[Edwin Jaynes]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1957, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics,]" ''Phys. Rev.'' 106: 620. &lt;br&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1957, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.2.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics II,]" ''Phys. Rev.'' 108: 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated an interpretation of [[probability theory]] as generalized Aristotelian [[logic]], a view linking fundamental physics with [[digital computers]], because these are designed to implement the [[logical operations|operations]] of [[classical logic]] and, equivalently, of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1990, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prob.as.logic.pdf Probability Theory as Logic,]" in Fougere, P.F., ed., ''Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods''. Boston: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that the [[universe]] is a [[digital computer]] was proposed by [[Konrad Zuse]] in his book ''Rechnender Raum'' (translated into English as ''[[Calculating Space]]''). The term ''digital physics'' was{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} employed by [[Edward Fredkin]], who later came to prefer the term ''[[digital philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Fredkin's [http://www.digitalphilosophy.org Digital Philosophy web site.]&lt;/ref&gt; Others who have modeled the universe as a giant computer include [[Stephen Wolfram]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[A New Kind of Science]]'' [http://www.wolframscience.com website.] [http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_reviews.html Reviews of ANKS.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juergen Schmidhuber]],&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.,"&gt;Schmidhuber, J., "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html Computer Universes and an Algorithmic Theory of Everything]"; [ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/everything.pdf A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything].&lt;/ref&gt; and Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]].&lt;ref&gt;G. 't Hooft, 1999, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9903084 Quantum Gravity as a Dissipative Deterministic System,]" ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' '''16''': 3263–79.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors hold that the [[probabilistic]] nature of [[quantum physics]] is not necessarily incompatible with the notion of computability. Quantum versions of digital physics have recently been proposed by [[Seth Lloyd]]&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, S., "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501135 The Computational Universe: Quantum gravity from quantum computation.]"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paola Zizzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0304032 Spacetime at the Planck Scale: The Quantum Computer View.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s binary theory of ur-alternatives, pancomputationalism, computational universe theory, [[John Archibald Wheeler]]'s "It from bit", and [[Max Tegmark]]'s [[ultimate ensemble]].

===Overview===
Digital physics suggests that there exists, at least in principle, a [[computer program|program]] for a [[universal computer]] that computes the evolution of the [[universe]]. The computer could be, for example, a huge [[cellular automaton]] (Zuse 1967&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuse, Konrad, 1967, Elektronische Datenverarbeitung vol 8., pages 336–344&lt;/ref&gt;), or a universal [[Turing machine]], as suggested by Schmidhuber (1997&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;), who pointed out that there exists a short program that can compute all possible computable universes in an [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] way.

[[Loop quantum gravity]] could lend support to digital physics, in that it assumes space-time is quantized.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt; [[Paola Zizzi]] has formulated a realization of this concept in what has come to be called "computational loop quantum gravity", or CLQG.&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0406069 A Minimal Model for Quantum Gravity.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0412076 Computability at the Planck Scale.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories that combine aspects of digital physics with loop quantum gravity are those of Marzuoli and Rasetti&lt;ref&gt;Marzuoli, A. and Rasetti, M., 2002, "[https://arxiv.org/quant-ph/0209016 Spin Network Quantum Simulator,]" ''Phys. Lett.'' A306, 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marzuoli, A. and Rasetti, M., 2005, "[https://arxiv.org/quant-ph/0410105 Computing Spin Networks,]" ''Annals of Physics'' 318: 345–407.&lt;/ref&gt; and Girelli and Livine.&lt;ref&gt;Girelli, F.; Livine, E. R., 2005, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0501075]" ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' 22: 3295–3314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weizsäcker's ur-alternatives===
Physicist [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s [[theory of ur-alternatives]] (theory of archetypal objects), first publicized in his book ''The Unity of Nature'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Weizsäcker |first1= Carl Friedrich |title= Die Einheit der Natur |date=1971 |publisher= Hanser |location=München |isbn= 978-3-446-11479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz71&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker |first= Carl Friedrich |authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker |year= 1980 |title= The Unity of Nature |location= New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; further developed through the 1990s,&lt;ref name=Weiz85&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1985 | title= Aufbau der Physik | location= [[Munich]] | isbn= 978-3-446-14142-1 | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Weizsäcker|first1=Carl Friedrich |title=The Structure of Physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-1-4020-5234-7|pages=XXX, 360|edition=Görnitz, Thomas; Lyre, Holger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz92&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1992 | title= Zeit und Wissen | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of digital physics as it [[axiom]]atically constructs quantum physics from the distinction between empirically observable, binary alternatives. Weizsäcker used his theory to derive the 3-dimensionality of space and to estimate the [[entropy]] of a [[proton]]. In 1988 Görnitz has shown that Weizsäcker's assumption can be connected with the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Görnitz|first1=Thomas|title=Abstract Quantum Theory and Space-Time Structure  I.

===Pancomputationalism&lt;!--'Pancomputationalism' 'and 'Naturalist computationalism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{also|Metaphysical naturalism|Mathematicism}}
'''Pancomputationalism''' (also known as '''naturalist computationalism''')&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic, [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.301.4845 "Info‐Computational Philosophy Of Nature: An Informational Universe With Computational Dynamics"] (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; is a view that the universe is a computational machine, or rather a network of computational processes which, following fundamental physical laws, computes (dynamically develops) its own next state from the current one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/browse/pancomputationalism Papers on pancomputationalism on philpapers.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A computational universe is proposed by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in a paper based on Zuse's 1967 thesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/digitalphysics.html Zuse's Thesis]&lt;/ref&gt;. He pointed out that a simple explanation of the universe would be a [[Turing machine]] programmed to execute all possible programs computing all possible histories for all types of computable physical laws. He also pointed out that there is an optimally efficient way of computing all computable universes based on [[Leonid Levin]]'s universal search algorithm (published in 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|title = Universal search problems (Russian: Универсальные задачи перебора, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission (Russian: Проблемы передачи информации, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115–116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=914&amp;volume=9&amp;year=1973&amp;issue=3&amp;fpage=115&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2000, he expanded this work by combining Ray Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference with the assumption that quickly computable universes are more likely than others. This work on digital physics also led to limit-computable generalizations of algorithmic information or [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and the concept of Super Omegas, which are limit-computable numbers that are even more random (in a certain sense) than [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s number of wisdom [[Chaitin's constant|Omega]].

===Wheeler's "it from bit"===

Following Jaynes and Weizsäcker, the physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler]] proposed an "it from bit" doctrine: information sits at the core of physics, and every "it", whether a particle or field, derives its existence from observations.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John Archibald; Ford, Kenneth (1998). ''Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] {{ISBN|0-393-04642-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John A. (1990). "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links". In Zurek, Wojciech Hubert. ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. [[Addison-Wesley]]. {{ISBN|9780201515091}}. OCLC 21482771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David. J., 1995, "[http://consc.net/papers/facing.html Facing up to the Hard Problem of Consciousness]", ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'' 2(3): 200–19. This paper cites John A. Wheeler (1990) ''op. cit.'' Also see Chalmers, D., 1996. ''The Conscious Mind''. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The toughest nut to crack in Wheeler's research program of a digital dissolution of physical being in a unified physics, Wheeler says, is time. In a 1986 eulogy to the mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]], Wheeler proclaimed: "Time, among all concepts in the world of physics, puts up the greatest resistance to being dethroned from ideal continuum to the world of the discrete, of information, of bits. ... Of all obstacles to a thoroughly penetrating account of existence, none looms up more dismayingly than 'time.' Explain time? Not without explaining existence. Explain existence? Not without explaining time. To uncover the deep and hidden connection between time and existence ... is a task for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John Archibald, 1986, "[http://www.weylmann.com/wheeler.pdf Hermann Weyl and the Unity of Knowledge]", ''[[American Scientist]]'', 74: 366-375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, 2009, '[http://www.arte-fact.org/dgtlon_e.html#ps2 Postscript 2: On quantum physics' assault on time]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, 2009, [http://www.arte-fact.org/dgtlcast.html ''The Digital Cast of Being: Metaphysics, Mathematics, Cartesianism, Cybernetics, Capitalism, Communication''] ontos, Frankfurt 2009 137 pp. {{ISBN|978-3-86838-045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital vs. informational physics===
Not every informational approach to physics (or [[ontology]]) is necessarily [[Ontology (computer science)|digital]]. According to [[Luciano Floridi]],&lt;ref&gt;Floridi, L., 2004, "[http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV37Floridi.pdf Informational Realism,]" in Weckert, J., and Al-Saggaf, Y, eds., ''Computing and Philosophy Conference'', vol. 37."&lt;/ref&gt; "informational structural realism" is a variant of [[structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structural]] [[scientific realism|realism]] that supports an ontological commitment to a world consisting of the totality of informational objects dynamically interacting with each other. Such informational objects are to be understood as constraining affordances.

Pancomputationalists like Lloyd (2006), who models the universe as a [[quantum computer]], can still maintain an analogue or hybrid ontology; and informational ontologists like [[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]] and Floridi embrace neither a digital ontology nor a pancomputationalist position.&lt;ref&gt;See Floridi talk on Informational Nature of Reality, abstract at the E-CAP conference 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational foundations==

===Turing machines===
{{Main|Turing machine}}

===The Church–Turing–Deutsch thesis===
The classic [[Church–Turing thesis]] claims that any computer as powerful as a [[Turing machine]] can, in principle, calculate anything that a human can calculate, given enough time. Turing moreover showed that there exist [[universal Turing machine]]s which can compute anything any other Turing machine can compute—that they are generalizable Turing machines. &lt;!-- A stronger version, not attributable to Church or Turing,&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Jack Copeland]], ''Computation'' in Luciano Floridi (ed.), ''The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, ISBN 0-631-22919-1, pp. 10–15&lt;/ref&gt; claims that [Surely not that universal Turing machines exist! That isn't even a "claim", let alone a stronger one]. --&gt; But the limits of practical computation are set by [[physics]], not by theoretical computer science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Turing did not show that his machines can solve any problem that can be solved 'by instructions, explicitly stated rules, or procedures', nor did he prove that the universal Turing machine 'can compute any function that any computer, with any architecture, can compute'. He proved that his universal machine can compute any function that any Turing machine can compute; and he put forward, and advanced philosophical arguments in support of, the thesis here called Turing's thesis. But a thesis concerning the extent of effective methods—which is to say, concerning the extent of procedures of a certain sort that a human being unaided by machinery is capable of carrying out—carries no implication concerning the extent of the procedures that machines are capable of carrying out, even machines acting in accordance with 'explicitly stated rules.' For among a machine's repertoire of atomic operations there may be those that no human being unaided by machinery can perform."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: "[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/church-turing/#Bloopers The Church–Turing thesis]" – by [[B. Jack Copeland]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, a modification of Turing's assumptions ''does'' bring practical computation within Turing's limits; as [[David Deutsch]] puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I can now state the physical version of the Church–Turing principle: 'Every ''finitely'' realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by ''finite'' means.' This formulation is both better defined and more physical than Turing's own way of expressing it."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Deutsch]], "Quantum Theory, the Church–Turing Principle and the Universal Quantum Computer."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This compound conjecture is sometimes called the "strong Church–Turing thesis" or the [[Church–Turing–Deutsch principle]]. It is stronger because a human or Turing machine computing with pencil and paper (under Turing's conditions) is a finitely realizable physical system.

==Experimental confirmation==

So far there is no experimental confirmation of either binary or quantized nature of the universe, which are basic for digital physics.
The few attempts made in this direction would include the experiment with [[holometer]] designed by [[Craig Hogan]], which among others would detect a bit structure of space-time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Salles, "Do we live in a 2-D hologram? New Fermilab experiment will test the nature of the universe", Fermilab Office of Communication, August 26, 2014
[http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/2014/2-D-Hologram-20140826.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The experiment started collecting data in August 2014.

A new result of the experiment released on December 3, 2015, after a year of data collection, has ruled out Hogan's theory of a pixelated universe to a high degree of statistical significance (4.6 sigma). The study found that [[space-time]] is not [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] at the scale being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.fnal.gov/2015/12/holometer-rules-out-first-theory-of-space-time-correlations/|title=Holometer rules out first theory of space-time correlations {{!}} News|website=news.fnal.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Physical symmetries are continuous===
One objection is that extant models of digital physics are incompatible {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} with the existence of several continuous characters of physical [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]], e.g., [[rotational symmetry]], [[translational symmetry]], [[Lorentz symmetry]], and the [[Lie group]] gauge invariance of [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]], all central to current physical theory.

Proponents of digital physics claim that such continuous symmetries are only convenient (and very good) approximations of a discrete reality. For example, the reasoning leading to systems of [[natural units]] and the conclusion that the [[Planck length]] is a minimum meaningful unit of distance suggests that at some level, space itself is quantized.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, computers can manipulate and solve formulas describing real numbers using [[symbolic computation]], thus avoiding the need to approximate real numbers by using an infinite number of digits.

A number—in particular a [[real number]], one with an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of digits—was defined by [[Turing]] to be [[computable real|computable]] if a [[Turing machine]] will continue to spit out digits endlessly. In other words, there is no "last digit". But this sits uncomfortably with any proposal that the universe is the output of a virtual-reality exercise carried out in real time (or any plausible kind of time). Known physical laws (including [[quantum mechanics]] and its [[continuous spectrum|continuous spectra]]) are very much infused with [[real number]]s and the mathematics of the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So ordinary computational descriptions do not have a cardinality of states and state space trajectories that is sufficient for them to map onto ordinary mathematical descriptions of natural systems. Thus, from the point of view of strict mathematical description, the thesis that everything is a computing system in this second sense cannot be supported".&lt;ref name="Piccinini"&gt;[[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini, Gualtiero]], 2007, "Computational Modelling vs. Computational Explanation:  Is Everything a Turing Machine, and Does It Matter to the Philosophy of Mind?" ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' 85(1): 93–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For his part, [[David Deutsch]] generally takes a "[[multiverse]]" view to the question of continuous vs. discrete. In short, he thinks that “within each universe all observable quantities are discrete, but the multiverse as a whole is a continuum. When the equations of quantum theory describe a continuous but not-directly-observable transition between two values of a discrete quantity, what they are telling us is that the transition does not take place entirely within one universe. So perhaps the price of continuous motion is not an infinity of consecutive actions, but an infinity of concurrent actions taking place across the multiverse.”  January, 2001 The Discrete and the Continuous, an abridged version of which appeared in The Times Higher Education Supplement.

===Locality===
Some argue that extant models of digital physics violate various postulates of [[quantum physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review on ''A New Kind of Science'' by Stephen Wolfram|journal=Quantum Information and Computation (QIC)|date=September 2002|arxiv=quant-ph/0206089}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if these models are not grounded in [[Hilbert space]]s and probabilities, they belong to the class of theories with local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] that have so far been ruled out experimentally using [[Bell's theorem]]. This criticism has two possible answers. First, any notion of locality in the digital model does not necessarily have to correspond to locality formulated in the usual way in the emergent [[spacetime]]. A concrete example of this case was given by [[Lee Smolin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=September 2012}} Another possibility is a well-known loophole in [[Bell's theorem]] known as [[superdeterminism]] (sometimes referred to as predeterminism).&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Bell, 1981, "Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality," ''Journal de Physique'' '''42''' C2: 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a completely deterministic model, the experimenter's decision to measure certain components of the spins is predetermined. Thus, the assumption that the experimenter could have decided to measure different components of the spins than he actually did is, strictly speaking, not true.

'''Dunyazad''' is a large [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] first discovered by the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft. It is named after [[Dunyazad]], the sister of [[Scheherazade]] in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

Dunyazad is located at {{coord|41.9|N|200.6|W|globe:enceladus_type:landmark|notes=&lt;ref name=gpn/&gt;}} and is approximately 31 kilometers across, making it one of the largest craters on Enceladus.  It is the southernmost crater of a prominent crater triplet on Enceladus' anti-Saturnian hemisphere (there is no evidence that the impacts are related or were formed from break-up of a single body, like [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]]). The craters to its north are [[Shahrazad_(crater)|Shahrazad]], and [[Al-Haddar_(crater)|Al-Haddar]].&lt;ref name="Se-4"/&gt; ''Voyager 2'' [[discovery images]] of this crater revealed an up-domed floor at Dunyazad, suggesting that the crater had been modified by viscous relaxation.  Higher resolution views of Dunyazad taken by the [[Cassini-Huygens Mission|''Cassini'' Spacecraft]] during a close flyby on March 9, 2005 reveal not only an up-domed floor, but numerous tectonic fractures as well, particularly within the dome and northeastern crater rim.

The '''Economic and Social Research Council''' ('''ESRC''') is one of the seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It receives most of its funding from the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], and provides funding and support for research and training work in the [[social sciences]] and [[economics]], such as postgraduate degrees.

==Structure==
The ESRC is based at Polaris House in [[Swindon]], UK which is also the location of the head offices of several other UK Research Councils and [[Innovate UK]]. ESRC is part of [[United Kingdom Research and Innovation]] (UKRI)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukri.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;, an organisation that brings together the UK’s research councils, Innovate UK and [[Research England]]. UKRI is a [[non-departmental public body]] funded by a grant-in-aid from the [[UK government]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} &lt;ref name="ESRC what they do"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/what-we-do/|title = ESRC what they do|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ESRC's mission, according to its website, is to:&lt;ref name="mission, strategy and priorities"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/strategy-and-priorities/|title = ESRC mission, strategy and priorities|publisher = ESRC|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* promote and support, by any means, high-quality research and related postgraduate training on social and economic issues
* develop and support the national data infrastructure that underpins high-quality research
* advance knowledge and provide trained social scientists who meet the needs of users and beneficiaries, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of the UK, the effectiveness of public services and policy, and the quality of life
* communicate clearly and promote public understanding of social science.

==History==
The ESRC was founded in 1965 as the ''Social Science Research Council'' (SSRC - not to be confused with the [[Social Science Research Council]] in the United States). The establishment of a state [[funding body]] for the social sciences in the United Kingdom, had been under discussion since the [[World War II|Second World War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ESRC's history|publisher = ESRC|date = December 2015|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the 1964 election of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] that the political climate for the creation of the SSRC became sufficiently favourable.

The first chief executive of the SSRC was [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (later Baron Young of Dartington). Subsequent holders of the post have included [[Michael Posner (economist)|Michael Posner]], later Secretary General of the [[European Science Foundation]]. The current Chief Executive of the ESRC is [https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/governance-and-structure/directors/jennifer-rubin/ Professor Jennifer Rubin] who took over from Professor [[Jane Elliott (academic)|Jane Elliott]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = King's Professor Jennifer Rubin appointed ESRC Chief Executive|publisher = KCL|url = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/news/newsrecords/2017/King's-Professor-Jennifer-Rubin-appointed-ESRC-Chief-Executive.aspx|accessdate = 2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Change of name===
Following the election of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 general election, the Government expressed reservations about the value of research in the social sciences, and the extent to which it should be publicly funded. In 1981, the Education Secretary [[Keith Joseph|Sir Keith Joseph]] asked [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] to lead a review into the future of the SSRC.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It was ultimately decided (due in no small part to the efforts of Michael Posner, chief executive of the SSRC at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michael Posner Obituary|publisher = The Independent|date = April 2009|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-posner-6107063.html|accessdate = 2015-12-03|location = London|first = Michael|last = Kuczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the Council should remain, but that its remit should be expanded beyond the social sciences, to include more 'empirical' research and research of 'more public concern'. To reflect this, in 1983 the SSRC was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SSRC/ESRC: the first forty years|publisher = ESRC|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/ssrc-and-esrc-the-first-forty-years/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EteRNA''' is a [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[Human-based computation game|"game with a purpose"]], developed by scientists at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Stanford University]], that engages users to solve puzzles related to the [[Protein folding|folding]] of [[RNA]] molecules.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/science/11rna.html?_r=3&amp;ref=science "RNA Game Lets Players Help Find a Biological Prize"], John Markoff, ''[[New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project is supported by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eternagame.org/web/about/|title=Eterna - Invent Medicine.|website=www.eternagame.org|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior funders include the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;[http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/asbmbtoday_article.aspx?id=13070 "Rebooting science outreach"], Alan Chen, [[American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]], June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[Foldit]]&amp;mdash;created by some of the same researchers that developed EteRNA&amp;mdash;the puzzles take advantage of human [[problem-solving]] capabilities to solve puzzles that are computationally laborious for current computer models. The researchers hope to capitalize on "[[crowdsourcing]]"&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-01-17/bay-area/27033241_1_algorithm-eterna-scrap-paper "RNA research EteRNA gets its game on"], Erin Allday, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[collective intelligence]]&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; of EteRNA players to answer fundamental questions about RNA folding mechanics. The top voted designs are [[RNA synthesis|synthesized]] in a Stanford biochemistry lab to evaluate the folding patterns of the RNA molecules to compare directly with the computer predictions, ultimately improving the [[computer simulation|computer models]].&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/01/11/5814820-play-a-game-and-engineer-real-rna?ocid=twitter "Play a game and engineer real RNA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318222503/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/01/11/5814820-play-a-game-and-engineer-real-rna?ocid=twitter |date=2012-03-18 }}, John Roach, ''[[MSNBC]]'', January 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, EteRNA researchers hope to determine a "complete and repeatable set of rules" to allow the synthesis of RNAs that consistently fold in expected shapes.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/piper/piper/2011/february/qa_treuille.html "Treuille On EteRNA - A Game Played By Humans, Scored By Nature"]:Interview with Adrien Treuille, Byron Spice, Faculty &amp; Staff News, [[Carnegie Mellon University]], January 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; EteRNA project leaders hope that determining these basic principles may facilitate the design of RNA-based [[nanomachine]]s and [[switch]]es.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://eternagame.org/web/about/ About EteRNA]&lt;/ref&gt; EteRNA creators have been pleasantly surprised by the solutions of EteRNA players, particularly those of non-researchers whose "creativity isn't constrained by what they think a correct answer should look like".&lt;ref name=Price&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/07/will-nih-embrace-biomedical-research.html?ref=hp "Will NIH Embrace Biomedical Research Prizes?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726154850/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/07/will-nih-embrace-biomedical-research.html?ref=hp |date=2011-07-26 }}, Michael Price, ''ScienceInsider'', [[science (journal)|''Science'']] 19 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, EteRNA has about 250,000 registered players.&lt;ref name=eterna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotechit.com/story/gamers-crush-algorithms-rna-structure-design-challenge/2016-02-18?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokuqrNeu%2FhmjTEU5z17e8uX6S3lMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4FS8pmPK%2BTFAwTG5toziV8R7LMKM1ty9MQWxTk|title=Gamers crush algorithms in RNA structure design challenge|author=Taylor, Nick|publisher=fiercebiotechit.com|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players are presented with a given target shape into which an RNA strand must fold. The player can change the sequence by placing any of the four [[RNA]] [[nucleotide]]s ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanosine]] and [[uracil]]) at various positions; this can alter the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the system and dramatically affect the RNA strand's folding dynamics. In EteRNA, different restrictions, such as those on the number of certain [[Nucleobase|bases]] and the number of the three [[base pair]] types, as well as locked bases, are sometimes imposed. A [[molecule]] is occasionally also included, which [[RNA-binding protein|binds]] with the RNA and has critical effects on the free energy of the system. In some more advanced puzzles, players may be presented with two or three different target shapes at the same time; the single sequence the player produces must fold in the respective shapes under different conditions (presence or absence of a binding molecule).

EteRNA puzzles are roughly classified into three types: Challenges, Player Puzzles, and Cloud Lab. Challenges are the puzzles prepared by the game-makers to introduce players to the workings of EteRNA as well as to provide series of pre-set puzzles for players to attempt. Player puzzles are generated by players, and Cloud Lab is where the active, proposed and archived laboratory projects are presented for players to review, vote or attempt.

New players are guided through an initial puzzle progression which introduces the basic concepts of RNA structure and design. As players proceed through puzzles of increasing complexity, additional game interface elements are unlocked. After earning 10 badges representing the 10 stages of the progression, players gain access to the Cloud Lab where they can participate in laboratory research. Once players have completed a sufficient number of RNA puzzles, they unlock the chance to generate puzzles for other players. These puzzles can be selected as future synthesis candidates if they fit certain rules and prove interesting for research.

==Biomedical Challenges==
In 2016, EteRNA launched its first biomedical challenge called '''OpenTB''', an initiative to develop a new diagnostic device for tuberculosis. The project uses a gene expression "signature" discovered by Stanford researchers using public data, and aims to create an open source, paper-based diagnostic kit that can be easily deployed in clinics around the world. The development of the open source kit is a collaboration with MIT's [http://littledevices.mit.edu Little Devices Lab]. Players successfully designed RNAs to detect the gene signature by round 2 of the challenge, and as of February 2018 testing continues with real patient samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eternagame.org/web/lab/8489876/|title=OpenTB Lab Challenge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of OpenTB, EteRNA launched '''OpenCRISPR''' in August 2017, which challenges players to design single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) used in CRISPR gene editing. The goal of the project is to create a new class of sgRNAs that can be modulated by another small molecule (such as theophylline), allowing gene editing in the body to be turned on or off as needed. At the conclusion of round 1 in November 2017, players had submitted over 90,000 RNA designs for synthesis, the largest set of submissions to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eternagame.org/web/lab/8037883/|title=OpenCRISPR Lab Challenge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==

*By August 2011, approximately 26,000 players had contributed RNA sequence designs and over 306 designs have been synthesized for ''[[in vitro]]'' testing.&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-public-playing-a-molecule-building-game-outperforms-scientists/32835 "The Public, Playing a Molecule-Building Game, Outperforms Scientists"], Rachel Wiseman, Wired Campus blog, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', August 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*In January 2014, the results from EteRNA have been published in the [[PNAS]] journal, with "EteRNA participants" listed as co-authors in the paper.&lt;ref name=PNASnews&gt;{{cite web|author1=EteRNA Team|title=Eterna results published in PNAS|url=http://eternagame.org/web/news/3741483/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PNASpublication&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jeehyung|last2=Kladwang|first2=Wipapat|last3=Lee|first3=Minjae|last4=Cantu|first4=Daniel|last5=Azizyan|first5=Martin|last6=Kim|first6=Hanjoo|last7=Limpaecher|first7=Alex|last8=Yoon|first8=Sungroh|last9=Treuille|first9=Adrien|last10=Das|first10=Rhiju|last11=EteRNA participants|title=RNA design rules from a massive open laboratory|journal=PNAS|date=Jan 17, 2014|pages=1–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.1313039111|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/01/23/1313039111.full.pdf+html|volume=111|pmc=3926058}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The EteRNA gamers beat the supercomputer-powered algorithms in solving all the 100 RNA secondary structure design challenges, while the best score of the six algorithms used is 54.  By manipulating the chemical sequences of RNA the gamers created stable forms of desired shapes. The strategies designed by the players identified specific structural features that make inverse RNA folding difficult. The EteRNA researchers hope that by integrating their strategies into algorithms, improvement in automated RNA secondary structure design can be achieved. The results of the challenges were published in the [[Journal of Molecular Biology]] on February 2016.&lt;ref name=eterna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson-Lee|first1=J.|last2=Fisker|first2=E.|last3=Das|first3=Rhiju|displayauthors=2|date=17 February 2016|title=Principles for Predicting RNA Secondary Structure Design Difficulty|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283615006567|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|publisher=Elsevier|volume=428|pages=748–757|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2015.11.013|pmc=4833017|pmid=26902426|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first paper based on dominant writing contributions—and co-lead authorship—by non-expert citizen scientists recruited through a video game.

'''Factor Ten''' is a social and economic policy program developed by the Factor Ten institute with the stated goal of reducing human resource turnover by 90% on a global scale within the next 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factor10-institute.org/ |title=Factor 10 Institute |publisher=Factor 10 Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, from the [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]], first proposed the Factor 10 and [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] concepts in the early 1990s. He concluded in his studies that 80% of the world’s resources are distributed among [[First World]] nations, which contribute 20% of the global population, so those nations are promoting an unsustainable system of development. The goal of Factor 10 is to assure that nations do not exceed the planet’s [[carrying capacity]] but leave sufficient resources for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/factor-10 |title=Factor 10 : Dictionary of Sustainable Management |publisher=Sustainabilitydictionary.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factor 4 ==
Factor 10 evolved from the less dramatic '''Factor 4''' was originally proposed by [[L. Hunter Lovins]] and [[Amory Lovins]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] and [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker|Ernst von Weizsäcker]], the founder of the [[Wuppertal Institute]] for Climate, Environment &amp; Energy. Their book ''Factor 4'' explains how simple it is for nations to achieve Factor 4 results with existing technologies. The concept attempts to reduce resource and energy use by 75 % by doubling output and halving input of production.

== Goals ==
Factor 10 requires the creation of new technologies, policies, and manufacturing processes along with sociocultural change to create a [[global economy]] that is sustainable for a long period of time. The long-term goal of Factor 10, many governments and firms aspiring toward shortIterm relief have difficulty achieving the massive reductions proposed by factor 10. [[Eco-efficiency]], environmental purchasing design for environment, policies and [[environmental taxes]] have already been used by business and governments implementing the Factor 10 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/sustdev/concepts/11-f10.html |title=Sustainability Concepts: Factor 10 |publisher=Gdrc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factor 10 goes farther as a response to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] call for a tenfold reduction in resource consumption in industrialised countries as a necessary long-term target if adequate resources are to be released for the needs of the [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UNEP]], Global Environmental Outlook 2000, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; With the predicted rise in population and economic growth to maintain the level of [[pollution]] we have today, we need to be able to produce the same output for 10% of the impact.

Factor X concept is the direct way of using metric and various activities that can reduce the throughput of resources and energy in the given process. The essential question is by what factor can or should certain flows be reduced. It is a useful tool to monitor the performance of business in terms of [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert, K.H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., et al. (2002).

'''Fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity''' is the change in reactivity of the nuclear fuel per degree change in the fuel temperature. The coefficient quantifies the amount of neutrons that the nuclear fuel (such as [[uranium-238]]) absorbs from the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] process as the fuel temperature increases. It is a measure of the stability of the reactor operations. This coefficient is also known as the '''Doppler coefficient'''.

The '''Functional Mock-up Interface''' (or '''FMI''') defines a standardized [[Interface (computing)|interface]] to be used in [[computer simulation]]s to develop complex [[cyber-physical system]]s.

The vision of '''FMI''' is to support this approach: if the real product is to be assembled from a wide range of parts interacting in complex ways, each controlled by a complex set of [[physical law]]s, then it should be possible to create a '''virtual product''' that can be assembled from a set of models that each represent a combination of parts, each a model of the physical laws as well as a model of the [[control system]]s (using [[electronics]], [[hydraulics]], digital [[software]], ..) assembled digitally.
The FMI standard thus provides the means for '''model based development of systems''' and is used for example for designing functions that are driven by electronic devices inside vehicles (e.g. ESP controllers, active safety systems, combustion controllers).
Activities from systems modelling, simulation, validation and test can be covered with the FMI based approach. 
 
To create the FMI standard, a large number of software companies and research centers have worked in a cooperation project established through a European consortium  that has been conducted by [[Dassault Systèmes]] under the name of '''MODELISAR'''.
The [[MODELISAR]] project started in 2008 to define the FMI specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through Use Cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products.

The development of the FMI specifications was coordinated by [[Daimler AG]].

After the end of the [[MODELISAR]] project in 2011, FMI is managed and developed as a [https://www.modelica.org/projects Modelica Association Project (MAP)].

The four required FMI aspects of creating models capable of being assembled have been covered in Modelisar project: 
* FMI for model exchange,
* FMI for [[co-simulation]],
* FMI for applications,
* FMI for [[Product life cycle management (marketing)|PLM]] (integration of models and related data in product life-cycle management).

In practice, the FMI implementation by a software modelling tool enables the creation of a simulation model that can be interconnected or the creation of a software library called '''FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit)'''.

== The FMI approach ==
The typical FMI approach is described in the following stages:
* a modelling environment describes a product sub-system by differential, algebraic and discrete equations with time, state and step-events. These models can be large for usage in off-line or on-line simulation or can be used in embedded control systems;
* as an alternative, an engineering tool defines the controller code for controlling a vehicle system;
* such tools generate and export the component in an FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit);
* an FMU can then be imported in another environment to be executed;
* several FMUs can – by this way – cooperate at runtime through a co-simulation environment, thanks to the FMI definitions of their interfaces.

  &lt;/ModelVariables&gt;
&lt;/fmiModelDescription&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comparison to Simulink S-Functions==
FMI is often compared to [[Simulink]] S-Functions since both technologies can be used to integrate third-party tools together.  S-Functions are used to specify a computer language description of a dynamic system. They are compiled as MEX-files that are dynamically linked into [[MATLAB]] when needed. S-Functions use a calling syntax that interacts with Simulink’s equation solvers. This interaction is similar to the interaction that takes place between built-in Simulink blocks and the solvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMI proponents explain that FMI models have several advantages over Simulink S-Functions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://synchronics.inria.fr/lib/exe/fetch.php/modelica-fmi-elmqvist.pdf |title=Functional Mockup Interface – Overview |author1=Martin Otter |author2=Hilding Elmqvist |author3=Torsten Blochwitz |author4=Jakob Mauss |author5=Andreas Junghanns |author6=Hans Olsson |work=synchronics.inria.fr |publisher=[[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|INRIA]] |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233637/http://synchronics.inria.fr/lib/exe/fetch.php/modelica-fmi-elmqvist.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* S-Functions format is proprietary, whereas the FMI schema is licensed under a [[BSD licenses|BSD license]].
* The building blocks of S-Functions are much more complex than FMI, making it very difficult to integrate in simulators other than Simulink itself.
* Furthermore, the S-Functions format is specific to Simulink.
* S-Functions are not suited for [[embedded system]]s, due to the memory overhead of S-Functions.

There are also several limitations cited when using FMI/FMU:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Memory - Parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are not exposed directly to the outside, which is in contrast to how ECU software is normally organized with respect to memory to allow transparency, simplicity, and efficiency.
* Event handling - Events could increase the runtime for real-time systems in an unpredictable manner.
* Potentially dangerous features can be included on ECU - Some features that make sense for offline simulations should not be present on the ECU.  Examples of features that are either supported or not explicitly forbidden in the FMI include logging and I/O operations such as print().
* Data type support - More supported data types are necessary for optimized code.  For example, there is not a way to distinguish between a uint8 and uint32 variable.

==Tools support==
As of November 2011, FMI is supported on the following simulation frameworks:&lt;ref name="modelica_Jan10"/&gt;

== Accompanying Standards and Recommendations ==
In May 2014, the Project Group Smart Systems Engineering (SmartSE) of the [[ProSTEP iViP]] Association published its Recommendation PSI 11 for the cross-company behavior model exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/medialibrary/publications/recommendations-standards.html#c1077 ProSTEP iViP Recommendation PSI 11, Smart Systems Engineering, Behavior Model Exchange, V 1.0], May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; FMI thereby is the technological basis. The PSI 11 specifies interaction scenarios, use cases, a reference process and templates, which thereby could ease the industrial application. End of 2016 the group published a movie, which should highlight the industrial benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3iIot0fO8&amp;t=52s Benefits of utilizing FMI for realizing cross-company Systems Engineering], Status February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gamma correction''', or often simply '''gamma''', is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode [[Relative luminance|luminance]] or [[CIE 1931 color space#Tristimulus values|tristimulus values]] in [[video]] or [[still image]] systems.&lt;ref name=poynton&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces | author = Charles A. Poynton | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-55860-792-7 | pages = 260, 630 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ra1lcAwgvq4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA630&amp;dq=gamma-encoding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma correction is, in the simplest cases, defined by the following [[Power law|power-law]] expression:
: &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = A {V_{\text{in}}^\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
where the non-negative real input value &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; is raised to the power &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and multiplied by the constant ''A,'' to get the output value &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt;. In the common case of {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 1}}, inputs and outputs are typically in the range 0–1.

A gamma value &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called an ''encoding gamma'', and the process of encoding with this compressive power-law nonlinearity is called '''gamma compression'''; conversely a gamma value &lt;math&gt;\gamma &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''decoding gamma'' and the application of the expansive power-law nonlinearity is called '''gamma expansion'''.

==Explanation==
Gamma encoding of images is used to optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image, or bandwidth used to transport an image, by taking advantage of the non-linear manner in which humans perceive light and color.&lt;ref name=poynton/&gt; The human perception of brightness, under common illumination conditions (not pitch black nor blindingly bright), follows an approximate [[power function]] (note: no relation to the [[gamma function]]), with greater sensitivity to relative differences between darker tones than between lighter ones, consistent with the [[Stevens' power law]] for brightness perception. If images are not gamma-encoded, they allocate too many bits or too much bandwidth to highlights that humans cannot differentiate, and too few bits or too little bandwidth to shadow values that humans are sensitive to and would require more bits/bandwidth to maintain the same visual quality.&lt;ref name=poynton/&gt;&lt;ref name=FQAGamma&gt;[http://www.poynton.com/notes/color/GammaFQA.html Charles Poynton (2010). Frequently Questioned Answers about Gamma.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gamma encoding of [[floating-point]] images is not required (and may be counterproductive), because the floating-point format already provides a piecewise linear approximation of a logarithmic curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erik Reinhard |author2=Wolfgang Heidrich |author3=Paul Debevec |author4=Sumanta Pattanaik |author5=Greg Ward |author6=Karol Myszkowski | title = High Dynamic Range Imaging: Acquisition, Display, and Image-Based Lighting | year = 2010 | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | isbn = 9780080957111 | page = 82 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w1i_1kejoYcC&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gamma encoding was developed originally to compensate for the input–output characteristic of [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays, that is not its main purpose or advantage in modern systems. In CRT displays, the light intensity varies nonlinearly with the electron-gun voltage. Altering the input signal by gamma compression can cancel this nonlinearity, such that the output picture has the intended luminance. However, the gamma characteristics of the display device do not play a factor in the gamma encoding of images and video—they need gamma encoding to maximize the visual quality of the signal, regardless of the gamma characteristics of the display device.&lt;ref name=poynton/&gt;&lt;ref name=FQAGamma/&gt; The similarity of CRT physics to the inverse of gamma encoding needed for video transmission was a combination of coincidence and engineering, which simplified the electronics in early television sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McKesson|first=Jason L. |title=Chapter 12.

==Generalized gamma==
The concept of gamma can be applied to any nonlinear relationship. For the [[power-law]] relationship &lt;math&gt;V_\text{out} = V_\text{in}^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, the curve on a log–log plot is a straight line, with slope everywhere equal to gamma (slope is represented here by the [[derivative]] operator):
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\mathrm{d} \log(V_{\text{out}})}{\mathrm{d} \log(V_{\text{in}})}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, gamma can be visualized as the slope of the input–output curve when plotted on logarithmic axes. For a power-law curve, this slope is constant, but the idea can be extended to any type of curve, in which case gamma (strictly speaking, "point gamma"&lt;ref&gt;R.W.G. Hunt, ''The Reproduction of Colour'', 6th Ed, p48&lt;/ref&gt;) is defined as the slope of the curve in any particular region.

==Film photography==
{{anchor|Photography}}
{{main|Sensitometry}}
When a [[photographic film]] is exposed to light, the result of the exposure can be represented on a graph showing log of [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] on the horizontal axis, and density, or log of transmittance, on the vertical axis. For a given film formulation and processing method, this curve is its [[Sensitometry|characteristic or Hurter–Driffield curve]].&lt;ref&gt;Kodak, "Basic sensitometry and characteristics of film" [http://motion.kodak.com/motion/uploadedFiles/US_plugins_acrobat_en_motion_newsletters_filmEss_06_Characteristics_of_Film.pdf]: "A characteristic curve is like a film’s fingerprint."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kodak&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/f4017/f4017.jhtml |title=Kodak Professional Tri-X 320 and 400 Films |date=May 2007 |publisher=[[Eastman Kodak Company]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both axes use logarithmic units, the slope of the linear section of the curve is called the gamma of the film. Negative film typically has a gamma less than 1; positive film (slide film, reversal film) typically has a gamma greater than 1.

Photographic film has a much greater ability to record fine differences in shade than can be reproduced on [[photographic paper]]. Similarly, most video screens are not capable of displaying the range of brightnesses (dynamic range) that can be captured by typical electronic cameras.&lt;ref&gt;

For this reason, considerable artistic effort is invested in choosing the reduced form in which the original image should be presented. The gamma correction, or contrast selection, is part of the photographic repertoire used to adjust the reproduced image.

Analogously, digital cameras record light using electronic sensors that usually respond linearly. In the process of rendering linear raw data to conventional [[RGB color model|RGB]] data (e.g. for storage into [[JPEG]] image format), color space transformations and rendering transformations will be performed. In particular, almost all standard [[RGB color space|RGB color spaces]] and file formats use a non-linear encoding (a [[gamma compression]]) of the intended intensities of the [[primary color]]s of the photographic reproduction; in addition, the intended reproduction is almost always nonlinearly related to the measured scene intensities, via a [[tone reproduction]] nonlinearity.

==Windows, Mac, sRGB and TV/video standard gammas==
{{further|sRGB#Specification of the transformation}}
[[File:SRGB gamma.svg|thumb|227px|Plot of the [[sRGB]] standard gamma-expansion nonlinearity in red, and its local gamma value (slope in log–log space) in blue. The local gamma rises from 1 to about 2.2.]]

In most computer display systems, images are encoded with a gamma of about 0.45 and decoded with the reciprocal gamma of 2.2. A notable exception, until the release of Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) in September 2009, were [[Macintosh]] computers, which encoded with a gamma of 0.55 and decoded with a gamma of 1.8. In any case, [[binary file|binary]] data in still image files (such as [[JPEG]]) are explicitly encoded (that is, they carry gamma-encoded values, not linear intensities), as are motion picture files (such as [[MPEG]]). The system can optionally further manage both cases, through [[color management]], if a better match to the output device gamma is required.

The [[sRGB color space]] standard used with most cameras, PCs, and printers does not use a simple power-law nonlinearity as above, but has a decoding gamma value near 2.2 over much of its range, as shown in the plot to the right. Below a compressed value of 0.04045 or a linear intensity of 0.00313, the curve is linear (encoded value proportional to intensity), so {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = 1}}. The dashed black curve behind the red curve is a standard {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = 2.2}} power-law curve, for comparison.

Output to CRT-based television receivers and monitors does not usually require further gamma correction, since the standard video signals that are transmitted or stored in image files incorporate gamma compression that provides a pleasant image after the gamma expansion of the CRT (it is not the exact inverse). For television signals, the actual gamma values are defined by the video standards ([[NTSC]], [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]]), and are always fixed and well-known values.

Gamma correction in computers is used, for example, to display a gamma = 1.8 Apple picture correctly on a gamma = 2.2 PC monitor by changing the image gamma. Another usage is equalizing of the individual color-channel gammas to correct for monitor discrepancies.

==Gamma meta information==
The "best" system gamma for display depends on the ambient light. Some picture formats include gamma meta information to allow the display system an automatic gamma correction. Some web browser use this meta information, others do not. The PNG format has the gAMA meta information, the Exif format has the Gamma tag. The [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/all_seven.html W3 PNG gamma test images] show that the Mozilla Firefox browser supports PNG gAMA and the Microsoft Edge browser does not.

==Power law for video display==
A ''gamma characteristic'' is a [[power law|power-law]] relationship that approximates the relationship between the encoded [[Luminance (video)|luma]] in a [[television]] system and the actual desired image luminance.

With this nonlinear relationship, equal steps in encoded luminance correspond roughly to subjectively equal steps in brightness. Ebner and Fairchild&lt;ref name="EbnerCIC61998"&gt;Fritz Ebner and Mark D Fairchild, "Development and testing of a color space (IPT) with improved hue uniformity," ''Proceedings of IS&amp;T/SID's Sixth Color Imaging Conference,'' p 8-13 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; used an exponent of 0.43 to convert linear intensity into lightness (luma) for neutrals; the reciprocal, approximately 2.33 (quite close to the 2.2 figure cited for a typical display subsystem), was found to provide approximately optimal perceptual encoding of grays. 

The following illustration shows the difference between a scale with linearly-increasing encoded luminance signal (linear gamma-compressed luma input) and a scale with linearly-increasing intensity scale (linear luminance output).

On most displays (those with gamma of about 2.2), one can observe that the linear-intensity scale has a large jump in perceived brightness between the intensity values 0.0 and 0.1, while the steps at the higher end of the scale are hardly perceptible. The gamma-encoded scale, which has a nonlinearly-increasing intensity, will show much more even steps in perceived brightness.

A [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), for example, converts a video signal to light in a nonlinear way, because the electron gun's intensity (brightness) as a function of applied video voltage is nonlinear. The light intensity ''I'' is related to the source [[voltage]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; according to
: &lt;math&gt;I \propto V_{\rm s}^{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''γ'' is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[gamma]]. For a CRT, the gamma that relates brightness to voltage is usually in the range 2.35 to 2.55; video [[look-up table]]s in computers usually adjust the system gamma to the range 1.8 to 2.2,&lt;ref name=poynton/&gt; which is in the region that makes a uniform encoding difference give approximately uniform perceptual brightness difference, as illustrated in the diagram at the top of this section.

For simplicity, consider the example of a monochrome CRT. In this case, when a video signal of 0.5 (representing a mid-gray) is fed to the display, the intensity or brightness is about 0.22 (resulting in a mid-gray, about 22% the intensity of white). Pure black (0.0) and pure white (1.0) are the only shades that are unaffected by gamma.

To compensate for this effect, the inverse transfer function (gamma correction) is sometimes applied to the video signal so that the end-to-end response is linear. In other words, the transmitted signal is deliberately distorted so that, after it has been distorted again by the display device, the viewer sees the correct brightness. The inverse of the function above is:
: &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm c} \propto V_{\rm s}^{1/\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the corrected voltage and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the source voltage, for example from an [[image sensor]] that converts photocharge linearly to a voltage. In our CRT example 1/''γ'' is 1/2.2 or 0.45.

A color CRT receives three video signals (red, green, and blue) and in general each color has its own value of gamma, denoted ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, in simple display systems, a single value of ''γ'' is used for all three colors.

Other display devices have different values of gamma: for example, a [[Game Boy Advance]] display has a gamma between 3 and 4 depending on lighting conditions. In LCDs such as those on laptop computers, the relation between the signal voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and the intensity ''I'' is very nonlinear and cannot be described with gamma value. However, such displays apply a correction onto the signal voltage in order to approximately get a standard {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = 2.5}} behavior. In [[NTSC]] [[television]] recording, {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = 2.2}}.

The power-law function, or its inverse, has a slope of infinity at zero. This leads to problems in converting from and to a gamma colorspace. For this reason most formally defined colorspaces such as [[sRGB]] will define a straight-line segment near zero and add raising {{nowrap|''x'' + ''K''}} (where ''K'' is a constant) to a power so the curve has continuous slope. This straight line does not represent what the CRT does, but does make the rest of the curve more closely match the effect of ambient light on the CRT. In such expressions the exponent is ''not'' the gamma; for instance, the sRGB function uses a power of 2.4 in it, but more closely resembles a power-law function with an exponent of 2.2, without a linear portion.

==Methods to perform display gamma correction in computing==
Up to four elements can be manipulated in order to achieve gamma encoding to correct the image to be shown on a typical 2.2- or 1.8-gamma computer display:
* The pixel's intensity values in a given image file; that is, the binary pixel values are stored in the file in such way that they represent the light intensity via gamma-compressed values instead of a linear encoding. This is done systematically with digital video files (as those in a [[DVD]] movie), in order to minimize the gamma-decoding step while playing, and maximize image quality for the given storage. Similarly, pixel values in standard image file formats are usually gamma-compensated, either for sRGB gamma (or equivalent, an approximation of typical of legacy monitor gammas), or according to some gamma specified by metadata such as an [[ICC profile]]. If the encoding gamma does not match the reproduction system's gamma, further correction may be done, either on display or to create a modified image file with a different profile.
* The rendering software writes gamma-encoded pixel binary values directly to the video memory (when [[highcolor]]/[[True Color|truecolor]] modes are used) or in the [[CLUT]] [[hardware register]]s (when [[indexed color]] modes are used) of the [[display adapter]]. They drive [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]]s (DAC) which output the proportional voltages to the display. For example, when using [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] color (8 bits per channel), writing a value of 128 (rounded midpoint of the 0–255 [[byte]] range) in video memory it outputs the proportional {{nowrap|≈ 0.5}} voltage to the display, which it is shown darker due to the monitor behavior. Alternatively, to achieve {{nowrap|≈ 50%}} intensity, a gamma-encoded [[look-up table]] can be applied to write a value near to 187 instead of 128 by the rendering software.
* Modern display adapters have dedicated calibrating CLUTs, which can be loaded once with the appropriate gamma-correction [[look-up table]] in order to modify the encoded signals digitally before the DACs that output voltages to the monitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536529.aspx ''SetDeviceGammaRamp'', the Win32 API to download arbitrary gamma ramps to display hardware]&lt;/ref&gt; Setting up these tables to be correct is called ''hardware calibration''.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;[http://ftp2.bmtmicro.com/dlc/Color%20Management.pdf Jonathan Sachs (2003). Color Management. Digital Light &amp; Color.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704074540/http://ftp2.bmtmicro.com/dlc/Color%20Management.pdf |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some modern monitors allow the user to manipulate their gamma behavior (as if it were merely another brightness/contrast-like setting), encoding the input signals by themselves before they are displayed on screen. This is also a ''calibration by hardware'' technique but it is performed on the analog electric signals instead of remapping the digital values, as in the previous cases.

In a correctly calibrated system, each component will have a specified gamma for its input and/or output encodings.&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; Stages may change the gamma to correct for different requirements, and finally the output device will do gamma decoding or correction as needed, to get to a linear intensity domain. All the encoding and correction methods can be arbitrarily superimposed, without mutual knowledge of this fact among the different elements; if done incorrectly, these conversions can lead to highly distorted results, but if done correctly as dictated by standards and conventions will lead to a properly functioning system.

In a typical system, for example from camera through [[JPEG]] file to display, the role of gamma correction will involve several cooperating parts. The camera encodes its rendered image into the JPEG file using one of the standard gamma values such as 2.2, for storage and transmission. The display computer may use a [[color management]] engine to convert to a different color space (such as older Macintosh's {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = 1.8}} color space) before putting pixel values into its video memory. The monitor may do its own gamma correction to match the CRT gamma to that used by the video system. Coordinating the components via standard interfaces with default standard gamma values makes it possible to get such system properly configured.

==Simple monitor tests==
[[File:Gamma correction test picture.png|left|frame|487px|Gamma correction test image]]

This procedure is not suitable for [[Color calibration|calibrating]] or print-proofing a monitor. It can be useful for making a monitor display sRGB images approximately correctly, on systems in which profiles are not used (for example, the Firefox browser prior to version 3.0 and many others) or in systems that assume untagged source images are in the sRGB colorspace.

Normally a graphics card has contrast and brightness control and a [[Transflective liquid-crystal display|transmissive LCD]] monitor has contrast, brightness and [[backlight]] control. Only backlight is a "real" brightness control. Graphics card and monitor contrast and brightness have a (negative) influence on gamma correction and should not be changed after gamma correction is completed. The correct brightness and contrast is often found with minimum setting of contrast and medium setting of brightness. The test image shows on top two grey gradients and below three areas of [[primary colors|primary colors]]. If the observers eye sees only a small white area in the middle of the first grey area and only a small black area in the middle of the second grey area, then the brightness and contrast settings are correct.

If the observer sees the same brightness in the lined part and in the homogeneous part of every colored area, for the desired gamma, then the gamma correction is approximately correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/gamma_calibration.php |title=Gamma calibration |last=Nienhuys |first=Han-Kwang |date=2008 |accessdate=2018-11-30 |quote=The reason for using 48% rather than 50% as a luminance is that many LCD screens have saturation issues in the last 5 percent of their brightness range that would distort the gamma measurement. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photoscientia.co.uk/Gamma.htm |title=The Monitor calibration and Gamma assessment page |last=Andrews |first=Peter |accessdate=2018-11-30 |quote=the problem is caused by the risetime of most monitor hardware not being sufficiently fast to turn from full black to full white in the space of a single pixel, or even two, in some cases. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the gamma correction values for the primary colors are slightly different. The test image display has to be pixel accurate; normally this is given at a [[web browser]] zoom value of 100%.

Setting the [[white point]] is the next step in monitor adjustment. Gamma correction and [[color balance]] are different, but both use a 3x3 matrix for transformation. The [[color temperature]] for a monitor in a bright environment, typical for type writing, is a [[color temperature]] between 5000K and 6500K or the [[Illuminant D65]].

Before gamma correction the [[color temperature]] of the monitor should be set to off or to 5500K. Using the controls for gamma, contrast and brightness, the gamma correction on a [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] can only be done for one specific vertical viewing angle, which implies one specific horizontal line on the monitor, at one specific brightness and contrast level. The quality (and price) of the monitor determines how much deviation of this operating point still gives a satisfactory gamma correction. [[Twisted nematic field effect|Twisted nematic]] (TN) displays have lowest quality with 6-bit [[color depth]] per primary color. [[IPS panel|In-plane switching]] (IPS) displays with typically 8-bit color depth. Some monitors have hardware [[color management]] and allow hardware calibration with a [[tristimulus colorimeter]] and have 10-bit color depth. The 24-bit and 32-bit color depth formats have 8 bits per primary color.

With Microsoft Windows 7 and above the user should set the gamma correction through the display color calibration tool dccw.exe. Increase the gamma slider in the dccw program until the last colored area, often the green color, has the same brightness in checkered and non-checkered area. The brightness controls for individual colors in the graphics card allow gamma correction of the two other colors. 

On some operating systems running the [[X Window System]], one can set the gamma correction factor (applied to the existing gamma value) by issuing the command &lt;code&gt;xgamma -gamma 0.9&lt;/code&gt; for setting gamma correction factor to 0.9, and &lt;code&gt;xgamma&lt;/code&gt; for querying current value of that factor (the default is 1.0). In [[OS X]] systems, the gamma and other related screen calibrations are made through the System Preferences.

==Terminology==
The term [[luminous exitance|intensity]] refers strictly to the amount of light that is emitted per unit of time and per unit of surface, in units of [[lux]]. Note, however, that in many fields of science this quantity is called [[luminous exitance]], as opposed to [[luminous intensity]], which is a different quantity. These distinctions, however, are largely irrelevant to gamma compression, which is applicable to any sort of normalized linear intensity-like scale.

"Luminance" can mean several things even within the context of video and imaging:
* ''[[luminance]]'' is the photometric brightness of an object, taking into account the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the human eye (in units of [[candela|cd]]/m²);
* ''[[relative luminance]]'' is the luminance relative to a white level, used in a color-space encoding;
* ''[[Luma (video)|luma]]'' is the encoded video brightness signal, i.e., similar to the signal voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.

One contrasts relative luminance in the sense of color (no gamma compression) with luma in the sense of video (with gamma compression), and denote relative luminance by ''Y'' and luma by ''Y''′, the prime symbol (′) denoting gamma compression.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Guideline EG 28, "Annotated Glossary of Essential Terms for Electronic Production," SMPTE, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that luma is not directly calculated from luminance, it is the (somewhat arbitrary) weighted sum of gamma compressed RGB components.&lt;ref name=poynton/&gt;

Likewise, ''[[brightness]]'' is sometimes applied to various measures, including light levels, though it more properly applies to a subjective visual attribute.

Gamma correction is a type of [[power law]] function whose exponent is the [[Greek letter]] [[gamma]] (''γ''). It should not be confused with the mathematical [[Gamma function]]. The lower case gamma, ''γ'', is a [[parameter]] of the former; the upper case letter, Γ, is the name of (and symbol used for) the latter (as in Γ(''x'')). To use the word "function" in conjunction with gamma correction, one may avoid confusion by saying "generalized power law function".

Without context, a value labeled gamma might be either the encoding or the decoding value. Caution must be taken to correctly interpret the value as that to be applied-to-compensate or to be compensated-by-applying its inverse. In common parlance, in many occasions the decoding value (as 2.2) is employed as if it were the encoding value, instead of its inverse (1/2.2 in this case), which is the ''real'' value that must be applied to encode gamma.

'''Hibernaculum''' (plural ''hibernacula'') is the term often applied to a winter bud of certain [[aquatic plant]]s, such as the [[bladderwort]]s (''[[Bladderwort|Utricularia]]'').  The buds are heavier than water, and, being developed at the approach of cold weather, they become detached, sink to the bottom of the pond, and thus survive the winter.  In the spring, they enlarge, developing [[buoyancy|air space]]s, rise to the surface, and reproduce their species.&lt;ref&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terrestrial plants also form hibernacula. These include some temperate sundews (''[[Drosera]]'') such as ''[[Drosera anglica|D.&amp;nbsp;anglica]]'', ''[[Drosera filiformis|D.&amp;nbsp;filiformis]]'', ''[[Drosera intermedia|D.&amp;nbsp;intermedia]]'', ''[[Drosera rotundifolia|D.&amp;nbsp;rotundifolia]]''; and some temperate butterworts (''[[Pinguicula]]'') such as ''[[Pinguicula balcanica|P.&amp;nbsp;balcanica]]'', ''[[Pinguicula grandiflora|P.&amp;nbsp;grandiflora]]'',  ''[[Pinguicula longifolia|P.&amp;nbsp;longifolia]]'', and ''[[Pinguicula vulgaris|P.&amp;nbsp;vulgaris]]''.

[[File:Skin_Microbiome20169-300.jpg|250px|thumb|Graphic depicting the human [[skin microbiota]], with relative prevalences of various classes of bacteria]]

The '''human microbiota''' is the aggregate of [[microorganism]]s that resides on or within any of a number of human tissues and biofluids, including the skin, mammary glands, placenta, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, [[oral mucosa]], [[conjunctiva]], [[Biliary tract|biliary]] and gastrointestinal tracts. They include [[Bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s and [[viruses]]. Though [[micro-animal]]s can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. The '''human microbiome''' refers specifically to the collective [[genome]]s of resident microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"&gt;{{cite book|last2 = Willey|first2 = Joanne|last1 = Sherwood|first1 = Linda|last3 = Woolverton|first3 = Christopher|title = Prescott's Microbiology|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=sBCSRAAACAAJ}}|year = 2013|isbn = 9780073402406|publisher = McGraw Hill|location = New York|edition = 9th|pages = 713–721|oclc = 886600661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are colonized by many microorganisms; the traditional estimate is that the average human body is inhabited by ten times as many non-human cells as human cells, but more recent estimates have lowered that ratio to 3:1 or even to approximately the same number.&lt;ref name=AAM2014&gt;American Academy of Microbiology [http://academy.asm.org/index.php/faq-series/5122-humanmicrobiome FAQ: Human Microbiome] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosner&gt;Judah L.

Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed ''normal flora'' or ''normal microbiota''.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;

The [[Human Microbiome Project]] took on the project of sequencing the genome of the human microbiota, focusing particularly on the microbiota that normally inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, digestive tract, and vagina.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt; It reached a milestone in 2012 when it published its initial results.&lt;ref name=hmpdata&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jun2012/nhgri-13.htm |title=NIH Human Microbiome Project defines normal bacterial makeup of the body |publisher=NIH News |date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{Life timeline}}
Though widely known as ''flora or'' ''microflora'', this is a [[misnomer]] in technical terms, since the word root ''[[flora]]'' pertains to plants, and ''[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]'' refers to the total collection of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Recently, the more appropriate term ''[[microbiota]]'' is applied, though its use has not eclipsed the entrenched use and recognition of ''flora'' with regard to bacteria and other microorganisms. Both terms are being used in different literature.&lt;ref name=Quigley2013rev/&gt;

==Relative numbers==
As of 2014, it was often reported in popular media and in the scientific literature that there are about 10 times as many microbial cells in the human body as there are human cells; this figure was based on estimates that the human microbiome includes around 100 trillion bacterial cells and that an adult human typically has around 10 trillion human cells.&lt;ref name=AAM2014/&gt; In 2014, the [[American Academy of Microbiology]] published a FAQ that emphasized that the number of microbial cells and the number of human cells are both estimates, and noted that recent research had arrived at a new estimate of the number of human cells{{spaced ndash}}approximately 37.2 trillion, meaning that the ratio of microbial-to-human cells, if the original estimate of 100 trillion bacterial cells is correct, is closer to 3:1.&lt;ref name=AAM2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosner/&gt; In 2016, another group published a new estimate of the ratio being roughly 1:1 (1.3:1, with "an uncertainty of 25% and a variation of 53% over the population of standard 70-kg males").&lt;ref name=NN2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sender/&gt;

==Study==
{{main|Human Microbiome Project}}
[[File:Microbiome analysis flowchart.png|thumb|right|Flowchart illustrating how the human microbiome is studied on the DNA level.]]
The problem of elucidating the human microbiome is essentially identifying the members of a microbial community which includes bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses.&lt;ref name="hmp"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = The NIH Human Microbiome Project | url = | journal = Genome Res | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 2317–2323 | doi=10.1101/gr.096651.109 | pmid=19819907 | pmc=2792171| author1 = NIH Human Microbiome Working Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done primarily using DNA-based studies, though RNA, protein and metabolite based studies are also performed.&lt;ref name=hmp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kucz2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kuczynski | first1 = J. et al| doi = 10.1038/nrg3129| title = Experimental and analytical tools for studying the human microbiome| journal = Nature Reviews Genetics| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 47–58| year = 2011| pmid = 22179717| pmc =5119550}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA-based microbiome studies typically can be categorized as either targeted [[amplicon]] studies or more recently [[shotgun sequencing|shotgun]] [[metagenomics|metagenomic]] studies. The former focuses on specific known marker genes and is primarily informative taxonomically, while the latter is an entire metagenomic approach which can also be used to study the functional potential of the community.&lt;ref name=hmp/&gt; One of the challenges that is present in human microbiome studies, but not in other metagenomic studies is to avoid including the host DNA in the study.&lt;ref name="Vest2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vestheim | first1 = H.| last2 = Jarman | first2 = S.

Aside from simply elucidating the composition of the human microbiome, one of the major questions involving the human microbiome is whether there is a "core", that is, whether there is a subset of the community that is shared among most humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards the human intestinal microbiota phylogenetic core |last=Tap |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=11 |issue=102 |pages=2574–2584 |year=2009|first1=Julien, et al. |last2=Mondot |pmid=19601958 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HK2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hamady | first1 = M.| last2 = Knight | first2 = R.| doi = 10.1101/gr.085464.108| title = Microbial community profiling for human microbiome projects: Tools, techniques, and challenges| journal = Genome Research| volume = 19 | issue = 7| pages = 1141–1152| year = 2009| pmid = 19383763| pmc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a core, then it would be possible to associate certain community compositions with disease states, which is one of the goals of the [[Human Microbiome Project]]. It is known that the human microbiome (such as the gut microbiota) is highly variable both within a single subject and among different individuals, a phenomenon which is also observed in mice.&lt;ref name=Quigley2013rev/&gt; 
  
On 13 June 2012, a major milestone of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was announced by the [[NIH]] director [[Francis Collins]].&lt;ref name=hmpdata/&gt; The announcement was accompanied with a series of coordinated articles published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A framework for human microbiome research|author=Human Microbiome Project Consortium |journal=Nature |volume=486 |issue=7402 |pages=215–221 |year=2012 |pmid=22699610| pmc=3377744| doi=10.1038/nature11209|bibcode=2012Natur.486..215T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome |author=The Human Microbiome Project Consortium |journal=Nature |volume=486 |issue=7402 |pages=207–214 |year=2012|pmid=22699609 |pmc=3564958 |doi=10.1038/nature11234 |bibcode=2012Natur.486..207T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several journals in the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) on the same day. By mapping the normal microbial make-up of healthy humans using genome sequencing techniques, the researchers of the HMP have created a reference database and the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans. From 242 healthy U.S. volunteers, more than 5,000 samples were collected from tissues from 15 (men) to 18 (women) body sites such as mouth, nose, skin, lower intestine (stool), and vagina. All the DNA, human and microbial, were analyzed with DNA sequencing machines. The microbial genome data were extracted by identifying the bacterial specific ribosomal RNA, [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. The researchers calculated that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem and they have identified 81 – 99% of the [[genera]].

=== Shotgun Sequencing ===
It is frequently difficult to culture in laboratory communities of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[Virus|viruses]], therefore [[DNA sequencing|sequencing technologies]] can be exploited in [[metagenomics]], too. Indeed, the complete knowledge of the functions and the characterization of specific microbial strains offer a great potentiality in therapeutic discovery and human health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Collection of samples and DNA extraction ====
The main point is to collect an amount microbial biomass that is sufficient to perform the sequencing and to minimize the sample contamination; for this reason, enrichment techniques can be used. In particular, the [[DNA extraction]] method must be good for every bacterial [[Strain (biology)|strain]], not to have the [[Genome|genomes]] of the ones that are easy to [[Lysis|lyse]]. Mechanical lysis is usually preferred rather than chemical lysis, and bead beating may result in [[DNA]] loss when preparing the library.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Preparation of the library and sequencing ====
The most used platforms are [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], [[Ion Torrent]], Oxford Nanopore [[MinION]] and [[Pacific Biosciences|Pacific Bioscience]] Sequel, although the Illumina platform is considered the most appealing option due to its wide availability, high output and accuracy. There are no indications regarding the correct amount of sample to use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Metagenome assembly ====
The [[De novo sequence assemblers|de novo]] approach is exploited; however, it presents some difficulties to be overcome. The [[Coverage (genetics)|coverage]] depends on each genome abundance in its specific community; low-abundance genomes may undergo [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] if the sequencing depth is not sufficient enough to avoid the formation of gaps. Luckily, there are metagenome-specific assemblers to help, since, if hundreds of strains are present, the sequencing depth needs to be increased to its maximum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Contig binning ====
Neither from which genome every [[contig]] derives, nor the number of genomes present in the sample are known ''a priori''; the aim of this step is to divide the contigs into species. The methods to perform such analysis can be either supervised (database with known sequences) or unsupervised (direct search for contig groups in the collected data). However, both methods require a kind of metric to define a score for the similarity between a specific contig and the group in which it must be put, and algorithms to convert the similarities into allocations in the groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Analysis after the processing ====
The statistical analysis is essential to validate the obtained results ([[Anova|ANOVA]] can be used to size the differences between the groups); if it is paired with graphical tools, the outcome is easily visualized and understood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quince|first=Christopher|last2=Walker|first2=Alan W|last3=Simpson|first3=Jared T|last4=Loman|first4=Nicholas J|last5=Segata|first5=Nicola|date=2017-09-12|title=Shotgun metagenomics, from sampling to analysis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3935|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=35|issue=9|pages=833–844|doi=10.1038/nbt.3935|issn=1087-0156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a metagenome is assembled, it is possible to infer the functional potential of the microbiome. The computational challenges for this type of analysis are greater than for single genomes, due the fact that usually metagenomes assemblers have poorer quality, and many recovered [[Gene|genes]] are non-complete or fragmented. After the gene identification step, the data can be used to carry out a functional annotation by means of multiple alignment of the target genes against [[orthologs]] databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claesson|first=Marcus J.|last2=Clooney|first2=Adam G.|last3=O'Toole|first3=Paul W.|date=2017-08-09|title=A clinician's guide to microbiome analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2017.97|journal=Nature Reviews Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|language=En|volume=14|issue=10|doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2017.97|issn=1759-5045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marker gene analysis ===
It is a technique that exploits [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|primers]] to target a specific genetic region and enables to determine the microbial [[phylogenies]]. The genetic region is characterized by a highly variable region which can confer detailed identification; it is delimited by conserved regions, which function as [[Binding site|binding sites]] for primers used in [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. The main gene used to characterize [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] is [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] gene, while fungi identification is based on [[Internal transcribed spacer|Internal Transcribed Spacer]] (ITS). The technique is fast and not so expensive and enables to obtain a low-resolution classification of a microbial sample; it is optimal for samples that may be contaminated by host DNA. Primer affinity varies among all DNA sequences, which may result in biases during the amplification reaction; indeed, low-abundance samples are susceptible to overamplification errors, since the other contaminating microorganisms result to be over-represented in case of increasing the PCR cycles. Therefore, the optimization of primer selection can help to decrease such errors, although it requires complete knowledge of the microorganisms present in the sample, and their relative abundances.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Rob|last2=Vrbanac|first2=Alison|last3=Taylor|first3=Bryn C.|last4=Aksenov|first4=Alexander|last5=Callewaert|first5=Chris|last6=Debelius|first6=Justine|last7=Gonzalez|first7=Antonio|last8=Kosciolek|first8=Tomasz|last9=McCall|first9=Laura-Isobel|date=2018-05-23|title=Best practices for analysing microbiomes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0029-9|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=16|issue=7|pages=410–422|doi=10.1038/s41579-018-0029-9|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marker gene analysis can be influenced by the primer choice; in this kind of analysis it's desirable to use a well-validated protocol (such as the one used in the [[Earth Microbiome Project]]). The first thing to do in a marker gene amplicon analysis is to remove sequencing errors; a lot of sequencing platforms are very reliable, but most of the apparent sequence diversity is still due to errors during the sequencing process. To reduce this phenomenon a first approach is to cluster sequences into [[Operational taxonomic unit]] (OTUs): this process consolidates similar sequences (a 97% similarity threshold is usually adopted) into a single feature that can be used in further analysis steps; this method however would discard [[SNPs]] because they would get clustered into a single OTU. Another approach is [[Oligotyping (taxonomy)|Oligotyping]], which includes position-specific information from 16s rRNA sequencing to detect small nucleotide variations and from discriminating between closely related distinct taxa. These methods give as an output a table of DNA sequences and counts of the different sequences per sample rather than OTU.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another important step in the analysis is to assign a taxonomic name to microbial sequences in the data. This can be done using [[machine learning]] approaches that can reach an accuracy at genus-level of about 80%. Other popular analysis packages provide support for taxonomic classification using exact matches to reference databases and should provide greater specificity, but poor sensitivity. Unclassified microorganism should be further checked for organelle sequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Phylogenetic Analysis ===
Many methods that exploit phylogenetic inference use the [[16S ribosomal RNA|16SRNA]] gene for Archea and Bacteria and the [[18S ribosomal RNA|18SRNA]] gene for Eukariotes. [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]] (PCS) are based on the comparison of multiple traits among microorganisms; the principle is: the closely they are related, the higher number of traits they share. Usually [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|PCS]] are coupled with phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) or other statistical analysis to get more significant results. Ancestral state reconstruction is used in microbiome studies to impute trait values for taxa whose traits are unknown. This is commonly performed with [[PICRUSt]], which relies on avaible databases. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] variables are chosen by researchers according to the type of study: through the selection of some variables with significant biological informations, it is possible to reduce the dimension of the data to analyse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Phylogenetic aware distance is usually performed with [[UniFrac]] or similar tools, such as Soresen's index or Rao's D, to quantify the differences between the different communities. All this methods are negatively affected by [[Horizontal gene transmission|horizontal gene trasmission]] (HGT), since it can generate errors and lead to the correlation of distant species. There are different ways to reduce the negative impact of HGT: the use of multiple genes or computational tools to assess the probability of putative HGT events.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Washburne|first=Alex D.|last2=Morton|first2=James T.|last3=Sanders|first3=Jon|last4=McDonald|first4=Daniel|last5=Zhu|first5=Qiyun|last6=Oliverio|first6=Angela M.|last7=Knight|first7=Rob|date=2018-05-24|title=Methods for phylogenetic analysis of microbiome data|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0156-0|journal=Nature Microbiology|language=En|volume=3|issue=6|pages=652–661|doi=10.1038/s41564-018-0156-0|issn=2058-5276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Bacteria ===
Populations of microbes (such as [[Bacterium|bacteria]] and [[yeast]]s) inhabit the skin and mucosal surfaces in various parts of the body. Their role forms part of normal, healthy human physiology, however if microbe numbers grow beyond their typical ranges (often due to a compromised immune system) or if microbes populate  (such as through poor hygiene or injury) areas of the body normally not colonized or sterile (such as the blood, or the lower respiratory tract, or the abdominal cavity), disease can result (causing, respectively, bacteremia/sepsis, pneumonia, and peritonitis).{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The Human Microbiome Project found that individuals host thousands of bacterial types, different body sites having their own distinctive communities. Skin and vaginal sites showed smaller diversity than the mouth and gut, these showing the greatest richness. The bacterial makeup for a given site on a body varies from person to person, not only in type, but also in abundance. Bacteria of the same species found throughout the mouth are of multiple subtypes, preferring to inhabit distinctly different locations in the mouth. Even the enterotypes in the human gut, previously thought to be well understood, are from a broad spectrum of communities with blurred taxon boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plos.org/media/press/2012/PLoS_%20HMP_Collection_Manuscript_Summaries.pdf PLoS Human Microbiome Project Collection Manuscript Summaries] 13 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/06/12149/consortium-scientists-map-human-bodys-bacterial-ecosystem|title = Consortium of Scientists Map the Human Body's Bacterial Ecosystem|work = ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 500 to 1,000 [[Species (biology)|species]] of bacteria live in the human gut but belong to just a few phyla: [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]] dominate but there are also [[Proteobacteria]], [[Victivallis vadensis|Verrumicrobia]], [[Actinobacteria]], [[Fusobacteria]] and [[Cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=Sommer2013rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sommer | first1 = F | last2 = Bäckhed | first2 = F | date = April 2013 | title = The gut microbiota—masters of host development and physiology | url = | journal = Nat Rev Microbiol | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 227–38 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2974 | pmid = 23435359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of types of bacteria, such as ''[[Actinomyces]] viscosus'' and ''A. naeslundii'', live in the mouth, where they are part of a sticky substance called [[Dental plaque|plaque]]. If this is not removed by brushing, it hardens into [[Calculus (dental)|calculus]] (also called tartar).  The same bacteria also secrete acids that dissolve [[tooth enamel]], causing [[tooth decay]].

The [[Vaginal flora|vaginal microflora]] consist mostly of various [[lactobacillus]] species. It was long thought that the most common of these species was ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'', but it has later been shown that ''[[Lactobacillus iners|L. iners]]'' is in fact most common, followed by ''[[Lactobacillus crispatus|L. crispatus]]''. Other lactobacilli found in the vagina are ''[[L. jensenii]], [[Lactobacillus delbruekii|L. delbruekii]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus gasseri|L. gasseri]]''. Disturbance of the vaginal flora can lead to infections such as [[bacterial vaginosis]] or [[candidiasis]] ("yeast infection").

=== Archaea ===

A study of twenty skin sites on each of ten healthy humans found 205 identified genera in nineteen bacterial phyla, with most sequences assigned to four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Grice|first1 = Elizabeth A.|year = 2006|last2 = Kong|first2 = HH|last3 = Conlan|first3 = S|last4 = Deming|first4 = CB|last5 = Davis|first5 = J|last6 = Young|first6 = AC|author7 = NISC Comparative Sequencing Program|last8 = Bouffard|first8 = GG|last9 = Blakesley|first9 = RW|last10 = Green|first10 = E.

The skin acts as a barrier to deter the invasion of pathogenic microbes. The human skin contains microbes that reside either in or on the skin and can be residential or transient. Resident microorganism types vary in relation to skin type on the human body. A majority of microbes reside on superficial cells on the skin or prefer to associate with glands. These glands such as oil or sweat glands provide the microbes with water, amino acids, and fatty acids. In addition, resident bacteria that associated with oil glands are often Gram-positive and can be pathogenic.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;

=== Conjunctiva ===
A small number of bacteria and fungi are normally present in the [[conjunctiva]].&lt;ref name="mycobiome" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Textbook/&gt; Classes of bacteria include Gram-positive cocci (e.g., ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' and [[Streptococcus]]) and Gram-negative rods and cocci (e.g., ''[[Haemophilus]]'' and ''[[Neisseria]]'') are present.&lt;ref name=Textbook&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/normalflora_3.html|title = The Normal Bacterial Flora of Humans|work = textbookofbacteriology.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal genera include ''Candida'', ''Aspergillus'', and ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name="mycobiome" /&gt; The [[lachrymal glands]] continuously secrete, keeping the conjunctiva moist, while intermittent blinking lubricates the conjunctiva and washes away foreign material. Tears contain bactericides such as [[lysozyme]], so that microorganisms have difficulty in surviving the lysozyme and settling on the [[Epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces.

===Uterus===
{{Main|Uterine microbiome}}
Until recently, the upper reproductive tract of women was considered to be a sterile environment. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the uterus of healthy, asymptomatic women of reproductive age. The microbiome of the uterus differs significantly from that of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract.&lt;!--The first studies of bacteria colonizing the [[uterus]] were published in 2015, were on special populations, and were too small from which to generalize.  In one study of 58 women undergoing hysterectomy, investigators looked for 12 species of bacteria; ''Lactobacillus'' and ''Prevotella'' were the most commonly detected species and overall density was much lower than vaginal colonization.  In another study of 22 infertile women undergoing [[assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatments]], ''Lactobacillus'' and ''Flavobacterium'' were most prevalent, and characteristics of the flora were roughly similar in women who became pregnant and those who didn't.--&gt;&lt;ref name="FranasiakScott2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franasiak|first1=Jason M.|last2=Scott|first2=Richard T.|title=Reproductive tract microbiome in assisted reproductive technologies|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=104|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1364–1371|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.10.012|pmid=26597628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment present in the human mouth allows the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there. It provides a source of water and nutrients, as well as a moderate temperature.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid-sensitive microbes are destroyed by hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang2014rev/&gt;

Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: ''[[Actinomyces]]'', ''[[Arachnia]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'', ''[[Eubacterium]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Leptotrichi]]a'', ''[[Peptococcu]]s'', ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'', ''[[Propionibacterium]]'', ''[[Selenomonas]]'', ''[[Treponema]]'', and ''[[Veillonella]]''.&lt;ref name="sutter"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1093/clinids/6.Supplement_1.S62 |last1 = Sutter|first1 = V.

Oral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or modify the host. However, a highly efficient innate host defense system constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial invasion of local tissues. A dynamic equilibrium exists between [[dental plaque]] bacteria and the innate host defense system.&lt;ref name="AnthonyHRogers"/&gt;

This dynamic between host oral cavity and oral microbes plays a key role in health and disease as it provides entry into the body.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zarco |first1=MF |last2=Vess |first2=TJ |last3=Ginsburg |first3=GS |title=The oral microbiome in health and disease and the potential impact on personalized dental medicine |journal=Oral Diseases |volume=18 |issue=2|year=2012 |pages=109–120 |issn=1354-523X |doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent proper oral hygiene is the primary method for preventing oral and systemic disease.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012" /&gt; It reduces the density of biofilm and overgrowth of potential pathogenic bacteria resulting in disease.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009" /&gt; However, proper oral hygiene may not be enough as the oral microbiome, genetics, and changes to immune response play a factor in developing chronic infections.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009" /&gt; Use of antibiotics could treat already spreading infection but ineffective against bacteria within biofilms.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009" /&gt;

=== Lung ===
{{Main|Lung microbiome}}
Much like the oral cavity, the upper and lower respiratory system possess mechanical deterrents to remove microbes.  Goblet cells produce mucous which traps microbes and moves them out of the respiratory system via continuously moving [[Cilium|ciliated]] epithelial cells.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; In addition, a bactericidal effect is generated by nasal mucus which contains the enzyme lysozyme.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; The upper and lower respiratory tract appears to have its own set of microbiota.&lt;ref name="Man2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Man WH, ((de Steenhuijsen Piters WAA)), Bogaert D | title = The microbiota of the respiratory tract: gatekeeper to respiratory health | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 259–270 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28316330 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro.2017.14 | url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulmonary bacterial microbiota belong to 9 major bacterial genera: ''Prevotella'', ''Sphingomonas'', ''Pseudomonas'', ''Acinetobacter'', ''Fusobacterium'', ''Megasphaera'', ''Veillonella'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Streptococcus''.

=== Biliary tract ===
Traditionally the biliary tract has been considered to be normally sterile, and the presence of microorganisms in bile is a marker of pathological process. This assumption was confirmed by failure in allocation of bacterial strains from the normal bile duct. Papers began emerging in 2013 showing that the normal biliary microbiota is a separate functional layer which protects a biliary tract from colonization by exogenous microorganisms.&lt;ref name=Verdier2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verdier|first1=J|last2=Luedde|first2=T|last3=Sellge|first3=G|title=Biliary Mucosal Barrier and Microbiome.|journal=Viszeralmedizin|date=June 2015|volume=31|issue=3|pages=156–61|doi=10.1159/000431071|pmid=26468308|pmc=4569210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microbiota may affect carcinogenesis in three broad ways: (i) altering the balance of tumor cell proliferation and death, (ii) regulating immune system function, and (iii) influencing metabolism of host-produced factors, foods and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt; Tumors arising at boundary surfaces, such as the skin, [[oropharynx]] and respiratory, digestive and [[urogenital]] tracts, harbor a microbiota. Substantial microbe presence at a tumor site does not establish association or causal links. Instead, microbes may find tumor [[oxygen tension]] or nutrient profile supportive. Decreased populations of specific microbes or induced [[oxidative stress]] may also increase risks.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt;&lt;ref name=wjg/&gt; Of the around 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; microbes on earth, ten are designated by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] as human carcinogens.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt; Microbes may secrete proteins or other factors directly drive cell proliferation in the host, or may [[upregulation|up-]] or [[downregulation|down-regulate]] the host immune system including driving acute or chronic inflammation in ways that contribute to carcinogenesis.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt;

Concerning the relationship of immune function and development of inflammation, [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] surface barriers are subject to environmental risks and must rapidly repair to maintain [[homeostasis]]. Compromised host or microbiota resiliency also reduce resistance to malignancy, possibly inducing inflammation and cancer. Once barriers are breached, microbes can elicit proinflammatory or immunosuppressive programs through various pathways.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer/&gt; For example, cancer-associated microbes appear to activate NF-κΒ signaling within the tumor microenviroment. Other pattern recognition receptors, such as [[NOD-like receptor|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor]] (NLR) family members [[NOD2|''NOD-2'']], ''[[NLRP3]]'', ''[[NLRP6]]'' and ''[[NLRP12]]'', may play a role in mediating colorectal cancer.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer/&gt;  Likewise ''Helicobacter pylori'' appears to increase the risk of gastric cancer,  due to its driving a chronic inflammatory response in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt;&lt;ref name=wjg/&gt;

=== Inflammatory bowel disease ===
Inflammatory bowel disease consists of two different diseases: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and both of these diseases present with disruptions in the gut microbiota (also known as [[dysbiosis]]).

Vaginal microbiota plays a role in the infectivity of HIV, with an increased risk of infection and transmission when the woman has [[bacterial vaginosis]], a condition characterized by an abnormal balance of vaginal bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrova|first=Mariya I.|last2=van den Broek|first2=Marianne|last3=Balzarini|first3=Jan|last4=Vanderleyden|first4=Jos|last5=Lebeer|first5=Sarah|date=1 September 2013|title=Vaginal microbiota and its role in HIV transmission and infection|url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/37/5/762/542986/Vaginal-microbiota-and-its-role-in-HIV|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=37|issue=5|pages=762–792|doi=10.1111/1574-6976.12029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced infectivity is seen with the increase in [[Proinflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory cytokines]] and [[CCR5|CCR5 +]] CD4+ cells in the vagina. However, a decrease in infectivity is seen with increased levels of vaginal ''Lactobacillus,'' which promotes an anti-inflammatory condition.&lt;ref name=Zilberman2016HIV/&gt;

=== Death ===
{{main|necrobiome}}
With death the microbiome of the living body collapses and a different microbiome named necrobiome establishes itself. Its predictable changes over time are thought to be useful to help determine the time of death.&lt;ref name=sa16&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/necrobiome-reveals-a-corpses-time-of-death/| author= Christopher Intagliata |title="Necrobiome" Reveals a Corpse's Time of Death |journal=[[Scientific American]] |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atl15&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/meet-the-necrobiome-the-predictable-microbes-that-will-eat-your-dying-corpse/419676/ | author=Ed Young |title= Meet the Necrobiome: The Waves of Microbes That Will Eat Your Corpse |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]| date=10 December 2015| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental health ==
Studies in 2009 questioned whether the decline in [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] (including [[microfauna]]) as a result of human intervention might impede human health, hospital safety procedures, food product design, and treatments of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-microbiome-change|title = Bugs Inside: What Happens When the Microbes That Keep Us Healthy Disappear?|author = Katherine Harmon|publisher = Scientific American|date = 16 December 2009|accessdate = 27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration ==
Preliminary research indicates that immediate changes in the microbiota may occur when a person [[International migration|migrates]] from one country to another, such as when [[Thailand|Thai]] [[immigrant]]s settled in the United States.&lt;ref name="vangay"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vanagay|first1=Pajau|last2=et al.|date=1 November 2018|title=US immigration westernizes the human gut microbiome|url=https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)31382-5.pdf|journal=Cell|volume=175|pages=962–972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losses of microbiota diversity were greater in obese individuals and children of immigrants.&lt;ref name=vangay/&gt;

'''Ignacio Bolívar y Urrutia''' (9 November 1850, [[Madrid]] &amp;ndash; 19 November 1944, [[Mexico]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[entomologist]], and one of the [[founding father]]s of Spanish entomology. He helped found the ''Real Sociedad Española de Historia Natural'' (Royal Spanish Natural History Society) in 1871, and was the author of several books and of over 1000 [[species]].

After the [[Spanish Civil War]] he was exiled to [[Mexico]] when the nationalist government harshly repressed Republican militants and sympathisers, as retaliation for the equally harsh repression of clergy and nationalist militants on the opposite side. Here he was made ''Doctor honoris'' of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].
In Mexico he was devoted mainly to entomology. In this field he wrote more than 300 books and monographs and discovered more than thousand new species and about 200 [[Genus|genera]]. 

He also encouraged other naturalists to study entomology, [[José María de la Fuente]] being one example.

Bolívar founded the journal ''Ciencia'' (Science). His more important works include:-
''Ortópteros de España nuevos o poco conocidos'' (1873) and ''Catálogo sinóptico de los ortópteros de la fauna ibérica'' (1900).

'''Russian philosophy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; includes a variety of [[Philosophical movement|philosophical movements]]. Authors who developed them are listed below sorted by movement.

While most authors listed below are primarily [[philosophers]], also included here are some [[Russian literature|Russian fiction]] writers, such as [[Tolstoy]] and [[Dostoyevsky]], who are also known as philosophers.

Russian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[History of Russia (1892–1917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]]. The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy.

In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[politics]] and [[nationalism]]; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and [[religion]] were other notable subjects.

Notable  philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include  [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]],  [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].

From the early 1920s to late 1980s, Russian philosophy was dominated by [[Marxism]] presented as dogma and not grounds for discussion. Stalin's purges, culminating in 1937, delivered a deadly blow to the development of philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

A handful of dissident philosophers survived through the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period, among them [[Aleksei Losev]]. Stalin's death in 1953 gave way for new schools of thought to spring up, among them Moscow Logic Circle, and [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32455">The following list is composed of items, techniques and processes that were invented by or discovered by people from [[Spanish people|Spain]].

Spain was an important center of knowledge during the [[medieval era]]. While most of western and southern Europe suffered from the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]], although declining, some regions of the former empire, [[Hispania]] (the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), [[southern Italy]], and the remainder of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire]], did not to suffer from the full impact of the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] when education collapsed with the collapse of the empire and most knowledge was lost. The Islamic conquests of places such as Egypt, which was a major part of the Byzantine Empire, and other places which were centers of knowledge in earlier times, gave the Muslims access to knowledge from many cultures which they translated into Arabic and recorded in books for the use of their own educated elites, who flourished in this period, and took with them to the Hispania after it fell under Muslim control. Much of this knowledge was later translated by Christian and Jewish scholars in the Christian kingdoms of the Reconquista from Arabic into Latin, and from there it spread through Europe.

== Inventions and discoveries from the Golden Age of Al Andalus ==
''&lt;small&gt;Note: Although these inventions were created on the Iberian Peninsula, that does not mean they were not made by people of Spanish  heritage due to the area being part of the Islamic Empire.&lt;/small&gt;''

* [[Speed of sound]], was proposed by the Cordoba scholar Ibn Hazm (994–1064 AD). Ibn Hazm argued and calculated the speed of sound by echoes in the Mosque of Cordoba. He is also credited as being the first to propose that thunder was a production of lightning.
* Spherical Earth Theory by Ibn Hazm (994–1064 AD).

The ideas of international law, balance of powers, civil law, order, and just war were all discussed and debated by these Spanish scholars. Francisco Suarez is the most famous Salamancan scholar of this era. Is considered the most important European scholastic after Thomas Aquinas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="930">A '''Natterer compressor''' was a type of [[air compressor|air compression]] machine which was used in early experiments in making [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) in the 1870s. A manually operated screw jack was utilized to compress air or other gases up to ~200&amp;nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (~3000&amp;nbsp;[[pounds per square inch|psi]]).

The device was created by Johann Natterer, a student of [[Adolf Martin Pleischl]], for experiments creating liquid carbonic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5465">[[File:Long tail.svg|thumb|300px|right|Example graph of the power law, x axis represents time, y axis represents reaction time]]

The '''power law of practice''' states that the [[logarithm]] of the [[reaction time]] for a particular task decreases linearly with the logarithm of the number of practice trials taken. It is an example of the [[Experience curve effects|learning curve]] effect on performance. It was first proposed as a psychological law by Snoddy (1928)&lt;ref&gt;[Snoddy, 1926] Snoddy, G. S. (1926). Learning and stability: a psychophysiological analysis of a case of motor learning with clinical applications. Journal of Applied Psychology, 10(1):1 – 36.&lt;/ref&gt;, used by Crossman (1959)&lt;ref&gt;[Crossman, 1959] Crossman, E. R. F. W. (1959). A theory of the acquisition of speed-skill. Ergonomics, 2(2):153–166. &lt;/ref&gt; in his study of a cigar roller in Cuba, and played an important part in the development of Cognitive Engineering by Card, Moran, &amp; Newell (1983)&lt;ref&gt;[Card et al., 1983] Card, S. K., Moran, T. P., and Newell, A. (1983). The psychology of human-computer interaction. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;. Mechanisms that would explain the power law were popularized by Fitts and Posner (1967)&lt;ref&gt;[Fitts and Posner, 1967] Fitts, P. M. and Posner, M. I. (1967). Human performance. Brooks Cole, Belmont, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;, Newell and Rosenbloom (1981)&lt;ref&gt;[Newell and Rosenbloom, 1981] Newell, A. and Rosenbloom, P. S. (1981). Mechanisms of skill acquisition and the law of practice. In Anderson, J. R., editor, Cognitive skills and their acquisition, pages 1–55. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Anderson (1982)&lt;ref&gt;[Anderson, 1982] Anderson, J. R. (1982). Acquisition of cognitive skill. Psychological Review, 89(4):369–406.&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, subsequent research by Heathcote, Brown, and Mewhort suggests that the power function observed in learning curves that are averaged across participants is an artifact of aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, A., Brown, S., &amp; Mewhort, D. J. K. (2000). The power law repealed: The case for an exponential law of practice. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 7(2), 185-207.&lt;/ref&gt; Heathcote et al. suggest that individual-level data is better fit by an exponential function and the authors demonstrate that the multiple exponential curves will average to produce a curve that is misleadingly well fit by a power function. 

The power function is based on the idea that something is slowing down the learning process; at least, this is what the function suggests. Our learning does not occur at a constant rate according to the this function; our learning is hindered. The exponential function shows that learning increases at a constant rate in relationship to what is left to be learned. If you know absolutely nothing about a topic, you can learn 50% of the information quickly, but when you have 50% less to learn, it takes more time to learn that final 50%.

Research by Logan suggests that the instance theory of [[automaticity]] can be used to explain why the power law is deemed an accurate portrayal of reaction time learning curves.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, G. (1992). Shapes of reaction-time distributions and shapes of learning curves: A test of the instance theory of automaticity. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18(5), 883-914.&lt;/ref&gt; A skill is automatic when there is one step from stimulus to retrieval. For many problem solving tasks (see table below), reaction time is related to how long it takes to discover an answer, but as time goes on, certain answers are stored within the individual's memory and they have to simply recall the information, thus reducing reaction time. This is the first theory that addresses the why of the power law of practice.

Power function:

:''RT'' = ''aP''&lt;sup&gt;−''b''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''

Exponential function:

:''RT'' = ''ae''&lt;sup&gt;−''b(P-1)''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''

Where

:''RT'' = trial completion time
:''P'' = trial number, starting from 1 (for exponential functions the P-1 argument is used)
:''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', are constants

Practice effects are also influenced by latency. Anderson, Fincham, and Douglass looked at the relationship between practice and latency and people's ability to retain what they learned. As the time between trials increases, there is greater decay. The latency function relates to the [[forgetting curve]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J., Fincham, J., &amp; Douglass, S. (1999). Practice and retention: A unifying analysis. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 25(5), 1120-1136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latency function:

latency = A + B*T&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;

Where

A = asymptotic latency
B = latency that varies
T = time between introduction and testing
d = decay rate

'''Structural functionalism''', or simply '''functionalism''', is "a framework for building theory that sees society as a [[Complex systems|complex system]] whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John|date=1944–2011|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|others=Gerber, Linda Marie|year=|isbn=9780137001613|edition= 7th|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=|oclc=652430995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach looks at society through a [[Macrosociology|macro-level orientation]], which is a broad focus on the [[social structure]]s that shape society as a whole,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and believes that society has evolved like organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisc-online.com/learn/social-science/sociology/i2s3404/the-structural-functional-theoretical-approac|title=The Structural-Functional Theoretical Approach|last=DeRosso|first=Deb|date=|website=Wisc-Online OER|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach looks at both [[social structure]] and '''social functions'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely [[norms (sociology)|norms]], [[Convention (norm)|customs]], [[traditions]], and [[institutions]].

A common analogy, popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]], presents these parts of society as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urry |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogyDBobOHVEC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century |chapter=Metaphors |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-415-19089-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the most basic terms, it simply emphasizes "the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system". For [[Talcott Parsons]], "structural-functionalism" came to describe a particular stage in the methodological development of [[social science]], rather than a specific school of thought.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social systems and the evolution of action theory|last=1902-1979.|first=Parsons, Talcott,|date=1977|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0029248003|location=New York|oclc=2968515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The sociology of Talcott Parsons|last=François.|first=Bourricaud,|date=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=978-0226067568|edition= Pbk.|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=35778236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[Sociological theory#Classical theoretical traditions|Classical theories]] are defined by a tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]]:
{{Quote
| text = Functionalist thought, from [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasises the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects).

While one may regard functionalism as a logical extension of the organic analogies for societies presented by [[political philosopher]]s such as [[Rousseau]], sociology draws firmer attention to those institutions unique to industrialized capitalist society (or ''[[modernity]]''). Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Functionalism|title=Functionalism|last=Porth|first=Eric|last2=Neutzling|first2=Kimberley|date=|website=anthropology.ua.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-20|last3=Edwards|first3=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radcliffe-Brown proposed that most stateless, "primitive" societies, lacking strong centralized institutions, are based on an association of corporate-descent groups.&lt;ref name="integratedsociopsychology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Keith|title=Structural Functionlism|url=http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/structural-functionalism.html|accessdate=23 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222221743/http://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/structural-functionalism.html|archivedate=22 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural functionalism also took on Malinowski's argument that the basic building block of society is the [[nuclear family]],&lt;ref name="integratedsociopsychology" /&gt; and that the [[clan]] is an outgrowth, not ''vice versa''.

[[Émile Durkheim]] was concerned with the question of how certain societies maintain internal stability and survive over time. He proposed that such societies tend to be segmented, with equivalent parts held together by shared values, common symbols or, as his nephew Marcel Mauss held, systems of exchanges. Durkheim used the term ''[[mechanical solidarity]]'' to refer to these types of "social bonds, based on common sentiments and shared moral values, that are strong among members of pre-industrial societies".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In modern, complex societies, members perform very different tasks, resulting in a strong interdependence. Based on the metaphor above of an organism in which many parts function together to sustain the whole, Durkheim argued that complex societies are held together by ''organic'' [[social solidarity|solidarity]], i.e. "social bonds, based on specialization and interdependence, that are strong among members of industrial societies".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

These views were upheld by Durkheim, who, following [[Auguste Comte]], believed that society constitutes a separate "level" of reality, distinct from both biological and inorganic matter. Explanations of [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] had therefore to be constructed within this level, individuals being merely transient occupants of comparatively stable social roles. The central concern of structural functionalism is a continuation of the Durkheimian task of explaining the apparent stability and internal [[Group cohesiveness|cohesion]] needed by societies to endure over time. Societies are seen as coherent, bounded and fundamentally relational constructs that function like organisms, with their various (or social institutions) working together in an unconscious, quasi-automatic fashion toward achieving an overall [[social equilibrium]]. All social and cultural phenomena are therefore seen as functional in the sense of working together, and are effectively deemed to have "lives" of their own. They are primarily analyzed in terms of this function. The individual is significant not in and of himself, but rather in terms of his status, his position in patterns of social relations, and the behaviours associated with his status. Therefore, the social structure is the network of statuses connected by associated roles.

It is simplistic to equate the perspective directly with political [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defending the Durkheimian tradition : religion, emotion, and morality|last=S.|first=Fish, Jonathan|date=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0754641384|location=Alershot, Hants, England|oclc=60543408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency to emphasize "cohesive systems", however, leads functionalist theories to be contrasted with "[[conflict theory|conflict theories]]" which instead emphasize social problems and inequalities.

==Prominent theorists==

===Auguste Comte===
{{see also|Law of three stages}}
[[Auguste Comte]], the "Father of [[Positivism]]", pointed out the need to keep society unified as many traditions were diminishing. He was the first person to coin the term sociology. Comte suggests that sociology is the product of a three-stage development:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

#'''Theological stage''': From the beginning of human history until the end of the European [[Middle Ages]], people took a religious view that society expressed God's will.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[theological]] state, the human mind, seeking the essential nature of beings, the first and final causes (the origin and purpose) of all effects—in short, absolute knowledge—supposes all phenomena to be produced by the immediate action of supernatural beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Auguste Comte and positivism : the essential writings|last=1798-1857.|first=Comte, Auguste,|date=1998|publisher=Transaction Publishers|others=Lenzer, Gertrude.|isbn=978-0765804129|location=New Brunswick, NJ|oclc=37437499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Metaphysical stage''': People began seeing society as a natural system as opposed to the supernatural. This began with [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the ideas of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and Rousseau. Perceptions of society reflected the failings of a selfish human nature rather than the perfection of God.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=J.|first=Macionis, John|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780205116713|edition= 14th|location=Boston|oclc=727658545}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Positive or scientific stage''': Describing society through the application of the [[Scientific method|scientific approach]], which draws on the work of scientists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Herbert Spencer===
[[File:Herbert Spencer.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Herbert Spencer]]
[[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] famous for applying the theory of [[natural selection]] to society. He was in many ways the first true sociological functionalist.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herbert Spencer : a renewed appreciation|last=H.|first=Turner, Jonathan|date=1985|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0803922440|location=Beverly Hills, California|oclc=11444338}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, while Durkheim is widely considered the most important functionalist among positivist theorists, it is known that much of his analysis was culled from reading Spencer's work, especially his ''Principles of Sociology'' (1874–96).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In describing society, Spencer alludes to the analogy of a human body. Just as the structural parts of the human body — the skeleton, muscles, and various internal organs — function independently to help the entire organism survive, social structures work together to preserve society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While reading Spencer's massive volumes can be tedious (long passages explicating the organic analogy, with reference to [[Cell (biology)|cells]], simple organisms, animals, humans and society), there are some important insights that have quietly influenced many contemporary theorists, including Talcott Parsons, in his early work ''[[The Structure of Social Action]]'' (1937). [[Cultural anthropology]] also consistently uses functionalism.

This [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary model]], unlike most 19th century evolutionary theories, is cyclical, beginning with the [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]] and increasing complication of an organic or "super-organic" (Spencer's term for a [[social system]]) body, followed by a fluctuating state of equilibrium and disequilibrium (or a state of adjustment and [[adaptation]]), and, finally, the stage of disintegration or dissolution. Following [[Thomas Malthus]]' population principles, Spencer concluded that society is constantly facing [[selection pressure]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (internal and external) that force it to adapt its internal structure through differentiation.

Every solution, however, causes a new set of selection pressures that threaten society's viability. It should be noted that Spencer was not a determinist in the sense that he never said that

# Selection pressures will be felt in time to change them;
# They will be felt and reacted to; or
# The solutions will always work.

In fact, he was in many ways a [[political sociologist]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and recognized that the degree of centralized and consolidated authority in a given polity could make or break its ability to adapt. In other words, he saw a general trend towards the centralization of power as leading to stagnation and ultimately, pressures to decentralize.

More specifically, Spencer recognized three functional needs or prerequisites that produce selection pressures: they are regulatory, operative (production) and distributive. He argued that all societies need to solve problems of control and coordination, production of goods, [[Service (economics)|services]] and [[idea]]s, and, finally, to find ways of distributing these resources.

Initially, in tribal societies, these three needs are inseparable, and the [[kinship]] system is the dominant structure that satisfies them. As many scholars have noted, all institutions are subsumed under kinship organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/226355644|title=Human societies: an introduction to macrosociology|last=Nolan|first=Patrick|publisher=Paradigm Publishers|others=Lenski, Gerhard|year=2004|isbn=9781594515781|edition= 11th|location=Boulder|pages=|oclc=226355644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masters|first=Roger D.|date=March 1994|title=The social cage: Human nature and the evolution of society|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=107–111|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(94)90021-3|issn=0162-3095}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, with increasing population (both in terms of sheer numbers and density), problems emerge with regard to feeding individuals, creating new forms of organization—consider the emergent division of labour—coordinating and controlling various differentiated social units, and developing systems of resource distribution.

The solution, as Spencer sees it, is to differentiate structures to fulfill more specialized functions; thus a chief or "big man" emerges, soon followed by a group of lieutenants, and later kings and administrators. The structural parts of society (e.g. families, work) function interdependently to help society function. Therefore, social structures work together to preserve society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Perhaps Spencer's greatest obstacle that is being widely discussed in modern sociology is the fact that much of his [[social philosophy]] is rooted in the social and historical context of [[ancient Egypt]]. He coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]" in discussing the simple fact that small tribes or societies tend to be defeated or conquered by larger ones. Of course, many sociologists still use his ideas (knowingly or otherwise) in their analyses, especially due to the recent re-emergence of evolutionary theory.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Talcott Parsons===
[[Talcott Parsons]] began writing in the 1930s and contributed to sociology, political science, anthropology, and psychology. Structural functionalism and Parsons have received a lot of criticism. Numerous critics have pointed out Parsons' underemphasis of political and monetary struggle, the basics of social change, and the by and large "manipulative" conduct unregulated by qualities and standards. Structural functionalism, and a large portion of Parsons' works, appear to be insufficient in their definitions concerning the connections amongst institutionalized and non-institutionalized conduct, and the procedures by which [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]] happens.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Parsons was heavily influenced by Durkheim and [[Max Weber]], synthesizing much of their work into his [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]], which he based on the system-theoretical concept and the methodological principle of [[voluntary action]]. He held that "the social system is made up of the actions of individuals."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward a General Theory of Action|last=W.|first=Allport, Gordon|date=1951|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Kluckhohn, Clyde., Murray, Henry A., Parsons, Talcott., Sears, Robert R., Sheldon, Richard C., Shils, Edward A.|isbn=9780674863491|location=[Erscheinungsort nicht ermittelbar]|oclc=900849450}}&lt;/ref&gt; His starting point, accordingly, is the interaction between two individuals faced with a variety of choices about how they might act,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; choices that are influenced and constrained by a number of physical and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern social theory: from Parsons to Habermas|last=Craib|first=Ian|date=1992|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=|isbn=978-0312086749|edition= 2nd|location=New York|pages=|oclc=26054873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons determined that each individual has expectations of the other's action and reaction to his own behavior, and that these expectations would (if successful) be "derived" from the accepted norms and values of the society they inhabit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As Parsons himself emphasized, in a general context there would never exist any perfect "fit" between behaviors and norms, so such a relation is never complete or "perfect".

Social norms were always problematic for Parsons, who never claimed (as has often been alleged){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} that social norms were generally accepted and agreed upon, should this prevent some kind of universal law. Whether social norms were accepted or not was for Parsons simply a historical question.

As behaviors are repeated in more interactions, and these expectations are entrenched or institutionalized, a [[role]] is created. Parsons defines a "role" as the normatively-regulated participation "of a person in a concrete process of social interaction with specific, concrete role-partners."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although any individual, theoretically, can fulfill any role, the individual is expected to conform to the norms governing the nature of the role they fulfill.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives in sociology|last=Cuff|first=E. C.|last2=Payne|first2=G. C. F.|date=1979|publisher=G. Allen &amp; Unwin|others=|year=|isbn=978-0043010914|location=London|pages=|oclc=4882507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, one person can and does fulfill many different roles at the same time. In one sense, an individual can be seen to be a "composition"&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; of the roles he inhabits. Certainly, today, when asked to describe themselves, most people would answer with reference to their societal roles.

Parsons later developed the idea of roles into collectivities of roles that complement each other in fulfilling functions for society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some roles are bound up in [[institution]]s and social structures (economic, educational, legal and even gender-based). These are functional in the sense that they assist society in operating&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/n2f99.htm|title=Notes on Structural Functionalism and Parsons|last=Gingrich|first=|date=1999|website=uregina.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfilling its functional needs so that society runs smoothly.

Contrary to prevailing myth, Parsons never spoke about a society where there was no conflict or some kind of "perfect" equilibrium.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A society's cultural value-system was in the typical case never completely integrated, never static and most of the time, like in the case of the American society, in a complex state of transformation relative to its historical point of departure. To reach a "perfect" equilibrium was not any serious theoretical question in Parsons analysis of social systems, indeed, the most dynamic societies had generally cultural systems with important inner tensions like the US and India. These tensions were a source of their strength according to Parsons rather than the opposite. Parsons never thought about system-institutionalization and the level of strains (tensions, conflict) in the system as opposite forces per se.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The key processes for Parsons for system reproduction are [[socialization]] and [[social control]]. Socialization is important because it is the mechanism for transferring the accepted norms and values of society to the individuals within the system. Parsons never spoke about "perfect socialization"—in any society socialization was only partial and "incomplete" from an integral point of view.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Parsons states that "this point [...] is independent of the sense in which [the] individual is concretely autonomous or creative rather than 'passive' or 'conforming', for individuality and creativity, are to a considerable extent, phenomena of the institutionalization of expectations";&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; they are culturally constructed.

Socialization is supported by the positive and negative sanctioning of role behaviours that do or do not meet these expectations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A punishment could be informal, like a snigger or gossip, or more formalized, through institutions such as prisons and mental homes. If these two processes were perfect, society would become static and unchanging, but in reality this is unlikely to occur for long.

Parsons recognizes this, stating that he treats "the structure of the system as problematic and subject to change,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and that his concept of the tendency towards equilibrium "does not imply the empirical dominance of stability over change."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He does, however, believe that these changes occur in a relatively smooth way.

Individuals in interaction with changing situations adapt through a process of "role bargaining".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Once the roles are established, they create norms that guide further action and are thus institutionalized, creating stability across social interactions. Where the adaptation process cannot adjust, due to sharp shocks or immediate radical change, structural dissolution occurs and either new structures (or therefore a new system) are formed, or society dies. This model of social change has been described as a "[[Moving equilibrium theorem|moving equilibrium]]",&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and emphasizes a desire for social order.

===Davis and Moore===
[[Kingsley Davis]] and [[Wilbert E. Moore]] (1945) gave an argument for [[social stratification]] based on the idea of "functional necessity" (also known as [[the Davis-Moore hypothesis]]). They argue that the most difficult jobs in any society have the highest incomes in order to motivate individuals to fill the roles needed by the [[division of labour]]. Thus inequality serves social stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|last2=Moore|first2=Wilbert E.|date=1945|title=Some Principles of Stratification|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=242–249|doi=10.2307/2085643|jstor=2085643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument has been criticized as fallacious from a number of different angles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health and social theory|last=De Maio|first=Fernando|date=1976–2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230517424|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke|pages=|oclc=468854721}}&lt;/ref&gt; the argument is both that the individuals who are the most deserving are the highest rewarded, and that ''a system of unequal rewards'' is necessary, otherwise no individuals would perform as needed for the society to function. The problem is that these rewards are supposed to be based upon objective merit, rather than subjective "motivations." The argument also does not clearly establish why some positions are worth more than others, even when they benefit more people in society, e.g., teachers compared to athletes and movie stars. Critics have suggested that [[structural inequality]] (inherited wealth, family power, etc.) is itself a cause of individual success or failure, not a consequence of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tumin|first=Melvin M.|date=1953|title=Some Principles of Stratification: A Critical Analysis|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=18|issue=4|pages=387–394|doi=10.2307/2087551|jstor=2087551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Merton===
[[Robert K. Merton]] made important refinements to functionalist thought.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He fundamentally agreed with Parsons' theory. However, he acknowledged Parsons' theory problematic, believing that it was over generalized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern social theory: an introduction|last=Holmwood|first=John|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Harrington, Austin, 1970|year=|isbn=978-0199255702|location=Oxford|pages=87–110|oclc=56608295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton tended to emphasize [[middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] rather than a [[grand theory]], meaning that he was able to deal specifically with some of the limitations in Parsons' theory. Merton believed that any social structure probably has many functions, some more obvious than others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He identified 3 main limitations: functional unity, universal functionalism and indispensability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908996993|title=Contemporary sociological theory|last=George.|first=Ritzer,|date=1988|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0075538326|edition= 2nd|location=New York, N.Y. etc.|oclc=908996993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed the concept of deviance and made the distinction between [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|manifest and latent functions]]. Manifest functions referred to the recognized and intended consequences of any social pattern. Latent functions referred to unrecognized and [[unintended consequences]] of any social pattern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Merton criticized functional unity, saying that not all parts of a modern complex society work for the functional unity of society. Consequently, there is a social dysfunction referred to as any social pattern that may disrupt the operation of society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some institutions and structures may have other functions, and some may even be generally dysfunctional, or be functional for some while being dysfunctional for others.&lt;ref&gt;In sociology, another term for describing a ''positive function'', in opposition to a ''dysfunction'', is [[eufunction]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is because not all structures are functional for society as a whole. Some practices are only functional for a dominant individual or a group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are two types of functions that Merton discusses the "manifest functions" in that a social pattern can trigger a recognized and intended consequence. The manifest function of education includes preparing for a career by getting good grades, graduation and finding good job. The second type of function is "latent functions", where a social pattern results in an unrecognized or unintended consequence. The latent functions of education include meeting new people, extra-curricular activities, school trips.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another type of social function is "social dysfunction" which is any undesirable consequences that disrupts the operation of society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The social dysfunction of education includes not getting good grades, a job. Merton states that by recognizing and examining the dysfunctional aspects of society we can explain the development and persistence of alternatives. Thus, as Holmwood states, "Merton explicitly made power and conflict central issues for research within a functionalist paradigm."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Merton also noted that there may be functional alternatives to the institutions and structures currently fulfilling the functions of society. This means that the institutions that currently exist are not indispensable to society. Merton states "just as the same item may have multiple functions, so may the same function be diversely fulfilled by alternative items."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This notion of functional alternatives is important because it reduces the tendency of functionalism to imply approval of the status quo.

Merton's theory of deviance is derived from Durkheim's idea of [[anomie]]. It is central in explaining how internal changes can occur in a system. For Merton, anomie means a discontinuity between cultural goals and the accepted methods available for reaching them.

Merton believes that there are 5 situations facing an actor.
* '''Conformity''' occurs when an individual has the means and desire to achieve the cultural goals socialized into them.
* '''Innovation''' occurs when an individual strives to attain the accepted cultural goals but chooses to do so in novel or unaccepted method.
* '''Ritualism''' occurs when an individual continues to do things as prescribed by society but forfeits the achievement of the goals.
* '''Retreatism''' is the rejection of both the means and the goals of society.
* '''Rebellion''' is a combination of the rejection of societal goals and means and a substitution of other goals and means.
Thus it can be seen that change can occur internally in society through either innovation or rebellion. It is true that society will attempt to control these individuals and negate the changes, but as the innovation or rebellion builds momentum, society will eventually adapt or face dissolution.

===Almond and Powell===
In the 1970s, [[political scientists]] [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Bingham Powell]] introduced a structural-functionalist approach to comparing [[political systems]]. They argued that, in order to understand a political system, it is necessary to understand not only its institutions (or structures) but also their respective functions. They also insisted that these institutions, to be properly understood, must be placed in a meaningful and dynamic historical context.

This idea stood in marked contrast to prevalent approaches in the field of comparative politics—the state-society theory and the [[dependency theory]]. These were the descendants of [[David Easton]]'s system theory in [[international relations]], a mechanistic view that saw all political systems as essentially the same, subject to the same laws of "stimulus and response"—or inputs and outputs—while paying little attention to unique characteristics. The structural-functional approach is based on the view that a political system is made up of several key components, including [[interest group]]s, [[political parties]] and branches of government.

In addition to structures, Almond and Powell showed that a political system consists of various functions, chief among them political socialization, [[recruitment]] and [[communication]]: socialization refers to the way in which societies pass along their values and beliefs to succeeding [[generation]]s, and in political terms describe the process by which a society inculcates civic virtues, or the habits of effective citizenship; recruitment denotes the process by which a political system generates interest, engagement and participation from citizens; and communication refers to the way that a system promulgates its values and information.

==Unilineal descent==
In their attempt to explain the social stability of African "primitive" [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] where they undertook their fieldwork, [[Evans-Pritchard]] (1940) and [[Meyer Fortes]] (1945) argued that the [[Tallensi]] and the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] were primarily organized around [[unilineal descent]] groups. Such groups are characterized by common purposes, such as administering property or defending against attacks; they form a permanent social structure that persists well beyond the lifespan of their members. In the case of the Tallensi and the Nuer, these corporate groups were based on kinship which in turn fitted into the larger structures of unilineal descent; consequently Evans-Pritchard's and Fortes' model is called "descent theory". Moreover, in this African context territorial divisions were aligned with lineages; descent theory therefore synthesized both blood and soil as the same.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The invention of primitive society : transformations of an illusion|last=Kuper|first=Adam|date=1988|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-0415009027|location=London|pages=|oclc=17841268}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Affinal kin|Affinal ties]] with the parent through whom descent is not reckoned, however, are considered to be merely complementary or secondary (Fortes created the concept of "complementary filiation"), with the reckoning of kinship through descent being considered the primary organizing force of social systems. Because of its strong emphasis on unilineal descent, this new kinship theory came to be called "descent theory".

With no delay, descent theory had found its critics. Many African tribal societies seemed to fit this neat model rather well, although [[Africanists]], such as [[Paul Richards (anthropology)|Paul Richards]], also argued that Fortes and Evans-Pritchard had deliberately downplayed internal contradictions and overemphasized the stability of the local lineage systems and their significance for the organization of society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in many Asian settings the problems were even more obvious. In [[Papua New Guinea]], the local [[patrilineal descent]] groups were fragmented and contained large amounts of non-agnates. Status distinctions did not depend on descent, and genealogies were too short to account for social solidarity through identification with a common ancestor. In particular, the phenomenon of [[Cognatic kinship|cognatic]] (or bilateral) kinship posed a serious problem to the proposition that descent groups are the primary element behind the social structures of "primitive" societies.

Leach's (1966) critique came in the form of the classical [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowskian]] argument, pointing out that "in Evans-Pritchard's studies of the Nuer and also in Fortes's studies of the Tallensi unilineal descent turns out to be largely an ideal concept to which the empirical facts are only adapted by means of fictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pul Eliya : a village in Ceylon|last=Leach|first=E. R. (Edmund Ronald)|date=1910–1989–2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521200219|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=751128426}}&lt;/ref&gt; People's self-interest, manoeuvring, manipulation and competition had been ignored. Moreover, descent theory neglected the significance of marriage and affinal ties, which were emphasized by Levi-Strauss' [[structural anthropology]], at the expense of overemphasizing the role of descent. To quote Leach: "The evident importance attached to matrilateral and affinal kinship connections is not so much explained as explained away."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Decline of functionalism==
Structural functionalism reached the peak of its influence in the 1940s and 1950s, and by the 1960s was in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Sports Studies|last=|first=|publisher=SAGE|others=Jay J. Coakley, Eric Dunning|year=2000|isbn=9781446224687|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, its place was taken in Europe by more [[Conflict theories|conflict]]-oriented approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key ideas in sociology|last=Slattery|first=Martin|date=2003|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=|isbn=978-0748765652|location=Cheltenham|pages=|oclc=52531237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by [[structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The constitution of society : outline of the theory of structuration|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=978-0520052925|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=11029282}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the critical approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline has instead shifted to a myriad of empirically-oriented [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theories]] with no overarching theoretical orientation. To most sociologists, functionalism is now "as dead as a [[dodo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The elements of social theory|last=Barnes|first=Barry|publisher=|year=1943|isbn=9781134215904|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=|oclc=862745810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the influence of functionalism in the 1960s began to wane, the [[linguistic turn|linguistic]] and [[cultural turn]]s led to a myriad of new movements in the social sciences: "According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third generation of [[social theory]] includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, [[critical theory]], [[ethnomethodology]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], and theories written in the tradition of [[hermeneutics]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Giddens reader|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|date=1993|publisher=Stanford University Press|others=Cassell, Philip.|year=|isbn=978-0804722025|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=|oclc=28914206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While absent from empirical sociology, functionalist themes remained detectable in sociological theory, most notably in the works of [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] and Giddens. There are, however, signs of an incipient revival, as functionalist claims have recently been bolstered by developments in [[Multilevel selection|multilevel selection theory]] and in empirical research on how groups solve [[social dilemma]]s. Recent developments in [[evolutionary theory]]—especially by biologist [[David Sloan Wilson]] and [[anthropologists]] [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] and [[Peter Richerson]]—have provided strong support for structural functionalism in the form of multilevel selection theory. In this theory, culture and social structure are seen as a [[darwinism|Darwinian]] (biological or cultural) [[adaptation]] at the group level.

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Conflict theories|Critical theory|l1=Conflict theory}}
In the 1960s, functionalism was criticized for being unable to account for social change, or for structural contradictions and conflict (and thus was often called "[[consensus theory]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://subedi.orgfree.com/docs/Structural_Functionalism.pdf|title=STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN SOCIOLOGY|last=Subedi|first=Devi Prasad|publisher=TU Nepal|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it ignores inequalities including race, gender, class, which cause tension and conflict. The refutation of the second criticism of functionalism, that it is static and has no concept of change, has already been articulated above, concluding that while Parsons' theory allows for change, it is an orderly process of change [Parsons, 1961:38], a moving equilibrium. Therefore, referring to Parsons' theory of society as static is inaccurate. It is true that it does place emphasis on equilibrium and the maintenance or quick return to social order, but this is a product of the time in which Parsons was writing (post-World War II, and the start of the cold war). Society was in upheaval and fear abounded. At the time social order was crucial, and this is reflected in Parsons' tendency to promote equilibrium and social order rather than social change.

Furthermore, Durkheim favoured a radical form of [[guild socialism]] along with functionalist explanations. Also, [[Marxism]], while acknowledging social contradictions, still uses functionalist explanations. Parsons' evolutionary theory describes the differentiation and reintegration systems and subsystems and thus at least temporary conflict before reintegration (''[[Ibid.|ibid]]''). "The fact that functional analysis can be seen by some as inherently conservative and by others as inherently radical suggests that it may be ''inherently'' neither one nor the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social theory and social structure|last=Merton|first=Robert King|publisher=|year=1968|isbn=978-0029211304|edition= 1968 enlarged|location=New York|pages=|oclc=253949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger criticisms include the [[epistemology|epistemological]] argument that functionalism is [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]], that is it attempts to account for the development of social institutions solely through recourse to the effects that are attributed to them and thereby explains the two circularly. However, Parsons drew directly on many of Durkheim's concepts in creating his theory. Certainly Durkheim was one of the first theorists to explain a phenomenon with reference to the function it served for society. He said, "the determination of function is…necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Masters of sociological thought : ideas in historical and social context|last=Coser|first=Lewis A.|publisher=|year=1977|isbn=978-1577663072|edition= 2nd|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=|oclc=53480377}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Durkheim made a clear distinction between historical and functional analysis, saying, "When ... the explanation of a social phenomenon is undertaken, we must seek separately the efficient cause which produces it and the function it fulfills."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If Durkheim made this distinction, then it is unlikely that Parsons did not. However Merton does explicitly state that functional analysis does not seek to explain why the action happened in the first instance, but why it continues or is reproduced. By this particular logic, it can be argued that functionalists do not necessarily explain the original cause of a phenomenon with reference to its effect. Yet the logic stated in reverse, that social phenomena are (re)produced because they serve ends, is unoriginal to functionalist thought. Thus functionalism is either undefinable or it can be defined by the teleological arguments which functionalist theorists normatively produced before Merton.

Another criticism describes the [[ontological]] argument that society cannot have "needs" as a human being does, and even if society does have needs they need not be met. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that functionalist explanations may all be rewritten as historical accounts of individual human actions and consequences (see [[Structuration]]).

A further criticism directed at functionalism is that it contains no sense of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], that individuals are seen as puppets, acting as their role requires. Yet Holmwood states that the most sophisticated forms of functionalism are based on "a highly developed concept of action,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and as was explained above, Parsons took as his starting point the individual and their actions. His theory did not however articulate how these actors exercise their agency in opposition to the socialization and inculcation of accepted norms. As has been shown above, Merton addressed this limitation through his concept of deviance, and so it can be seen that functionalism allows for agency. It cannot, however, explain why individuals choose to accept or reject the accepted norms, why and in what circumstances they choose to exercise their agency, and this does remain a considerable limitation of the theory.

Further criticisms have been levelled at functionalism by proponents of other social theories, particularly [[conflict theory|conflict theorists]], [[Marxists]], [[feminists]] and [[postmodernists]]. Conflict theorists criticized functionalism's concept of systems as giving far too much weight to integration and consensus, and neglecting independence and conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lockwood, in line with conflict theory, suggested that Parsons' theory missed the concept of system contradiction. He did not account for those parts of the system that might have tendencies to mal-integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Lockwood, it was these tendencies that come to the surface as opposition and conflict among actors. However Parsons thought that the issues of conflict and cooperation were very much intertwined and sought to account for both in his model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this however he was limited by his analysis of an ‘ideal type' of society which was characterized by consensus. Merton, through his critique of functional unity, introduced into functionalism an explicit analysis of tension and conflict. Yet Merton's functionalist explanations of social phenomena continued to rest on the idea that society is primarily co-operative rather than conflicted, which differentiates Merton from conflict theorists.

Marxism, which was revived soon after the emergence of conflict theory, criticized professional sociology (functionalism and conflict theory alike) for being partisan to advanced welfare capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gouldner thought that Parsons' theory specifically was an expression of the dominant interests of welfare capitalism, that it justified institutions with reference to the function they fulfill for society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It may be that Parsons' work implied or articulated that certain institutions were necessary to fulfill the functional prerequisites of society, but whether or not this is the case, Merton explicitly states that institutions are not indispensable and that there are functional alternatives. That he does not identify any alternatives to the current institutions does reflect a conservative bias, which as has been stated before is a product of the specific time that he was writing in.

As functionalism's prominence was ending, feminism was on the rise, and it attempted a radical criticism of functionalism. It believed that functionalism neglected the suppression of women within the family structure. Holmwood&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows, however, that Parsons did in fact describe the situations where tensions and conflict existed or were about to take place, even if he did not articulate those conflicts. Some feminists agree, suggesting that Parsons' provided accurate descriptions of these situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the other hand, Parsons recognized that he had oversimplified his functional analysis of women in relation to work and the family, and focused on the positive functions of the family for society and not on its dysfunctions for women. Merton, too, although addressing situations where function and dysfunction occurred simultaneously, lacked a "feminist sensibility."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Citation needed span|text=Postmodernism, as a theory, is critical of claims of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]. Therefore, the idea of [[grand theory]] and [[grand narrative]] that can explain society in all its forms is treated with skepticism. This critique focuses on exposing the danger that grand theory can pose when not seen as a limited perspective, as one way of understanding society.|date=October 2018|reason=While this is generally consistent with our articles on postmodernism and related topics, it nonetheless needs to be supported by a citation.}}

[[Jeffrey Alexander]] (1985) sees functionalism as a broad school rather than a specific method or system, such as Parsons, who is capable of taking equilibrium (stability) as a reference-point rather than assumption and treats structural differentiation as a major form of social change. The name 'functionalism' implies a difference of method or interpretation that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|date=1959|title=The Myth of Functional Analysis as a Special Method in Sociology and Anthropology|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=757–772|doi=10.2307/2088563|jstor=2088563}}&lt;/ref&gt; This removes the determinism criticized above. Cohen argues that rather than needs a society has dispositional facts: features of the social environment that support the existence of particular social institutions but do not cause them.

'''''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8''''' is a 1982 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fourth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates the fate of a planet, under the care of the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]], that is plunged into an [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/thethe.html |title=The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in January 1982 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1982 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a review of this book that "the effect of the story is powerful and immediate – with all the drama of good polar-exploration literature, and the eloquence, at its best, of the King James Bible."&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[John Leonard (American critic)|John Leonard]], also of The New York Times, was critical of Lessing's switch to science fiction and in a review of this book, complained that "Mrs. Lessing is no longer very interested in people. She has come to feel that individuality is a 'degenerative disease'... She seems ... to be in the process of junking not only traditional narrative and conventional characters but the details of feeling as well..."&lt;ref name=NYT-JL&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DE163BF934A35751C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Spacing Out of Doris Lessing |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=7 February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' can be read as a stand-alone book, although it does make reference to the planet ''[[Shikasta]]'', introduced in the first book of the ''Canopus'' series.

Planet 8 is a small [[planet|world]] that was colonised by the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]] and populated with a new [[species]] created from the stock of four different species originating on several other Canopean planets. Planet 8 has a warm [[Temperateness|temperate climate]] and, under Canopus's skilled guidance, the inhabitants live comfortably and at peace with themselves and their world.

One day Canopus instructs them to build a huge wall, to exact Canopean specifications, right around the girth of the planet. The construction takes the inhabitants years to complete, and when it is finished, Canopus tells the planet's representatives, leaders of each of the planet's main disciplines, to relocate all settlements north of the wall to the south. Canopus informs everyone that unfortunate interstellar "re-alignments" have taken place and that Planet 8 will soon experience an [[ice age]]. After a while temperatures start to drop and the climate begins to change. [[Glacier]]s form in the north and slowly advance towards the wall. Canopus, however, assures Planet 8 that Canopus has a new home for them, a peaceful and prosperous world called Rohanda (the subject of the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]''), and that when it has reached a certain level of development, Canopus will space-lift the inhabitants of Planet 8 to Rohanda. This fills the people of Planet 8 with hope as they are forced to adapt their lifestyles to cope with this new and unfamiliar climate.

By the time the glaciers reach the wall, much of the vegetation in the south has been destroyed by snow and ice and conditions grow worse. Conflict breaks out amongst the erstwhile peaceful villagers as food becomes scarce. But the wall holds the glaciers back and the people still remain resolute in their faith that Canopus will rescue them. Then Canopean agent Johor (first introduced in ''Shikasta'') arrives on Planet 8 with the devastating news that disaster has struck Rohanda: it has been renamed Shikasta (the stricken) and is no longer available for re-settlement. But Johor does not leave Planet 8. He remains to endure the hardships with the villagers and does what he can to help them face their inevitable demise.

In time, when the population is now faced with starvation, the wall, which was only a temporary barrier, gives way and the glaciers start over-running settlements in the south. The senior representatives, at a loss as to what to do, head north over the wall and onto the glacier. Johor travels with them as they try to reach the [[Geographical pole|pole]], but they soon all succumb to cold and hunger. Their physical bodies perish, but their "[[being]]s" rise and merge into a single [[consciousness]] that becomes the Representative for Planet 8 and all its memories. After watching Planet 8 freeze over completely, the Representative departs for a place "where Canopus tends and guards and instructs."{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc=p. 161}}

==Afterword==
The book contains a 30-page [[afterword]] in which Lessing states that ''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' and the previous book in this series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination in the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]],&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH/&gt; though not, she points out, by the element of ice and polar conditions in itself.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

Lessing expresses a concern that Scott and his explorers, heroes in their day, were vilified by recent generations. She analyses the disastrous expedition and the changes as to how it, and Scott himself, have been viewed by posterity, and discusses these changes in the popular views of the journey in connection with the changing fashions of thought and the decline of imperialist ideas. The efforts of Scott and his men, she concludes, should be understood as a deliberate wager with destiny rather than a scientific project: they tried to transcend themselves by taking on responsibilities they knew they might not be fully equipped for or experienced enough to handle, which ultimately cost many of them their lives. Lessing explicitly likens this view of the pride in sacrifice and self-transcending to the expectations and propaganda imagery of the [[First World War]] soon after.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

==Adaptations==
*''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera)|The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (opera, 1986)

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' was adapted for the opera in 1986 by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[libretto|story-libretto]] by [[Doris Lessing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2431&amp;State_2905=2&amp;composerId_2905=540 |title=Philip Glass |work=Chester Music and Novello &amp; Company |accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-act opera, for orchestra, small chorus and soloists was commissioned by the [[Houston Grand Opera]], the [[English National Opera]] and the Landestheater Kiel in Germany. It first premiered on 8 July 1988 at the Houston Grand Opera in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://philipglass.com/compositions/making_rep_for_planet_8/ |title=Compositions: The Making Of The Representative For Planet 8 |work=Philipglass.com |accessdate=23 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227063031/http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/making_rep_for_planet_8.php |archivedate=27 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/therepresentative.html |title=Opera: The Making Of The Representative For Planet 8 |work=Dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British premiere was on 9 November 1988 by the English National Opera at the [[London Coliseum]].

'''''The Rational Optimist''''' is a 2010 [[popular science]] book by [[Matt Ridley]], author of ''[[The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature]]''. The book primarily focuses on the benefits of the innate human tendency to trade goods and services. Ridley argues that this trait, together with the specialization linked to it, is the source of modern human civilization, and that, as people increasingly specialize in their skill sets, we will have increased trade and more prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting better all the time|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16103826|date=13 May 2010|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theories of cloaking''' discusses various theories based on [[science]] and [[research]],  for producing an electromagnetic [[cloaking device]]. Theories presented employ [[metamaterial cloaking|transformation optics]], event cloaking, dipolar scattering cancellation, tunneling light transmittance, sensors and active sources, and [[acoustic metamaterials|acoustic cloaking]].

A cloaking device is one where the purpose of the transformation is to hide something, so that a defined region of space is [[invisibility|invisibly]] isolated from passing electromagnetic fields (see Metamaterial cloaking&lt;ref name=Eng-space&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kildishev |first1=A. V. |last2=Shalaev |first2=V. M. |year=2007 |title=Engineering space for light via transformation optics |url=http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~shalaev/Publication_list_files/OL%2033%20(1)%20January%202007.pdf |journal=[[Optics Letters]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=43–45 |bibcode=2008OptL...33...43K |doi=10.1364/OL.33.000043 |accessdate=2010-02-14 |arxiv = 0711.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TLTC-1/&gt;) or sound waves. Objects in the defined location are still present, but incident waves are guided around them without being affected by the object itself. Along with this basic "[[cloaking device]]", other related concepts have been proposed in [[peer review]]ed,  [[scientific article]]s, and are discussed here. Naturally, some of the theories discussed here also employ metamaterials, either [[metamaterial|electromagnetic]] or [[acoustic metamaterials|acoustic]], although often in a different manner than the original demonstration and its successor, the ''broad-band cloak''.

==The first electromagnetic cloak==
The first electromagnetic cloaking device was produced in 2006, using gradient-index [[metamaterial]]s.  This has led to the burgeoning field of [[transformation optics]] (and now [[transformation acoustics]]), where the propagation of waves is precisely manipulated by controlling the behaviour of the material through which the light (sound) is travelling.

==Ordinary spatial cloaking==
[[Wave]]s and the host material in which they [[wave propagation|propagate]] have a symbiotic relationship: both act on each other. A simple spatial cloak relies on fine tuning the properties of the propagation medium in order to direct the flow smoothly around an object, like water flowing past a rock in a stream, but without reflection, or without creating turbulence.  Another analogy is that of a flow of cars passing a symmetrical [[traffic island]] – the cars are temporarily diverted, but can later reassemble themselves into a smooth flow that holds no information about whether the traffic island was small or large, or whether flowers or a large advertising [[billboard]] might have been planted on it.

Although both analogies given above have an implied direction (that of the water flow, or of the road orientation), cloaks are often designed so as to be [[isotropic]], i.e. to work equally well for all orientations. However, they do not need to be so general, and might only work in two dimensions, as in the original electromagnetic demonstration, or only from one side, as for the so-called [[Metamaterial cloaking#Broadband ground-plane cloak|carpet cloak]].

Spatial cloaks have other characteristics: whatever they contain can (in principle) be kept invisible forever, since an object inside the cloak may simply remain there. Signals emitted by the objects inside the cloak that are not absorbed can likewise be trapped forever by its internal structure. If a spatial cloak could be turned off and on again at will, the objects inside would then appear and disappear accordingly.

==Space-time cloaking==
The event cloak is a means of manipulating electromagnetic radiation in space and time in such a way that a certain collection of happenings, or events, is concealed from distant observers. Conceptually, a safecracker can enter a scene, steal the cash and exit, whilst a surveillance camera records the safe door locked and undisturbed all the time. The concept utilizes the science of metamaterials in which light can be made to behave in ways that are not found in naturally occurring materials.&lt;ref name=EventCloak/&gt;

The event cloak works by designing a medium in which different parts of the light illuminating a certain region can be either slowed or accelerated. A leading portion of the light is accelerated so that it arrives before the events occur, whilst a trailing part is slowed and arrives too late. After their occurrence, the light is reformed by slowing the leading part and accelerating the trailing part. The distant observer only sees a continuous illumination, whilst the events that occurred during the dark period of the cloak's operation remain undetected. The concept can be related to traffic flowing along a highway: at a certain point some cars are accelerated up, whilst the ones behind are slowed. The result is a temporary gap in the traffic allowing a pedestrian to cross. After this, the process can be reversed so that the traffic resumes its continuous flow without a gap. Regarding the cars as light particles (photons), the act of the pedestrian crossing the road is never suspected by the observer down the highway, who sees an uninterrupted and unperturbed flow of cars.&lt;ref name=EventCloak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/46376 Cloaking space–time]. ''Physics World'' (Jul 7, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

For absolute concealment, the events must be non-radiating. If they do emit light during their occurrence (e.g. by fluorescence), then this light is received by the distant observer as a single flash.&lt;ref name=EventCloak/&gt;

Applications of the Event Cloak include the possibility to achieve `interrupt-without-interrupt' in data channels that converge at a node. A primary calculation can be temporarily suspended to process priority information from another channel. Afterwards the suspended channel can be resumed in such a way as to appear as though it was never interrupted.&lt;ref name=EventCloak/&gt;

The idea of the event cloak was first proposed by a team of researchers at Imperial College London (UK) in 2010, and published in the Journal of Optics.&lt;ref name=EventCloak&gt;

The experiment claims a cloaked time interval of about 10 [[picosecond]]s, but that extension into the [[nanosecond]] and [[microsecond]] regimes should be possible.

==Anomalous localized resonance cloaking==
In 2006, the same year as the first metamaterial cloak, another type of cloak was proposed. This type of cloaking exploits [[resonance]] of [[light]] waves while matching the [[resonance]] of another object. In particular a particle placed near a [[superlens]] would appear to disappear as the light surrounding the particle resonates as the same frequency as the superlens. The resonance would effectively cancel out the light reflecting from the particle, rendering the particle electromagnetically invisible.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nicorovici |first=N. |last2=Milton |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=On the cloaking effects associated with anomalous localized resonance |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=462 |issue=2074 |pages=3027–3059 |url=http://www.lci.kent.edu/muri/nim_papers/cloaking/2006MiltonTheCloak.pdf |bibcode=2006RSPSA.462.3027M |doi=10.1098/rspa.2006.1715 |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040535/http://www.lci.kent.edu/muri/nim_papers/cloaking/2006MiltonTheCloak.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cloaking objects at a distance== 
In 2009, a passive cloaking device was designed to be an 'external invisibility device' that leaves the concealed object out in the open so that it can ‘see’ its surroundings. This is based on the premise that cloaking research has not adequately provided a solution to an inherent problem; because no electromagnetic radiation can enter or leave the cloaked space, this leaves the concealed object of the cloak without ability to detect visually, or otherwise, anything outside the cloaked space.&lt;ref name=ext-clk-2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |title=External invisibility device cloaks objects at a distance |journal=SPIE Newsroom |date=July 2009|doi=10.1117/2.1200907.1720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ext-clk-2009-journal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |last2=Chen |first2=H. Y. |last3=Zhang |first3=Z. Q. |last4=Chan |first4=C. T. |year=2009 |title=Complementary media invisibility cloak that cloaks objects at a distance outside the cloaking shell |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=102 |issue=9 |page=093901 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.102i3901L |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.093901 |pmid=19392518 |arxiv = 0811.0458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a cloaking device is also capable of ‘cloaking’ only parts of an object, such as opening a virtual peep hole on a wall so as to see the other side.&lt;ref name=ext-clk-2009-journal2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |last2=Ng |first2=J. |last3=Chen |first3=H. Y. |last4=Han |first4=D. Z. |last5=Xiao |first5=J. J. |last6=Zhang |first6=Z. Q. |last7=Chan |first7=C.

The traffic analogy used above for the spatial cloak can be adapted (albeit imperfectly) to describe this process. Imagine that a car has broken down in the vicinity of the roundabout, and is disrupting the traffic flow, causing cars to take different routes or creating a [[traffic jam]].  This exterior cloak corresponds to a carefully misshapen roundabout which manages to cancel or counteract the effect of the broken down car – so that as the traffic flow departs, there is again no evidence in it of either the roundabout or of the broken down car.

==Plasmonic cover==
The ''plasmonic cover'', mentioned alongside ''metamaterial covers'' (see [[plasmonic metamaterials]]), theoretically utilizes plasmonic resonance effects to reduce the total scattering cross section of spherical and cylindrical objects. These are lossless metamaterial covers near their plasma resonance which could possibly induce a dramatic drop in the scattering cross section, making these objects nearly “invisible” or “transparent” to an outside observer. Low loss, even no-loss, passive covers might be utilized that do not require high dissipation, but rely on a completely different mechanism.&lt;ref name=Plasmonic-cover/&gt;

Materials with either negative or low value constitutive parameters, are required for this effect. Certain metals near their plasma frequency, or metamaterials with negative parameters could fill this need. For example, several noble metals achieve this requirement because of their electrical permittivity at the infra-red or visible wavelengths with relatively low loss.&lt;ref name=Plasmonic-cover/&gt;

Currently only microscopically small objects could possibly appear transparent.&lt;ref name=Plasmonic-cover&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Alù |first1=A. |last2=Engheta |first2=N. |year=2005 |title=Achieving transparency with plasmonic and metamaterial coatings |journal=[[Physical Review E]] |volume=72 |issue=|page=016623 |arxiv=cond-mat/0502336 |bibcode=2005PhRvE..72a6623A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.72.016623 |url=https://works.bepress.com/nader_engheta/66/download/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These materials are further described as a homogeneous, isotropic, metamaterial covers near plasma frequency dramatically reducing the fields scattered by a given object. Furthermore, These do not require any absorptive process, any anisotropy or inhomogeneity, and nor any interference cancellation.&lt;ref name=Plasmonic-cover/&gt;

The "classical theory" of ''metamaterial covers'' works with light of only one specific frequency.
A new research, of Kort-Kamp ''et al'',&lt;ref&gt;"[https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5022 Tuning plasmonic cloaks with an external magnetic field]", W. J. M. Kort-Kamp, F. S. S. Rosa, F. A. Pinheiro, C. Farina.&lt;/ref&gt; who won the prize  “School on Nonlinear Optics and Nanophotonics” of 2013, shows that is possible to tune the metamaterial to different light frequencies.

==Tunneling light transmission cloak==
As implied in the nomenclature, this is a type of light transmission. Transmission of light ([[EM radiation]]) through an object such as metallic film occurs with an assist of tunnelling between resonating inclusions. This effect can be created by embedding a periodic configuration of dielectrics in a metal, for example. By creating and observing transmission peaks interactions between the dielectrics and interference effects cause mixing and splitting of resonances. With an effective permittivity close to unity, the results can be used to propose a method for turning the resulting materials invisible.&lt;ref name=TLTC-1&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Garcia de Abajo |first=F.

==More research in cloaking technology==
There are other proposals for use of the cloaking technology.

In 2007 cloaking with metamaterials is reviewed and deficienies are presented. At the same time, theoretical solutions are presented that could improve the capability to cloak objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenleaf |first1=A. |last2=Kurylev |first2=Y. |last3=Lassas |first3=M. |last4=Uhlmann |first4=G. |title=Improvement of cylindrical cloaking with the SHS lining |journal=[[Optics Express]] |volume=15 |issue=20 |pages=12717–34 |year=2007 |bibcode=2007OExpr..1512717G |doi=10.1364/OE.15.012717 |pmid=19550540 |arxiv = 0707.1315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yan |first1=M. |last2=Ruan |first2=Z. |last3=Qiu |first3=M. |year=2007 |title=Cylindrical Invisibility Cloak with Simplified Material Parameters is Inherently Visible |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=99 |issue=23 |arxiv=0706.0655 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99w3901Y |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.233901 |pmid=18233363 |page=233901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruan |first1=Z. |last2=Yan |first2=M. |last3=Neff |first3=C.

Other advances may be realized with an [[acoustic metamaterials#acoustic superlens|acoustic superlens]]. In addition, [[acoustic metamaterials]] have realized negative refraction for sound waves. Possible advances could be enhanced ultrasound scans, sharpening sonic medical scans, seismic maps with more detail, and buildings no longer susceptible to earthquakes. Underground imaging may be improved with finer details. The acoustic superlens, acousitc cloaking, and acoustic metamaterials translates into novel applications for focusing, or steering, sonic waves.&lt;ref name=acousticsuperlens&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adler |first=R. |title=Acoustic 'superlens' could mean finer ultrasound scans |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=8 January 2008 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13156-acoustic-superlens-could-mean-finer-ultrasound-scans.html |accessdate=2009-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic cloaking technology could be used to stop a sonar-using observer from detecting the presence of an object that would normally be detectable as it reflects or scatters sound waves. Ideally, the technology would encompass a broad spectrum of vibrations on a variety of scales. The range might be from miniature electronic or mechanical components up to large earthquakes. Although most progress has been made on mathematical and theoretical solutions, a laboratory metamaterial device for evading sonar has been recently demonstrated. It can be applied to sound wavelengths from 40 to 80&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=acousticsuperlens/&gt;&lt;ref name=acousticcloak/&gt;&lt;ref name=USnewscloak&gt;

Waves also apply to bodies of water. A theory has been developed for a cloak that could "hide", or protect,  man-made platforms, ships,  and natural coastlines from destructive ocean waves, including tsunamis.&lt;ref name=acousticcloak&gt;

[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|350px|A trailer for the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'']]

A '''trailer''' (also known as a '''preview''' or '''coming attraction''') is a commercial [[advertisement]] for a [[feature film]] that will be exhibited in the future at a [[movie theater|cinema]], the result of creative and technical work. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://straightdope.com/mailbag/mtrailers.html | title = Why are they called "trailers" if they're shown before the movie? | author = Gfactor | publisher = The Straight Dope | date = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film begins.

Movie trailers have now become popular on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]] discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.

== History ==
[[File:The African Queen - trailer.ogv|thumb|Film trailer for ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' ([[1951 in film|1951]]).]]

The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when [[Nils Granlund]], the advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical ''The Pleasure Seekers'', opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ''Daily Star'', the practice which Loew adopted was described as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew’s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising".&lt;ref&gt;"Movies Score on Legit in New York;" Lincoln, Nebraska ''Daily Star''; November 9, 1913; Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]] at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers were initially shown after, or "trailing", the feature film, and this led to their being called "trailers". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by [[National Screen Service]] and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries.  Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured [[wiktionary:stentorian|stentorian]] voices.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the "new Hollywood" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television.  Among the trend setters were [[Stanley Kubrick]] with his montage trailers for ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]).  Kubrick's main inspiration for the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer was the short film ''[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]) by Canadian film visionary [[Arthur Lipsett]]. [[Pablo Ferro]], who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most [[VHS]] tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to "Stay tuned after the feature for more previews." With [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]s, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Definition ==
Trailers consist of a series selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]]. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trailer music |publisher=SoundtrackNet, LLC |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the movie theater trade group ''[[National Association of Theatre Owners]]'' issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than 2 minutes, which is 30 second shorter than the prior norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/theaters-advocate-shorter-trailers-marketing/ | title = Theaters Advocate Shorter Movie Trailers | publisher = MarketingMovies.net | date = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.

Some trailers use "special shoot" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. [[Dimension Films]] also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s two towers. However, after the [[September 11 attacks]] the studio pulled it from theaters.

[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] in a 1937 color film trailer for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.]]

One of the most famous "special shoot" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', which featured director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal [[Vera Miles]] with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when [[Janet Leigh]] was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio.  Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer [[film editor|editor]]s work from [[Dailies|rushes]] or [[dailies]]. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different [[take]]s of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' the character Rick Blaine says, "OK, you asked for it!" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.

== Truth vs. misleading ==
{{essay|section|date=December 2016}}

Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by [[bait and switch]]ing, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernman.com/10-incredibly-misleading-movie-trailers/ |title=10 Movie Trailers That Are Nothing Like The Actual Movie |publisher=Modernman.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American woman sued the makers of ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' because their film "failed to live up to its promo's promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardie|first=Giles|title=Misleading trailer leads to law suit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/misleading-trailer-leads-to-law-suit-20111011-1lj2z.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Woman sues to stop Drive getting away with a 'misleading' trailer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10/08/11 3:02pm 10/08/11 3:02pm |url=http://gawker.com/5847970/woman-files-lawsuit-over-misleading-trailer-for-drive |title=Woman Files Lawsuit Over 'Misleading' Trailer for Drive |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although her lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2013/101513/55553.pdf ''Deming v.

== Composition ==
Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain [[deleted scene]]s from the film.

The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=6–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trailers have a [[three-act structure]] similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of "signature music" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.

[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (33).jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot from film trailer for 1959 ''[[North by Northwest]]'']]

[[Voice-over]] narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist [[Don LaFontaine]]. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, [[Hal Douglas]], [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliott]], John Leader, [[Corey Burton]], [[George DelHoyo]], [[Peter Cullen]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Ashton Smith]], [[Jim Cummings]], John Garry, [[Tom Kane]], [[Nick Schatzki]], [[Ben Patrick Johnson]], Tony Rodgers, [[Beau Weaver]], and [[Brian Cummings]]. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as "Colossal!", "Stupendous!", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

[[Music]] helps set the [[setting tone|tone]] and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the [[film score]] may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:

* Music from the score of other movies.
* Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is ''[[O Fortuna]]'' from ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' by Carl Orff,&lt;ref name="soundtrack.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundtrack.net/trailers/frequent/ |title=SoundtrackNet : Trailers: Frequently Used Trailer Music |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the works of [[E.S. Posthumus]] and [[Beethoven]].  Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing).
* "Library" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce [[trailer music]], some of the best known are [[audiomachine]], [[Two Steps From Hell]], [[Immediate Music]] and [[X-Ray Dog]] or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, [[Gerrit Kinkel Productions]] or [[RedCola Music|redCola]].
* Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]], who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020113.html?categoryid=4051&amp;cs=1 |title=Daily Variety: Razor-thin copyright line |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.

A ''cast run'' is a list of the [[movie star|stars]] that appear in the movie. If the [[film director|director]] or [[film producer|producer]] is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a [[billing (film)|billing]] block, which is a list of the principal [[actor|cast]] and [[film crew|crew]]. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio [[production logo]]s are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, [[Paramount Pictures]] was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the [[production company]] and [[film distributor|distributor]] of the film.

Many trailers are [[audio mixing (film and television)|mixed]] in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.

Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution.  Since the advent of [[Digital 3D|Digital 3&amp;#8209;D]], it has become common for a 3‑D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‑D.

== Collections ==
National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed, however it required no proof of destruction and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You - Maybe" in Ares 8, Schow, DJ; Simulations Publications, NY 1981, Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cinemas also began to show "trailer trash" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.

== Other types of trailers ==
Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as [[YouTube]] as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.

=== Video game trailers ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/04/03/sega-admits-aliens-colonial-marines-trailer-was-misleading/ |title=Sega Admits 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' Trailer Was Misleading |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hideo Kojima]], a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-12-war-has-changed-but-has-hideo-kojima |title=War has changed.

=== TV spots ===
TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content "appropriate" for the channel.

=== TV show trailers ===
[[TV show]] trailers are trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.

=== Book trailer ===
A '''book trailer''' is a [[video]] advertisement for a [[book]] which employs techniques similar to those of [[trailer (film)|movie trailers]] to promote books and encourage readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=YouTube video sets stage for novel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/04/business/fi-vidbooks4|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trailers can also be referred to as "video-podcasts", with higher quality trailers being called "cinematic book trailers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deval|first=Jacqueline|title=Publicize Your Book (Updated): An Insider's Guide to Getting Your Book the Attention It Deserves|year=2008|publisher=Perigee Trade|isbn=0399534318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FVhmwgodMUC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=%22book+trailer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22book%20trailer%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Justin|title=Seeking readers via 'book trailer' / Publisher tries out movie-style preview to market new title |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Seeking-readers-via-book-trailer-Publisher-2488096.php|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Killian|title=On a screen near you ...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/16/fiction.features7|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kneschke|first=Tristan|title=Don't Judge a Book by its Trailer|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/301723/20120220/book-trailer-video-movie-edit-film-novel.htm|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=International Business Times|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Nina|title=Super Sad Book Trailers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-06/features/ct-prj-0708-book-trailers-20120706_1_book-trailers-publishers-videos|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Farris|John Farris's]] book trailer for his 1986 novel ''Wildwood'' incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as [[John Zacherle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitton|first=Akira|title=TOR Books' WILDWOOD promo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OMCNVb7wMM|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the ''School Library Journal'' Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLJ's Trailie Awards Asks Readers to Vote for Their Favorite Book Trailer|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/886663-312/sljs_trailie_awards_asks_readers.html.csp|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BookReels, an MTV for Books?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/62365-bookreels-an-mtv-for-books.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan-made trailers ===
For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.

== MPAA rating cards for theatrical trailers ==
{{Anchor|Rating cards}}
[[File:Redband.JPG|thumb|An example of a red band trailer card, in this case for 2008 ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.]]

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds.  Each major studio{{clarify|date=February 2013}} is given one exception to this rule per year.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. ''Rating cards'' appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A ''green band'' is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer.  Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for "all audiences" and often included the movie's [[MPAA rating]]. This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which include limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for "appropriate" audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from "for appropriate audiences" to "to accompany this feature", but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Trailers which do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a ''red band'', which indicates approval for only "restricted" or "mature" audiences. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters{{clarify|date=December 2014}} rated PG-13). These trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Cat-and-Mouse for a Trashy Trailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/movies/24kick.html | publisher =New York Times |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-24 | first=Brooks | last=Barnes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, "yellow band" trailers were introduced around 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the Internet. Although official, this practice appears to have never been widespread (although occasional yellow band trailers are created). A notable example is the yellow band trailer for Rob Zombie's ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David M. |last=Halbfinger |date=13 June 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/movies/13yell.html |title=Attention, Web Surfers: The Following Film Trailer May Be Racy or Graphic |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=E1 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The [[Key Art Awards]], presented by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and the [[Golden Trailer Awards]]. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the [[Dolby Theater]] in Hollywood. ''The Film Informant'' also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 TFI Awards|url=http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|work=2011 Film Informant Awards|publisher=The Film Informant|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717025506/http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

[[File:Picture taken at aprox. 100,000 feet above Oregon by Justin Hamel and Chris Thompson.jpg|thumb|Picture taken at approximately 30 km above [[Oregon]] using a 1,500 gram weather balloon]]
[[Image:nssl0020.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rawinsonde]] weather balloon just after launch. Notice a parachute in the center of the string and a small instrument box at the end. After release it measures many parameters. These include temperature, [[relative humidity]], pressure, and wind speed and wind direction. This information is transmitted back to surface observers.]]

A '''weather''' or '''sounding balloon''' is a [[balloon]] (specifically a type of [[high-altitude balloon]]) that carries instruments aloft to send back information on [[atmospheric pressure]], [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and wind speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device called a [[radiosonde]].  To obtain [[wind]] data, they can be tracked by [[radar]], [[Direction finding|radio direction finding]], or navigation systems (such as the satellite-based [[Global Positioning System]], GPS).  Balloons meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time are known as transosondes.  Weather balloons that do not carry an instrument pack are used to determine upper-level winds and the height of cloud layers.  For such balloons, a [[theodolite]] or [[total station]] is used to track the balloon's azimuth and elevation, which are then converted to estimated wind speed and direction and/or cloud height, as applicable.

== History ==
One of the first people to use weather balloons was [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]], the French [[meteorologist]].  Starting in 1896 he launched hundreds of weather balloons from his observatory in [[Trappes]], France.  These experiments led to his discovery of the [[tropopause]] and [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Teisserenc de Bort, Léon Philippe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transosondes, weather balloons with instrumentation meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time to help diagnose radioactive debris from atomic fallout, were experimented with in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staff |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/wb_topicsandpersonnel/1958.pdf|title=Chief Special Projects Section: Dr. Lester Machta|pages=39–41|publisher=[[United States Weather Bureau]]|date=February 1958|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials and equipment ==
The balloon itself produces the [[lifting gas|lift]], and is usually made of a highly flexible [[Latex (rubber)|latex]] material, though [[Chloroprene]] may also be used. The unit that performs the actual measurements and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|radio transmissions]] hangs at the lower end of the string, and is called a [[radiosonde]]. Specialized radiosondes are used for measuring particular parameters, such as determining the [[ozone layer|ozone]] concentration. 

The balloon is usually filled with [[hydrogen]] due to lower cost, though [[helium]] can also be used.  The ascent rate can be controlled by the amount of gas with which the balloon is filled.  Weather balloons may reach altitudes of 40&amp;nbsp;km (25 miles) or more, limited by diminishing pressures causing the balloon to expand to such a degree (typically by a 100:1 factor) that it disintegrates. In this instance the instrument package is usually lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiopassioni.it/pdf/materialirsonde/Radiosondes.pdf Radiosonde]&lt;/ref&gt; Above that altitude [[sounding rocket]]s are used, and for even higher altitudes satellites are used.

== Launch time, location, and uses ==
[[Image:Hydrogen balloon at upper air.jpg|thumb|left|A hydrogen filled balloon at [[Cambridge Bay]] Upper Air station, Nunavut, Canada]]
Weather balloons are launched around the world for observations used to diagnose current conditions as well as by human forecasters and [[numerical weather prediction|computer models]] for [[weather forecasting]]. About 800&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ua.nws.noaa.gov/factsheet.htm NWS factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220121505/http://www.ua.nws.noaa.gov/factsheet.htm |date=2016-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; locations around the globe do routine releases, twice daily, usually at 0000 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] and 1200 UTC. Some facilities will also do occasional supplementary "special" releases when meteorologists determine there is a need for additional data between the 12-hour routine launches in which time much can change in the atmosphere.  Military and civilian government meteorological agencies such as the [[National Weather Service]] in the US typically launch balloons, and by international agreements almost all the data are shared with all nations.

Specialized uses also exist, such as for aviation interests, pollution monitoring, photography or videography and research. Examples include [[Ceiling balloon|pilot balloon]]s (Pibal). Field research programs often use mobile launchers from land vehicles as well as ships and aircraft (usually [[dropsonde]]s in this case). In recent years weather balloons have also been used for scattering human ashes at high-altitude by companies such as Stardust Ashes, founded by [[Chester Mojay-Sinclare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out of this world! Space fan gives late grandmother the ultimate send-off by scattering her ashes in SPACE|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2039538/Out-world-Space-fan-gives-late-grandmother-ultimate-send-scattering-ashes-SPACE.html|publisher=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Weather balloon was also used to create the fictional entity 'Rover' during production of the 1960s TV series 'The Prisoner' in Portmeirion, Gwynedd, North Wales, UK in September 1966. This was retained in further scenes shot at MGM Borehamwood UK during 1966-67.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prisoner Handbook|last=Paul-Davies|first=Steven|publisher=Pan Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-230-53028-7|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">The '''Widom-Larsen theory''' is a proposed explanation for supposed [[Low Energy Nuclear Reactions]] (LENR) developed in 2005 by Allan Widom and Lewis Larsen. In the paper describing the idea, they claim that ultra low momentum [[neutron]]s are produced in the [[cold fusion]] apparatuses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2012/nov/27-big-idea-bring-back-the-cold-fusion-dream |title=Big Idea: Bring Back the "Cold Fusion" Dream.

The idea was expanded by Yogendra Srivastava together with Widom and Larsen in 2014, who went on to propose that it could be an explanation for neutrons observed in exploding wire experiments, [[Corona|solar corona]] and flares, and neutron production in [[thunderstorm]]s.&lt;ref name="Pramana"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srivastava |first=Y |last2=Widom |first2=A |last3=Larsen |first3=L |title=A primer for electroweak induced low-energy nuclear reactions |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/pram/075/04/0617-0637 |journal=Pramana – Journal of Physics |publication-date=October 2014 |access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unrealistic concentrations of free electrons are needed for the neutron yield to be a significant component of thunderstorm neutrons, discounting the explanation.&lt;ref name="PRD"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Babich |first=L P |last2=Bochkov |first2=E I |last3=Kutsyk |first3=I M |last4=Rassoul |first4=H K |title=Analysis of fundamental interactions capable of producing neutrons in thunderstorms |url=https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.093010#fulltext |journal=Physical Review D |publication-date=13 May 2014 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.89.093010 |archive-url=https://dspace-test.lib.fit.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11141/305/PRD20141D.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |archive-date=2014 |access-date=24 March 2017|bibcode=2014PhRvD..89i3010B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JETP"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Babich |first=L P |title=Fundamental processes capable of accounting for the neutron flux enhancements in a thunderstorm atmosphere |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1063776114030017 |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics |doi=10.1134/S1063776114030017 |archive-url=http://crd.yerphi.am/files/Exploration-Discovery/Babich_Neutrons14.pdf |archive-date=2014 |access-date=24 March 2017|bibcode=2014JETP..118..375B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRC"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Babich |first=L P |title=Analysis of a laboratory experiment on neutron generation by discharges in the open atmosphere |url=https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.92.044602 |journal=Physical Review C |publication-date=8 October 2015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.92.044602 |archive-url=http://crd.yerphi.am/files/Publication/References_to_CRD/Babich_anti_n20.pdf |archive-date=2015 |access-date=24 March 2017|bibcode=2015PhRvC..92d4602B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wikispecies''' is a [[wiki]]-based online project supported by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Its aim is to create a comprehensive [[free content]] catalogue of all [[species]]; the project is directed at scientists, rather than at the general public. [[Jimmy Wales]] stated that editors are not required to [[fax]] in their degrees, but that submissions will have to pass muster with a technical audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Calling all taxonomists |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=307 |issue=5712 |pages=1021 |doi=10.1126/science.307.5712.1021a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiSpecies |newspaper=[[American Scientist|American Scientist Online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430034914/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/SiteOfTheWeekTypeDetail/assetid/43122 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/SiteOfTheWeekTypeDetail/assetid/43122 |archivedate=30 April 2005 |date=25 April 2005 |publisher=Sigma Xi |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikispecies is available under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] and [[Creative Commons licenses|CC BY-SA 3.0]].

Started in September 2004, with [[biologist]]s across the world invited to contribute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|first=Mark |last=Peplow |year=2005 |title=Species list reaches half-million mark |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/news050314-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project had grown a framework encompassing the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] with links to [[Wikipedia]] articles on individual species by April 2005.&lt;ref name=AS /&gt;

== History ==
[[:species:User:Benedikt|Benedikt Mandl]] co-ordinated the efforts of several people who are interested in getting involved with the project and contacted potential supporters in early summer 2004. Databases were evaluated and the administrators contacted, some of them have agreed on providing their data for Wikispecies. Mandl defined two major tasks:
# Figure out how the contents of the data base would need to be presented—by asking experts, potential non-professional users and comparing that with existing databases
# Figure out how to do the software, which hardware is required and how to cover the costs—by asking experts, looking for fellow volunteers and potential sponsors

Advantages and disadvantages were widely discussed by the wikimedia-I mailing list. The board of directors of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] voted by 4 to 0 in favor of the establishment of a Wikispecies. The project was launched in August 2004 and is hosted at species.wikimedia.org. It was officially merged to a sister project of Wikimedia Foundation on September 14, 2004.
