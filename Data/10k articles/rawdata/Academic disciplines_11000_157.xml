'''Algorithmic game theory''' is an area in the intersection of [[game theory]] and [[computer science]], whose objective is to understand and design algorithms in [[Strategy (game theory)|strategic]] environments. Typically, in Algorithmic Game Theory problems, the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output. In those situations, the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests. On top of the usual requirements in classical algorithm design, say ''polynomial-time running time'', ''good approximation ratio'', ... the designer must also care about incentive constraints. We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives:

* ''Analysis'': look at the current implemented algorithms and analyze them using Game Theory tools: calculate and prove properties on their [[Nash equilibria]], [[price of anarchy]], best-response dynamics ...
* ''Design'': design games that have both good game-theoretical and algorithmic properties. This area is called [[algorithmic mechanism design]].

==History==
===Nisan-Ronen: a new framework for studying algorithms===

In 1999, the seminal paper of [[Noam Nisan|Nisan]] and Ronen &lt;ref name="nr"&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Nisan | first1 = Noam | author1-link = Noam Nisan
 | last2 = Ronen | first2 = Amir
 | contribution = Algorithmic mechanism design
 | doi = 10.1145/301250.301287
 | pages = 129–140
 | title = Proceedings of the 31st ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC '99)
 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; drew the attention of the Theoretical Computer Science community to designing algorithms for selfish (strategic) users. As they claim in the abstract:

{{Quote|We consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants cannot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents’ interests are best served by behaving correctly.

Following notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism. The payments should be carefully chosen as to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes. We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in particular to the shortest path problem.}}

This paper coined the term [[algorithmic mechanism design]] and was recognized by the 2012 [[Gödel Prize]] committee as one of "three papers laying foundation of growth in Algorithmic Game Theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Price of Anarchy===
{{main article|Price of Anarchy}}
The other two papers cited in the 2012 Gödel Prize for fundamental contributions to Algorithmic Game Theory introduced and developed the concept of "Price of Anarchy". 
In their 1999 paper "Worst-case Equilibria",&lt;ref name = "kp"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Worst-case Equilibria|first=Elias|last=Koutsoupias|first2=Christos|last2=Papadimitriou|journal=Computer Science Review|volume=3|issue=2|date=May 2009|pages=65–69|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/nash.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koutsoupias and [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] proposed a new measure of the degradation of system efficiency due to the selfish behavior of its agents: the ratio of between system efficiency at an optimal configuration, and its efficiency at the worst Nash equilibrium. 
(The term "Price of Anarchy" only appeared a couple of years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===The Internet as a catalyst===
The Internet created a new economy—both as a foundation for exchange and commerce, and in its own right. The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy. On the other hand, the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many. This was new to the classic, ‘top-down’ approach to computation that held till then. Thus, game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it, both human and mechanical.

Game theory studies equilibria (such as the [[Nash equilibrium]]). An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy. Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet, for instance financial interactions and communication load-balancing{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria, and a common approach is then to ‘find the game’—that is, to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game, and to derive the associated equilibria.

Rephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet-based interactions and the construction of mechanisms to meet specified demands. If equilibria can be shown to exist, a further question must be answered: can an equilibrium be found, and in reasonable time? This leads to the [[analysis of algorithms]] for finding equilibria. Of special importance is the complexity class [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD]], which includes many problems in algorithmic game theory.

==Areas of research==
The main areas of research in algorithmic game theory include:

* [[Algorithmic mechanism design]]
* Inefficiency of equilibria ([[price of anarchy]], [[price of stability]])
* [[Computational complexity theory|Complexity]] of finding equilibria
* [[Market equilibrium]]
* [[Multi-agent systems]]
* [[Computational social choice]]

And the area counts with diverse practical applications:

* [[Routing]]
* [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] systems
* [[Sponsored search auction|Sponsored search auctions]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5200">An '''Anglo-Saxon multiple estate''' was a large landholding controlled from a central location with surrounding subsidiary [[Human settlement|settlements]]. These estates were present in the early Anglo-Saxon period, but fragmented into smaller units in the late [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]]. Despite some academic criticism, the concept has been widely used and a large number of possible examples have been proposed.

==Definition==
The concept of an Anglo-Saxon multiple estate was developed by Professor Glanville Jones of [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]]. The idea originally appeared in a paper published in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Settlement Patterns in Anglo-Saxon England|first=Glanville|last=Jones|journal=Antiquity|volume=XXXV|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was fleshed out in a 1976 book on medieval settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Glanville|last=Jones|editor-first=PH|editor-last=Sawyer|title=English Medieval Settlements|chapter=Multiple Estates and Early Settlement|publisher=Edward Arnold|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "great estate" is sometimes used as an alternative to multiple estate.&lt;ref name=Rippon&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Rippon|page=14|title=Beyond the medieval village|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These estates typically contained various features:&lt;ref name=Aston&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting the Landscape|first=Mick|last=Aston|pages=34–35|publisher=Routledge|year=1985|authorlink=Mick Aston|isbn=0-7134-3649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a central ''[[caput]]'' from which the estate was managed
* a [[Minster (church)|minster church]] providing parochial support to the whole estate
* surrounding agricultural settlements specialising in particular crops.

The specialised settlements, dependent on the caput, often took their name from the crop they produced - Cheswick (cheese wick), Berwick (barley farm), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Landscape of Anglo-Saxon England|first=Della|last=Hooke|page=52|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7185-0161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caput has been variously described as a villa regalis, aula, mansio or maerdref.&lt;ref name=Aston/&gt; Specialisation may have been encouraged by "renders" - taxation in kind - paid to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Oosthuizen|title=Landscapes Decoded|page=9|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|year=2006|isbn=1-902806-58-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These estates may have been based around a [[royal vill]] and may have been coterminous with the parochia of an early minster church.&lt;ref name=Rippon/&gt;

==Chronology==
The origin of some of these estates has been traced back to [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] or earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Landscape Detective|first=Richard|last=Muir|year=2001|page=24|publisher=Windgather Press|isbn=0-7509-4333-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; - for example, [[H. P. R. Finberg]] proposed a Roman origin for [[Withington, Gloucestershire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finberg |first=H.P.R. |authorlink=Local history#United Kingdom |title=Roman and Saxon Withington: a study in continuity |year=1955 |location=Leicester |publisher=[[University of Leicester|University College, Leicester]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Glanville Jones himself suggested a pre-Roman origin for some estates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting the Landscape|first=Mick|last=Aston|page=32|publisher=Routledge|year=1985|authorlink=Mick Aston|isbn=0-7134-3649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These multiple estates were a common feature in the English landscape before the 10th century and were usually owned by the king or an important monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Later Anglo-Saxon England|first=Andrew|last=Reynolds|publisher=Tempus|year=1999|page=81|isbn=0-7524-2513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Anglo-Saxon period, many of these large estates fragmented into smaller units which eventually became independent parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Signposts to the Past|first=Margaret|last=Gelling|publisher=Phillimore|page=206|year=1997|edition=third|authorlink=Margaret Gelling|isbn=0-460-04264-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant parishes frequently share the same name differentiated by a suffix or prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essex Landscape|first=John|last=Hunter|publisher=Essex Record Office|page=68|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentation of these estates resulted in the diminishing importance of their minster churches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Blair|chapter=Parish Churches in the Eleventh Century|title=The Story of Domesday Book|editor1-first=RWH|editor1-last=Erskine|editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Ann|publisher=Phillimore|year=2003|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (under the "[[minster hypothesis]]") had been the basis of early Christian church organisation.

==Academic status==
The concept has been criticised - for example because the evidence used is often much later than the date of the proposed estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NEW Reading the Landscape|first=Richard|last=Muir|page=123|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0-7181-1971-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the concept is widely used and a large number of possible examples have been proposed.

{{Anthropology}}
'''[[Anthropology of development|Anthropology]] of media''' (also '''anthropology of mass media''', '''media anthropology''') is an area of study within [[social anthropology|social]] or [[cultural anthropology]] that emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of [[mass media]].

==Methodology==
The use of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods, particularly [[ethnography]], distinguishes media anthropology from other disciplinary approaches to mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Faye Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod &amp; Brian Larkin. (2002) ''Media Worlds: Anthropology of New Terrain''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within [[media studies]], media ethnographies have been of increasing interest since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;David Morley. (1980) ''The “Nationwide” Audience: Structure and Decoding''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ien Ang. (1991) ''Desperately Seeking the Audience''&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stephen Putnam Hughes remarks in a recent review, these studies often do not engage in rigorous ethnographic fieldwork, ignoring or misapplying such landmark anthropological techniques as [[participant observation]] or long-term fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Putnam Hughes. (2011). 'Anthropology and the Problem of Audience Reception', in Marcus Banks &amp; Jay Ruby. ''Made to be Seen: Perspectives on the History of Visual Anthropology''&lt;/ref&gt; Given such differences, anthropologists who take an interest in the media see themselves as forming a distinct subfield from ethnographic approaches to [[media studies]] and [[cultural studies]].

==Theory==
The anthropology of media is a fairly inter-disciplinary area, with a wide range of other influences. The theories used in the anthropology of media range from practice approaches, associated with theorists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], as well as discussions of the appropriation and adaptation of new technologies and practices.  Theoretical approaches have also been adopted from [[visual anthropology]] and from [[film theory]], as well as from studies of ritual and performance studies (e.g. dance and theatre), studies of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], audience reception in media studies, [[new media]] and network theories, theories of [[globalisation]], theories of international [[civil society]], and discussions on participatory communications and [[governance]] in [[development studies]].

==Ethnographic contexts==
The types of ethnographic contexts explored in the anthropology of media range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, [[journalists]] in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media such as newspaper cartoons (Khanduri 2014).  Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movements]], human rights &lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Erica (2013) Indigenous Media in Mexico: Culture, Community and the State (Duke University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as [[radio]], [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and [[television]](Mankekar 1999, Abu-Lughod 2005) have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Spitulnik. (1993) 'Anthropology and Mass Media', ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 22: 293-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lila Abu-Lughod. (1997) 'The Interpretation of Cultures after Television', ''Representations'', 59: 109-133&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apatheism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|ɪ|z|əm}};{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[apathy]]'' and ''[[theism]]'') is the attitude of apathy towards the existence or non-existence of god(s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system.&lt;ref name="nooga.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nooga.com/164154/apatheism-should-we-care-whether-god-exists/|title=Apatheism: Should we care whether God exists?|publisher=nooga.com|author=Sean Phillips|date=November 7, 2013|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20170805185445/http://nooga.com/164154/apatheism-should-we-care-whether-god-exists/|archive-date=August 5, 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-apatheist-247851 |author=Austin Cline |title=What Is an Apatheist? |website=ThoughtCo. |date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods exist or do not exist. The existence of god(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"&gt;

Scientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as [[theism]], [[atheism]], and [[agnosticism]], with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"/&gt; Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism "uncharted territory in the [[philosophy of religion]]."&lt;ref name="nooga.com"/&gt;

==Mindset==
Apatheism considers the question of the existence or nonexistence of deities to be fundamentally irrelevant in every way that matters.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"/&gt; This position should not be understood as a skeptical position in a manner similar to that of, for example, atheists or agnostics who question the existence of deities or whether we can know about anything about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Atlantic |title=Let it Be |date=May 2003 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/05/let-it-be/302726/ |author=Jonathan Rauch |access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of deities is not put aside for moral or epistemic reasons—for democratic or existential reasons, it is deemed unnecessary. This is a universalization of the fundamental democratic principle that there are no first- and second-class humans and that among other species or beings (including hypothetical deities or aliens elsewhere in the universe), human beings also are not second class. In this version, the existence of deities is thus not one of the so-called grand questions in life.&lt;ref name="Von Hegner"/&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}
The term apatheist was coined by Stuart D. Johnson to describe the attitudinal disinterest in theism that "accompanies the shift from sacred to secular orientations in the contemporary world." &lt;ref&gt;Stuart D. Johnson "The Correctional Chaplaincy: Sociological Perspectives in a Time of Rapid Change,” &lt;i&gt;Canadian Journal of Criminology and Corrections&lt;/i&gt;, 14, No. 2: 173. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

=== Irrelevance ===
Apatheists may feel that even if there was a god/deity and the existence and legitimacy of them were proven, it would not make a difference to him/her for one reason or another, therefore, which one(s), if any, are real does not matter and any discussion about it is meaningless. This approach is similar to [[#Practical atheism|that of practical atheism]].

=== Lack of interest ===
An apatheist may not have any interest in the god debate simply for lack of interest in the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/academic-activist-or-apatheist-what-kind-of-unbeliever-are-you/2014/06/09/5b347b18-f00c-11e3-ba99-4469323d5076_story.html?utm_term=.348a9e0d0c68|author=Kimberly Winston|title=Academic, activist or apatheist: What kind of unbeliever are you?|publisher=washingtonpost.com|date=June 9, 2014|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
This apatheistic argument states that morals do not come from god and that if a god exists there would be no changes with regards to morality, therefore a god's existence or non-existence is irrelevant.

==Related views==
===Apathetic agnosticism===
A view related to apatheism, apathetic agnosticism claims that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html |title=Commentary on the Articles of Faith |author=John Tyrrell |year=1996 |quote=To believe in the existence of a god is an act of faith. To believe in the nonexistence of a god is likewise an act of faith. There is no verifiable evidence that there is a [[Supreme Being]] nor is there verifiable evidence there is not a Supreme Being. Faith is not knowledge. We can only state with assurance that we do not know. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807021506/http://www.apatheticagnostic.com/ourchurch/faith.html |archivedate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/basic-facts-about-agnosticism-and-agnostics-248036 |author=Austin Cline |title=Agnosticism for Beginners - Basic Facts About Agnosticism and Agnostics |website=ThoughtCo. |date=March 8, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical atheism===
{{main|Practical atheism}}
The view that one should live their life with disregard towards a god or gods. Practical atheism doesn't see the god question as irrelevant, in contrast to apatheism.&lt;ref name =ZofiaJ&gt;{{cite book

Over the last two centuries many environmental '''chemical observations''' have been made from a variety of ground-based, [[aircraft|airborne]], and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] platforms and deposited in [[databases]].  Many of these [[databases]] are publicly available. All of the instruments mentioned in this article give online public access to their data. These observations are critical in developing our understanding of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and issues such as [[climate change]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[air quality]]. Some of the external links provide repositories of many of these datasets in one place. For example, the Cambridge Atmospheric Chemical Database, is a large [[database]] in a uniform [[ASCII]] format. Each observation is augmented with the meteorological conditions such as the [[temperature]], [[potential temperature]], [[geopotential height]], and equivalent [[Potential vorticity|PV]] latitude.

==Ground-based and balloon observations==
* '''NDSC observations'''. The [http://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/ Network for the Detection for Stratospheric Change] (NDSC) is a set of high-quality remote-sounding research stations for observing and understanding the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere. Ozone and key ozone-related chemical compounds and parameters are targeted for measurement. The NDSC is a major component of the international upper atmosphere research effort and has been endorsed by national and international scientific agencies, including the International Ozone Commission, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The primary instruments and measurements are: Ozone lidar (vertical profiles of ozone from the tropopause to at least 40&amp;nbsp;km altitude; in some cases tropospheric ozone will also be measured). Temperature lidar (vertical profiles of temperature from about 30 to 80&amp;nbsp;km). Aerosol lidar (vertical profiles of aerosol optical depth in the lower stratosphere). Water vapor  lidar (vertical profiles of water vapor in the lower stratosphere). Ozone microwave (vertical profiles of stratospheric ozone from 20 to 70&amp;nbsp;km). H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O microwave (vertical profiles water vapor from about 20 to 80&amp;nbsp;km). ClO microwave (vertical profiles of ClO from about 25 to 45&amp;nbsp;km, depending on latitude). Ultraviolet/Visible spectrograph (column abundance of ozone, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and, at some latitudes, OClO and BrO). Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (column abundances of a broad range of species including ozone, HCl, NO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
* '''MkIV observations'''. The [http://mark4sun.jpl.nasa.gov/ MkIV] Interferometer is a Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectrometer, designed and built at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in 1984, to remotely sense the composition of the Earth's atmosphere by the technique of solar absorption spectrometry. This was born out of concern that man-made pollutants (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, aircraft exhaust) might perturb the ozone layer. Since 1984, the MkIV Interferometer has participated in 3 NASA DC-8 polar aircraft campaigns, and has successfully completed 15 balloon flights. In addition, the MkIV Interferometer made over 900 days of ground-based observations from many different locations, including [[McMurdo Station|McMurdo]], [[Antarctica]] in 1986.
* '''Sonde observations'''. The [http://www.woudc.org/index_e.html World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre] (WOUDC) is one of five World Data Centres which are part of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). The WOUDC is operated by the Experimental Studies Division of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) — formerly Atmospheric Environment Service (AES), Environment Canada and is located in Toronto. The WOUDC began as the World Ozone Data Centre (WODC) in 1960 and produced its first data publication of Ozone Data for the World in 1964. In June 1992, the AES agreed to a request from the WMO to add ultraviolet radiation data to the WODC. The Data Centre has since been renamed to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) with the two component parts: the WODC and the World Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WUDC).

==Airborne observations==
* '''Aircraft observations'''. Many aircraft campaigns have been conducted as part of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070214031222/http://suborbital.nasa.gov/ Suborbital Science Program] and by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060930215700/http://www.espo.nasa.gov/project/mission2.html Earth Science Project Office] an overview of these campaigns is available. The data can be accessed from the Earth Science Project Office [http://espoarchive.nasa.gov/archive/arcs/ archives].
* '''MOZAIC observations'''. The [http://mozaic.aero.obs-mip.fr/web/ MOZAIC] program (Measurement of OZone and water vapour by AIrbus in-service airCraft) was initiated in 1993 by European scientists, aircraft manufacturers and airlines to collect experimental data. Its goal is to help understand the atmosphere and how it is changing under the influence of human activity, with particular interest in the effects of aircraft. MOZAIC consists of automatic and regular measurements of ozone and water vapour by five long range passenger airliners flying all over the world. The aim is to build a large database of measurements to allow studies of chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, and hence to validate global chemistry transport models. MOZAIC data provide, in particular, detailed ozone and water vapour climatologies at 9–12&amp;nbsp;km where subsonic aircraft emit most of their exhaust and which is a very critical domain (e.g. radiatively and S/T exchanges) still imperfectly described in existing models. This will be valuable to improve knowledge about the processes occurring in the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere (UT/LS), and the model treatment of near tropopause chemistry and transport. The MOZAIC data is restricted access, to obtain access the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070108203102/http://mozaic.aero.obs-mip.fr/web/features/database/access.html forms] need to be filled out.
* '''CARIBIC observations'''. The [http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com CARIBIC] (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) project is an innovative scientific project to study and monitor important chemical and physical processes in the Earth's atmosphere. Detailed and extensive measurements are made during long distance flights on board the [[Airbus]] [[A340-600]] "Leverkusen" (http://www.flightradar24.com/data/airplanes/D-AIHE/). We deploy an airfreight container with automated scientific apparatuses, which are connected to an air and particle (aerosol) inlet underneath the aircraft. In contrast to MOZAIC, CARIBIC is only installed on one aircraft, but it measures a much wider spectrum of atmospheric constituents ([http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com/ CARIBIC -&gt; instrumentation]). Both, CARIBIC and MOZAIC are integrated in [http://www.iagos.org IAGOS]. Data exist from 1998-2002 and from 2004-today. It can be requested via [http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com/ CARIBIC -&gt; data access].

==Space shuttle observations==
* '''ATMOS observations'''. The [http://remus.jpl.nasa.gov/atmos/atmos.html Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy] experiment (ATMOS) is an infrared spectrometer (a Fourier transform interferometer) that is designed to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere. In this section you will be able to read both general and detailed information as to why and how the instrument works. The ATMOS instrument has flown four times on the Space Shuttle since 1985. The predecessor to ATMOS, flown on aircraft and high-altitude balloon platforms, was born in the early 1970s out of concern for the effects of Super Sonic Transport exhaust products on the ozone layer. The experiment was redesigned for the Space Shuttle when the potential for ozone destruction by man-made chlorofluorocarbons was discovered and the need for global measurements became crucial.
* '''CRISTA observations'''. [https://archive.is/20011201094454/http://www.crista.uni-wuppertal.de/introduction.shtml CRISTA] is short for CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere. It is a limb-scanning satellite experiment, designed and developed by the University of Wuppertal to measure infrared emissions of the Earth's atmosphere. Equipped with three telescopes and four spectrometers and cooled with liquid helium, CRISTA acquires global maps of temperature and atmospheric trace gases with very high horizontal and vertical resolution. The design enables the observation of small scale dynamical structures in the 15–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude region.

==Satellite observations==
* '''ACE observations'''. The [http://www.ace.uwaterloo.ca/ Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment] (ACE) satellite, also known as [[SCISAT-1]], is a Canadian satellite that makes measurements of the Earth's atmosphere and follows in heritage of ATMOS.
* '''[[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] observations'''. [http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ Aura] flies in formation with the [[NASA]] [[Earth Observing System|EOS]] "A Train," a collection of several other satellites (Aqua, CALIPSO, CloudSat and the French PARASOL). Aura carries four instruments for studies of atmospheric chemistry: [[Microwave Limb Sounder|MLS]], HIRDLS, TES and OMI.
* '''ILAS observations'''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205195349/http://www-ilas.nies.go.jp/index.html ILAS] (Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer) developed by MOE (the Ministry of the Environment) (formerly EA - Environment Agency of Japan) is boarded on ADEOS (Advanced Earth Observing Satellite). On August 17, 1996, ADEOS was launched by the H-II rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center of Japan (ADEOS was renamed as "MIDORI") and stopped its operation on June 30, 1997. Data obtained by ILAS are processed, archived, and distributed by NIES (National Institute for Environmental Studies).
* '''POAM observations'''. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301180400/http://wvms.nrl.navy.mil/POAM/poam.html Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement] II (POAM II) instrument was developed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, aerosol extinction, and temperature. POAM II measures solar extinction in nine narrow band channels, covering the spectral range from approximately 350 to 1060&amp;nbsp;nm.
* '''Sulfate aerosol observations from SAGE and HALOE'''. The SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II) sensor was launched into a 57 degree inclination orbit aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) in October 1984. During each sunrise and sunset encountered by the orbiting spacecraft, the instrument uses the solar occultation technique to measure attenuated solar radiation through the Earth's limb in seven channels centered at wavelengths ranging from 0.385 to 1.02 micrometers. The retrieval of stratospheric aerosol size distributions based on HALOE multi-wavelength particle extinction measurements was described by Hervig et al. [1998].  That approach yields unimodal lognormal size distributions,  which describe the aerosol concentration versus radius using three parameters:  total aerosol concentration,  median radius,  and distribution width. This [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208105210/http://haloedata.larc.nasa.gov/home/index.php?p=noframe_home.html site] offers results based on the Hervig et al. [1998] technique,  with one exception.  The retrieval results reported here are based on sulfate refractive indices for 215 K,  where Hervig et al.  [1998] used room temperature indices adjusted to stratospheric temperatures using the Lorentz-Lorenz rule.  Size distributions were only retrieved at altitudes above tropospheric cloud tops. Clouds were identified using techniques described by Hervig and McHugh [1999].  The HALOE size distributions are offered in NetCDF files containing data for a single year.  The results are reported on a uniform altitude grid ranging from 6 to 33&amp;nbsp;km at 0.3&amp;nbsp;km spacing.  The native HALOE altitude spacing is 0.3&amp;nbsp;km,  so this interpolation has little or no effect on the data.  The files report profile data including: altitude, pressure, temperature, aerosol concentration, median radius, distribution width, aerosol composition. Aerosol surface area and volume densities can be easily calculated from the size distribution parameters using the relationships given [http://gwest.gats-inc.com/haloe_aerosols/HALOE_size_distribution_data.html here].
* '''[[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite]]''' (UARS) observations. Data from the UARS is available from the [http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/ GES Distributed Active Archive Center] (DAAC). The UARS satellite was launched in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery. It is {{convert|35|ft|m}} long, {{convert|15|ft|m}} in diameter, weighs 13,000 pounds, and carries 10 instruments. UARS orbits at an altitude of {{convert|375|mi|km}} with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. UARS measured ozone and chemical compounds found in the ozone layer which affect ozone chemistry and processes. UARS also measured winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun. Together, these helped define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability.

The '''biocapacity''' or '''biological capacity''' of an [[ecosystem]] is an estimate of its production of certain biological materials such as [[natural resources]], and its absorption and filtering of other materials such as [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/|website=[[Global Footprint Network]]: Advancing the Science of Sustainability|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yue|first1=Dongxia|last2=Guo|first2=Jianjun|last3=Hui|first3=Cang|title=Scale dependency of biocapacity and the fallacy of unsustainable development|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2013|volume=126|pages=13–19|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.022}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; “Useful biological 

Biocapacity is expressed in terms of [[global hectares]] per person, thus is dependent on human population. A global hectare is an adjusted unit that represents the average biological productivity of all productive [[hectares]] on Earth in a given year (because not all hectares produce the same amount of [[ecosystem services]]). Biocapcity is calculated from United Nations population and land use data, and may be reported at various regional levels, such as a city, a country, or the world as a whole. 

For example, there were 12 billion hectares of biologically productive land and water on this planet in 2008. Dividing by the number of people alive in that year, 6.7 billion, gives a biocapacity of 1.8 global hectares per person . This assumes that no land is set aside for other species that consume the same biological material as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/ecological_wealth_of_nations_en Ecological Wealth of Nations: Earth's Biocapacity as a new framework for International Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocapacity is used together with [[Ecological Footprint]] as a method of measuring [[Human impact on the environment]]. Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint are tools created by the [[Global Footprint Network]], used in sustainability studies around the world.

==Applications of biocapacity==
An increase in global population can result in a decrease in biocapacity.  This is usually due to the fact that the Earth’s resources have to be shared; therefore, there becomes little to supply the increasing demand of the increasing [[population]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web|title=What does ecological overshoot mean?|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/overshoot/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this issue can be resolved by [[outsourcing]]. However, resources will run out due to the increasing demands and as a result a collapse of an ecosystem can be the consequence of such actions.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; When the [[ecological footprint]] becomes greater than the biocapacity of the population, a [[ecological deficit|biocapacity deficit]] is suspected.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap&gt;{{cite web|title=Natures regenerative capacity|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/biocapacity/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'Global biocapacity' is a term sometimes used to describe the total capacity of an ecosystem to support various continuous activity and changes.  When the [[ecological footprint]] of a population exceeds the biocapacity of the environment it lives in, this can be called an 'ecological overshoot'.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap /&gt;&lt;ref name=RefiningEF&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venetoulis|first1=Jason|last2=Talberth|first2=John|title=Refining the ecological footprint|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=5 January 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=441–469|doi=10.1007/s10668-006-9074-z}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report stated that people were using an equivalence of 1.5 Earths to compensate for their needs.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt;  However other sources have suggested that depletion of cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land is not occurring on an aggregate, global level. Hence, virtually all of the ecological overshoot comes from the measure of the rate at which carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does the Shoe Fit? Real versus Imagined Ecological Footprints|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001700|publisher=PLOS biology journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional stresses of [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[climate change]], and [[ocean acidification]] can also aggravate the problem.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; In reference to the definition of biocapacity: 1.5 Earths means [[renewable resource]]s will eventually result in depletion because they are being produced faster and more often than the resources can be re-grown.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; Therefore, it will one year and six months for the resources we use to be able to regenerate again and in addition absorb all the waste we manufactured as well.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; So instead of taking one year, we are now in-taking enough [[resource]]s that should last us one year and six months.

In addition, if this matter becomes severe, an [[nature reserve|ecological reserve]] will be set on areas to preserve their ecosystems. Awareness about our depleting resources include: agricultural land, forest resources and rangeland.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayden|first1=Anders|title=ecological footprint (EF)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1699724/ecological-footprint-EF|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biocapacity used in correlation to ecological footprint can therefore suggest whether a specific population, region, country or part of a world is living in the means of their capital. Accordingly,§98 the study of biocapacity and ecological footprint is known as the [[ecological footprint|Ecological Footprint Analysis (EFA)]].&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt;

Biocapacity is also affected on the technology used during the year. With new technologies emerging, it is not whether the technology in that year is good or bad but whether how the technology impacts resource supply and demand; which in return affects biocapacity.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; Hence what is considered “useful” can change from year to year (e.g. use of corn (maize) stover for cellulosic ethanol production would result in corn stover becoming a useful material, and thus increase the biocapacity of maize cropland).

Moreover, environmentalists have created [[ecological footprint|ecological footprint calculators]] for a single person(s) to determine whether they are encompassing more than what is available for them in their population.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopton|first1=Matthew E.|last2=White|first2=Denis|title=A simplified ecological footprint at a regional scale|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2012|volume=111|pages=279–286|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.07.005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, biocapacity results will be applied to their ecological footprint to determine how much they may contribute or take away from sustainable development.

In general, biocapacity is the amount of resources available to people at a specific moment in time to a specific population ([[resource|supply]]) and to differentiate between ecological footprint – that is the demand constructed on behalf of a '''regional ecosystem'''.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale /&gt; Biocapacity is able to determine the human impacts on Earth. By determining productivity of land, hence the resources available for human consumption, biocapacity will be able to predict and perhaps examine the effects on the ecosystems closely based on collected results of human consumption.
.The biocapacity of an area is calculated by multiplying the actual physical area by the yield factor and the appropriate equivalence factor. Biocapacity is usually expressed in [[global hectare|global hectares (gha)]].&lt;ref name=Serres&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioresources, Biocapacity of Ecosystems, and related terms|url=http://institutmichelserres.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?article37|website=Michel Serres Institute: for resources and public goods|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since global hectares is able to convert [[Consumer (food chain)|human consumptions]] like food and water into a measurement, biocapacity can be applied to determine the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth.

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}
{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Biosocial criminology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that aims to explain crime and [[antisocial behavior]] by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary [[criminology]] has been dominated by [[sociological]] theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="Asghate2011"&gt;Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
===Environment===
Environment has a significant effect on genetic expression. Disadvantaged environments enhance antisocial gene expression, suppress prosocial gene action and prevent the realization of genetic potential.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;

{{quotation|Genes and environments operating in tandem (interacting) were required to produce significant antisocial behavior, while neither was powerful enough to produce it independent of the other. That is, children genetically at risk for antisocial behavior reared in positive family environments did not display antisocial behavior, and children not at genetic risk did not become antisocial in adverse family environments.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;}}

===Genetics===
One approach to studying the role of genetics for crime is to calculate the [[heritability]] coefficient, which describes the proportion of the [[variance]] that is due to actualized genetic effects for some trait in a given population in a specific environment at a specific time. The heritability coefficient for antisocial behavior is estimated to be between 0.40 and 0.58.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;

The methodology often used in biosocial criminology (that of [[twin studies]]) has been criticized for producing inflated heritability estimates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Burt |first=Callie H. |last2=Simons |first2=Ronald L.|authorlink2=Ronald L. Simons |date=2014-05-01 |title=Pulling Back the Curtain on Heritability Studies: Biosocial Criminology in the Postgenomic Era |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12036/abstract |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=223–262 |doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12036 |issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; though biosocial criminologists maintain that these criticisms are baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barnes |first=J. C. |last2=Wright |first2=John Paul|authorlink2=John Paul Wright |last3=Boutwell |first3=Brian B. |authorlink3=Brian Boutwell|last4=Schwartz |first4=Joseph A. |last5=Connolly |first5=Eric J. |last6=Nedelec |first6=Joseph L. |last7=Beaver |first7=Kevin M. |authorlink7=Kevin Beaver|date=2014-11-01 |title=Demonstrating the Validity of Twin Research in Criminology |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12049/abstract |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=588–626 |doi=10.1111/1745-9125.12049 |issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal justice researchers Brian Boutwell and J.C. Barnes argue that many sociological studies that do not control for genetic inheritance of risk factors have misleading or unreliable results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2016/03/06/crime-genetic-scientists-don-know-because-they-afraid-ask/3lhGUVuNsfdJXjvhtaxPHN/story.html Is crime genetic? Scientists don’t know because they’re afraid to ask]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
Another approach is to examine the relationship between neurophysiology and criminality. One example is that measured levels of neurotransmitters such as [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]] have been associated with criminal behavior. Another is that [[neuroimaging]] studies give strong evidence that both brain structure and function are involved in criminal behaviors. The [[limbic system]] creates emotions such as anger and jealousy that ultimately may cause criminal behavior. The [[prefrontal cortex]] is involved in delaying gratification and impulse control and moderates the impulses from the limbic system. If this balance is shifted in favor of the limbic system this may contribute to criminal behavior. [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] argues that "life-course-persistent offenders" make up only 6% of the population but commits more than 50% of all crimes and that this is due to a combination neurophysiological deficits and an adverse environment that creates a criminal path that is very difficult to break once started.&lt;ref name=Asghate2011/&gt;

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
Men can potentially have many children with little effort; women only a few with great effort. One argued consequence of this is that males are more [[aggressive]], and more violently aggressive, than females, since they face higher reproductive competition from their own sex than females. In particular, low-status males may be more likely to remain completely childless. Under such circumstances, it may have been evolutionarily useful to take very high risks and use violent aggression in order to try to increase status and reproductive success rather than become genetically extinct. This may explain why males have higher crime rates than females and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. It may also explain why the degree of income inequality of a society is a better predictor than the absolute income level of the society for male-male homicides; income inequality creates social disparity, while differing average income levels may not do so. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Aurelio José Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman. The evolutionary psychology of criminal behaviour. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory" focuses on the hormone [[testosterone]] as a factor influencing aggression and criminality and being beneficial during certain forms of competition.&lt;ref name="psychology-criminalbehavior-law.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=
Should We Be More Concerned With Prenatal Exposure In The Prevention Of Crime?|url=http://www.psychology-criminalbehavior-law.com/2015/04/should-we-be-more-concerned-with-prenatal-exposure-in-the-prevention-of-crime//|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males.&lt;ref name="crimetimes.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=MILD TESTOSTERONE REDUCTION EFFECTIVE AGAINST AGGRESSION?|url=http://www.crimetimes.org/95d/w95dp6.htm|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens in correlation with the rise of testosterone levels. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by [[lumbar puncture]], which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used less reliable measurements from blood or saliva. Some studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone, although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. A significant link between juvenile delinquency and testosterone levels has not been established. Some studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial behavior]] and [[alcoholism]]. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies have found a relationship and about half no relationship.&lt;ref name="EllisBeaver2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lee Ellis| author2=Kevin M. Beaver|author3=John Wright| title=Handbook of Crime Correlates| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eD0ttBXoMvQC| date=1 April 2009| publisher=Academic Press| isbn=978-0-12-373612-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conflicts causing homicides involve status conflicts, protecting reputation, and seemingly trivial insults.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt; [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against aggression. Therefore, it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting reputation ("[[honor]]"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.

Some cultures place greater emphasis on protecting honor than other cultures. One explanation is that protecting honor was in the ancestral past relatively more important for herders than for farmers. The livestock of herders were easily and quickly stolen. As a result, it was important to constantly show toughness as a deterrence, which may cause a higher level of violence. The predictions of the theory was confirmed in a cross-cultural examination of traditional farming and herding Spanish-American societies. However, the prediction that sedentary fishing societies would place a low emphasis on honor was not confirmed.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

The degree of cultural [[collectivism]] is strongly associated with the burden of [[infectious disease]]. It has been argued that this is due to collectivism and associated characteristics such as [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]] avoidance limiting the spread of infectious diseases. Other characteristics such as strong [[in-group–out-group bias]] and willingness to defend the [[ingroup]]'s honor may promote violence. A study found strong associations between several forms of violent criminal behavior and both infectious disease rates across U.S states and degree of cultural collectivism across U.S. states. The associations remained strong after controlling for income inequality.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

==== Specific forms ====
Evolutionary psychology researchers have proposed several evolutionary explanations for [[psychopathy]]. One is that psychopathy represents a frequency-dependent, socially [[parasitic]] strategy. This may benefit the psychopath as long as there are few other psychopaths in the community since more psychopaths means increasing the risk of encountering another psychopath as well as non-psychopaths likely adapting more countermeasures against cheaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Glenn | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Kurzban | first2 = R. | last3 = Raine | first3 = A. | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2011.03.009 | title = Evolutionary theory and psychopathy | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 371 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.

[[Sociobiological theories of rape]] are theories that explore to what degree, if any, evolutionary adaptations influence the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures.

The [[Cinderella effect]] is the alleged higher rate of [[Stepfamily|stepchildren]] being abused by  [[Stepfamily|stepparents]] as compared to genetic parents, observed in some, but not all, studies. An explanation of this affect has been attempted by application of [[evolutionary psychology]] theories. There have also been various criticisms of these theories.&lt;ref name=DalyWilson2007&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (2007) [http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf Is the "Cinderella Effect" controversial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516102016/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf |date=16 May 2011 }} In Crawford &amp; Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Infanticide]] is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross-cultural research has found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success, in which case it would decrease the mother's [[inclusive fitness]] to spend resources on the child, in particular since women generally have a greater [[parental investment]] than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liddle | first1 = J.

==== Criminal justice ====
Punishment of exploitative behaviors harmful to the group was likely a recurring problem in the ancestral environment. As such humans are argued to have developed a range of psychological mechanisms for handling this. Punishment can be a deterrent to undesired behaviors but excessive punishment can also be harmful to the group. Thus, human are argued to favor a proportional response based on how severe the offence is. Cross-cultural research have a found a high agreement regarding how relatively harmful different crimes are perceived to be. On the other hand, evolutionary novel factors that may be rational to consider from a deterrent perspective, such as how difficult it is for the modern police to detect the crime, do not seem to affect people's perceptions of appropriate punishments.&lt;ref name=AEP2&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. The evolutionary psychology of Mass Politics. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a crime's severity has been judged, there is a choice regarding how to respond. In some cases in the ancestral environment there may have been benefits from future interactions with the offender which some forms of punishment may have prevented as compared to responses such as reparations or rehabilitation. Research suggests that individuals may modify what they think are appropriate forms of response to offenders based on factors that once in the past small-group environment may have indicated that they could personally benefit from continued interactions with the offender such as kinship, in-group or out-group membership, possession of resources, sexual attractiveness, expressed remorse, intentionality, and prior history of cooperation and exploitation.&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

A '''brocard''' is a [[legal maxim]] in [[Latin]] that is, in a strict sense, derived from traditional legal authorities, even from [[ancient Rome]]. The word is a variant of the [[Latinized name]] of [[Burchard of Worms]] (died AD 1025), Bishop of [[Worms, Germany]], who compiled 20 volumes of ''Ecclesiastical Rules''.

==History==
Begun in AD 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile. He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. The collection, which he called the ''Collectarium Canonum'' or ''Decretum'', became the primary source for [[canon law]].

Along with numerous documents from a variety of sources, including the [[Old Testament]] and [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], Burchard included the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'' in this collection, under the belief that it dated from an episcopal "Council of Anquira" in AD 314, but no other evidence of this council exists. Because of this inclusion, Burchard has been described as something of a rationalist. As the source of [[canon law]], Burchard's ''Decretum'' was supplanted around 1150 by the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', a much larger collection that further attempted to reconcile contradictory elements of [[canon law]].

Burchard spent the years 1023 to 1025 promulgating ''Leges et Statuta Familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis'', a collection of religious laws he endorsed as just and hoped to have officially approbated.

Although the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] first came to [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Julius Caesar#Conquest of Gaul|55 BC]], [[Roman Law]] has had negligible influence&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfsr.com/pdf/influences-of-roman-law-and-civil-law-on-the-common-law&lt;/ref&gt; on [[English common law]]. Latin legal phrases are used in English only because Latin was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Medieval era]]. Although some of these phrases are in common use in law, such as ''[[res ipsa loquitur]]'', ''[[novus actus interveniens]]'', ''[[talem qualem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195557558.001.0001/acref-9780195557558-e-3249?rskey=0DnFO4&amp;result=3248&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[de minimis non curat lex]]'', and  ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', the common law is not premised on the principles of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and their use is being replaced by that of vernacular substitutes. For example, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' previously included numerous brocards among its entries.

==Examples==
;''Contra non valentem agere nulla'' [or ''non''] ''currit praescriptio'' : A [[statute of limitation]] does not run against those who cannot act; this is the basis of the American discovery rule limiting prescriptive limitation periods.
;''[[Dura lex, sed lex]]'' : "The [[law]] [is] harsh, but [it is] the law". It follows from the principle of the [[rule of law]] that even [[Draco (lawgiver)|draconian]] laws must be followed and enforced; if one disagrees with the result, one must seek to change the law.
;''[[Ignorantia juris non excusat|Ignorantia legis non excusat]]'' : "Ignorance of the law is no excuse."  Not knowing that one's actions are forbidden by the law is not a defense.
;''In claris non fit interpretatio'' : When a rule is clearly intelligible, there is no need of proposing a (usually extensive) interpretation.
;''Inadimplenti non est adimplendum'' : "One has no need to respect his obligation if the counter-party has not respected his own." This is used in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] to briefly indicate a principle (adopted in some systems) referred to as the [[synallagmatic contract]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jusbelli.com/Bouvier/bouvier1856_sw.html&lt;/ref&gt;
; ''[[Lex specialis derogat legi generali]]'' : "A law governing a specific subject matter overrides a law which only governs general matters." 
; ''[[Iura novit curia]]'' : The judge knows the law (technically, there is no need to "explain the law" or the legal system to a judge/justice in any given petition).
; ''[[Nemo dat quod non habet]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100228794&lt;/ref&gt; The basic rule that a person who does not own property (e.g. a thief) cannot confer it on another except with the true owner's authority (i.e. as his agent). Exceptions to this rule include sales under statutory powers, and cases where the doctrine of [[estoppel]] prevents a legal owner from denying a seller's right to sell.
; ''[[Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]'' : There can be neither [[crime]] nor [[punishment]] unless there is a [[penal law]] first.
;''[[Pacta sunt servanda]]'' : Contracts are the law ''or'' Contracts establish obligations (between those who sign them).
; ''Quod non est in registro, non est in Mundo'' : What is not reported in the (related, referring) registry, has no legal relevance. Used when a formal act (usually a recording or a transcription) is required in order to give consistence, content or efficacy to a [[right]].
; ''Res inter alios acta vel iudicata, aliis nec nocet nec prodocet'' : What has been agreed/decided between people (a specific group) can neither benefit nor harm a third party (meaning: two or more people cannot agree amongst each other to establish an obligation for a third party who was not involved in the negotiation; furthermore, any benefit that may be established will have to be accepted by the third party before it can be implemented).
; ''Sententia quae in rem iudicatam transit, pro veritate habetur'' : When a definitive [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] is declared, it is considered to be the truth. In the case of a sentence ''in rem iudicatam'' (that finally consents to consider a judgement completed), its content will then be the only legally relevant consideration of a fact.
; ''Solve et repete'' : Respect your obligation first, then you can ask for reimbursement. Used in those situations in which one of the two (or more) parties needs to complete his obligation before being allowed to ask for the opposite obligation to be respected by his counter party. Usually this principle is used in fields and subjects in which a certain general steadiness or uniformity of the system has been considered a relevant value by the legislator. The case is typical of service contracts with repeated obligations (like with gas, water, electricity providers and similars), in which irregularities on one side cannot be balanced if not in a regular situation (i.e., of payments) on the other side. The customer, for example, might be asked to pay regularly the new bill, before contesting the previous one in which he found irregular calculations, and asking for a balancement with newer bills; he thus cannot by himself determine a discount in the next payment.
; ''Ubi lex voluit, dixit; ubi noluit, tacuit'' : When the law wanted to regulate the matter in further detail, it did regulate the matter; when it did not want to regulate the matter in further detail, it remained silent (in the interpretation of a law, an excessively expansive interpretation might perhaps go beyond the intention of the [[legislator]], thus we must adhere to what is in the text of the law and draw no material consequences from the law's silence).

{{Anti-consumerism|Theories}}

'''Buy Nothing Day''' ('''BND''') is an international day of protest against [[consumerism]]. In North America, the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden, Buy Nothing Day is held the day after U.S. [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], concurrent to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]; elsewhere, it is held the following day, which is the last Saturday in November.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/internetnews/story/0,7369,402170,00.html Buy Nothing Day]"''The Guardian.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"&gt;"[http://abillionpeople.org/buy-nothing-day/ Buy Nothing Day]"''Adbusters.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Buy Nothing Day was founded in [[Vancouver]] by artist Ted Dave&lt;ref&gt;Crook, Barbara. "Can you say bye to buying 1 day a year?" ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. September 25, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently promoted by ''[[Adbusters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/11/40142 Click Here to Buy Nothing]. Joanna Glasner. [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']], November 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; based in Canada.

The first Buy Nothing Day was organized in Canada in September 1992 "as a day for society to examine the issue of overconsumption." In 1997, it was moved to the Friday after American Thanksgiving, also called [[Black Friday (shopping)|"Black Friday"]], which is one of the ten busiest shopping days in the United States. In 2000, some advertisements by ''Adbusters'' promoting Buy Nothing Day were denied advertising time by almost all major television networks except for [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"/&gt; Soon, campaigns started appearing in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enkopfridag.se/1998.php|title=1998, köp-inget-dagen|publisher=En köpfri dag|language=Swedish|author=Jonas Lindkvist|date=1998|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation now includes more than 65 nations.

==Activities==
[[File:Buy Nothing Day trolley (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Buy Nothing Day sign attached to a Walmart shopping trolley by an activist]]
Various gatherings and forms of protest have been used on Buy Nothing Day to draw attention to the problem of [[overconsumption]]:
* Credit card cut-up: Participants stand in a shopping mall, shopping center, or store with a pair of scissors and a poster that advertises help for people who want to put an end to mounting debt and extortionate interest rates with one simple cut. Namely, by destroying their credit card by cutting it with the scissors.
* Free, non-commercial street parties
* [[Sit-in]]
* [[Zombie walk]]: Participant "zombies" wander around shopping malls or other consumer havens with a blank stare. When asked what they are doing, participants describe Buy Nothing Day.
* Whirl-mart: Participants silently steer their shopping carts around a shopping mall or store in a long, baffling conga line without putting anything in the carts or actually making any purchases.
* Public protests
* Wildcat General Strike: A strategy used for the 2009 Buy Nothing Day where participants not only do not buy anything for twenty-four hours but also keep their lights, televisions, computers and other non-essential appliances turned off, their cars parked, and their phones turned off or unplugged from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}
* Buy Nothing Day hike: Rather than celebrating consumerism by shopping, participants celebrate The Earth and nature.
* Buy Nothing + [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]]: As the monthly Critical Mass bicycle ride often falls on this day or near, rides in some cities acknowledge and celebrate Buy Nothing Day.
* Buy Nothing Day paddle along the San Francisco waterfront: This event is promoted by the Bay Area Sea Kayakers to kayak along the notoriously consumptive San Francisco waterfront.
* The Buy Nothing Coat Exchange: began in Rhode Island and became part of the Buy Nothing Day some twenty years ago. Coupling the two events was the brainchild of Greg Gerritt, an expert in environmental studies and long term activist in consumerism and global warming. Similar Winter Coat Exchanges take place on Buy Nothing Day in Kentucky, Utah and Oregon. Coats are collected throughout the month of November from anyone who wants to donate and brought to various locations within each state. On the day after Thanksgiving, many opt out of the Black Friday madness to donate and/or volunteer. On that day, anyone who needs a winter coat is welcome to exchange one or just take one. The lines in Providence RI form early and are long which punctuates the need that is prevalent in many cities and towns. The combination of the two events has become a welcomed tradition in RI.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==
While critics of the day charge that Buy Nothing Day simply causes participants to buy the next day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetyee.ca/Views/2006/11/24/BND/ Why I Shop on Buy Nothing Day], TheTyee.ca, November 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters states that it "isn't just about changing your habits for one day" but "about starting a lasting lifestyle commitment to consuming less and producing less [[waste]]."{{cite quote|date=November 2018}}

Other campaigns, such as Shift Your Shopping, attempt to redirect spending away from corporate chains and online giants toward locally owned, community-based businesses as a means to combat consumerism. Even some independent business advocates, such as the [[American Independent Business Alliance]], recognize "Black Friday" frenzy does little for independent businesses and instead encourage people to consider giving gifts but not necessarily "things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Gifts Don't Have to Be "Stuff"|url=http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff|publisher=American Independent Business Alliance|archivedate=October 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017183448/http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaming==
[[Adbusters]] in 2011 renamed the event Occupy Xmas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://occupyxmas.net/ Occupy Xmas], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231142336/http://www.occupyxmas.net/ |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Occupy movement]].  Buy Nothing Day was first joined with Adbuster's [[Buy Nothing Christmas]] campaign.  Shortly thereafter, Lauren Bercovitch, the production manager at Adbusters Media Foundation publicly embraced the principles of Occupy Xmas, advocating "something as simple as buying locally—going out and putting money into your local economy—or making your Christmas presents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefulcrum.ca/news/an-occupied-christmas/ An interview with Lauren Bercovitch]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the central message of Occupy X-mas and Occupy Christmas differed in that Occupy X-Mas called for a "buy nothing Christmas" and Occupy Christmas called for support of local economy, artists, and craftspeople in holiday shopping.  The union of these ideologies calls for a Buy Nothing Day to kick off a season of supporting local economy and family.

'''CALO''' was an [[List of notable artificial intelligence projects|artificial intelligence project]] that attempted to integrate numerous AI technologies into a cognitive assistant. CALO is an acronym for "'''Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes'''". The name was inspired by the Latin word "calonis," which means "soldier’s servant". The project started in May 2003 and ran for five years, ending in 2008.

The CALO effort has had many major spin-offs, most notably the [[Siri (software)|Siri]] [[intelligent software assistant]] that is now part of the [[Apple iOS]] since [[iOS 5]], delivered in several phones and tablets; Social Kinetics, a social application that learned personalized intervention and treatment strategies for chronic disease patients, sold to [[RedBrick Health]]; the [[Trapit]] project, which is a [[web scraper]] and [[news aggregator]] that makes intelligent selections of web content based on user preferences; [[Tempo (app)|Tempo AI]], a smart calendar; [[Desti]], a personalized travel guide; and [[Kuato Studios]], a game development startup.

CALO was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) under its Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Markoff |authorlink=John Markoff |title=A Software Secretary That Takes Charge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14stream.html?_r=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Personalized_Assistant_that_Learns_%28PAL%29.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805162949/http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Personalized_Assistant_that_Learns_%28PAL%29.aspx|archivedate=2011-08-05|title=Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL)|publisher=[[DARPA]]|accessdate=2013-05-18|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA's five-year contract brought together over 300 researchers from 25 of the top university and commercial research institutions, with the goal of building a new generation of cognitive assistants that can reason, learn from experience, be told what to do, explain what they are doing, reflect on their experience, and respond robustly to surprise. [[SRI International]] was the lead integrator responsible for coordinating the effort to produce an assistant that can live with and learn from its users, provide value to them, and then pass a yearly evaluation that measures how well the system has learned to do its job.

==Functions==
CALO assists its user with six high-level functions:

# ''Organizing and Prioritizing Information'': As the user works with email, appointments, web pages, files, and so forth, CALO uses machine learning algorithms to build a queryable model of who works on which projects, what role they play, how important they are, how documents and deliverables are related to this, etc.
# ''Preparing Information Artifacts'': CALO can help its user put together new documents such as PowerPoint presentations, leveraging learning about structure and content from previous documents accessed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pan |first=Sinno Jialin |last2=Yang | first2=Qiang |title=A Survey on Transfer Learning|journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering|volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1345–1359 |date=October 2010|doi=10.1109/TKDE.2009.191|citeseerx=10.1.1.216.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Mediating Human Communications'': CALO provides assistance as its user interacts with other people, both in electronic forums (e.g. email) and in physical meetings.  If given access to participate in a meeting, CALO automatically generates a meeting transcript, tracks action item assignments, detects roles of participants, and so forth.  CALO can also put together a "PrepPak" for a meeting containing information to read ahead of time or have at your fingertips as the meeting progresses.
# ''Task Management'': CALO can automate routine tasks for you (e.g. travel authorizations), and can be taught new procedures and tasks by observing and interacting with the user.
# ''Scheduling and Reasoning in Time'':  CALO can learn your preferences for when you need things done by, and help you manage your busy schedule (PTIME published in ACM TIST).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Berry |first=Pauline M. |last2=Gervasio | first2=Melinda |last3=Peintner|first3=Bart | last4=Yorke-Smith | first4=Neil |title=PTIME: Personalized assistance for calendaring|journal=ACM Tist|volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=1–22 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1145/1989734.1989744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://tist.acm.org |title=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (ACM TIST)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Resource allocation'': As part of Task management, CALO can learn to acquire new resources (electronic services and real-world people) to help get a job done.

==Evaluation==

Every year, the CALO system, after living with its user for a period of time, is given an achievement-style test of 153 "administration assistant" questions, primarily focused on what it has learned about the user's life.  Evaluators measure how well CALO's performance on these questions improves year-over-year, and how much of CALO's performance is due to "learning in the wild" (new knowledge, tasks, and inferences it has been able to acquire on its own, as opposed to function or knowledge hard-wired into the system by a developer).

==Framework==

[[SRI International]] made a collection of successful machine learning and reasoning technologies developed in the PAL program, primarily from the CALO project, available online. The available technologies include both general-purpose learning methods along with more focused learning applications. The PAL software and related publications are available at the PAL Framework website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pal.sri.com/Plone/framework|title=Framework|website=Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL)|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAL capabilities have been modularized, packaged, and adapted to industry standards to facilitate their incorporation into target applications. Various infrastructure components and APIs are available to simplify interaction with the technologies. PAL capabilities were integrated into the [[US Army]]'s [[CPOF]] command and control system and fielded to Iraq in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=[[Thomas Garvey (artificial intelligence researcher)|Thomas Garvey]], [[Melinda Gervasio]], [[Thomas H.

The available technologies were developed by research teams at SRI International, [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], the [[University of Rochester]], the [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]], [[Oregon State University]], the [[University of Southern California]], and [[Stanford University]].

[[File:Cable diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram demonstrating cable bacteria metabolism in surface sediment. Hydrogen sulfide (H{{sub|2}}S) is oxidized in the sulfidic sediment layer, and the resulting electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) are conducted up through the cable bacteria filament to the oxic layer and used to reduce molecular oxygen (O{{sub|2}}).]]

'''Cable bacteria''' are filamentous [[bacteria]] that conduct electricity across distances over 1&amp;nbsp;cm in sediment and groundwater aquifers.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2010"&gt;Nielsen LP, Risgaard-Petersen N, Fossing H, Christensen PB, Sayama M. (2010). Electric currents couple spatially separated biogeochemical processes in marine sediment.

(2014). Electric coupling between distant nitrate reduction and sulfide oxidation in marine sediment. The ISME Journal 8: 1682–1690. {{doi|10.1038/ismej.2014.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the sediment's surface to the oxidation of sulfide&lt;ref name="Pfeffer2012" /&gt; in the deeper, anoxic, sediment layers.

==Discovery==
Long-distance electrical conductance in sediment was first observed in 2010 as a spatial separation of sulfide oxidation and oxygen reduction in marine sediment that was interrupted and re-established at a rate faster than could be explained by chemical diffusion.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2010" /&gt; It was later found that this electrical conductance could be observed across a non-conductive layer of glass microspheres, where the only possible conductive structures were filamentous bacteria belonging to the family [[Desulfobulbaceae]].&lt;ref name="Pfeffer2012" /&gt; The conductivity of single, live filaments was later demonstrated by observing the oxidation state of [[cytochromes]] using [[Raman microscopy]].&lt;ref name="Bjerg2018"&gt;Bjerg JT, Boschker HTS, Larsen S, Berry D, Schmid M, Millo D, et al. (2018). Long-distance electron transport in individual, living cable bacteria. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 115: 5786–5791. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1800367115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same phenomenon was later observed in freshwater sediments&lt;ref name="Risgaard-Petersen2015"&gt;Risgaard-Petersen N, Kristiansen M, Frederiksen RB, Dittmer AL, Bjerg JT, Trojan D, et al. (2015). Cable Bacteria in Freshwater Sediments. Appl Environ Microbiol 81: 6003–6011. {{doi|10.1128/AEM.01064-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and groundwater aquifers.&lt;ref name="Müller2016"&gt;Müller H, Bosch J, Griebler C, Damgaard LR, Nielsen LP, Lueders T, et al. (2016). Long-distance electron transfer by cable bacteria in aquifer sediments. The ISME Journal 10: 2010–2019. {{doi|10.1038/ismej.2015.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable bacteria densities of up to 2&amp;nbsp;km per square centimeter of sediment surface have been observed.&lt;ref name="Schauer2014" /&gt;

==Morphology==
Cable bacteria filaments are 0.4—1.7&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and up to 15&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Schauer2014"&gt;Schauer R, Risgaard-Petersen N, Kjeldsen KU, Tataru Bjerg JJ, B Jørgensen B, Schramm A, et al. (2014). Succession of cable bacteria and electric currents in marine sediment. The ISME Journal 8: 1314–1322.&lt;/ref&gt; Filaments consist of rod-shaped cells with an average length of 3&amp;nbsp;µm and 15-58 ridges around encircling the cells diameter. These ridges are hypothesized to contain the cells' conductive structures.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malkin2014"&gt;Malkin SY, Rao AMF, Seitaj D, Vasquez-Cardenas D, Zetsche E-M, Hidalgo-Martinez S, et al. (2014). Natural occurrence of microbial sulphur oxidation by long-range electron transport in the seafloor. The ISME Journal 8: 1843–1854. {{doi|10.1038/ismej.2014.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each ridge contains two parallel "strings" - continuous structures that connect cells in the filament to one another. &lt;ref name="Jiang2018"&gt;Jiang Z, Zhang S, Klausen LH, Song J, Li Q, Wang Z, et al. (2018). In vitro single-cell dissection revealing the interior structure of cable bacteria. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 115: 8517–8522.{{doi|10.1073/pnas.1807562115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diameter of junctions between cells in the filament varies from being smaller than the cell diameter, the same diameter as the cells on either side of the junction, or bulging out to become wider than the cell diameter. &lt;ref name="Jiang2018" /&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Two candidate genera of cable bacteria have been described: ''Electrothrix'' containing four candidate species, found in marine or brackish sediments, and ''Electronema'' containing two candidate species, found in freshwater sediments.&lt;ref name="Trojan2016"&gt;Trojan D, Schreiber L, Bjerg JT, Bøggild A, Yang T, Kjeldsen KU, et al. (2016). A taxonomic framework for cable bacteria and proposal of the candidate genera Electrothrix and Electronema. Syst Appl Microbiol 39: 297–306. {{doi|10.1016/j.syapm.2016.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genera are classified within the family [[Desulfobulbaceae]]. Cable bacteria are defined by their function rather than their phylogeny, and it is possible that further cable bacteria taxa will be discovered.

==Ecological significance==
Cable bacteria strongly influence the geochemical properties of the surrounding environment. Their activity promotes the oxidation of [[iron]] at the surface of the sediment, and the resulting iron oxides bind phosphorus-containing compounds&lt;ref name="Sulu-Gambari2016"&gt;Sulu-Gambari F, Seitaj D, Meysman FJR, Schauer R, Polerecky L, Slomp CP. (2016). Cable Bacteria Control Iron-Phosphorus Dynamics in Sediments of a Coastal Hypoxic Basin. Environ Sci Technol 50: 1227–1233. {{doi|10.1021/acs.est.5b04369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hydrogen sulfide,&lt;ref name="Seitaj2015"&gt;Seitaj D, Schauer R, Sulu-Gambari F, Hidalgo-Martinez S, Malkin SY, Burdorf LDW, et al. (2015). Cable bacteria generate a firewall against euxinia in seasonally hypoxic basins. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112: 13278–13283. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1510152112}}&lt;/ref&gt; limiting the amount of [[phosphorus]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the water. Phosphorus can cause [[eutrophication]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] can be toxic to marine life, meaning that cable bacteria play an important role in maintaining marine ecosystems in coastal areas.

==Practical applications==
Cable bacteria have been found associated with benthic [[microbial fuel cells]], devices that convert chemical energy on the ocean floor to electrical energy.&lt;ref name="Reimers2017"&gt;Reimers CE, Li C, Graw MF, Schrader PS, Wolf M. (2017). The Identification of Cable Bacteria Attached to the Anode of a Benthic Microbial Fuel Cell: Evidence of Long Distance Extracellular Electron Transport to Electrodes. Front Microbio 8: 563. {{doi|10.1101/pdb.prot5366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the future, cable bacteria may play a role in increasing the efficiency of [[microbial fuel cells]]. Cable bacteria have also been found associated with a bioelectrochemical system for degrading contaminating hydrocarbons in marine sediment &lt;ref name="Matturo2017"&gt;Matturro B, Cruz Viggi C, Aulenta F, Rossetti S. (2017). Cable Bacteria and the Bioelectrochemical Snorkel: The Natural and Engineered Facets Playing a Role in Hydrocarbons Degradation in Marine Sediments. Front Microbio 8: 952. {{doi|10.3389/fmicb.2017.00952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may play a role in future [[oil spill]] cleanup technologies.

==Extent==
Cable bacteria have been identified in a diverse range of climatic conditions worldwide,&lt;ref name="Burdorf2017"&gt;Burdorf LDW, Tramper A, Seitaj D, Meire L, Hidalgo-Martinez S, Zetsche E-M, et al. (2017). Long-distance electron transport occurs globally in marine sediments. Biogeosciences 14: 683–701. {{doi|10.5194/bg-14-683-2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Denmark]],&lt;ref name="Pfeffer2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Risgaard-Petersen2015" /&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="Malkin2014" /&gt; [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="Trojan2016" /&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theage.com.au/technology/shock-as-scientists-find-electric-bacteria-in-the-yarra-20141205-121751.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Larsen2014"&gt;Larsen S, Nielsen LP, Schramm A. (2014). Cable bacteria associated with long-distance electron transport in New England salt marsh sediment. Environmental Microbiology Reports 7: 175–179. {{doi|10.1111/1758-2229.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">'''Casa Viva''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Wheaton, Illinois]] and [[San Jose, Costa Rica]]. Casa Viva seeks to place children who have been separated from their families into a safe, caring family. Casa Viva is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for “Living Families” or “Living Homes.” The model of international child care that Casa Viva has created:
*Doesn’t rely on ongoing American funding
*Is nationally based
*Uses the social network of [[Christian]] churches to identify and train families
Casa Viva primarily cares for [[social orphan]]s, and also cares for true [[orphans]].

==Casa Viva’s History==
In 1998 Philip and Jill Aspegren moved to the [[Dominican Republic]] to build an orphanage and train nationals to care for the children there with [[Kids Alive]]. But there had to be a better way: a less expensive, less institutional, quicker way to care for children internationally. They began to dream of a childcare model that does not require new buildings and that places children in families rather than in homes.

Moving to [[Costa Rica]] in 2005 they began to network with local churches, recruiting families belonging to those churches to care for children. Children who have been separated from their biological families are placed in families on a short term basis while their family is identified and counseled. Children are also placed in Casa Viva homes long term when it is impossible for the child to be reunited with their biological family. Children placed in a Casa Viva home have the advantage of growing up in a home that is surrounded by [[extended family]], [[local church]], and the support of the Casa Viva center.

==Casa Viva Today==
There are currently two Casa Viva Communities in [[Costa Rica]] - one in Eastern San Jose and a second in Grecia. In partnership with the Viva Network and Toybox it has identified [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]] as the next sites of multiplication.

===Developing Family Based Child Care International===
====Alternative to Orphanages====
Orphanages, whether private or government run, are institutions that are expensive to run and the good ones often become inundated with children sent there by the authorities. This reduces the quality of care and leaves the institution and its staff overworked and under equipped. While the physical needs of the child are met, often psychological needs of a child, the privacy of a child, and integration into their home culture are found to be lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf Save The Children: A Last Resort] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907101844/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Casa Viva to begin creating a program, similar to England and the United States' [[foster care]] model, but with two primary differences:
*Church based
*Little financial incentive
In some cases, the financial benefit of already-established government-based fostering has become a primary motivator for families to be host foster families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster07.htm Lifting the Veil on Foster Care]&lt;/ref&gt; Casa Viva does help families cover the cost of caring for the child but relies heavily on Biblical motivation and mandates to care for the orphan in need.

====Children Raised in Families====
It has been shown that children raised in orphanages do not develop as well physically, cognitively or emotionally as children raised in family based settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_4_38/ai_n15338080 The House, The Street, Global Society: Latin American families and childhood in the twenty-first century]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, [[t-norm]]s are a special kind of binary operations on the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Various '''constructions of t-norms''', either by explicit definition or by transformation from previously known functions, provide a plenitude of examples and classes of t-norms. This is important, e.g., for finding [[counter-example]]s or supplying t-norms with particular properties for use in engineering applications of [[fuzzy logic]]. The main ways of construction of t-norms include using ''generators'', defining ''parametric classes'' of t-norms, ''rotations'', or ''ordinal sums'' of t-norms.

Relevant background can be found in the article on [[t-norm]]s.

== Generators of t-norms ==

The method of constructing t-norms by generators consists in using a unary function (''generator'') to transform some known binary function (most often, addition or multiplication) into a t-norm.

In order to allow using non-bijective generators, which do not have the [[inverse function]], the following notion of ''pseudo-inverse function'' is employed:
:Let ''f'': [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] → [''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''] be a monotone function between two closed subintervals of [[affinely extended real number system|extended real line]]. The ''pseudo-inverse function'' to ''f'' is the function ''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;(−1)&lt;/sup&gt;: [''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''] → [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] defined as
::&lt;math&gt;f^{(-1)}(y) = \begin{cases}
  \sup \{ x\in[a,b] \mid f(x) &lt; y \} &amp; \text{for } f \text{ non-decreasing} \\
  \sup \{ x\in[a,b] \mid f(x) &gt; y \} &amp; \text{for } f \text{ non-increasing.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Additive generators ===

The construction of t-norms by additive generators is based on the following theorem:
: Let ''f'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;] be a strictly decreasing function such that ''f''(1) = 0 and ''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y'') is in the range of ''f'' or equal to ''f''(0&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or +&amp;infin; for all ''x'', ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Then the function ''T'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] defined as
::''T''(''x'', ''y'') = ''f''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;(-1)&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''(''x'') + ''f''(''y''))
: is a t-norm.

Alternatively, one may avoid using the notion of pseudo-inverse function by having &lt;math&gt;T(x,y)=f^{-1}\left(\min\left(f(0^+),f(x)+f(y)\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding residuum can then be expressed as &lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = f^{-1}\left(\max\left(0,f(y)-f(x)\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;. And the biresiduum as &lt;math&gt;(x \Leftrightarrow y) = f^{-1}\left(\left|f(x)-f(y)\right|\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

If a t-norm ''T'' results from the latter construction by a function ''f'' which is right-continuous in 0, then ''f'' is called an ''additive generator'' of ''T''.

Examples:
* The function ''f''(''x'') = 1 – ''x'' for ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is an additive generator of the Łukasiewicz t-norm.
* The function ''f'' defined as ''f''(''x'') = –log(''x'') if 0 &amp;lt; ''x'' ≤ 1 and ''f''(0) = +∞ is an additive generator of the product t-norm.
* The function ''f'' defined as ''f''(''x'') = 2 – ''x'' if 0 ≤ ''x'' &amp;lt; 1 and ''f''(1) = 0 is an additive generator of the drastic t-norm.

Basic properties of additive generators are summarized by the following theorem:
:Let ''f'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;] be an additive generator of a t-norm ''T''. Then:
:* ''T'' is an Archimedean t-norm.
:* ''T'' is continuous if and only if ''f'' is continuous.
:* ''T'' is strictly monotone if and only if ''f''(0) = +&amp;infin;.
:* Each element of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) is a nilpotent element of ''T'' if and only if f(0) &amp;lt; +&amp;infin;.
:* The multiple of ''f'' by a positive constant is also an additive generator of ''T''.
:* ''T'' has no non-trivial idempotents. (Consequently, e.g., the minimum t-norm has no additive generator.)

=== Multiplicative generators ===

The isomorphism between addition on [0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] and multiplication on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] by the logarithm and the exponential function allow two-way transformations between additive and multiplicative generators of a t-norm. If ''f'' is an additive generator of a t-norm ''T'', then the function ''h'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] defined as ''h''(''x'') = e&lt;sup&gt;−''f''&amp;nbsp;(''x'')&lt;/sup&gt; is a ''multiplicative generator'' of ''T'', that is, a function ''h'' such that
* ''h'' is strictly increasing
* ''h''(1) = 1
* ''h''(''x'') · ''h''(''y'') is in the range of ''h'' or equal to 0 or ''h''(0+) for all ''x'', ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]
* ''h'' is right-continuous in 0
* ''T''(''x'', ''y'') = ''h''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;(−1)&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'') · ''h''(''y'')).
Vice versa, if ''h'' is a multiplicative generator of ''T'', then ''f'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;+∞] defined by ''f''(''x'') = −log(''h''(x)) is an additive generator of ''T''.

== Parametric classes of t-norms ==

Many families of related t-norms can be defined by an explicit formula depending on a parameter ''p''. This section lists the best known parameterized families of t-norms. The following definitions will be used in the list:

* A family of t-norms ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; parameterized by ''p'' is ''increasing'' if ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') ≤ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') for all ''x'', ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] whenever ''p'' ≤ ''q'' (similarly for ''decreasing'' and ''strictly'' increasing or decreasing).
* A family of t-norms ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''continuous'' with respect to the parameter ''p'' if
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{p\to p_0} T_p = T_{p_0}&lt;/math&gt;
:for all values ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the parameter.

=== Schweizer–Sklar t-norms ===

[[Image:Schweizer-Sklar-2-Tnorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph (3D and contours) of the Schweizer–Sklar t-norm with ''p'' = 2]]
The family of ''Schweizer–Sklar t-norms'', introduced by Berthold Schweizer and [[Abe Sklar]] in the early 1960s, is given by the parametric definition
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{SS}}_p(x,y) = \begin{cases}
  T_{\min}(x,y)          &amp; \text{if } p = -\infty \\
  (x^p + y^p - 1)^{1/p}          &amp; \text{if } -\infty &lt; p &lt; 0 \\
  T_{\mathrm{prod}}(x,y)         &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  (\max(0, x^p + y^p - 1))^{1/p} &amp; \text{if } 0 &lt; p &lt; +\infty \\
  T_{\mathrm{D}}(x,y)            &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

A Schweizer–Sklar t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{SS}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is
* Archimedean if and only if ''p'' &amp;gt; −∞
* Continuous if and only if ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞
* Strict if and only if −∞ &amp;lt; ''p'' ≤ 0 (for ''p'' = −1 it is the Hamacher product)
* Nilpotent if and only if 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ (for ''p'' = 1 it is the Łukasiewicz t-norm).
The family is strictly decreasing for ''p'' ≥ 0 and continuous with respect to ''p'' in [−∞,&amp;nbsp;+∞]. An additive generator for &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{SS}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for −∞ &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{SS}}_p (x) = \begin{cases}
  -\log x           &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  \frac{1 - x^p}{p} &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hamacher t-norms ===

The family of ''Hamacher t-norms'', introduced by Horst Hamacher in the late 1970s, is given by the following parametric definition for 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{H}}_p (x,y) = \begin{cases}
  T_{\mathrm{D}}(x,y)                &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty \\
  0                                  &amp; \text{if } p = x = y = 0 \\
  \frac{xy}{p + (1 - p)(x + y - xy)} &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
The t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{H}}_0&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''Hamacher product.''

Hamacher t-norms are the only t-norms which are rational functions.
The Hamacher t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{H}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is strict if and only if ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ (for ''p'' = 1 it is the product t-norm). The family is strictly decreasing and continuous with respect to ''p''. An additive generator of &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{H}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{H}}_p(x) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1 - x}{x}            &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  \log\frac{p + (1 - p)x}{x} &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Frank t-norms ===

The family of ''Frank t-norms'', introduced by M.J. Frank in the late 1970s, is given by the parametric definition for 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞ as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{F}}_p(x,y) = \begin{cases}
  T_{\mathrm{min}}(x,y)  &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  T_{\mathrm{prod}}(x,y) &amp; \text{if } p = 1 \\
  T_{\mathrm{Luk}}(x,y)  &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty \\
  \log_p\left(1 + \frac{(p^x - 1)(p^y - 1)}{p - 1}\right) &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The Frank t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{F}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is strict if ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞. The family is strictly decreasing and continuous with respect to ''p''. An additive generator for &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{F}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{F}}_p(x) = \begin{cases}
  -\log x                   &amp; \text{if } p = 1 \\
  1 - x                     &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty \\
  \log\frac{p - 1}{p^x - 1} &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Yager t-norms ===

[[Image:Yager-2-Tnorm-graph-contours.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Yager t-norm with ''p'' = 2]]
The family of ''Yager t-norms'', introduced in the early 1980s by [[Ronald R. Yager]], is given for 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞ by
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{Y}}_p (x,y) = \begin{cases}
  T_{\mathrm{D}}(x,y)   &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  \max\left(0, 1 - ((1 - x)^p + (1 - y)^p)^{1/p}\right) &amp; \text{if } 0 &lt; p &lt; +\infty \\
  T_{\mathrm{min}}(x,y) &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Yager t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{Y}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent if and only if 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ (for ''p'' = 1 it is the Łukasiewicz t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to ''p''. The Yager t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{Y}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ arises from the Łukasiewicz t-norm by raising its additive generator to the power of ''p''. An additive generator of &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{Y}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{Y}}_p(x) = (1 - x)^p.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Aczél–Alsina t-norms ===

The family of ''Aczél–Alsina t-norms'', introduced in the early 1980s by János Aczél and Claudi Alsina, is given for 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞ by
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{AA}}_p (x,y) = \begin{cases}
  T_{\mathrm{D}}(x,y)   &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  e^{-\left(|\log x|^p + |\log y|^p\right)^{1/p}} &amp; \text{if } 0 &lt; p &lt; +\infty \\
  T_{\mathrm{min}}(x,y) &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The Aczél–Alsina t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{AA}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is strict if and only if 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ (for ''p'' = 1 it is the product t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to ''p''. The Aczél–Alsina t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{AA}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ arises from the product t-norm by raising its additive generator to the power of ''p''. An additive generator of &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{AA}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{AA}}_p(x) = (-\log x)^p.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dombi t-norms ===

The family of ''Dombi t-norms'', introduced by József Dombi (1982), is given for 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞ by
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{D}}_p (x,y) = \begin{cases}
  0                     &amp; \text{if } x = 0 \text{ or } y = 0 \\
  T_{\mathrm{D}}(x,y)   &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  T_{\mathrm{min}}(x,y) &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty \\
  \frac{1}{1 + \left(
    \left(\frac{1 - x}{x}\right)^p + \left(\frac{1 - y}{y}\right)^p
  \right)^{1/p}} &amp; \text{otherwise.} \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Dombi t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{D}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is strict if and only if 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ (for ''p'' = 1 it is the Hamacher product). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to ''p''. The Dombi t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{D}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ arises from the Hamacher product t-norm by raising its additive generator to the power of ''p''. An additive generator of &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{D}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{D}}_p(x) = \left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^p.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sugeno–Weber t-norms ===

The family of ''Sugeno–Weber t-norms'' was introduced in the early 1980s by Siegfried Weber;  the dual [[t-conorm]]s were defined already in the early 1970s by Michio Sugeno. It is given for −1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞ by
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{SW}}_p (x,y) = \begin{cases}
  T_{\mathrm{D}}(x,y)    &amp; \text{if } p = -1 \\
  \max\left(0, \frac{x + y - 1 + pxy}{1 + p}\right) &amp; \text{if } -1 &lt; p &lt; +\infty \\
  T_{\mathrm{prod}}(x,y) &amp; \text{if } p = +\infty 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Sugeno–Weber t-norm &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{SW}}_p&lt;/math&gt; is nilpotent if and only if −1 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ (for ''p'' = 0 it is the Łukasiewicz t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to ''p''. An additive generator of &lt;math&gt;T^{\mathrm{SW}}_p&lt;/math&gt; for 0 &amp;lt; ''p'' &amp;lt; +∞ [sic] is
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{SW}}_p(x) = \begin{cases}
  1 - x   &amp; \text{if } p = 0 \\
  1 - \log_{1 + p}(1 + px) &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

== Ordinal sums ==

The [[ordinal sum]] constructs a t-norm from a family of t-norms, by shrinking them into disjoint subintervals of the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and completing the t-norm by using the minimum on the rest of the unit square. It is based on the following theorem:

:Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' in an index set ''I'' be a family of t-norms and (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) a family of pairwise disjoint (non-empty) open subintervals of [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Then the function ''T'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] defined as
::&lt;math&gt;T(x, y) = \begin{cases}
  a_i + (b_i - a_i) \cdot T_i\left(\frac{x - a_i}{b_i - a_i}, \frac{y - a_i}{b_i - a_i}\right)
    &amp; \text{if } x, y \in [a_i, b_i]^2 \\
  \min(x, y) &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a t-norm.

[[Image:OrdSum-Luk-prod-graph-contours.png|thumb|270px|Ordinal sum of the Łukasiewicz t-norm on the interval [0.05, 0.45] and the product t-norm on the interval [0.55, 0.95]]]
The resulting t-norm is called the ''ordinal sum'' of the summands (''T''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''i'' in ''I'', denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;T = \bigoplus\nolimits_{i\in I} (T_i, a_i, b_i),&lt;/math&gt;
or &lt;math&gt;(T_1, a_1, b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (T_n, a_n, b_n)&lt;/math&gt; if ''I'' is finite.

Ordinal sums of t-norms enjoy the following properties:

* Each t-norm is a trivial ordinal sum of itself on the whole interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
* The empty ordinal sum (for the empty index set) yields the minimum t-norm ''T''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;. Summands with the minimum t-norm can arbitrarily be added or omitted without changing the resulting t-norm.
* It can be assumed without loss of generality that the index set is [[countable]], since the [[real line]] can only contain at most countably many disjoint subintervals.
* An ordinal sum of t-norm is continuous if and only if each summand is a continuous t-norm. (Analogously for left-continuity.)
* An ordinal sum is Archimedean if and only if it is a trivial sum of one Archimedean t-norm on the whole unit interval.
* An ordinal sum has zero divisors if and only if for some index ''i'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has zero divisors. (Analogously for nilpotent elements.)

If &lt;math&gt;T = \bigoplus\nolimits_{i\in I} (T_i, a_i, b_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a left-continuous t-norm, then its residuum ''R'' is given as follows:

\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Ordinal sums of continuous t-norms ===

The ordinal sum of a family of continuous t-norms is a continuous t-norm. By the Mostert–Shields theorem, every continuous t-norm is expressible as the ordinal sum of Archimedean continuous t-norms. Since the latter are either nilpotent (and then isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or strict (then isomorphic to the product t-norm), each continuous t-norm is isomorphic to the ordinal sum of Łukasiewicz and product t-norms.

Important examples of ordinal sums of continuous t-norms are the following ones:

* '''Dubois–Prade t-norms''', introduced by [[Didier Dubois (mathematician)|Didier Dubois]] and Henri Prade in the early 1980s, are the ordinal sums of the product t-norm on [0,&amp;nbsp;''p''] for a parameter ''p'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Dubois–Prade t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to ''p''..
* '''Mayor–Torrens t-norms''', introduced by Gaspar Mayor and Joan Torrens in the early 1990s, are the ordinal sums of the Łukasiewicz t-norm on [0,&amp;nbsp;''p''] for a parameter ''p'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Mayor–Torrens t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to ''p''..

== Rotations ==

The construction of t-norms by rotation was introduced by Sándor Jenei (2000). It is based on the following theorem:
:Let ''T'' be a left-continuous t-norm without [[zero divisor]]s, ''N'': [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] the function that assigns 1 − ''x'' to ''x'' and ''t'' = 0.5. Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be the linear transformation of ''T'' into [''t'',&amp;nbsp;1] and &lt;math&gt;R_{T_1}(x,y) = \sup\{z \mid T_1(z,x)\le y\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then the function
::&lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{rot}} = \begin{cases}
  T_1(x, y) &amp; \text{if } x, y \in (t, 1] \\
  N(R_{T_1}(x, N(y))) &amp; \text{if } x \in (t, 1] \text{ and } y \in [0, t] \\
  N(R_{T_1}(y, N(x))) &amp; \text{if } x \in [0, t] \text{ and } y \in (t, 1] \\
  0 &amp; \text{if } x, y \in [0, t]
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a left-continuous t-norm, called the ''rotation'' of the t-norm ''T''.

[[Image:NilpotentMinimum-as-rotation.png|thumb|120px|right|The [[T-norm#Nilpotent-minimum t-norm|nilpotent minimum]] as a rotation of the [[T-norm#Minimum t-norm|minimum]] t-norm]]
Geometrically, the construction can be described as first shrinking the t-norm ''T'' to the interval [0.5,&amp;nbsp;1] and then rotating it by the angle 2π/3 in both directions around the line connecting the points (0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1) and (1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0).

[[Image:Rotation-Luk-prod-nM-drast-Tnorm-graphs.png|thumb|200px|left|Rotations of the [[T-norm#Lukasiewicz t-norm|Łukasiewicz]], [[T-norm#Product t-norm|product]], [[T-norm#Nilpotent-minimum t-norm|nilpotent minimum]], and [[T-norm#Drastic t-norm|drastic]] t-norm]]
The theorem can be generalized by taking for ''N'' any ''strong negation'', that is, an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] strictly decreasing continuous function on [0,&amp;nbsp;1], and for ''t'' taking the unique [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of&amp;nbsp;''N''.

The resulting t-norm enjoys the following ''rotation invariance'' property with respect to&amp;nbsp;''N'':
:''T''(''x'', ''y'') &amp;le; ''z'' if and only if ''T''(''y'', ''N''(''z'')) &amp;le; ''N''(''x'') for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
The negation induced by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; is the function ''N'', that is, ''N''(''x'') = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', 0) for all ''x'', where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; is the residuum of&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16534">'''Dephosphorylation''' is the removal of a [[phosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;) group from an [[organic compound]] by [[hydrolysis]]. It is a reversible [[post-translational modification]]. Dephosphorylation and its counterpart, [[phosphorylation]], activate and deactivate [[enzyme]]s by detaching or attaching phosphoric [[esters]] and [[anhydride]]s. A  notable occurrence of dephosphorylation is the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and inorganic phosphate.

Dephosphorylation employs a type of hydrolytic enzyme, or [[hydrolase]], which cleave ester bonds. The prominent hydrolase subclass used in dephosphorylation is [[phosphatase]]. Phosphatase removes phosphate groups by hydrolysing [[phosphoric acid]] monoesters into a [[phosphate ion]] and a molecule with a free [[hydroxyl]] (-OH) group.

The reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction occurs in every physiological process, making proper function of protein phosphatases necessary for organism viability. Because protein dephosphorylation is a key process involved in cell signalling, protein phosphatases are implicated in conditions such as cardiac disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.

==History==
The discovery of dephosphorylation came from a series of experiments examining the enzyme phosphorylase isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. In 1955, [[Edwin Krebs]] and [[Edmond Fischer]] used radiolabeled ATP to determine that phosphate is added to the serine residue of phosphorylase to convert it from its ''b'' to ''a'' form via phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FISCHER|first=EH|author2=KREBS, EG|title=Conversion of phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a in muscle extracts.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Sep 1955|volume=216|issue=1|pages=121–32|pmid=13252012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Krebs and Fischer showed that this phosphorylation is part of a kinase cascade. Finally, after purifying the phosphorylated form of the enzyme, phosphorylase ''a'', from rabbit liver, ion exchange chromatography was used to identify phosphoprotein phosphatase I and II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khandelwal|first=RL|author2=Vandenheede, JR |author3=Krebs, EG |title=Purification, properties, and substrate specificities of phosphoprotein phosphatase(s) from rabbit liver.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Aug 25, 1976|volume=251|issue=16|pages=4850–8|pmid=8449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discovery of these dephosphorylating proteins, the reversible nature of  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been associated with a broad range of functional proteins, primarily enzymatic, but also including nonenzymatic proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid38740"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krebs EG, Beavo JA |title=Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of enzymes |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=48 |issue= |pages=923–59 |year=1979 |pmid=38740 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.48.070179.004423 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin G. Krebs|Edwin Krebs]] and [[Edmond H. Fischer|Edmond Fischer]] won the 1992 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation.&lt;ref name="pmid10859071"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raju TN |title=The Nobel chronicles. 1992: Edmond H Fischer (b 1920) and Edwin G Krebs (b 1918) |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9219 |pages=2004 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10859071 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)72951-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of hydroxyl groups belonging to neutral but polar [[amino acids]] such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine within specific target proteins is a fundamental part of the regulation of every physiologic process. Phosphorylation involves the covalent modification of the hydroxyl with a phosphate group through the nucleophilic attack of the alpha phosphate in ATP by the oxygen in the hydroxyl. Dephosphorylation involves removal of the phosphate group through a hydration reaction by addition of a molecule of water and release of the original phosphate group, regenerating the hydroxyl. Both processes are reversible and either mechanism can be used to activate or deactivate a protein. Phosphorylation of a protein produces many biochemical effects, such as changing its conformation to alter its binding to a specific ligand to increase or reduce its activity. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can be used on all types of substrates, such as structural proteins, enzymes, membrane channels, signaling molecules, and other [[kinases]] and phosphatases. The sum of these processes is referred to as phosphoregulation.&lt;ref name="pmid19547744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beltrao P, Trinidad JC, Fiedler D |title=Evolution of phosphoregulation: comparison of phosphorylation patterns across yeast species |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=e1000134 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19547744 |pmc=2691599 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000134 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deregulation of phosphorylation can lead to disease.&lt;ref name="pmid21904669"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bononi A, Agnoletto C, De Marchi E |title=Protein kinases and phosphatases in the control of cell fate |journal=Enzyme Res |volume=2011 |issue= |pages=329098 |year=2011 |pmid=21904669 |pmc=3166778 |doi=10.4061/2011/329098 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-translational modification===
During the synthesis of proteins, polypeptide chains, which are created by ribosomes translating mRNA, must be processed before assuming a mature conformation. The dephosphorylation of proteins is a mechanism for modifying behavior of a protein, often by activating or inactivating an [[enzyme]]. Components of the protein synthetic apparatus also undergo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and thus regulate the rates of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="pmid2349232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Celis JE, Madsen P, Ryazanov AG |title=Increased phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 during mitosis in transformed human amnion cells correlates with a decreased rate of protein synthesis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=87 |issue=11 |pages=4231–5 |date=June 1990 |pmid=2349232 |pmc=54082 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.87.11.4231|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of postranslational modifications, phosphate groups may be removed from serine, threonine, or tyrosine. As such, pathways of intracellular signal transduction depend on sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a wide variety of proteins.

===ATP===
{{Main|adenosine triphosphate}}
{{See also|#Role of dephosphorylation in disease|l1=Role of dephosphorylation in disease}}

: ATP&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⟶ ADP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP, acts as a free energy "currency" in all living organisms. In a spontaneous dephosphorylation reaction 30.5 kJ/mol is released, which is harnessed to drive cellular reactions. Overall, nonspontaneous reactions coupled to the dephosphorylation of ATP are spontaneous, due to the negative free energy change of the coupled reaction. This is important in driving oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is dephosphorylated to ADP and inorganic phosphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casiday|first=Rachel|title=Energy for the Body: Oxidative Phosphorylation|url=http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Cytochromes/cytochromes.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the cellular level, the dephosphorylation of ATPases determines the flow of ions into and out of the cell. Proton pump inhibitors are a class of drug that acts directly on ATPases of the gastrointestinal tract.

===Dephosphorylation in other reactions===
Other molecules besides ATP undergo dephosphorylation as part of other biological systems. Different compounds produce different free energy changes as a result of dephosphorylation.&lt;ref name="Ox phosphorylation site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casiday|first=Rachel|title=Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Experiment|url=http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/LabTutorials/Cytochromes/cytochromes.html|work=Energy for the Body: Oxidative Phosphorylation|publisher=Department of Chemistry, Washington University|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psilocybin also relies on dephosphorylation to be metabolized into psilocin and further eliminated. No information on psilocybin's effect on the change in free energy is currently available.

===Importance of Dephosphorylation in Photosystem II===
The first protein complex of the [[photosynthesis]] component [[light-dependent reactions]] is referred to as [[photosystem II]]. The complex utilizes an enzyme to capture photons of light, providing the greater photosynthesis process with all of the electrons needed to produce ATP. Photosystem II is particularly temperature sensitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamauchi|first=Yasuo|title=Plants switch photosystem at high temperature to protect photosystem II|journal=Nature Precedings|date=29 July 2011|url=http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6168/version/1/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and desphosphorylation has been implicated as a driver of plasticity in responding to varied temperature. Accelerated protein dephosphorylation in photosynthetic thylakoid membranes occurs at elevated temperatures, directly impacting the desphosphorylation of key proteins within the photosystem II complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokka|first=A|author2=Aro, EM |author3=Herrmann, RG |author4=Andersson, B |author5= Vener, AV |title=Dephosphorylation of photosystem II reaction center proteins in plant photosynthetic membranes as an immediate response to abrupt elevation of temperature.|journal=Plant Physiology|date=Aug 2000|volume=123|issue=4|pages=1525–36|pmid=10938368|doi=10.1104/pp.123.4.1525 |pmc=59108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of dephosphorylation in disease==

===Pathology===

Excessive dephosphorylation of the membrane ATPases and proton pumps in the gastrointestinal tract leads to higher secretory rates of caustic peptic acids. These result in heartburn and esophagitis. In combination with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection, peptic ulcer disease is caused by the elevated pH dephosphorylation elicits.&lt;ref name="Robinson 709-15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=M|title=Proton pump inhibitors: update on their role in acid-related gastrointestinal diseases.|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|date=Jun 2005|volume=59|issue=6|pages=709–15|pmid=15924600|doi=10.1111/j.1368-5031.2005.00517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microtubule-associated protein [[tau]] is abnormally hyperphosphorylated when isolated from the brain of patients who suffer from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. This is due to the dysfunction of dephosphorylation mechanisms at specific amino acids on the tau protein. Tau dephosphorylation is catalysed by protein phosphatase-2A and phosphatase-2B. Deficiency or modification of one or both proteins may be involved in abnormal phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease&lt;ref name="pmid7838376"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gong CX, Grundke-Iqbal I, Iqbal K |title=Dephosphorylation of Alzheimer's disease abnormally phosphorylated tau by protein phosphatase-2A |journal=Neuroscience |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=765–72 |date=August 1994 |pmid=7838376 |doi= 10.1016/0306-4522(94)90400-6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dephosphorylation has also been linked to [[cardiac disease]], particularly the alteration of actin-myosin interactions that are key for providing the underlying force of a heartbeat. Dephosphorylation is a key part of the myosin cycling kinetics that directly control the actin-myosin interactions. When the dephosphorylation process is interrupted,  calcium dependent cardiac contraction is impaired or fully disabled.&lt;ref name="pmid22426213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheikh F, Ouyang K, Campbell SG |title=Mouse and computational models link Mlc2v dephosphorylation to altered myosin kinetics in early cardiac disease |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=1209–21 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22426213 |pmc=3314469 |doi=10.1172/JCI61134 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also suggested that modifications to dephosphorylation impact physiological processes implicated in [[Diabetes mellitus]]. The kinetics of dephosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2, phosphoproteins are shown to be involved in insulin receptor signaling, and ''in vitro'' models demonstrate that changes to dephosphorylation kinetics impact upstream and downstream insulin stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid17068339"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhande R, Zhang W, Zheng Y |title=Dephosphorylation by default, a potential mechanism for regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2 |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=281 |issue=51 |pages=39071–80 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17068339 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M605251200 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatments===
Inhibition of proton pumps&lt;ref name="Robinson 709-15"/&gt; significantly decreases the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing the symptoms of acid-related diseases. The resulting change in pH decreases survival of the bacteria ''H.pylori'', a major cause of peptic ulcer disease. Once the proton pump inhibitor eradicates this bacteria within the gut, reversing erosive reflux.
Treating heart disease has improved with the use of drugs that inhibit [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] via dephosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=DS|author2=Summers, RJ |author3=Bengtsson, T |title=Regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity by G-protein coupled receptors: potential utility in treatment of diabetes and heart disease.|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=Sep 2008|volume=119|issue=3|pages=291–310|pmid=18606183|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In the treatment of diabetes, [[sulfonylurea]] drugs are able to stimulate dephosphorylation of the glucose transporter [[GLUT4]], decreasing insulin resistance and increasing and glucose utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Müller|first=G|author2=Wied, S|title=The sulfonylurea drug, glimepiride, stimulates glucose transport, glucose transporter translocation, and dephosphorylation in insulin-resistant rat adipocytes in vitro.|journal=Diabetes|date=Dec 1993|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1852–67|pmid=8243832|doi=10.2337/diabetes.42.12.1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Dephosphorylation can play a key role in molecular biology, particularly [[Molecular cloning|cloning]] using [[restriction enzymes]]. The cut ends of a [[Cloning vector|vector]] may re-ligate during a ligation step due to phosphorylation. By using a desphosphorylating phosphatase, re-ligation can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Cloning manual"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sambrook|first=J|title=Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual|year=1989|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|edition=2nd|author2=Fritsch, E.F.|author3=Maniatis, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alkaline phosphatases are often sourced naturally, most commonly from calf intestine, and are abbreviated as [[Calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase|CIP]].&lt;ref name="pmid19838171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makovets S, Blackburn EH |title=DNA damage signalling prevents deleterious telomere addition at DNA breaks |journal=Nat.

[[File:Mechanical door closer.jpg|thumb|right|Modern manual door closer]]
A '''door closer''' is a [[mechanical device]] that closes a [[door]], in general after someone opens it, or after it was automatically opened. 

==Types==
[[File:PERKO-POWER controlled concealed jamb-mounted door closer.jpg|thumb|A concealed jamb-mounted door closer]]

There are four styles of interior door-closer:

* Surface-mounted
* Concealed in frame
* Concealed in floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constructionwitness.com/Published-Articles/Doors-Door-Closers-Door-Hardware/Concealed-Door-Closers.aspx |title=Concealed Door Closers |author=Michael Panish |work=Michael Panish: Construction Expert Witness and Consultant |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concealed in door

Surface-mounted door closers come in four variations: slide-track arm, regular arm surface mounted, parallel arm surface mounted, and top jamb mounted. Overhead door closers are typically surface mounted, some manufacturers offer concealed models too. Such closers mount inside a pocket in the door frame or are mounted in the floor directly under the pivot point and are completely concealed.

Another type of door closer, a surface mounted one, is attached to the door frame behind the door (where the hinges are) next to the middle hinge. The "arm" rests against the door, and a spring that is bent by the user opening the door closes the door by retracting to its proper shape.

There is also the storm door and screen door variation of the door closer: As the name implies, these piston shaped closers are used on storm, security, and screen doors which give the home an extra line of defense against weather, intruders, and insects.  Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm door closers are more typically pneumatic, using air and springs to close the door.  Storm Door closers generally have a small metal washer on the rod that is used to lock the closer in the open position when moving stuff in or out, but more recent models such as the Touch 'n Hold door closer have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier.

Finally, there is the concealed, jamb-mounted door closer, which fits in morticed recesses in the door and door frame and is totally concealed when the door is closed. These are available in controlled and uncontrolled versions, selected according to the application for which they are intended.

===Manual===
[[File:BKS-Türschließer.jpg|thumb|right|Old type of manual door closer (made by BKS)]]
A manual door closer stores the energy used in the opening of the door in a compression or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly the first half of the sweep range. Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.

===Automatic===

An automatic door closer (more often called a "door opener") opens the door itself, typically under the control of a [[push button]], [[motion detector]] or other device, and then closes it as well, typically employing a motion or [[proximity detector]] to determine when it is safe to close the door.

==Control of closing force and speed==
Closers often feature dampers that offer control over the closing force and speed. Such dampers are usually hydraulic or pneumatic [[dashpot]]s.

==Usage==
===Fire safety===

Door closers are most commonly installed on [[fire door]]s, which need to be closed in case of fire, to help prevent the spread of fire and smoke. In most countries, their performance will be governed by national standards.

===Maintaining room temperatures===

Door closers also play a role in maintaining average cooling temperatures, since colder air does not vent out for longer periods if the door remains closed for longer periods on average.

The '''ecological humanities''' (also '''environmental humanities''') is an interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the [[humanities]] over the past several decades (in particular environmental literature, environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology)&lt;ref&gt;Robin, L., 2018. Environmental humanities and climate change: understanding humans geologically and other life forms ethically. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 9(1), p.e499.&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[ecological]] humanities aim to help  bridge traditional divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between [[Western culture|Western]], [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] ways of knowing the natural world and the place of humans in it (Rose 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-April-2004/rose.html|title=Rose and Robin, "The Ecological Humanities in Action: An Invitation"|last=Rose|first=Deborah Bird|date=|website=www.australianhumanitiesreview.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The ecological humanities are characterised by a ''connectivity ontology'' and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to [[Ecology|ecological]] laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Connectivity ontology==
One of the fundamental [[Ontology|ontological]] presuppositions of ecological humanities is that the [[Organic compounds|organic]] world and its [[Inorganic compounds|inorganic]] parts are seen as a single system whereby each part is linked to each other part. This [[world view]] in turn shares an intimate connection with [[Lotka]]'s physiological philosophy and the associated concept of the "World Engine".{{ref|Kingsland1985}} When we see everything as connected, then the traditional questions of the humanities concerning economic and political justice become ''enlarged,'' into a consideration of how [[justice]] is connected with our transformation of our [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[ecosystems]]. The consequence of such a connectivity [[ontology]] is, as proponents of the ecological humanities argue, that we begin to seek out a more inclusive concept of justice that includes non-humans within the domain of those to whom rights are owing. This broadened conception of justice involves "enlarged" or "ecological thinking", which presupposes the enhancement of knowledge sharing within fields of plural and diverse ‘knowledges’. This kind of knowledge sharing is called transdisciplinarity. It has links with the political philosophy of [[Hannah Arendt]] and the works of [[Italo Calvino]]. As Calvino put it, "enlarge[s] the sphere of what we can imagine". It also has connections with Leibniz's Enlightenment project where, the sciences are simultaneously abridged while also being enlarged.{{ref|Rutherford2002}}

The situation is complicated however by the recognition of the fact that connections are both ''non-linear'' and ''linear''. The ecological humanities therefore, require both linear and non-linear modes of language through which reasoning about justice can be done. Thus there is a motivation to find linguistic modes which can adequately express both linear and non-linear connectivities.

==Axioms==

There are three [[axioms]] of ecological humanities:

# The axiom of submission to [[ecological energetics|ecosystem laws]];
# The axiom of ecological kinship, which situates humanity as participant in a larger living system; and 
# The axiom of the social construction of ecosystems and ecological unity, which states that ecosystems and nature may be merely convenient conceptual entities (Marshall, 2002).

Putting the first and second axioms another way, the connections between and among living things are the basis for how ecosystems are understood to work, and thus constitute laws of existence and guidelines for behaviour (Rose 2004)

The first of these axioms has a tradition in social sciences (''see'' Marx, 1968: 3). From the second axiom the notions of "[[Embodied energy|ecological embodiment/ embeddedness]]" and "habitat" have emerged from Political Theory with a fundamental connectivity to rights, democracy and ecologism (Eckersley 1996: 222, 225; Eckersley 1998).

The third axiom comes from the strong 'self-reflective' tradition of all 'humanities' scholarship and it encourages ecological humanities to investigate its own theoretical basis (and without which, ecological humanities is just 'ecology').

==Contemporary ideas==

===Political economic ecology===
{{See also|Political ecology}}

Some theorists have suggested that the inclusion of non-humans in the consideration of justice links ecocentric philosophy with political economics. This is because the theorising of justice is a central activity of political economic philosophy. If in accordance with the axioms of ecological humanities, theories of justice are enlarged to include ecological values then the necessary result is the synthesis of the concerns of ecology with that of political economy: i.e. Political Economic Ecology.

===Energy systems language===
The question of what language can best depict the linear and non-linear causal connections of [[ecosystem|ecological systems]] appears to have been taken up by the school of ecology known as [[systems ecology]]. To depict the linear and non-linear internal relatedness of ecosystems where the laws of thermodynamics hold significant consequences (Hannon et al. 1991: 80), Systems Ecologist H.T. Odum (1994) predicated the [[Energy Systems Language]] on the principles of [[ecological energetics]]. In ecological energetics, just as in ecological humanities, the causal bond between connections is considered an ontic category (see Patten et al. 1976: 460). Moreover, as a result of simulating ecological systems with the energy systems language H.T.Odum make the controversial suggestion that embodied energy could be understood as [[emergy|value]], which in itself is a step into the field of Political Economic Ecology noted above.

'''Edaphic''' is a nature related to [[soil]].  Edaphic qualities may characterize the soil itself, including drainage, [[soil texture|texture]], or [[soil chemistry|chemical properties]] such as [[soil pH]]. Edaphic may also characterize [[organism]]s, such as plant [[Community (ecology)|communities]], where it specifies their relationships with soil. '''Edaphic endemics''' are plants or animals [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to areas of a specific [[soil type]].

Edaphic [[plant communities]] include:
* Sandy soils: plant communities distinct to sandy, acidic, nutrient-poor soils include the tropical [[heath forest]]s and [[restingas]] and temperate [[pine barrens]].
* Ultramafic soils: plant communities distinct to soils derived from magnesium and iron-rich [[ultramafic rock]]s include ultramafic woodlands and ultramafic barrens of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and piedmont, the "wet maquis" of the [[New Caledonia rain forests]], the ultramafic forests of [[Mount Kinabalu]] and other peaks in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[serpentine soil]] plant communities of [[California]].

'''Edging''', '''peaking''', or '''surfing''',&lt;ref name=Bodansky&gt;''Extended Massive Orgasm'', Steve and Vera Bodansky, (2000), pp. 91, 92, 94–98, {{ISBN|0-89793-289-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a orgasm control sexual technique which may be practiced either alone or with a partner and involves the maintenance of a high level of [[sexual arousal]] for an extended period of time without reaching [[Orgasm|climax]].

When practiced by males, orgasm control allows the practitioner to enjoy direct sexual stimulation without waiting through the refractory period common after orgasm. When the decision is made to allow orgasm, the physical sensations may be much greater and more pleasurable than if the orgasm were experienced conventionally. Orgasm control is referenced as 'slow masturbation' in [[Alex Comfort]]'s ''The New Joy of Sex'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;''The New Joy of Sex'', [[Alex Comfort]], (1993), {{ISBN|1-85732-097-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'extended massive orgasm' in Vera and Steve Bodansky's 2000 book of the same name,&lt;ref name=Bodansky/&gt; and is similar to the [[Venus Butterfly]] technique used in the volume ''The One Hour Orgasm'' (1988) by Leah and Bob Schwartz.

Since orgasm control prolongs the experience of powerful sexual sensations occurring during the final build-up to orgasm, the physical demands of being kept or keeping oneself in this highly excited state for an extended time can induce a pleasurable, almost euphoric state.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Orgasm control can involve either [[sex partner]] being in control of the other partner's orgasm, or a person delaying their own orgasm during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with a partner or by [[masturbation]]. To experience orgasm control, any method of [[sexual stimulation]] can be used.

== In partnered sex ==
When shared in sexual activity between partners, one partner would stimulate the other, gradually bringing them up to the point high in the plateau phase where an orgasm is actually building, and will then reduce the level of stimulation to just below that needed to trigger the orgasm. If control of the orgasm is given to a partner and orgasm is not allowed for a time in order to develop an increased level of sexual tension, it is referred to as [[erotic sexual denial]]. By carefully varying the intensity and speed of stimulation, and by practicing with the same partner to learn his or her responses, a person can be held in the highly aroused state near orgasm. This process may be repeated as desired, but at some point repetition may cause the urge to orgasm to become overwhelming. When a partner eventually provides enough stimulation to achieve an orgasm, it may be stronger than usual due to the increased tension and [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] that builds up during the extended stimulation. If the partner whose orgasm is being controlled, sometimes referred to as the [[submissive]] partner, is [[Bondage (sexual)|tied up]], it may better control the orgasm (the activity is sometimes called [[Erotic sexual denial#Tie and tease|tie and tease]] and if orgasm is denied it is [[tease and denial]]). Another possibility is for one partner to help produce [[multiple orgasm]]s in the other.

== In masturbation ==
{{original research|date=November 2010}}
When practiced alone, orgasm control is beneficial for heightening sexual pleasure as well as a training tool which permits the practitioner to increase the duration of sex with a partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} For the female, because there is little or no post-orgasm refractory period, the practitioner can enjoy direct sexual stimulation for longer periods of time, as well as with increased frequency and intensity. For the male, the speed of the rubbing or stroking of the penis may vary to navigate right to the edge of ejaculation. With orgasm control, a male can experience a longer or more intense orgasm, as well as a larger volume of semen expelled during his ejaculation. Because solo masturbation allows for precise control over the feelings, the timing, and the speed of stimulation, many people practice orgasmic control by themselves. One technique, commonly referred to as 'edging', involves masturbating up until the moment before reaching the plateau phase just before orgasm occurs, and then stopping suddenly before experiencing a climax. Another technique, commonly referred to as 'surfing', involves reaching the plateau phase and slowing down the stimulation to maintain a heightened level of sensation for an extended time. Repeating either of these techniques many times during a single masturbation session may result in a stronger, more intense orgasm.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Many individuals{{who|date=January 2014}} assert that orgasm control is more often possible with [[masturbation]]. This is a direct result of the fact that one is then able to control the intensity and duration of stimulation without having to rely on the partner stopping or changing the type of stimulation in order to postpone the orgasm. Masturbation is then the easy way to learn one's limits and could also be seen as the starting point in the technique of orgasm control.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Orgasm control is most easily learned through solitary masturbation, although many individuals enjoy including elements of orgasm control in sex with a partner. Masturbation provides the individual with the opportunity of learning about their bodies and the amount of pleasure they can experience without reaching orgasm. Self-stimulation can help both men and women acknowledge the limits of their body and the techniques that may help them in controlling their orgasms.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As it has been described by Steve Bodansky and Vera Bodansky in ''Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure'', masturbation practiced with the aim of orgasm control must be carried on with the purpose of making every stroke feel exquisite and not to relieve tension, as 'simple' masturbation does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JqiXUjILAlQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=steve+and+orgasm+familiarity#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%205&amp;f=false|title=Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure|date=2000-11-01|accessdate= 2010-07-27|isbn=9780897932899|author1=Bodansky|first1=Steve|last2=Bodansky|first2=Vera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to practice this other type of masturbation, the same authors suggest gradual stimulation of the [[genitals]] and then making connections between the primary area ([[Human penis|penis]] or [[clitoris]]) and the secondary area ([[lip]]s, [[nipple]] or other part of the body that is an [[erogenous zone]]). The connection between the two areas is established once the individual stimulates them with exactly the same moves of the same intensity.

'''Figure of Insensitiveness''' (or ''F of I'') is an inverse scale of measure of the impact sensitivity of an explosive substance.  In this particular context the term 'Insensitiveness' refers to the likelihood of initiation/[[detonation]] by accidental means e.g. impact, friction, electrostatic discharge, application of flame, etc. It is a quantitative measure of the level of stimulus required to cause initiation, typically by shock/impact. 

The Figure of Insensitiveness is determined from impact testing, typically using a drop-weight tower. In this test, a small sample of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which  is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules which will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it.

A reference standard sample of [[RDX]] is currently used to calibrate the drop tower, so that the drop height to produce 50% likelihood of initiation in this material is measured and recorded. The drop height required to initiate other explosives can then be related to the RDX standard, so that a ready comparison of impact sensitiveness between different explosives can be made.  By convention, explosives having a 50% initiation drop height equal to that of RDX are given a F of I of 80.

The scale was originally defined using [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] as the reference standard, with TNT having, by definition, an F of I of exactly 100. On this original scale, RDX yielded an F&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;I of around 80.  Following [[World War II]], when more complex explosive compositions replaced pure TNT as the most common energetic component of weapon systems, RDX was adopted as the reference standard.

Sensitiveness should not be confused with ''Sensitivity'' which is a measure of how easy it is to detonate an explosive, i.e. how sensitive it is to the mode of initiation to achieve a detonation.  In this context an explosive which has greater sensitivity, (like specificity) requires a more specific stimulus in order to detonate it.

'''NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field''' is a [[NASA]] center, located within the cities of [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]] and [[Cleveland]] between [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and the Rocky River Reservation of [[Cleveland Metroparks]], with a subsidiary facility in [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. Its director is Janet L. Kavandi. Glenn Research Center is one of ten major NASA field centers, whose primary mission is to develop science and technology for use in aeronautics and space. {{As of|May 2012}}, it employed about 1,650 civil servants and 1,850 support contractors located on or near its site.

In 2010, the formerly on-site NASA Visitors Center moved to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]] in the [[North Coast Harbor]] area of [[downtown Cleveland]].

==History==
The installation was established in 1942 as part of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) and was later incorporated into the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] as a laboratory for aircraft engine research.

It was first named the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory after funding was approved in June 1940. It was renamed the Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory in 1947, the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (LFPL) in 1948 (after [[George W. Lewis]], the head of NACA from 1919 to 1947), and the NASA Lewis Research Center in 1958.

On March 1, 1999, the center was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. [[John Glenn]] was an American fighter pilot, astronaut, and politician.

As early as 1951, researchers at the LFPL were studying the combustion processes in [[liquid rocket]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntt=tn-2349&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall | title=NACA TN-2349, Fluctuations in a spray formed by two impinging jets | publisher=[[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==

===Plum Brook Field Station===
[[File:GRC PBS B-2 Facility Aerial View.jpg|thumb|right|GRC Plum Brook Station Spacecraft Propulsion Facility (B-2)]]

The {{convert|6400|acre|ha|sing=on}} Plum Brook Field Station near [[Sandusky, Ohio]] is also part of Glenn ({{coord|41|20|59.4|N|82|39|01.8|W|region:US-OH_type:landmark|display=inline}}). It is located about {{convert|50|mi}} from the main campus. It specializes in very large scale tests that would be hazardous on the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/facility.html | title=NASA Glenn Test Facilities | publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226144534/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/facility.html | archivedate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the station consisted of five major facilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-ig-scrutinizes-seldom-used-plum-brook-test-facilities/ | title=NASA IG Scrutinizes Seldom-used Plum Brook Test Facilities | author=Dan Leone | publisher=Spacenews, Inc. | website=spacenews.com | date=April 24, 2015 | accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility: not fully functional
* Combined Effects Chamber: never used and unusable
* Cryogenic Components Laboratory: slated for demolition
* Hypersonic Test Facility
* Space Power Facility

The [[Plum Brook Reactor]] was decontaminated and decommissioned under a 2008 cost-plus-fee contract valued at more than $33.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_C08030_Plum_Brook.html | title=NASA Awards Reactor Decontamination and Decommission Contract | publisher=[[NASA]] | date=May 29, 2008 | accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility====
{{anchor|Spacecraft Propulsion Facility}}
{{main|Space Power Facility}}

The B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility is the world's only facility capable of testing full-scale, upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The Space Power Facility houses the world's largest space environment vacuum chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/plumbrook.html | title=Plum Brook Station | publisher=NASA | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160415/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/plumbrook.html | archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Icing tunnel ===
An icing tunnel is capable of simulating atmospheric icing condition to test the effect of ice accretion on aircraft wings and body as well as to test anti-icing systems for aircraft.

=== Zero Gravity Research Facility ===
{{main|Zero Gravity Research Facility}}
The Zero Gravity Research Facility is a vertical [[vacuum chamber]] used for [[microgravity]] experiments. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985. The facility uses vertical drop tests in a vacuum chamber to investigate the behavior of components, systems, liquids, gases, and combustion in such circumstances.

The facility consists of a concrete-lined shaft, {{convert|28|ft|m}} in diameter, that extends {{convert|510|ft|m}} below ground level. An aluminum vacuum chamber, {{convert|20|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|470|ft|m}} high, is contained within the concrete shaft. The pressure in this vacuum chamber is reduced to 13.3 newtons per square meter (1.3{{e|-4}}atm) before use.

After the closing of the [[Japan Microgravity Centre]] (JAMIC), the NASA Zero-G facility is the largest microgravity facility in the world.

Another, smaller drop tower remains in use. That tower has a free fall time of 2.2 seconds, and the [[Dropping In Microgravity Environment]] (DIME) program is conducted there.

==Significant developments==
===Aeronautics science and technology===
{{unsourced section|date=June 2018}}
NASA Glenn does significant research and technology development on jet engines, producing designs that reduce energy consumption, pollution, and noise. The chevrons it invented for noise reduction appear on many commercial jet engines today, including the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]].

===Space science and technology===
The Glenn Research Center, along with its partners in industry, are credited with the following:
* The [[Rocket propellant|liquid hydrogen]] rocket engine, which [[Wernher von Braun]] credited as being the critical technology leading to the [[Apollo moon landing]]&lt;ref name="Hydrogen"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4404/cover.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029053729/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4404/cover.htm|date=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur upper stage rocket]]&lt;ref name="Hydrogen"/&gt;
* The gridded [[ion thruster]], which is a high-efficiency engine for spaceflight.&lt;ref name="Ion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html | title=Glenn Ion Propulsion Research Tames the Challenges of 21st Century Space Travel | publisher=NASA | date=September 27, 2013 | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915023928/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html | archivedate=September 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Glenn-derived ion engine was used on the successful NASA probe ''[[Deep Space 1]]''.
* The Electrical Power System for [[Space Station Freedom]], which, except for minor modifications, is used on the [[International Space Station]].

==Significant contributions==
===List of core competencies===

NASA Glenn's core competencies are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/aboutgrc.html | title=Shaping the World of Tomorrow | website=nasa.gov | publisher=NASA | accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air-breathing propulsion
* Communications technology and development
* Space propulsion and cryogenic fluids management
* Power, energy storage, and conversion
* Materials and structures for extreme environments

===Education===

The Glenn Research Center is home to the Lewis' Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Program (LERCIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/education/LERCIP_GRC.html | title=USA.gov | publisher=NASA | date=September 29, 2013 | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides internships for high school and college students and high school teachers. The high school program is an eight-week internship for sophomores and juniors with interests in science, technology, engineering, math, or professional administration. The college level consists of a 10-week internship and is open to college students at all levels. Only residents of the Cleveland area are eligible for high school LERCIP, but college LERCIP is open to students nationwide. Interns work closely with their NASA mentors and are involved in the daily activities of the Center. They are expected to be available to work 40 hours a week for the duration of the internship. The LERCIP Teacher program is a 10-week internship for educators in STEM fields.

====Other====
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}
The [[Dropping In Microgravity Environment]] is an annual contest held yearly by the center. Teams of high school students write proposals for experiments to be performed in the Drop Tower. The winners travel to the Center, perform their experiments, and submit a research report to NASA.

==Future of Glenn==
After 2004, NASA had been shifting its focus towards space exploration as mandated by the [[Vision for Space Exploration]]. Because of this, it was perceived by some that regional NASA centers like Glenn, which focus on research and technology, were becoming more and more marginalized in terms of resources and relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/politics/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/opinion/1145090523129980.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Northeast Ohio|publisher=[[Cleveland.com]]|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212626/http://www.cleveland.com/politics/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fopinion%2F1145090523129980.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2013-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on May 13, 2006, it was announced that NASA Glenn Research Center had secured management of the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]'s service module, which promised to generate billions of dollars and hundreds of jobs for the center.  This work secured the center's future in the near term, and signalled a shift in priority for the center from aeronautical research to space exploration, aligning itself closer with NASA's new mission.

Another change of direction created uncertainty in 2010, however, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] declared the end of the Vision for Space Exploration and sought to chart a new course{{clarify|date=November 2010}} for human space flight and NASA.  However, the 2015 budget for NASA made substantial increases to projects in which the Research Center participates, such as aeronautics research, planetary science and space technology, and some of that funding was expected to flow down to the Center.&lt;ref name=CCB2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Soder |first1=Chuck |title=Beefed-up budget is big development for NASA Glenn |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150111/SUB1/301119979/beefed-up-budget-is-big-development-for-nasa-glenn |accessdate=August 12, 2016 |agency=Crain's Cleveland Business |date=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA Glenn Visitor Center==
[[File:Skylab 3 Apollo Command Module.JPG|thumb|The Apollo Command Module of the [[Skylab 3]] mission being moved to the Great Lakes Science Center]]

The NASA Glenn Visitor Center features six galleries with interactive exhibits about NASA, space exploration, John Glenn and other astronauts, satellites and the solar system.  The center also features an auditorium for lectures, movies and special programs, and a gift shop.  Admission is free. Adult visitors must be U.S. citizens and present photo identification.

The NASA Glenn Research Center also offers public tours of its research facilities on the first Saturday of each month. Reservations must be made in advance.

The Visitor Center closed in September 2009 with many displays shifted to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], and new ones created there.  This move was done to reduce the public relations budget and to provide easier access to the general public, especially the under-served community.  It was hoped that putting the displays at the much more visited science center will bring the NASA Glenn facility more public exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/cuyahoga/1247733104222090.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Cleveland Plain Dealer &amp;#124; Cleveland, Ohio Newspaper|publisher=cleveland.com|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616174255/http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fcuyahoga%2F1247733104222090.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, this proved true: compared to the 60,000 visitors per year at its former site, the Glenn Visitor Center enjoyed 330,000 visitors in the first year at the Great Lakes Science Center.  The new display area at the science center is referred to as the Glenn Visitor Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/07/nasa_glenn.html |title=NASA Glenn visitors center offers its exhibits to Great Lakes Science Center |publisher=cleveland.com |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guido of Arezzo''' (also '''Guido Aretinus''', '''Guido Aretino''', '''Guido da Arezzo''', '''Guido Monaco''', '''Guido d'Arezzo''', or '''Guy of Arezzo''' also '''Guy d'Arezzo''') (991/992 – after 1033) was an Italian music theorist of the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] era. He is regarded as the inventor of modern [[musical notation#Early Europe|musical notation]] ([[Staff (music)|staff notation]]) that replaced [[neume|neumatic notation]]. His text, the ''[[Micrologus]]'', was the second most widely distributed treatise on music in the Middle Ages (after the writings of [[Boethius]]).

==Life==
Guido was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] from the Italian city-state of [[Arezzo]]. Recent research has dated his ''Micrologus'' to 1025 or 1026; since Guido stated in a letter that he was thirty-four when he wrote it,&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi"&gt;Stuart Lyons, ''Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi with Full Verse Translation of the Odes''. Oxford: Aris &amp; Phillips, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-85668-790-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his birthdate is presumed to be around 991 or 992. His early career was spent at the [[Pomposa Abbey|monastery of Pomposa]], on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast near [[Ferrara]]. While there, he noted the difficulty that singers had in remembering [[Gregorian chant]]s.

He came up with a method for teaching the singers to learn chants in a short time, and quickly became famous throughout north Italy. However, he attracted the hostility of the other monks at the abbey, prompting him to move to Arezzo, a town which had no abbey, but which did have a large group of cathedral singers, whose training [[Tedald (Bishop of Arezzo)|Bishop Tedald]] invited him to conduct.

While at Arezzo, he developed new techniques for teaching, such as staff notation and the use of the "ut–re–mi–fa–so–la" ([[Solfège|do–re–mi–fa–so–la]]) [[mnemonic]] ([[solmization]]). The ut–re–mi-fa-so-la syllables are taken from the initial syllables of each of the first six half-lines of the first stanza of the [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', whose text is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]] (though the musical line either shares a common ancestor with the earlier setting of [[Horace]]'s "[[:la:s:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|Ode to Phyllis]]" (''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' 4.11), recorded in the Montpellier manuscript H425, or may have been taken from it).&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi" /&gt;  [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] is known for having changed the name of note "Ut" (C), renaming it "Do" (in the "Do Re Mi ..." sequence known as [[solfège]]).&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh note, "Si" (from the initials for "Sancte Iohannes," Latin for St. John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale.&lt;ref&gt; Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 271–7). {{ISBN|978-0-19-520912-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-19-820171-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In anglophone countries, "Si" was changed to "Ti" by [[Sarah Glover]] in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might [[Tonic sol-fa|begin with a different letter]] (this also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp). "Ti" is used in [[tonic sol-fa]] and in the song "[[Do-Re-Mi]]".

The ''Micrologus'', written at the cathedral at Arezzo and dedicated to Tedald, contains Guido's teaching method as it had developed by that time. Soon it had attracted the attention of [[Pope John XIX]], who invited Guido to Rome. Most likely he went there in 1028, but he soon returned to Arezzo, due to his poor health. It was then that he announced in a letter to Michael of Pomposa ("{{Lang|la|Epistola de ignoto cantu|italic=no}}") his discovery of the "ut–re–mi" musical mnemonic. Little is known of him after this time.

==The Guidonian hand==
Guido is credited with the invention of the [[Guidonian hand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11968 Claude V. Palisca and Dolores Pesce: "Guido of Arezzo [Aretinus&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"]. ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', 11 February 2013. Accessed 11 February 2018. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26154 "Solmization"] by Andrew Hughes and Edith Gerson-Kiwi, ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; a widely used mnemonic system where note names are mapped to parts of the human hand. However, only a rudimentary form of the Guidonian hand is actually described by Guido, and the fully elaborated system of natural, hard, and soft [[hexachord]]s cannot be securely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Theory, Theorists, §5: Early Middle Ages", ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, a development in teaching and learning music in a more efficient manner had arisen. Guido of Arezzo's alleged development of the Guidonian hand, more than a hundred years after his death, allowed for musicians to label a specific joint or fingertip with the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]] (also referred to as the hexachord in the modern era).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=Bonnie Blackburn certainly does not make this outrageous claim. Who in the modern era confuses a six-note system with a twenty-note one?}} Using specific joints of the hand and fingertips transformed the way one would learn and memorize solmization syllables. Not only did the Guidonian hand become a standard use in preparing music in the 12th century, its popularity grew more widespread well into the 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie J. Blackburn, "[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/17205 Lusitano, Vicente]", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge and use of the Guidonian hand would allow a musician to simply transpose, identify intervals, and aid in use of notation and the creation of new music. Musicians were able to sing and memorize longer sections of music and counterpoint during performances and the amount of time spent diminished dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Michael Randel]], "Guido of Arezzo", ''The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1996): 339–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A monument to him was erected in his native Arezzo. He is one of the famous Tuscans honored by a statue in the [[Loggiato of the Uffizi]] in Florence. 

The [[Scorewriter|computer music notation]] system [[GUIDO music notation]] is named after him and his invention.

The "International Guido d'Arezzo Polyphonic Contest" (Concorso Polifónico Guido d'Arezzo) is named after him.

[[Francisco Valls]]' controversial ''Missa Scala Aretina'' took its name from Guido Aretinus' scale.

'''Health Systems Engineering''' or '''Health Engineering''' (often known as "Health Care Systems Engineering (HCSE)") is an academic and a pragmatic discipline that approaches the [[health care]] industry, and other industries connected with health care delivery, as [[complex adaptive system]]s, and identifies and applies engineering design and analysis principles in such areas. This can overlap with [[biomedical engineering]] which focuses on design and development of various medical products; [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]] which involve improving organizational operations; and various health care practice fields like [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], etc.  Other fields participating in this interdisciplinary area include [[public health]], [[information technology]], [[management]] studies, and regulatory [[law]].

People whose work implicates this field in some capacity can include members of all the above-noted fields, many of which have sub-fields targeted toward health care matters even if health or health care is not a principal focus of the overall field (e.g. management, law). Areas of [[biomedical engineering]] (BME) in this area often include [[clinical engineering]] (sometimes also called "hospital engineering") as well as those BMEs developing [[medical devices]] and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.  The [[industrial engineering]] (IE) principles employed tend to include optimization, decision analysis, [[human factors engineering]], quality engineering, and value engineering.

'''''Heracles’ Bow''''' is a collection of ten essays, written by [[James Boyd White]] in 1985, that examine [[forensic rhetoric]] as it creates community, as an example of what White calls [[constitutive rhetoric]].  White supported the [[Law and literature|Law and Literature Movement]]. This movement was in contradiction to two other movements of the 1970/80s: [[Law and economics]] and [[critical legal studies|Critical Legal Studies (CLS)]], holding that a scientific view of law left little room to examine the rhetoric of written and spoken law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard A. “Law and Literature: A Relation Reargued.” Virginia Law Review 72.8 (1986): 1351-1392. JSTOR. Web. 23. April. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content Summary==

In ''Heracles' Bow: Persuasion and Community in Philoctetes'',  through an analysis of the ancient Greek play [[Philoctetes]], distinguishes between two methods of persuasion, dolos (deceitful persuasion) and peitho (genuine statements made for the purpose of forming community).  White compares using rhetoric on another person as a [[means-to-an-end]] against viewing the person as an [[end-in-itself]].  He relates this to the teaching of law through a discussion of methods that an attorney should use in the art of persuading others.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;White, James Boyd. Heracles' Bow: Essays on the Rhetoric and Poetics of the Law. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In, ''Rhetoric and Law: The Arts of Cultural and Communal Life'', White compares two definitions of law: his own, which is that law is a branch of rhetoric, and the traditional view of law as institutional authority.  He outlines three elements specific and necessary to legal rhetoric: first, that lawyers need to speak the language of their [[audience]], or that law is culture-specific; second, that law is always a creative performance; and third, that legal rhetoric contains an ethical identity, or [[ethos]].&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

''The Study of Law as an Intellectual Activity'', originally a lecture given to a class of first-year law students, outlines how learning law is not simply memorizing a set of rules. White claims that, in learning law, it is imperative that students first identify their own ethos to become effective practitioners.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

In ''The Invisible Discourse of the Law'', originally a lecture given to educators on writing, White argues that [[legal language]] is difficult to understand because the law is generalized and non-specific.  These characteristics mean that legal language is always subject to the interpretation of the reader, thus creating a rhetorical situation.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

White contends in ''Reading Law and Reading Literature'' that law is a language and a lawyer must also operate as a [[literary critic]]. He explains how law is its own form of language, which means that it is subject to open interpretation. The language of the law creates a [[legal culture]] just as spoken languages have cultures associated with them.  A lawyer must use good judgment in interpreting the law just as individuals use good judgment in interpreting how to speak to one another.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

In ''The Judicial Opinion and the Poem'' White examines how reading poems and cases during his legal training enforced his belief that the practice of law is an art, and one can use this training to discover Truth.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

In the next essay, White reasons that it is impossible for a narrative to exclude the author’s values, no matter how factual it may be.  Using [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbons]]’ [[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]] as an example, he illustrates how the form, syntax, and presentation of any writing necessarily shape the way a reader receives the facts. As a result, the opinion of the reader is shaped by the opinion of the writer.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

''Telling Stories in the Law and Ordinary Life'' explores how legal stories take root in the stories told by [[Layperson|laypeople]] in social situations. He argues that it is impossible to tell a story in the language of the law without relying on a non-legal situation.

Does [[criminal law]] make sense as a system of meaning? White seeks to answer that question through an examination of the purpose of criminal law, which he concludes to be placing blame. He examines the rhetoric of criminal law in order to identify its true audience.

In the last essay, White constructs his own [[Socratic dialogue]] to determine whether the ancient [[Platonian]] argument of rhetoric vs. dialectic can be applied to modern law. He argues that today’s attorneys are a modern day version of Plato's "[[Gorgias]]" and concludes with the importance of maintaining ethics in the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt;

==Scholarly Review==

[[David D. Cole|David Cole]] argues that White’s view and the [[Critical legal studies|CLS]] are not that different; both are built on [[ideology]]. Cole criticizes White for relying too much on law as an end in itself, and failing to address the practical application of tangible, [[codified law]].&lt;ref&gt;Cole, David. "Against Literalism." Stanford Law Review 40.2 (1988): 545-60. JSTOR. Web. 25 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Richard Weisberg|Weisberg]]’s main criticism of ''Heracles’ Bow'' is that White’s explanation remains too abstract. He contends that White does not express any knowledge of the actual law or the application thereof. Weisburg argues that White relies on law too much as a function of pure rhetoric, and that he ignores the scientific aspect of the discipline. This is a common criticism of the [[Law and literature|Law and Literature Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, Richard H. "Law and Rhetoric." Michigan Law Review 85.5/6 (1987): 920-29. JSTOR. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Kahn]] claims that White’s view of the law ignores the relationship of law and inequality. She criticizes his work for its lack of explaining how the rhetoric of law is applied to different genders, races, and classes in different ways. She argues that seeing law simply as a [[rhetorical situation]] ignores the real-life power struggles within the application of law to society.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Victoria. “Rhetoric and the Law.” The Johns Hopkins University Press 19.2 (1989): 21-34. JSTOR. Web. 23. April. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herd behavior''' describes how individuals in a group can act collectively without centralized direction. The term can refer to the [[behavior]] of animals in [[herd]]s, [[Pack (canine)|packs]], [[bird flock]]s, [[fish school]]s and so on, as well as the behavior of humans in demonstrations, [[riots]] and [[general strikes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braha | first1 = D | year = 2012 | title = Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 10| page = e48596 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048596 | pmid=23119067 | pmc=3485346}}&lt;/ref&gt; sporting events, religious gatherings, episodes of mob violence and everyday decision-making, judgement and opinion-forming.

Raafat, Chater and Frith proposed an integrated approach to herding, describing two key issues, the mechanisms of transmission of thoughts or behavior between individuals and the patterns of connections between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raafat |first=R. M. |last2=Chater |first2=N. |last3=Frith |first3=C. |title=Herding in humans |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2009 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=420–428 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that bringing together diverse theoretical approaches of herding behavior illuminates the applicability of the concept to many domains, ranging from cognitive neuroscience to economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=C. J. |last2=Tobler |first2=P. N. |last3=Schultz |first3=W. |last4=Baddeley |first4=M. |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00048 |title=Striatal BOLD response reflects the impact of herd information on financial decisions |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |year=2010 |volume=4 |page=48 |pmid=20589242 |pmc=2892997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Stereoscopic-motion-analysis-in-densely-packed-clusters-3D-analysis-of-the-shimmering-behaviour-in-1742-9994-8-3-S1.ogv|thumb|[[Shimmering behaviour]] of ''[[Apis dorsata]]'' (giant honeybees)]]
A group of animals fleeing from a predator shows the nature of herd behavior. In 1971, in the oft cited article "Geometry For The Selfish Herd", [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. D. Hamilton]] asserted that each individual group member reduces the danger to itself by moving as close as possible to the center of the fleeing group. Thus the herd appears as a unit in moving together, but its function emerges from the uncoordinated behavior of self-serving individuals.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=W. D. |last=Hamilton |year=1971 |title=Geometry for the Selfish Herd |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=295–311 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5 |pmid=5104951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry-breaking==
Asymmetric aggregation of animals under panic conditions has been observed in many species, including humans, mice, and ants.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0401/0401124.pdf|title= Panic-induced symmetry breaking in escaping ants|first1=E.|last1=Altshuler|first2=O.|last2=Ramos|first3=Y.|last3=Nuñez|first4=J.|last4=Fernández|location=[[University of Havana]], [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical models have demonstrated symmetry-breaking similar to observations in empirical studies. For example, when panicked individuals are confined to a room with two equal and equidistant exits, a majority will favor one exit while the minority will favor the other.

Possible mechanisms for this behavior include [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]’s [[selfish herd theory]], neighbor copying, or the byproduct of communication by social animals or runaway positive feedback.

Characteristics of escape panic include:

* Individuals attempt to move faster than normal.
* Interactions between individuals become physical.
* Exits become arched and clogged.
* Escape is slowed by fallen individuals serving as obstacles.
* Individuals display a tendency towards mass or copied behavior.
* Alternative or less used exits are overlooked.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = E. | last2 = Ramos | first2 = O. | last3 = Núñez | first3 = Y. | last4 = Fernández | first4 = J. | last5 = Batista-Leyva | first5 = A.

==In human societies==
The philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were among the first to criticize what they referred to as "the crowd" (Kierkegaard) and "herd morality" and the "herd instinct" (Nietzsche) in human society. Modern [[psychology|psychological]] and [[economics|economic]] research has identified herd behavior in humans to explain the phenomenon of large numbers of people acting in the same way at the same time. The British surgeon [[Wilfred Trotter]] popularized the "herd behavior" phrase in his book, ''[[Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War]]'' (1914). In ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'', [[Thorstein Veblen]] explained economic behavior in terms of social influences such as "emulation," where some members of a group mimic other members of higher status. In "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (1903), early sociologist [[George Simmel]] referred to the "impulse to sociability in man", and sought to describe "the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a 'society'&amp;nbsp;". Other social scientists explored behaviors related to herding, such as [[Sigmund Freud]] (crowd psychology), [[Carl Jung]] (collective unconscious), [[Everett Dean Martin]] (Behavior of Crowds) and [[Gustave Le Bon]] (the popular mind).
[[Swarm theory]] observed in non-human societies is a related concept and is being explored as it occurs in human society.

===Stock market bubbles===
Large stock market trends often begin and end with periods of frenzied buying (bubbles) or selling (crashes). Many observers cite these episodes as clear examples of herding behavior that is irrational and driven by emotion—greed in the bubbles, fear in the crashes. Individual investors join the crowd of others in a rush to get in or out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus K. Brunnermeier]], [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/Business/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198296980 Asset ''Pricing under Asymmetric Information: Bubbles, Crashes, Technical Analysis, and Herding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102846/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/Business/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198296980 |date=2007-09-29 }}, Oxford University Press (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some followers of the [[technical analysis]] school of investing see the herding behavior of investors as an example of extreme [[market sentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Prechter, ''The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior'', New Classics Library (1999), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic study of [[behavioral finance]] has identified herding in the collective irrationality of investors, particularly the work of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates [[Vernon L. Smith]], [[Amos Tversky]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], and [[Robert Shiller]].&lt;ref name=Shiller2000&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Shiller |title=Irrational Exuberance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djq5RWiUN6oC&amp;printsec=frontcover |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |pages=149–153 |isbn= |accessdate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

Hey and Morone (2004) analyzed a model of herd behavior in a market context. Their work is related to at least two important strands of literature. The first of these strands is that on herd behavior in a non-market context. The seminal references are [[Abhijit Banerjee|Banerjee]] (1992) and Bikhchandani, [[David Hirshleifer|Hirshleifer]] and [[Ivo Welch|Welch]] (1992), both of which showed that herd behavior may result from private information not publicly shared. More specifically, both of these papers showed that individuals, acting sequentially on the basis of private information and public knowledge about the behavior of others, may end up choosing the socially undesirable option. The second of the strands of literature motivating this paper is that of information aggregation in market contexts. A very early reference is the classic paper by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) that showed that uninformed traders in a market context can become informed through the price in such a way that private information is aggregated correctly and efficiently. In this strand of the literature, the most commonly used empirical methodologies to test for herding toward the average, are the works of Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). Overall, it was shown that it is possible to observe herd-type behavior in a market context. The results refer to a market with a well-defined fundamental value. Even if herd behavior might only be observed rarely, this has important consequences for a whole range of real markets – most particularly foreign exchange markets.

One such herdish incident was the price volatility that surrounded the [[Uranium bubble of 2007|2007 Uranium bubble]], which started with flooding of the [[Cigar Lake Mine]] in [[Saskatchewan]], during the year 2006.&lt;ref name=NuclearMarketReview2012&gt;{{citation |date=8 June 2012 |author=In Focus article |title=Reproduced article from Nuclear Market Review|chapter=WNFM: A Focus on Fundamentals One Year After Fukushima |publisher=TradeTech |chapter-url=http://www.uranium.info/market_analyses.php |accessdate=4 March 2013 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are several reproduced In Focus articles on this page.

===In crowds===
{{Main|Crowd psychology}}
Crowds that gather on behalf of a grievance can involve herding behavior that turns violent, particularly when confronted by an opposing ethnic or racial group. The [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[New York Draft Riots]] and [[Tulsa Race Riot]] are notorious in U.S. history. The idea of a "group mind" or "mob behavior" was put forward by the [[France|French]] social psychologists [[Gabriel Tarde]] and [[Gustave Le Bon]].

===Everyday decision-making===
"Benign" herding behaviors may occur frequently in everyday decisions based on learning from the information of others, as when a person on the street decides which of two restaurants to dine in. Suppose that both look appealing, but both are empty because it is early evening; so at random, this person chooses restaurant A. Soon a couple walks down the same street in search of a place to eat. They see that restaurant A has customers while B is empty, and choose A on the assumption that having customers makes it the better choice. Because other passersby do the same thing into the evening, restaurant A does more business that night than B. This phenomenon is also referred as an [[information cascade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Abhijit V. |last=Banerjee |year=1992 |title=A Simple Model of Herd Behavior |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=797–817 |doi=10.2307/2118364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sushil |last=Bikhchandani |authorlink2=David Hirshleifer |first2=David |last2=Hirshleifer |authorlink3=Ivo Welch |first3=Ivo |last3=Welch |year=1992 |title=A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=992–1026 |doi=10.1086/261849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Froot | first1 = K | last2 = Schaferstein | first2 = DS | last3 = Jeremy Stein | first3 = J | year = 1992 | title = Herd on the street: Informational inefficiencies in a market with short-term speculation | url = http://www.people.hbs.edu/kfroot/oldwebsite/cvpaperlinks/herd_on_the_street.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Finance | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1461–1484 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirshleifer | first1 = D | last2 = Teoh | first2 = SH | year = 2003 | title = Herd behaviour and cascading in capital markets: A review and synthesis | url = http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/5186/1/MPRA_paper_5186.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Financial Management | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 25–66 | doi = 10.1111/1468-036X.00207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In marketing ==
Herd behavior is often a useful tool in [[marketing]] and, if used properly, can lead to increases in sales and changes to the [[Social structure|structure of society]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Whilst it has been shown that financial incentives cause action in large numbers of people, herd mentality often wins out in a case of "Keeping up with the Joneses".

=== In brand and product success ===
Communications technologies have contributed to the proliferation to [[consumer choice]] and "the power of crowds",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Chen|first = Yi-Fen|date = 2008-09-01|title = Herd behavior in purchasing books online|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563207001458|journal = Computers in Human Behavior|series = Including the Special Issue: Internet Empowerment|volume = 24|issue = 5|pages = 1977–1992|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2007.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers increasingly have more access to opinions and information from both [[opinion leader]]s and formers on platforms that have largely [[user-generated content]], and thus have more tools with which to complete any [[decision-making]] process. [[Popularity]] is seen as an indication of better quality, and consumers will use the opinions of others posted on these platforms as a powerful compass to guide them towards products and brands that align with their preconceptions and the decisions of others in their [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lessig|first = V|date = 1977|title = Students and Housewives: Differences in Susceptibility to Reference Group Influence|url =|journal = Journal of Consumer Research|doi =10.1086/208685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account differences in needs and their position in the [[socialization]] process, Lessig &amp; Park examined groups of students and housewives and the influence that these reference groups have on one another. By way of herd mentality, students tended to encourage each other towards beer, hamburger and cigarettes, whilst [[housewives]] tended to encourage each other towards furniture and detergent. Whilst this particular study was done in 1977, one cannot discount its findings in today's society. A study done by Burke, Leykin, Li and Zhang in 2014 on the [[social influence]] on shopper behavior shows that shoppers are influenced by direct interactions with companions, and as a group size grows, herd behaviour becomes more apparent. Discussions that create excitement and interest have greater impact on touch frequency and purchase likelihood grows with greater involvement caused by a large group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Zhang|first = Xiaoling|last2 = Li|first2 = Shibo|last3 = Burke|first3 = Raymond R.|last4 = Leykin|first4 = Alex|date = 2014-05-13|title = An Examination of Social Influence on Shopper Behavior Using Video Tracking Data|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.12.0106|journal = Journal of Marketing|volume = 78|issue = 5|pages = 24–41|doi = 10.1509/jm.12.0106|issn = 0022-2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoppers in this Midwestern American shopping outlet were monitored and their purchases noted, and it was found up to a point, potential customers preferred to be in stores which had moderate levels of traffic. The other people in the store not only served as company, but also provided an inference point on which potential customers could model their behavior and make [[purchase decision]]s, as with any reference group or community.

[[Social media]] can also be a powerful tool in perpetuating herd behaviour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Its immeasurable amount of user-generated content serves as a platform for opinion leaders to take the stage and influence purchase decisions, and recommendations from peers and evidence of positive online experience all serve to help consumers make purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dhar|first = Joydip|last2 = Jha|first2 = Abhishek Kumar|date = 2014-10-03|title = Analyzing Social Media Engagement and its Effect on Online Product Purchase Decision Behavior|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2013.876376|journal = Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume = 24|issue = 7|pages = 791–798|doi = 10.1080/10911359.2013.876376|issn = 1091-1359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunawan and Huarng's 2015 study concluded that social influence is essential in [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] attitudes towards brands, which in turn leads to purchase intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gunawan|first = Dedy Darsono|last2 = Huarng|first2 = Kun-Huang|date = 2015-11-01|title = Viral effects of social network and media on consumers' purchase intention|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315002325|journal = Journal of Business Research|volume = 68|issue = 11|pages = 2237–2241|doi = 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influencers form norms which their peers are found to follow, and targeting [[extrovert]]ed personalities increases chances of purchase even further.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because the stronger personalities tend to be more engaged on consumer platforms and thus spread word of mouth information more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Cheung|first = Christy M. K.|last2 = Xiao|first2 = Bo Sophia|last3 = Liu|first3 = Ivy L. B.|date = 2014-09-01|title = Do actions speak louder than voices?

=== In social marketing ===
Marketing can easily transcend beyond commercial roots, in that it can be used to encourage [[activism|action]] to do with health, [[environmentalism]] and general society. Herd mentality often takes a front seat when it comes to [[social marketing]], paving the way for [[Civil society campaign|campaign]]s such as [[Earth Day]], and the variety of anti-smoking and anti-obesity campaigns seen in every country. Within cultures and communities, marketers must aim to influence opinion leaders who in turn influence each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = James M. Cronin|last2 = Mary B. McCarthy|date = 2011-07-12|title = Preventing game over: A study of the situated food choice influences within the videogames subculture|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/20426761111141887|journal = Journal of Social Marketing|volume = 1|issue = 2|pages = 133–153|doi = 10.1108/20426761111141887|issn = 2042-6763}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is the herd mentality of any group of people that ensures a social campaign's success. A campaign run by Som la Pera in Spain to combat teenage obesity found that campaigns run in schools are more effective due to influence of teachers and peers, and students' high visibility, and their interaction with one another. Opinion leaders in schools created the logo and branding for the campaign, built content for social media and led in-school presentations to engage audience interaction. It was thus concluded that the success of the campaign was rooted in the fact that its means of communication was the audience itself, giving the target audience a sense of ownership and empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lozano|first = Natàlia|last2 = Prades|first2 = Jordi|last3 = Montagut|first3 = Marta|date = 2015-10-01|title = Som la Pera: How to develop a social marketing and public relations campaign to prevent obesity among teenagers in Catalonia|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/cjcs/2015/00000007/00000002/art00009?token=00531b149b5bd549bde7e41225f4038382c2b672148783b774450576b34272c5f7b3d6d3f4e4b34f5a7|journal = Catalan Journal of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 251–259|doi = 10.1386/cjcs.7.2.251_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, students exert a high level of influence over one another, and by encouraging stronger personalities to lead opinions, the organizers of the campaign were able to secure the attention of other students who identified with the reference group.

Herd behaviour not only applies to students in schools where they are highly visible, but also amongst communities where perceived action plays a strong role. Between 2003 and 2004, California State University carried out a study to measure household [[energy saving|conservation of energy]], and motivations for doing so. It was found that factors like saving the environment, saving money or [[social responsibility]] did not have as great an impact on each household as the perceived behaviour of their neighbours did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nolan|first = Jessica M.|last2 = Schultz|first2 = P. Wesley|last3 = Cialdini|first3 = Robert B.|last4 = Goldstein|first4 = Noah J.|last5 = Griskevicius|first5 = Vladas|date = 2008-07-01|title = Normative Social Influence is Underdetected|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/34/7/913|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language = en|volume = 34|issue = 7|pages = 913–923|doi = 10.1177/0146167208316691|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 18550863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the financial incentives of saving money, closely followed by moral incentives of protecting the environment, are often thought of as being a community's greatest guiding compass, more households responded to the encouragement to save energy when they were told that 77% of their neighbours were using fans instead of air conditioning, proving that communities are more likely to engage in a behaviour if they think that everyone else is already taking part.

Herd behaviours shown in the two examples exemplify that it can be a powerful tool in social marketing, and if harnessed correctly, has the potential to achieve great change. It is clear that opinion leaders and their influence achieve huge reach among their reference groups and thus can be used as the loudest voices to encourage others in any collective direction.

'''ICAD''' (Corporate history: ICAD, Inc., Concentra (name change at IPO in 1995), KTI (name change in 1998), Dassault Systemes (purchase in 2001) (&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ds-kti.com/our_products/icad.shtml The ICAD System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041122204622/http://www.ds-kti.com/our_products/icad.shtml |date=November 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[knowledge-based engineering]] (KBE) system that enables users to encode design knowledge using a semantic representation that can be evaluated for [[Parasolid]] output. ICAD has an open architecture that can utilize all the power and flexibility of the underlying language.

KBE, as implemented via ICAD, received a lot of attention due to the remarkable results that appeared to take little effort.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} ICAD allowed one example of [[end-user computing]] that in a sense is unparalleled. Most ICAD developers were degreed engineers. Systems developed by ICAD users were non-trivial and consisted of highly complicated code. In the sense of [[end-user computing]], ICAD was the first to allow the power of a domain tool to be in the hands of the user, at the same time being open to allow extensions as identified and defined by the domain expert or [[subject-matter expert]] (SME).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

A COE article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Switlik |first1=John |title=Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE): Update |url=http://legacy.coe.org/newsnet/Oct05/index.cfm |website=coe.org |publisher=COE |access-date=6 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324223121/http://legacy.coe.org/newsnet/Oct05/index.cfm |archive-date=24 March 2012 |date=October–November 2005 |dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the resulting explosion of expectations (see [[AI winter]]), which were not sustainable. However, such a bubble burst does not diminish the existence of ability that would exist were expectations and use reasonable or properly managed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==History==
The original implementation of ICAD was on a [[Lisp machine]] ([[Symbolics]]). Some of the principals involved with the development were Larry Rosenfeld,&lt;ref name="glengaryllc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glengaryllc.com/Our-Team/Partner-Directory.aspx?id=22 |publisher=glengaryllc.com |title=Welcome to Glengary LLC – Partner Directory &amp;#124; Larry Rosenfeld, ICAD Founder |access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avrum Belzer, Patrick M. O'Keefe, Philip Greenspun, and David F. Place. The time frame was 1984–85.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Greenspun]]'s [http://philip.greenspun.com/narcissism/resume resume]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Greenspun]]'s List of [http://philip.greenspun.com/narcissism/resume-list Engineering Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

ICAD started on special-purpose Symbolics Lisp hardware and was then ported to [[Unix]] when [[Common Lisp]] became portable to general-purpose workstations.

The original domain for ICAD was [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical design]] with many application successes. However, ICAD has found use in other domains, such as [[Electrical engineering|electrical design]], shape modeling, etc. An example project could be wind tunnel design or the development of a support tool for aircraft multidisciplinary design.&lt;ref&gt;Bermell-Garcia, P. et al () [http://www.gid.uji.es/sites/default/files/congresos/2006_ant/A%20KBE%20System%20for%20the%20design%20of%20wind%20tunnel%20models%20using%20reusable%20knowledge%20components.pdf A KBE System for the design of wind tunnel models using reusable knowledge components]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tudelft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=f1030549-cee5-4197-a4b0-2197fe671949&amp;lang=en&amp;binary=/doc/KBEtoFEmodelGen-Rocca.pdf |publisher=lr.tudelft.nl |title=A modular reconfigurable software tool to support distributed multidisciplinary design and optimization of complex products |access-date=11 April 2017}}{{dead link |date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanleyknutson.com/kbe-history.html Stanley Knutson], ICAD Chief Scientist&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples can be found in the presentations at the annual IIUG (International ICAD Users Group) that have been published in the [http://www.ds-kti.com/the_kti_vault/events.shtml KTI Vault]{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (1999 through 2002).&lt;ref name="tudelft2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=f1030549-cee5-4197-a4b0-2197fe671949&amp;lang=en&amp;binary=/doc/2002_5447-Gianfranco.pdf|publisher=lr.tudelft.nl|title=The last ICAD application to receive the KBE Innovation Award at the 2002 IIUG conference in Boston |access-date=11 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing and Airbus used ICAD extensively to develop various components in the 1990s and early 21st century.

As of 2003, ICAD was featured strongly in several areas as evidenced by the [http://www.ds-kti.com/the_kti_vault/2002_ppt/Product-Vision-and-Roadmap-Overview-for-IIUG-2002.ppt Vision &amp; Strategy Product Vision and Strategy]{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} presentation. After 2003, ICAD use diminished. At the end of 2001, the KTI Company faced financial difficulties and laid off most of its best staff. They were eventually bought out by Dassault who effectively scuppered the ICAD product. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20060619194319/http://www.coe.org/newsnet/may03/icadnews.cfm IIUG at COE, 2003] (first meeting due to Dassault by KTI)

The ICAD system was very expensive, relatively, and was in the price range of high-end systems. Market dynamics couldn't support this as there may not have been sufficient differentiating factors between ICAD and the lower-end systems (or the promises from Dassault). KTI was absorbed by Dassault Systemes and ICAD is no longer considered the go-forward tool for knowledge-based engineering (KBE) applications by that company. Dassault Systemes is promoting a suite of tools oriented around version 5 of their popular CATIA CAD application, with Knowledgeware the replacement for ICAD.

{{As of|2005}}, things were still a bit unclear. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050205213112/http://ds-kti.com/latest_news/index.shtml ICAD 8.3] was delivered.
The recent COE Aerospace Conference had a discussion about the futures of KBE. One issue involves the stacking of 'meta' issues within a computer model. How this is resolved, whether by more icons or the availability of an external language, remains to be seen.

The [http://www.genworks.com Genworks GDL] product (including kernel technology from [https://github.com/genworks/gendl the Gendl Project]) is the nearest functional equivalent to ICAD currently available.

==Particulars==
ICAD provided a declarative language (IDL) using New [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]] (never converted to [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS)) that supported a mechanism for relating parts (defpart) via a hierarchical set of relationships. Technically, the ICAD Defpart was a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] macro; the ICAD defpart list was a set of generic classes that can be instantiated with specific properties depending upon what was represented. This defpart list was extendible via composited parts that represented domain entities. Along with the part-subpart relations, ICAD supported generic relations via the object modeling abilities of Lisp.

Example applications of ICAD range from a small collection of defparts that represents a part or component to a larger collection that represents an assembly. In terms of power, an ICAD system, when fully specified, can generate thousands of instances of parts on a major assembly design.

One example of an application driving thousands of instances of parts is that of an aircraft wing – where fastener type and placement may number in the thousands, each instance requiring evaluation of several factors driving the design parameters.

==Futures (KBE, etc.)==
One role for ICAD may be serving as the defining prototype for KBE which would require that we know more about what occurred the past 15 years (much information is tied up behind corporate firewalls and under proprietary walls). With the rise of [[functional programming]] languages (an example is [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) in the markets, perhaps some of the power attributable to [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] may be replicated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2124">The '''Information Security Automation Program''' ('''ISAP''', pronounced “I Sap”) is a U.S. government multi-agency initiative to enable automation and standardization of technical security operations. While a U.S. government initiative, its standards based design can benefit all information technology security operations. The ISAP high level goals include standards based automation of security checking and remediation as well as automation of technical compliance activities (e.g. [[FISMA]]). ISAP’s low level objectives include enabling standards based communication of vulnerability data, customizing and managing configuration baselines for various IT products, assessing information systems and reporting compliance status, using standard metrics to weight and aggregate potential vulnerability impact, and remediating identified vulnerabilities.

ISAP’s technical specifications are contained in the related [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP). ISAP’s security automation content is either contained within, or referenced by, the [[National Vulnerability Database]]. 

ISAP is being formalized through a trilateral memorandum of agreement (MOA) between [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA), the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).  The [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD) also participates and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) funds the operation infrastructure on which ISAP relies (i.e., the National Vulnerability Database).

'''Islamic hygienical jurisprudence''' includes a number of regulations involving cleanliness during [[Salah|''salat'']] (obligatory prayer) through [[Wudu]] and [[Ghusl]], as well as [[Islamic dietary laws|dietary laws]] and [[Islamic toilet etiquette|toilet etiquette]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. The ''fiqh'' is based on admonitions in the [[Qur'an]] for Muslims to be ritually clean whenever possible, as well as in [[Hadith|hadith]] (words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). 

Cleanliness is an important part of Islam, including Qur'anic verses that teach how to achieve [[Ritual purification|ritual cleanliness]]. Keeping [[oral hygiene]] through cleaning the [[Tooth|teeth]] with the use of a form of [[toothbrush]] called [[miswak]] is considered [[sunnah]], the way of Prophet [[Muhammad]]. Ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is also very important, as observed by the practices of [[wudu]] (partial ablution), [[ghusl]] (full ablution), and [[tayammum]] (water-free alternative using any natural surface such as rock, sand, or dust). 

In Muslim countries, bathrooms are often equipped with a [[Muslim shower]] situated next to the toilet, so that individuals may wash themselves properly. This [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is required in order to maintain ritual cleanliness.  The common Muslims practice of taking off shoes when entering mosques and homes is also based on ritual cleanliness.

==Islamic cleanliness and hygiene==
[[Sunni Islam]] has its own hygienical jurisprudence. It is preferable for a Sunni Muslim to remove the hair directly below the navel and under the arms also as trimming the nails once a week. Leaving hair and nails is permissible after 15 days and disliked after 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunnah.com/urn/204970|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification  - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best day for removing needless hair and cutting nails is Friday. It is permissible to use shaving cream to remove needless hair. Needless hair and nails should be buried to prevent illnesses from spreading. Cutting [[eyebrow]]s is permissible if they are too long. Sunni women should put their nails and hair removed from the head, below the navel and under the arms in a place where no non-permissible man can see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sunnah of Trimming Hair / Nails - ZIKR|url = http://www.zikr.co.uk/content/view/69/110/|website = www.zikr.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal grooming]] is also a matter of focus in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9037|title=Ruling on trimming hair|work=Islam QA|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing a [[beard]] to grow while trimming the moustache is emphasized with it being seen as [[Fard|mandatory]] by all respected Sunni scholars from the four major Sunni [[Madh'hab]].

==Islamic dietary laws==
{{Main|Islamic dietary laws}}
'''Islamic dietary laws''' provide a set of rules as to what Muslims eat in their diet. These rules specify the food that is '''[[halal|halāl]]''', meaning lawful. They are found in Qur'an, the holy book of [[Islam]], usually detailing what is unlawful, or '''[[haraam|harām]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.icv.org.au/about/about-islam-overview/what-is-halal-a-guide-for-non-muslims/|title=What is Halal? A Guide for Non-Muslims {{!}} Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|work=Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV)|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic genitalia hygiene==
Urine is forbidden to be on a Muslim during prayer times, as it is considered dirty. The [[foreskin]] is a possible spot where urine can accumulate. [[Circumcision]] is used to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/2/65|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic toilet etiquette==
{{Main|Islamic toilet etiquette}}
The [[Islam]]ic faith has particular rules regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code is known as ''Qadaahul Haajah''.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/surgeons-perform-delicate-operation-for-muslims-124083.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|title=Surgeons perform delicate operation for Muslims|date=April 8, 2007|author=Niamh Horan|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of laterality, such as whether one uses the left or right hand and the foot used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC|year=1992|title=The Tao of Islam|author=Sachiko Murata|isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8|chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands especially after using the toilet which is mentioned in verse 5:6.

Examples of these rules include, but are not limited to:

* It is strongly forbidden to make the toilet close to the flowing waters, or to be by flowing water whilst relieving yourself.
* It is more preferable to step into the bathroom area with the left leg and step outside the bathroom area with the right leg.
* One should remain silent whilst on the toilet. Talking, answering greetings or greeting others is heavily disliked.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* One should not face nor turn one's back on [[Qibla]] (the direction Muslims face to pray) whilst relieving oneself.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* When leaving the toilet one should also say a prayer, "O Allah! Bestow your forgiveness upon me."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;
* Use of [[toilet paper]] is acceptable, but [[Anal cleansing|washing with water]] is still needed for purity and to minimize germs present in feces from touching the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Israr Hasan |year=2006 |title=Muslims in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k5J493fDF38C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;vq=odd |isbn=978-1-4259-4243-4 |page=144 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">'''Lusser's law''' in [[systems engineering]] is a prediction of [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]]. Named after engineer [[Robert Lusser]],&lt;ref name="AmSpec"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://spectator.org/51313_lussers-law/ | title=Lusser's Law | work=The American Spectator | date=July 14, 2003 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Collins, R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as ''Lusser's product law'' or the ''probability product law of series components'', it states that the reliability of a [[Series circuit|series of components]] is equal to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the individual reliabilities of the components, if their [[failure causes|failure modes]] are known to be [[statistically independent]]. For a series of ''N'' components, this is expressed as:&lt;ref name="DeVale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/traditional_reliability/presentation.pdf | title=Basics of Traditional Reliability | date=1998 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=DeVale, J. | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ausairpower.net/PDF-A/Reliability-PHA.pdf | title=System Reliability and Metrics of Reliability | publisher=Peter Harding &amp; Associates, Pty Ltd | date=1996 | accessdate=11 August 2015 | author=Kopp, C. | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=\prod_{i=1}^N r_i=r_1 \times r_2 \times r_3 \times ... \times r_n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the overall reliability of the system, and ''r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the reliability of the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.

If the failure probabilities of all components are equal, then as Lusser's colleague [[Erich Pieruschka]] observed, this can be expressed simply as:&lt;ref name="DeVale" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_s=r^N&lt;/math&gt;

Lusser's law has been described as the idea that a series system is  "weaker than its weakest link", as the product reliability of a series of components can be less than the lowest-value component.&lt;ref name="Critchley"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ltAqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=Lusser%27s+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SNPCKYZh-o&amp;sig=NUsUd9m3e45m87gG_bSxWjA7kps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwB2oVChMI0ZO-5qOfxwIVh4kaCh3oaw9V#v=onepage&amp;q=Lusser's%20law&amp;f=false | title=High Availability IT Services | publisher=CRC Press | author=Critchley, Terry | year=2014 | pages=117 | isbn=9781482255911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, given a series system of two components with different reliabilities — one of 0.95 and the other of 0.8 — Lusser's law will predict a reliability of

:&lt;math&gt;R_s = 0.95 \times 0.8 = 0.76&lt;/math&gt;

which is lower than either of the individual components.

The '''Micrococcineae''' are a suborder of [[bacteria]] of the order [[Actinomycetales]]. They are [[Gram-positive]] [[soil]] organisms, and are also [[paraphyletic]] with respect to the suborder [[Actinomycetineae]] and order [[Bifidobacteriales]], i.e. the [[Actinomycetineae]] and [[Bifidobacteriales]] are both nested within the clade Micrococcineae.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11923">A '''nutritionist''' is a person who advises others on matters of food and [[Human nutrition|nutrition]] and their impacts on [[human health]].  Some people specialize in particular areas, such as [[sports nutrition]].

In many countries, a person claiming to be a nutritionist is not required to have any training, education, or any type of [[professional license]].  This differs from becoming a [[dietitian]], which normally requires specific training and a professional license.

==Regulation of the title "nutritionist"==
The terms [[dietitian|''dietitian'']] (also spelled ''dietician'') and ''nutritionist'' are not synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos077.htm United States Bureau of Labor Statistics: ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition''] - ''Dietitians and Nutritionists''. Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries and jurisdictions, the title ''nutritionist'' is not subject to [[healthcare provider requisites|professional regulation]]; thus any person may call themselves a nutritionist/nutrition expert even if they are wholly self-taught.&lt;ref&gt;''Nutrition Encyclopedia'', edited by Delores C.S. James, The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, Australia, parts of Canada, and most US states, the term nutritionist is not legally protected, whereas the title of dietitian can be used only by those who have met specified professional requirements. People who have achieved this standard refer to themselves as [[Registered dietitian|Registered Dietitians]], and use "R.D." after their name. One career counselor attempting to describe the difference between the two professions to Canadian students suggested "all dietitians are nutritionists, but not all nutritionists are dietitians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athabascau.ca/counselling/dietitian.php Athabaska University: ''How to become a Dietitian (or Nutritionist)''], by Julia McDonald, Athabaska University Counselor. Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term nutritionist may be associated with practitioners of [[alternative medicine]]. Prominent examples include [[Gillian McKeith]] and [[Robert O. Young]]. A potential problem with nutritionists is low levels of training and the use or promotion of concepts that are untested or even dangerous, such as [[fad diet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/it-sounds-so-nutritionous/|title=It sounds so “nutritionous”|author=|date=1 July 2010|website=sciencebasedmedicine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
To obtain the Nutritionist title, one must have studied at a recognized university for four years plus a year practice (internship). The nutritionists are registered at the Conselho Regional de Nutricão.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn3.org.br/|title=CRN-3 Conselho Regional de Nutricionistas SP-MS|author=|date=|website=www.crn3.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Nutritionist can prescribe diets, work at hospitals with clinical intervention, or in food production segment.

===Canada===
The title "nutritionist" is protected by provincial law in [[Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. The term "Registered Nutritionist" and "Nutritionist" are protected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/acts/h07.pdf|title=HEALTH PROFESSIONS ACT Schedule 23|author=|date=|website=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Alberta]]. The term “Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist” is protected by law in [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicic.ca/en/professions.aspx?sortcode=2.19.21&amp;prof=3132 Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials: ''Information for foreign-trained dietitians and nutritionists''] Accessed 24 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Nova Scotia Dietetic Association is the regulatory body for professional dietitians and nutritionists in that province, authorized by legislation, the Professional Dietitians Act, "to engage in registration, quality assurance, and when necessary, the discipline of dietitians in Nova Scotia to ensure safe, ethical and competent dietetic practice." Professional requirements include a bachelor's degree in Dietetics/Nutrition from an accredited university, a program of practical training, and successful completion of a registration examination (the "Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination" or CDRE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsdassoc.ca|title=Home - Nova Scotia Dietetic Association|first=Mark|last=Seymour|date=|website=www.nsdassoc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
Qualified Nutritionist: Any person who is the holder of a degree (baccalaureate, master, doctoral) in dietetics, foods, and nutrition awarded by a university or other institution recognized by the Association. Qualified Dietitian: Any person who is currently holder of a degree or a postgraduate diploma in dietetics recognized by the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Dietitian Board), the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, British Dietetic Association and the Dietitians Association of Australia, for full membership or equivalent. Details can be found in the Hong Kong Nutrition Association. Job opportunities available in the Hospitals (Government or Private), private consultation companies. In Hong Kong, more and more people are taking note of the importance of balanced diets. The Government, Heart Foundation, Elderly Associations, etc., are keenly promoting in collaboration with local companies like WeCare Nutritionist and Consultants, Nestle, Anlene, etc., resulting in the urgent needs of nutritional professionals.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===India===
Dietitians and nutritionists in India held about 150,000 jobs in 2011. More than half of all dietitians and nutritionists worked in hospitals, nursing homes, and physician's offices and clinics.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Several professional associations are available to serve nutritionists, dietitians, and food technologists in India, e.g., Nutrition Society of India, Food Scientists and Nutritionists Association India, Indian Dietetic Association, IAPEN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapen.co.in|title=Welcome to The Indian Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (IAPEN)|first=|last=IAPEN|date=|website=www.iapen.co.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

===Morocco===
In Morocco, "Nutritionist" is a protected title and might refer to a researcher in the field of nutrition or to a person who practices therapeutic nutrition. To hold the title of Nutritionist, a person should have carried doctoral studies in the field of nutrition and obtained a Ph.D. degree. On the other hand, the title of "Dietitian" is given to whomever carries studies in nutrition schools for three years and obtains a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]]. However, unlike Nutritionists, Dietitians are not given authorization to open private offices and to practice.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, nutritionists must be registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_dietetics.php Health Professions Council of South Africa: ''Dietetics and Nutrition Professional Board''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323083941/http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_dietetics.php |date=2011-03-23 }} Accessed 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council regulates the professional titles of "Nutritionist", "Student Nutritionist", and "Supplementary Nutritionist", along with "Dietitian", "Student Dietitian", and Supplementary Dietitian". Requirements for eligibility for registration include a recognized bachelor's degree from an accredited educational institution. The undergraduate training should include the three practice areas of therapeutic nutrition, community nutrition, and food service management.

===United Kingdom===
"Nutritionist" is not a protected term in the UK, unlike "[[dietitian]]"; the latter must be registered with the [[Health and Care Professions Council]], so anybody can claim to be a nutritionist. The [[Association for Nutrition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/ "Association for Nutrition"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is a registered charity that holds the UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN).

Since 2002, the number of jobs for nutritionists has reportedly grown faster in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) than in any other sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=840 National Health Service Careers: ''Nutritionist''.] Accessed 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it being recognized that nutritionists have an increasingly important role to play in health care in the UK, the NHS employs fewer dietitians each year and the profession itself is shrinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Broadening career opportunities in dietetics: employment in independent research|date=2012-03-13 |pmid=10405676 | volume=99 |issue=7 |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |pages=799–801 | last1 = Peterson | first1 = DA | last2 = Albers | first2 = JE | last3 = Mertz | first3 = JR | last4 = McCoy | first4 = RA | doi = 10.1016/s0002-8223(99)00190-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Certified Nutrition Specialists (CNS) are advanced nutrition professionals. They typically specialize in [[obesity]] and [[chronic disease]]. In order to become certified, a potential CNS candidate must pass an examination. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including clinical intervention and human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs about CNS Certification – Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists|url = http://cbns.org/faqs-cns-certification/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Government regulation, especially in terms of licensing, is currently more universal for the RD or RDN than that of CCN.

Certified Clinical Nutritionists (CCN) are trained health professionals who offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaacn.org/ The International &amp; American Associations of Clinical Nutritionist, 2014, Retrieved 2014-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quackwatch]] has accused the group that provides credentialing to CCNs, and its members, of promoting highly dubious medical claims including [[homeopathy]], [[detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], and [[herbalism]].&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nutritionist.html|title=Where To Get Professional Nutrition Advice |publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Personal protective equipment''' ('''PPE''') refers to protective [[clothing]], [[helmets]], [[goggles]], or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from [[injury]] or [[infection]]. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, [[biological hazard|biohazards]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]]. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related [[occupational safety and health]] purposes, as well as for [[sports]] and other  [[recreation|recreational activities]]. "Protective clothing" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and "protective gear" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or  masks, and others.

The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when [[engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014041258/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/personal-protective-equipment |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }} Personal Protective Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;

Any item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer;
impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.

Practices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.

==Types==
[[File:Die Bienenzüchter (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|left|A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]].]]

Personal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high [[Reflectance|reflectivity]] and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verbeek|first1=Jos H|last2=Ijaz|first2=Sharea|last3=Mischke|first3=Christina|last4=Ruotsalainen|first4=Jani H|last5=Mäkelä|first5=Erja|last6=Neuvonen|first6=Kaisa|last7=Edmond|first7=Michael B|last8=Sauni|first8=Riitta|last9=Kilinc Balci|first9=F Selcen|last10=Mihalache|first10=Raluca C|title=Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 April 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub2/full|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|language=en|pmid=27093058|volume=4|page=CD011621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respirators===
{{main article|Respirator}}
[[File:Air-Purifying Respirator.jpg|thumb|Air-purifying respirator]]

Respirators serve to protect the user from breathing in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user.&lt;ref name=resp&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830084012/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/ |date=2012-08-30 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; The filtration may be either passive or [[Powered, air-purifying respirator|active (powered)]]. [[Gas mask]]s and [[respirator|particulate respirators]] are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA).&lt;ref name =resp/&gt; In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]]. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), [[NHS Health Scotland]] and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as "dos and don'ts" for each type.&lt;ref name=rpe&gt;[http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/rpe-selector/ "Selecting the right Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) for the job"]. Healthy Working Lives. 2008-4-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84.&lt;ref name=resp/&gt; [[The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory]] (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html CDC - NIOSH - Respirator Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928092148/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/factsheets/respfact.html |date=2017-09-28 }}.

===Skin protection===
[[File:Worker weighing carbon nanotubes.png|alt=A man wearing a white lab coat reaches over a beaker containing white powder on a balance|thumb|A worker wearing a [[respirator]], [[lab coat]], and [[Medical glove|gloves]] while weighing [[carbon nanotube]]s]]
[[File:Incorrect use of personal protective equipment.png|alt=A closeup of a person's arm requing into a bucket filled with a black material|thumb|This is an incorrect use of personal protective equipment, because the gap between the [[Medical glove|glove]] and the [[lab coat]] exposes the wrist to hazardous materials.]]
Occupational skin diseases such as [[contact dermatitis]], [[skin cancer]]s, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly.&lt;ref name="skin"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ CDC - Skin Exposures and Effects - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806040459/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/ |date=2012-08-06 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. [[Chemical hazard|Chemical agents]] can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt; Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.&lt;ref name="skin" /&gt;

Any form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, [[glove]]s are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include [[rubber gloves]], [[cut-resistant gloves]], [[chainsaw safety clothing|chainsaw gloves]] and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.

Other than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. [[White coat|Lab coats]] for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. [[Face shield]]s serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.

===Eye protection===
{{Main|Eye protection}}
[[Image:Nuxos1pl.JPG|thumb|left|A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact.]]

Each day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707114404/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/ |date=2017-07-07 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt; Smaller particles in [[smoke]]s and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter-causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as [[welding]] torches and [[ultraviolet|UV light]], also contribute to occupational eye injury.&lt;ref name="eyesafe"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html CDC - Eye Safety - Eye Safety for Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902212409/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eyesafe.html |date=2017-09-02 }}. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Goggles]] provide better protection than safety glasses, and are effective in preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and welding.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt; Goggles with high air flow should be used to prevent fogging.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* [[Face shield]]s provide additional protection and are worn over the standard eyewear; they also provide protection from impact, chemical, and blood-borne hazards.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Full-facepiece respirators are considered the best form of eye protection when respiratory protection is needed as well, but may be less effective against potential impact hazards to the eye.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;
* Eye protection for welding is shaded to different degrees, depending on the specific operation.&lt;ref name="eyesafe" /&gt;

===Hearing protection===
{{Main article|Hearing protection}}
[[Industrial noise]] is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year.&lt;ref name="noise"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Facts and Statistics - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703145248/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html |date=2016-07-03 }}. The National Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="noise" /&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] establishes occupational noise exposure standards.&lt;ref name="oshanoise"&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 Occupational noise exposure - 1910.95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402213424/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 |date=2015-04-02 }}. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85&amp;nbsp;dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational [[noise-induced hearing loss]].&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202172749/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }}.  DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

PPE for hearing protection consists of [[earplugs]] and [[earmuffs]]. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention.

===Protective clothing and ensembles===
{{See also|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}
[[File:Regal mit Persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.jpg|thumb|upright|Locker containing personal protective equipment]][[Image:High-Pressure-Cleaning-with-Personal-Protective-Equipment.jpg|thumb|right|A complete PPE ensemble worn during high pressure cleaning work]]

This form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and [[ballistic vest]]s worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category.

====Ensembles====
Below are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user.
* [[Chainsaw]] [[chainsaw safety clothing|protection]] (especially a helmet with face guard, hearing protection, [[kevlar]] [[chaps]], anti-vibration gloves, and [[Chainsaw safety clothing#Boots|chainsaw safety boots]]).
* [[Beekeeping|Bee-keepers]] wear various levels of protection depending on the temperament of their bees and the reaction of the bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves [[leather glove]]s with long gauntlets and some way of keeping [[bees]] from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.
* [[Diving equipment]], for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a [[diving helmet]] or [[diving mask]], an [[scuba set|underwater breathing apparatus]], and a [[diving suit]].
* [[Firefighter]]s wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases. PPE worn by firefighters include [[bunker gear]], [[self-contained breathing apparatus]], a [[helmet]], [[steel-toe boot|safety boots]], and a [[PASS device]].

====In sports====
{{Main|Protective gear in sports}}
Participants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on [[National Football League|NFL]] players,&lt;ref name=brainnfl&gt;[http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Brain Injury in the NFL] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121220112221/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/09/nfl-brain-injury/ |date=2012-12-20 }}.

==Limits of the definition==
[[File:Safetyequipment3030.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Workers using personal protective equipment while painting poles. While basic head protection is present, no engineering fall protection systems appear to be in place.]]
The definition of what constitutes as personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against [[Hustler]] and other adult film production companies by the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]], leading to several citations brought by [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Cal/OSHA]].&lt;ref name=hustler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|title=Larry Flynt’s Hustler Video Cited by Cal/OSHA over Condoms, Safety, Says AHF|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806224124/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110330007006/en/Larry-Flynt%E2%80%99s-Hustler-Video-Cited-CalOSHA-Condoms|archivedate=6 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to use [[condom]]s by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment.&lt;ref name=hustler/&gt; This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition.

==Legislation in the European Union==
At the [[European Union]] level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers ‘any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1989/686/oj/eng|title=Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment|author=|date=30 December 1989|website=europa.eu|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The [[European Commission]] additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the [[CE Marking]].

Article 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:
* Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles)
* Category II:  PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits)
* Category III:  complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses)

Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.

Personal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN, CENELEC) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.

Personal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:
* PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order;
* PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons);
* PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat;
* PPE  used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times;
* helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles.

The European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legalislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and becoming law.

{{Taxation}}

A '''Pigovian tax''' (also spelled '''Pigouvian tax''') is a [[tax]] on any market activity that generates negative [[Externality|externalities]] (costs not included in the market price). The tax is intended to correct an undesirable or inefficient [[Economic equilibrium|market outcome]], and does so by being set equal to the [[social cost]] of the negative externalities. In the presence of negative externalities, the social cost of a market activity is not covered by the private cost of the activity. In such a case, the market outcome is not [[economic efficiency|efficient]] and may lead to over-consumption of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agnar Sandmo|Sandmo, Agnar]] (2008). "Pigouvian taxes," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000351  Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Often-cited examples of such externalities are environmental [[pollution]], and increased public healthcare costs associated with tobacco and [[Sugary_drink_tax|sugary drink]] consumption.&lt;ref name="Baumol1972" &gt;{{Citation |last=Baumol |first=W. J. |authorlink=William J. Baumol |year=1972 |title=On Taxation and the Control of Externalities |journal=American Economic Review |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=[http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/user/kolya/afs/root.afs/athena/dept/cron/project/urban-sustainability/Discouraging%20Driving_Patrick%20Lynch/Misc/Baumol%20On%20Taxation%20and%20Control%20of%20Externalities.pdf 307–322]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presence of positive externalities, i.e., public benefits from a market activity, those who receive the benefit do not pay for it and the market may under-supply the product. Similar logic suggests the creation of a '''Pigovian subsidy''' to make the users pay for the extra benefit and spur more production.&lt;ref&gt;Turvey, Ralph (1963). "On Divergences between Social Cost and Private Cost", Economica, N.S., 30(119), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2601550?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101938505647 309]–313.&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example sometimes cited is a [[subsidy]] for provision of flu vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;• Carlton, Dennis W., and [[Glenn C. Loury]] (1980). "The Limitations of Pigouvian Taxes as a Long-Run Remedy for Externalities," ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'', 95(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1885093?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101798807531 559]–566.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Althouse, Benjamin M., Theodore C. Bergstrom, and [[Carl Bergstrom|Carl T. Bergstrom]] (2010). "A Public Choice Framework for Controlling Transmissible and Evolving Diseases," ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', January 26; 107(suppl. 1), pp. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2868281/ 1696–1701.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigovian taxes are named after English [[economist]] [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]] (1877–1959) who also developed the concept of economic externalities. [[William Baumol]] was instrumental in framing Pigou's work in modern economics in 1972.&lt;ref name="Baumol1972" /&gt;

==Pigou's original argument==
In 1920, British economist Arthur C. Pigou wrote ''The Economics of Welfare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pigou |first=A. C. |title=The Economics of Welfare |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Pigou argues that industrialists seek their own marginal private interest. When the marginal social interest diverges from the marginal private interest, the industrialist has no incentive to internalize the cost of the marginal social cost. Conversely, Pigou argues, if an industry produces a marginal social benefit, the individuals receiving the benefit have no incentive to pay for that service. Pigou refers to these situations as incidental uncharged disservices and incidental uncharged services, respectively.

Pigou provides numerous illustrations of incidental uncharged disservices. For example, if a contractor builds a factory in the middle of a crowded neighborhood, the factory causes these incidental uncharged disservices: higher congestion, loss of light, and a loss of health for the neighbors. He also references businesses that sell alcohol. The sale of alcohol necessitates higher costs in policemen and prisons, Pigou argues, because of the crime associated with alcohol. In other words, the net private product of alcohol businesses is peculiarly large relative to the net social product of the same business. He suggests that this is why most countries tax alcohol businesses.

The divergence between the marginal private interest and the marginal social interest produces two primary results. First, as already noted, the party receiving the social benefit does not pay for it, and the one creating the social harm does not pay for it. Second, when the marginal social cost exceeds the private marginal benefit, the cost-creator over-produces the product. Ultimately, because [[Pecuniary externality|non-pecuniary externalities]] overestimate the social value, they are over-produced.

To deal with over-production, Pigou recommends a tax placed on the offending producer. If the government can accurately gauge the social cost, the tax could equalize the marginal private cost and the marginal social cost. In more specific terms, the producer would have to pay for the non-pecuniary externality that it created. This would effectively reduce the quantity of the product produced, moving the economy back to a healthy equilibrium.

==Working of the Pigovian tax==
[[File:Social cost with tax.svg|thumb|left|Pigovian tax effect on output]]
The diagram illustrates the working of a Pigovian tax.  A tax shifts the marginal private cost curve up by the amount of the externality. If the tax is placed on the quantity of emissions from the factory, the producers have an incentive to reduce output to the socially optimum level. If the tax is placed on the percentage of emissions per unit of production, the factory has the incentive to change to cleaner processes or technology.

==Lump-sum tax subsidy==
In 1980, a new critique of Pigovian taxes emerged from [[Dennis Carlton]] and [[Glenn Loury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carlton |first=Dennis W. |last2=Loury |first2=Glenn C. |year=1980 |title=The Limitations of Pigouvian Taxes as a Long-Run Remedy for Externalities |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=559–566 |jstor=1885093 |doi=10.2307/1885093}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that Pigovian taxes alone would not create an efficient outcome in the long-run, because the taxes controlled only the scale of the individual firms, not the number of firms in the particular industry. In the case of pollution, if the firms each produced a fraction of what they produced before, but the number of firms increased exponentially, the amount of pollution would still increase. To prevent this, Carlton and Loury recommend a policy with the potential to regulate the number of firms in an industry: lump-sum taxes or lump-sum subsidies.

Carlton and Loury present four basic arguments in their article. First, Pigovian taxes work in the short-term, because the number of firms cannot vary. Second, Pigovian taxes do not work in the long-term because the number of firms can vary. Third, an industry with a specific number of firms and scale can achieve the long-run social optimum (LRSO). The best option is to add an entry tax for potential firms and a subsidy for current firms to restrict a movement in the number of firms. Fourth, it is possible for a tax policy to create a LRSO.

Robert Kohn responded to this article in "The Limitations of Pigouvian Taxes as a Long-Run Remedy for Externalities: Comment," saying that a Pigovian tax on pollution emissions can, in fact, create the long-run social optimum without a lump-sum tax-subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kohn |first=Robert E. |year=1986 |title=The Limitations of Pigouvian Taxes as a Long-Run Remedy for Externalities: Comment |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=625–630 |jstor= |doi=10.2307/1885700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlton and Loury responded the same month, clarifying that they were discussing a Pigovian tax on output; whereas, Kohn was discussing a Pigovian tax on emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carlton |first=Dennis W. |last2=Loury |first2=Glenn C. |year=1986 |title=The Limitation of Pigouvian Taxes as a Long-Run Remedy for Externalities: An Extension of Results |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=631–634 |jstor=1885701 |doi=10.2307/1885701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlton and Loury provide numerical proofs as to why these are different. Ultimately, they argue that there are some cases in which a single tax on emissions will produce the LRSO and others in which a single tax on output will attain the LRSO. Either case only works with the taxes properly determined.

==Double-dividend hypothesis==
The double-dividend hypothesis proposes that a revenue-neutral substitution of environmental taxes for revenue-raising taxes might offer two benefits. The idea was first advanced by Tullock (1967) in a paper titled 'Excess Benefit'.&lt;ref&gt;Tullock, G. (1967), "Excess benefit", Water Resources Research, 3, 643–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The first benefit (or dividend) is the benefit or welfare gain resulting from an improvement in the environment (less pollution), and the second dividend or benefit is due to a reduction in the distortions of the revenue-raising tax system, which also produces an improvement in welfare. This idea received scant attention until the early 1990s, when the economics of climate change attracted attention to the topic of environmental taxes.
The term 'double dividend' became widely used following its introduction by David Pearce in 1991. Pearce noted that estimates of the marginal excess burden (marginal distortionary cost) of existing levels of taxation in the US economy are between 20 and 50 cents per dollar of revenue collected. Because the revenue from the carbon tax would be recycled (used to lower preexisting and distorting taxes), the policy would be revenue-neutral, and the secondary benefit from revenue recycling would justify an even higher carbon tax. It is generally accepted now that the magnitude of the "revenue-recycling" benefit is lower than the 20–50 cents per dollar of revenue, but there are differing views on whether the second effect is positive or negative. The line of argument suggesting that the second “benefit” is negative proposes a previously unrecognized “tax interaction effect” (Bovenberg and de Mooij 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Bovenberg, A.L. and R.A. de Mooij (1994), ‘Environmental levies and distortionary taxation’, Ameri¬can Economic Review, 94 (4), 1085–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 paper, Don Fullerton and [[Gilbert E. Metcalf]] evaluated the double dividend hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Fullerton 42"&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = w6199| pages = 42| last = Fullerton| first = Don| author2 = Gilbert E. Metcalf| title = Environmental Taxes and the Double-Dividend Hypothesis: Did You Really Expect Something for Nothing?| journal = NBER Working Papers| accessdate = | date = September 1997| ssrn = 225957}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They define the double-dividend hypothesis as the theory that environmental taxes can improve the environment and increase economic efficiency simultaneously. Either motivation can legitimately support a tax reform. The first dividend intuitively makes sense: decreasing pollutant emissions improves the environment. The improvement in economic efficiency results from a shift away from distorting taxes such as the income tax. Fullerton and Metcalf note that for every $1 extracted in taxes, a $1.35 burden falls on the economy. In a sense, the private sector must swallow a 35 cent excess burden for no particular reason. The second dividend aims to eliminate some of this excess burden.

Tempting as it may be to try, Fullerton and Metcalf argue, the validity of the double-dividend theory cannot be established as a whole. An observer must evaluate each circumstance individually. Fullerton and Metcalf do provide guidelines for this analysis. Two questions help shape this analysis: what is the status quo? What are the specifics of the reform? The amount and nature of the current taxes, permits, and regulations greatly influence the results of the additional tax. Also, where the tax revenue goes greatly affects the success of the tax.

Secondly, Fullerton and Metcalf say the previous literature on Pigovian taxes focused too heavily on the revenue dividend and too lightly on the environmental dividend of environmental taxes. Their predecessors naively value revenue too much, Fullerton and Metcalf argue, because they fail to recognize that all taxes impose costs on someone. These taxes could outweigh the environmental benefit. Thus, the government must use the Pigovian tax revenue to lower another tax if it wants to minimize the economic damage of a tax.

Fullerton and Metcalf also mention that the effectiveness of any sort of Pigovian tax depends on whether it supplements or replaces an existing pollution regulation. If the tax replaces a pollution regulation, it will most likely be environmentally neutral, even if it is revenue-positive. If it supplements the regulation, it may or may not be environmentally and revenue-neutral, depending on the effectiveness of the original regulation. The status quo substantially affects the outcome of a proposed tax.

==Pigovian tax and distortionary taxation==
[[Lans Bovenberg|A. Lans Bovenberg]] and Ruud A. Mooij argue that there is a first-best case scenario and a second-best case scenario in their article “Environmental Levies and Distortionary Taxation."&lt;ref&gt;Bovenberg, A. Lans and de Mooij, Ruud A. (1994). "Environmental Levies and Distortionary Taxation," The American Economic Review, 84(4): 1085–1089.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first-best case, the government does not need to get revenue from distortionary taxes such as the income tax, and the Pigovian tax can create the long-run social optimum. In the real world, second-best case, the status quo includes an income tax that distorts the labor supply. In this situation, Bovenberg and Mooij write that the best tax comes in below the level of the Pigovian tax.

Bovenberg and Mooij establish that households consume a dirty good (D) and a clean good (C). If the government taxes D, it can use the earned revenue to lower the labor income tax. At the same time, the tax levied on the firm will increase the price of D. The lowered income tax and the higher consumer prices even each other out, stabilizing the real net wage. But because C’s price has not changed and it can substitute for D, consumers will buy C instead of D. Suddenly the government’s environmental tax base has eroded and its revenue with it. The government then cannot afford to keep the labor income tax down. Bovenberg and Mooij posit that the increase in the price of goods will outweigh the slight decrease in the income tax. Labor and leisure become more interchangeable the lower the real net wage (or after-tax wage) falls. With this decrease in the real net wage, more people leave the job market. Ultimately, labor bears the cost of all public goods.

Goulder, Parry, and Burtraw agree that the net social welfare after the implementation of a tax hinges on the preexisting tax rate. Don Fullerton agreed with this analysis in 1997 in his article “Environmental Levies and Distortionary Taxation: Comment.”&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, Don (1997). "Environmental Levies and Distortionary Taxation: Comment," The American Economic Review, 87(1): 245–251.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that lowering the income tax and taxing the dirty good equates with raising the labor tax and subsidizing the clean product. These two policies create the same effects, Fullerton says.

In 1998, Fullerton and Gilbert E. Metcalf explain this theory more thoroughly. They begin by defining terms. The gross wage reflects the pre-tax wage a laborer receives.&lt;ref name="Fullerton 42"/&gt; The simplest form of the net wage is the pre-tax wage minus the income tax.  In reality, however, the net wage is the gross wage times one minus the tax rate, all divided by the price of consumption goods. With the status quo income tax, [[deadweight loss]] exists. Any addition to the price of consumption goods or an increase in the income tax extends the deadweight loss further. Either of these scenarios lowers the net wage, reducing the supply of labor offered. Supply of labor decreases because of the labor/leisure interchange. If someone gets paid very little, he or she may decide it is no longer worth his or her time to continue in that job. Thus, employment decreases. If the Pigovian tax, which increases the price of consumption goods, replaces the income tax, Fullerton argues that the net wage is not affected.

This rejection of the double dividend hypothesis found in the “tax interaction” literature was met with surprise and skepticism among economists for a variety of reasons. There are multiple sources of ambiguity, differing definitions of what constitutes a ‘double dividend’, and confusion caused when comparing models with direct versus indirect tax programs, reliance on comparisons with an unreliable benchmark, and misinterpretation of notation in the literature.

Although the central question for the double dividend hypothesis and the tax interaction literature has been whether the welfare gains from environmental taxation in a second-best world are larger or smaller than in a first-best setting, the Tax Interaction literature takes this central question and frames it indirectly, by asking whether the second-best optimal environmental tax is higher or lower than the first-best Pigouvian rate. This question, too, is not answered directly, because the first-best Pigouvian rate is replaced by a definition of marginal social damages, the value of which changes with the tax level and tax program normalization. This becomes an unreliable and shifting benchmark (Jaeger 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, W.K. (2011), ‘The welfare effects of environmental taxation’, Environmental and Resource Economics, 49 (1), 101–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, three factors contributed to misleading interpretations in the TI literature: an algebraic error, the use of an unreliable benchmark, and unrecognized compounding or double taxation. As a result, the conclusion that a large, previously unnoticed distortionary tax interaction effect existed can be seen as partly due to misinterpretations (Jaeger 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, William K., 2013. The Double Dividend Debate. In Handbook of Research on Environmental Taxation (Janet E. Milne and Mikael S. Anderson editors). Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite these sources of confusion, it remains the case that a) the possibility of a double dividend depends on specifics specific to the demands and the economy in which an environmental tax is being considered, and b) that the efficiency gains with revenue recycling will be greater, potentially significantly greater, than when revenues are not collected and used to reduce pre-existing revenue-raising taxes. Various research studies using numerical models find evidence in support of the double dividend hypothesis (Jorgensen et al., 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Jorgenson, Dale W., et al. Double dividend: Environmental taxes and fiscal reform in the United States. MIT Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite recent controversy on this topic, the conclusions that can be drawn are in keeping with economic intuition. Environmental and revenue-raising taxes are complementary tools for achieving two different kinds of government goals: the provision of public goods with revenue-motivated taxes and the protection of environmental quality with corrective taxes. Indeed, the joint pursuit of these two goals through taxation can enable government to justify doing more of each by making the optimal environmental tax higher than it would be otherwise, and by lowering the distortionary cost of financing the provision of public goods.

==Alternatives==
The Pigovian tax is a method commonly used by governments as it has relatively low transaction costs associated with implementation. Other methods such as command and control regulations or subsidies assume that the government has a complete knowledge of the market, which is almost never the case, and can often lead to inefficiencies and market failure through [[rent-seeking]] behavior by individuals and firms.

===No intervention (direct negotiation between parties)===
Economist [[Ronald Coase]] argued that individuals can come to an agreement with an efficient result without the need for a third party when transaction costs are low.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, Ronald H. (1960). "The Problem of Social Cost". Journal of Law and Economics 3 (1): 1–44.&lt;/ref&gt; He says it is less expensive and less difficult for two neighbors to come to an agreement about a fence, the amount of noise, or the amount of smoke than it is for these two neighbors to approach a third party to solve the situation for them. Even when several parties are involved, outside interference could result in an inefficient outcome.

Yet, in dynamic settings Coasean bargaining ex post may lead to inefficient investments ex ante (the so-called [[hold-up problem]]). For this reason, some authors have argued that unconstrained Coasean bargaining may actually justify Pigouvian taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can Coasean Bargaining Justify Pigouvian Taxation?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x/abstract|journal = Economica|date = 2007|issn = 1468-0335|pages = 573–585|volume = 74|issue = 296|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x|language = en|first = Stephanie|last = Rosenkranz|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Offshoring and the Role of Trade Agreements|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/aer.102.7.3140|journal = American Economic Review|date = 2012|issn = 0002-8282|pages = 3140–3183|volume = 102|issue = 7|doi = 10.1257/aer.102.7.3140|first = Pol|last = Antràs|first2 = Robert W|last2 = Staiger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm limits===
Instead of taxing the negative externality producer, government could regulate the production of that negative externality. Fullerton and Metcalf argue that restricting the amount of pollution that all firms in an industry can produce will indirectly reduce the output of all firms.&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, Don and Metcalf, Gilbert (1998). "[http://ase.tufts.edu/econ/papers/9706.pdf Environmental Taxes and the Double-Dividend Hypothesis: Did You Really Expect Something for Nothing?]" Chicago-Kent Law Review, 73: 221–256.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|no such assertion made. Authors do assert that a 10% reduction in pollution requires a 10% reduction in production. |date=June 2013}} This comprehensive supply reduction will automatically raise the consumption price of the good. These types of command-and-control restrictions stimulate cartel-like profits. Fullerton and Metcalf assert that production costs do not change, and assert that the companies can earn profits over and above what is earned before the regulations even with selling a lower quantity of goods. If the production cost of all firms increased simultaneously due to a regulation, the firms may be able to increase the price uniformly. They do not consider the elasticity of products and that's effect on the quantity of demand and the industry's final profits.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Cap and trade===
{{Main|Emissions trading}}
Another alternative to applying Pigovian taxation is for government to place a limit on the total amount of the production of the output causing the negative externality and create a market for rights to generate that specific output. In the United States since the late 1970s, and in other developed nations since the 1980s, the concept of a market for "pollution rights" has emerged.  Giving out the rights for free (or at less than market price) allows polluters to lose less profit or even gain profits (by selling their rights) relative to the unaltered market case.

Goulder, Perry, and Burtraw suggest that selling permits to firms is the best option, but recognize that many firms in the status quo are grandfathered in, meaning they are given exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;Goulder, Lawrence H., Parry, Ian W.H., and Burtraw, Dallas (1997). "Revenue-raising versus other approaches to environmental protection: The critical significance of preexisting tax distortions," The RAND Journal of Economics, 28(4): 708–731.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors include an example of the U.S. regulations in coal-fired electrical power plants that require the reduction of 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions. They estimate that more than half of the $907 million preexisting taxes could have been eliminated by auctioning off the permits rather than grandfathering them.

==Criticisms==
Most of the criticism of the Pigovian tax relates to the determination of the tax and the implementation. Pigou and [[Friedrich Hayek]] point out that the assumption that the government can determine the marginal social cost of a negative externality and convert that amount into a monetary value is a weakness of the Pigovian tax. [[William Baumol]] suggests that the measurement of social cost is almost impossible. [[Ronald Coase]] argues that all social costs are reciprocal in nature, so, once the tax is set, it must not be changed. Others point out that political factors can complicate the implementation of a Pigovian tax.

===Measurement problem===
Arthur Pigou said: "It must be confessed, however, that we seldom know enough to decide in what fields and to what extent the State, on account of [the gaps between private and public costs] could interfere with individual choice."&lt;ref&gt;Pigou, A.C., (1954) Some Aspects of the Welfare State. Diogenes 7 (6).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the economist's blackboard "model" assumes knowledge we don't possess{{snd}} it's a model with assumed "givens" which are in fact ''not'' given to anyone. [[Friedrich Hayek]] would argue that  this is knowledge which could not be provided as a "given" by any "method" yet discovered, due to insuperable cognitive limits.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[William Baumol]] as well as Polodoo (2008) have argued that it is extraordinarily difficult to measure the social costs of any externality, especially because many costs are psychological and individual.&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William J. (1972). "On Taxation and the Control of Externalities," The American Economic Review, 62(3): 307–322.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if a measurement of the psychological effect of some externality did exist, it would be impossible to collect that data for all individuals affected and then find the optimum output level. Since it is not possible to find the optimum output level, it is not possible to find the optimum Pigovian tax level to achieve that optimum. In the end, Baumol argues that the best solution is to set a minimum standard of acceptability for negative externalities, and create tax systems to achieve those minimum standards. Baumol points out that government committees have a tradition of agreeing on minimum standards, so the practicality of this solution is reasonable.

[[Peter Boettke]] brings forth that "The Pigouvian remedy was to bring marginal private costs (subjectively understood) into line with marginal social costs (objectively understood). The problem, [[James M. Buchanan]] pointed out, was that the analyst had to specify the conditions under which objectively measurable costs could be ascertained by economic and policy actors. In general competitive equilibrium there are also no deviations between marginal private costs and marginal social costs. In other words, Buchanan (like [[Ronald Coase]]) pointed out that Pigovian tax remedies are either possible and redundant, or impossible to set because the conditions presupposed for their establishment either eliminate their necessity or (if absent) preclude their enactment." In other words, "[[Karen I. Vaughn]] has pointed out the dilemma involved in this situation. To calculate the appropriate corrective tax, the policymaker must know the equilibrium price; yet the situation demanding correction implies a disequilibrium situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Karen|title=Does it Matter That Costs Are Subjective?|journal=Southern Economic Journal|date=January 1980|volume=46|issue=3|pages=702–715|doi=10.2307/1057140|jstor=1057140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boettke|first=Peter|title=Living Economics|year=2012|publisher=The Independent Institute, Universidad Francisco Marroquin|isbn=9781598130751|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reciprocal cost problem===
[[Ronald Coase]] argues that the tax placed on an industry creating a negative externality should not be changed after it is implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, Ronald (1960), "The Problem of Social Cost", Journal of Law and Economics 3 (1): 1–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The crux of his argument is that all social costs are reciprocal in nature. Coase argues that a factory emitting smoke is not entirely responsible for the social harm of smoky air. If the factory were not there, no one would suffer from smoky air, and if the people were not there, no one would suffer from smoky air. Because of this reciprocity of harm, Coase argues that neither party bears sole responsibility for the social harm, so neither party should pay the full cost.

The social harm gets worse, Coase argues, if only one offender pays for the social harm. If the smoke-emitting factory must pay dearly for all its smoke, it will reduce its quantity of production or buy the necessary technology to reduce its smoke rate. With the advent of clean air, neighbors may move into the area. This immediately increases the marginal social cost of smoke, which would require a tax increase on the factory. Essentially, each time the tax increases, the population increases and the marginal cost of the status quo increases again, so the factory is punished for making conditions good enough that people want to move there.

One complexity of this situation is the multiple local maxima, or the interchangeable best-case scenarios. It all hinges on the numbers. If the cost of abating all smoke is more than the cost to move the neighbors out, the neighbors should move out and let the factory continue emitting smoke. On the other hand, if it costs less to abate the smoke than to move the neighbors, then the factory ought to pay the tax or buy the clean technology to provide clean air for the surrounding residents.  Once the optimum solution is implemented, Coase argues that the tax should not change, regardless of changing circumstances. In this case, if a tax is imposed on the factory and some more neighbors move in, the factory tax should not increase.

===Political problem===
Political factors such as lobbying of government by [[polluter]]s may also tend to reduce the level of the tax levied, which will tend to reduce the mitigating effect of the tax; lobbying of government by special interests who calculate the negative utility of the externality higher than others may also tend to increase the level of the tax levied, which will tend to result in a sub-optimal level of production.

Political factors can result in complementary problems when pollution opponents assert irrationally high levels of harm or operate from a hidden agenda of extirpating the polluting agent regardless of the prospects for regulating it to cause minimal harm; regulators are then driven to set absurdly high tax levels, possibly high enough to effectively prohibit operation.

Similarly, lobbyists whose agendas are entirely orthogonal to pollution reduction per se might intervene with regulators to drive tax rates higher or lower, thus preventing optimal operation of the tax.  Likely instances of such include organizations intending to lower the polluter's market value as part of a pending plan to buy out its parent entity.  Alternatively there might be efforts to drive the polluter's market value higher prior to its sale.  Familiar real-world examples of groups intervening for reason unrelated to pollution reduction include opponents of the polluter's (or the polluter's parent organization's) labor practices and groups with seemingly dogmatic opposition to anything connected to nuclear energy.

Earl A. Thompson and Ronald Batchelder cited one political problem with Pigovian taxes being that if a firm can influence the tax rate or regulations put on it, the results will not be as certain as Pigou and Baumol suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/1808900| issn = 0002-8282| volume = 64| issue = 3| pages = 462–466| last = Tietenberg| first = T. H.| author-link= Thomas H. Tietenberg| title = On Taxation and the Control of Externalities: Comment
| journal = The American Economic Review| date = 1974-06-01| jstor=1808900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baumol responded to this, saying that almost all discussions on Pigovian taxes include the assumption of pure competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/1808902| issn = 0002-8282| volume = 64| issue = 3| pages = 472| last = Baumol| first = William J.| title = On Taxation and the Control of Externalities: Reply| journal = The American Economic Review| date = 1974-06-01| jstor=1808902}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This certainly does alter the scenario, but the literature had not ignored it; it had merely used a different set of assumptions.

Thomas A. Barthold argues in 1994 that  actual policy decisions often come from budget requirements, not concern for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Barthold, Thomas A. (1994). "Issues in the Design of Environmental Excise Taxes," The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 8(1): 133–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The taxes do not always parallel raw economic theory because social benefits and costs are hard to measure. He uses the 1989 Montreal Protocol as an example. President George H. W. Bush signed this protocol that allowed either a permit auction or a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals. Barthold attributes the decision to implement the tax to the pressure on the Ways and Means committee to come up with more consistent revenue.

The tax policy also did not accord with basic common sense economic principles.  For one, it makes sense to impose a tax on the industry that creates the pollution problem, on the activity that emits the harmful chemicals. This particular activity happened to be the use of automobiles with leaky compressor systems, but because of the high administration cost of taxing that many people, the government decided to tax the producers of those chemicals, though they contributed nothing to the actual problems of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere.

Another evidence of the alternative motivations for this policy is the fact that the base tax increases annually. Does the harm from chlorofluorocarbons increase every year and in the same increment? Who is to say that $1.37 per pound of chlorofluorocarbons is an accurate description of the marginal social cost of pollution? The conspicuous hike in the tax in 1992 that equalized the Energy Policy Act’s budget ignited Barthold’s suspicions. Additionally, exporting firms should not receive exemptions from environmental taxes simply because they are exporting goods. If the motivation for this tax was simply the first dividend, environmental improvement, then all firms, whether or not they export, would be taxed.

Aside from this frustration, Barthold noted that politicians often prefer regulations with obvious benefits and hidden costs over regulations with hidden benefits and obvious costs. This is one reason why politicians often prefer to hand out permits to firms rather than impose a tax on them, even though the tax is more economically efficient. Free permits create winners of grandfathered firms and losers of the consumer who has to pay more for the same product. According to Barthold, taxation makes losers of the factory producers and indirect winners of the consumers.

'''Private jurisdiction''' is the right of an individual or a [[Legal person|legal entity]] to establish [[Court|courts of law]]. It was prevalent during [[feudalism]].

A [[Exclusive right|franchise]], such as a [[corporation]], a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an "[[incorporeal hereditament]]". Under [[English law]] incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in [[charter]]s. 

Franchise jurisdictions included those of [[manorial court]]s, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over [[family law]]), [[borough courts]] of [[municipal corporation]]s, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.

In medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]" and [[county|counties]]. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the [[East India Company]]). 

In medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for [[trespass]] ([[tort]]) against the franchise court.

[[File:1931 Act ed.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Architects Act 1997]] imposes restrictions on the use of the name, style or title "architect" in connection with a business or a professional practice, and for that purpose requires a statutory [[Register of Architects]] to be maintained. The [[Architects Registration Board]] constituted under the Act is responsible for '''Architects Registration in the United Kingdom''' and is required to publish the current version of the Register annually. Every person who is entitled to be registered under the Act has the right to be entered in the Register. The Act consolidated previous enactments originating with the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 as amended by the Architects Registration Act 1938]]. It applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Section 2 of the Act prescribes that the Board shall appoint and regulate the functions ascribed to the '''Registrar'''. The Act refers to the Registrar by the masculine [[pronoun]] in the singular, but by the usual rules of [[statutory interpretation]],&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; this is not limited to an individual male person.

An [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment]] under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] came into force on 20 June 2008.

The recurring controversy about whether statutory protection of title serves useful purposes has been intensified by the legislative impact of the [[EU Directive]] on [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Unfair Commercial Practices]] implemented in May 2008 by two [[Statutory Instrument]]s under the European Communities Act 1972, namely No 1276 ([[Trade Descriptions Act 1968|Trade Descriptions]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081276_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1276]&lt;/ref&gt; and No 1277 ([[Consumer Protection]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081277_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1277]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006], "regulatory function" is defined in subsection 32(2).

==Use of the title "architect"==

Under subsection 20(1) of the [[Architects Act 1997]], a person in the [[United Kingdom]] may only practise or carry on business under any name, style or title containing the word "[[architect]]" if registered. There is no restriction on its use in any other circumstance. The words in the current Act follow those of the 1938 Architects Registration Act under which it was decided that the use of the suffix "FRIBA" in business notepaper constituted an infringement.

By subsection 20(3) corporate bodies, firms or partnerships can carry on business under a name, style or title containing the word "architect" provided that (in broad terms) the architectural business is run by a registered person. However the statutory registration Board may (by rules made under subsection 20(4) – see General Rules, Rule 25) effectively limit the application of subsection 20(3) to those corporate bodies firms or partnerships who have supplied information necessary for determining whether the architectural business is run by a registered person.

The rule-making power under subsection 20(4) appears to be limited to prescribing particular information to be provided to the Board viz. "such information necessary for statutory registration determining whether [subsection 20(3)] applies". The subsection makes no provision for levying any fee.

==Background to legislation==

===Up to the 1990s===

Opinions had been divided for well over a century about the merits of statutory registration of architects in the United Kingdom. The result was that Parliament, as the legislator and guided by the government of the day, has had to maintain a state of benevolent neutrality among the holders of these contending views, consistent with more general public policies for business competition, employment, professional education and so on. In relation to statutory protection of title, three aspects of the field in which architects practise invite examination. In summary:

* ''The design quality of the built environment'': this is essentially a cultural concern which was and remains one of the principal reasons for the formation and continuance of the Royal Institute of British Architects as a chartered body. It has connotations not only for the United Kingdom but world wide. It is beyond the ambit of statutory protection of title.
* ''The technical sufficiency of buildings'': the public interest is secured in the United Kingdom under Building Regulations and other enactments. This too is beyond the statutory protection of the title "architect".
* ''The business of architectural practice'': contracts of engagement for professional services are always between a business entity (whether individual, firm, partnership, or company) and the client, and are governed by the general law, including consumer protection legislation where applicable. Protection of the title ‘architect’ for business entities is of no practical relevance for securing the performance of architectural services.

In the light of experience since the inception of the Register under the 1931 Act, and more particularly under the Architects Registration Board’s regime from 1997, the recurring question has been whether protection of title serves useful purposes in respect of the three aspects mentioned above. The question of obsolescence has been further intensified by the [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], effective from 2007.

Statutory registration had its origin within the architectural profession in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was then (as now) a matter of controversy. However, by 1905 the [[RIBA]] had established a policy to secure satisfactory training of architects by statutory means.

The basis of the policy (on registration) had always been that the profession was governed by voluntary associations of practising architects and that the profession would retain control of registration. This was reflected in the composition of the registration body (the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] - [[ARCUK]]) established by the 1931 Act. Shortly after, in the book published on occasion of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;''The Growth and Work of the Royal Institute of British Architects'' edited by J. A. Gotch PPRIBA [[John Alfred Gotch]]

.&lt;/ref&gt; in the concluding paragraphs of the chapter on statutory registration.,&lt;ref&gt;In this chapter the author includes an informative account of the history of registration quoting extensively an article published in the ''RIBA Journal'' of 8 August 1931 by Charles MacArthur Butler, Secretary of the RIBA Registration Committee and first Registrar to ARCUK.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Barnes FRIBA., Chairman of the Registration Committee, wrote -

:''" ... I do not conceive the purpose of the Registration Act to be that of protecting the Architectural profession. The interests of the Profession are of course legitimate but are best served by the Architectural Associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture are to be found.''

:''"The object of the Registration Act is to ensure to the public that the architects they employ possess capacity and character.''

:''"Under the purview of the [[Board of Architectural Education]] no one will enjoy the title of '[[Registered Architect]]' without giving evidence of his capacity, and under that of the Discipline Committee no one will retain the title whose character has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.''

:''"The [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] can never, therefore, on this view be a rival of any Architectural Association and least of all of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].''

:''"The Architects' Registration Council stands at the gateway of the realm of Architectural practice, but within that realm the affairs of the Architect are best administered by those voluntary Associations to which he has allied himself and over the actions of which he has complete control."''

After more than half a century times have changed and a regime of quite another kind has been installed under the 1997 Act.

===From the 1990s===

By the 1990s it was almost universally accepted that the time had come to bring the statutory Architects' Registration Council as it then was to an end. Opinion within the profession was divided among those who held that statutory registration should be discontinued altogether and those who held that the registration body should be reconstituted.

In the event the body was reconstituted as the Architects Registration Board (1996/1997 Acts). But it was only after the event that many in the profession came to appreciate the effect of the new requirement that the majority of the Board should be non-architects and appointed by the government, as the following quotation shows:

:"''Crucially, professional control of the Register was taken away by the government's decision which was realised in the 1996/97 Act. This had not been generally expected by those of the membership who before then had been in favour of continuing protection of the title '[[architect]]'. The significance and effect of the change is now becoming more widely understood.''" (Report of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] Council's Task Group on the [[Architects Registration Board]], September 2004.)

===Statutory Registration – chronology of key events===

'''''1834''''' - The body which was to become the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (originally known as the Institute of British Architects in London) was formed by [[Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey]] and several prominent architects. (After the grant of the charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.)&lt;ref&gt;about the RIBA Charter and Byelaws {{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426122320/http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} |Text of the Charter and Byelaws

'''''1837''''' - It was granted its [[Royal Charter]] under [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].

'''''1884''''' - [[Society of Architects]] formed, after a campaign by a group of ARIBA to be allowed to vote on RIBA affairs had been resisted by FRIBA.

'''''1887''''' - Architects and Engineers Registration Act Committee formed as an independent committee to promote a bill for registration of architects, engineers and surveyors. The bill was withdrawn after chief bodies representing engineers petitioned against it.

'''''1889 &amp; 1891''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee put forward bills for registration of architects, which were strongly supported by the [[Society of Architects]] but opposed by an independent group of prominent architects and artists.

'''''1892''''' - Papers published, defining the profession of architecture:
:[[Norman Shaw]] and [[T. G. Jackson|T G Jackson]] (eds.) "Architecture, A Profession or an Art".
:[[William H. White (architect)|William H White]] "''The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art''".

'''''1902''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee amalgamated with the Society of Architects as a joint Registration Committee.

'''''1905''''' - RIBA Education Policy was adopted for statutory powers to secure satisfactory training for architects by way of registration of title, by and through the RIBA.

'''''1908''''' - RIBA Licentiate Class formed, for architects who could show evidence of competence, without exams. On closure in 1913, over 2000 had been accepted.

'''1924-1959''' - RIBA Standing Registration Committee.

'''''1925''''' - Amalgamation of [[RIBA]] and [[Society of Architects]]: most of the [[Society of Architects]] members transferred to Licentiate class, which was reopened.

'''''1927''''' - RIBA Registration Committee has draft bill introduced in Parliament, but opposed by the [[Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors]] and the [[Faculty of Architects and Surveyors]].

'''''1931''''' - Bill recast and enacted as the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, enabling the [[Register of Architects]] to be established under a statutory body called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK). The Council was to be made up of representatives of all architectural bodies in the [[United Kingdom]] in proportion to the numbers of their memberships on the Register, and representatives from government departments and related professional bodies. Under ARCUK, the RIBA system of exams etc. was accepted for registration. (The provisions of the Act constituting the [[Board of Architectural Education]] were repealed when ARCUK was reconstituted as ARB in 1996/7.)

'''''1937''''' - A letter is sent by "the president of the council" [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognizing the fact that there was nothing in the Bill which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938) to interfere with the activities of registered architects. The letter is mentioned by
[[Lord Goddard]],Lord Chief Justice, in the course of his judgment in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court in 1957 allowing the appeal of an architect (Hughes) against a professional miscondct decision of the Discipline Committee of ARCUK (later renamed [[Architects Registration Board]]), a case which becomes cited in later cases and in legal text-books as a judicial precedent.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1938''''' - The Architects Registration Act, 1938 changed the protected title from "Registered Architect" to "Architect".

'''''1957''''' - Resulting from the 1938 legislation, an appeal by an architect against ARCUK is allowed by the High Court in a case which becomes a judicial precedent, ''Hughes v. Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom'': "It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful."—Devlin J. ([[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin]])&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1992''''' - Government, in response to a request from ARCUK, commissioned review of the Architects Registration Acts by an independent assessor (John Warne).

'''''1993''''' - [[Warne Report]] published - principal recommendation: abolition of protection of title "architect" and disbanding of ARCUK. RIBA Council initially supported this recommendation, but this was resisted by the RIBA membership. As a result RIBA campaigned for the retention of protection of title with a "stream-lined" registration board.

'''''1996''''' - Part III of [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]], among other things, reconstituted the registration body as the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

'''''1997''''' - Architects Act 1997, a consolidating act, brought together the provisions of Part III of the 1996 Act and previous registration legislation. The Architects Registration Board then established with a majority of appointed lay members and a minority of elected Architect members.

'''''2008''''' - [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==The present legislation==

===Summary of legislative history===

The following analysis of the operative and other parts of the Architects Act 1997 as it was before the [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment of June 2008]] pays attention to details which sometimes go unnoticed.

The Act is fairly short. That is partly due to its conciseness, but this quality makes it all the more necessary to remember that the Act must be read as a whole to ascertain the meaning and effect of its various parts. Care is needed not to read into it what is not there (whatever conventional wisdom may have supposed or desired), and not to fail to notice what actually is there. In particular, like many such Acts, it can be better understood by looking at its beginning (Arrangement of Sections and long title) and its end (derivations), as well as the operative part in between.

Its long title is "An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects". The Table of Derivations printed at the end lists the enactments which it consolidated; and Schedule 3 lists the originating and two amending Acts which it repealed, namely: the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Architects Registration Act 1938 and parts of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.

The unbroken continuity of these enactments is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2:

:''"the Council" means the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''

The changes made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act as amended can be deduced from the Table of Derivations. This also shows that, for the purpose of the consolidation, certain definitions were inserted in the "Interpretation" section. These included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not vice versa). In subsection 14(1) the phrase is expanded as: "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

===The "burdens" and "choices"===

The scheme of the consolidation Act of 1997 is identical with that of the originating Act of 1931, as amended. It is as follows:

:It operates by imposing (under Part IV) one kind of burden, backed by threat of penal sanction, on persons carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]] generally, but at the same time giving to one particular group of persons a statutory right to choose instead to submit to another kind of burden, and to another group of persons the statutory right to choose to submit to a third kind of burden.&lt;ref&gt;For the statutory meaning of "burden" see: s.1(5)(b) of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940040_en_1.htm Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994]; s.2 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010006.htm Regulatory Reform Act 2001], and s.1 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the first is described as the "general burden"; the other two as the "voluntary burdens"; and the freedom to choose the "statutory choices".

The general burden is a prohibition imposed on all persons, firms, partnerships and bodies corporate carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]], including architects and [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architects]]. The prohibition is against practising or carrying on business under the title of "[[architect]]", with two exceptions, viz.:

:*In the case of an individual, s/he has opted for one of the voluntary burdens and is registered or enrolled under the Act.

:*In the case of a business entity (body corporate, firm or partnership) it has opted for the other of the voluntary burdens, in that its business so far as it relates to architecture satisfies the statutory requirement to be under the control, management and supervision of a registered person.

Here, the first of these is described as a "practice volunteer", and the second as a "business volunteer".

The statutory choice is exercisable:

:*In the case of a practice volunteer, by applying for registration in the [[Register of Architects]] and paying the annual retention fee (under sections 4 to 11), or by enrolling in the statutory list of visiting EEA architects (under section 12).

:*In the case of a business volunteer, by complying with the control, management and supervision requirements (of subsection 20(3)).

The voluntary burdens which result from the exercise of the statutory choice are as follows:

:*In the case of a registered person, to submit to the regime imposed on registered persons under sections 4 to 11 of Part II (payment of fees and satisfying requirements about qualifications and competence) and Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a person enrolled in the list of visiting EEA architects, to submit to the regime of section 12 and of Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a business volunteer, to submit to the regime for control, management and supervision imposed by subsection 20(3) and be liable to supply the Board with information showing compliance.

In consequence:

:*any person or business entity is free to supply services of the same kind as a registered person, but may only use the title "[[architect]]" in this connection subject to one of the voluntary burdens; and

:*a [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architect]] may only use this title in the course of professional practice if s/he has opted to submit to one of the voluntary burdens, normally as a registered person.

===Side effects===

A side effect of the Act is the imposition of burdens on third parties under Part II, namely, [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]], but the effect of the changes made by the 1996 Act is that Schools of Architecture have disappeared from the legislation without trace. The result has been a certain amount of wrangling between the Schools, the ARB and the RIBA which is the principal professional body, whose concerns inevitably include architectural education.

Another side effect has been a claim by the ARB to be able to impose on registered persons certain requirements about Professional Indemnity Insurance.

===The Board and its duties===

The membership of the Board is the result of one of the changes made by the 1996 Act to the registration body's previous constitution when its name had been the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. The Act abolished the [[Board of Architectural Education]], renamed the Council as the Board, and made this Board consist predominantly of persons appointed by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

Subsection 3(4) states "The Board shall publish the current version of the Register annually...". Provisions of Part II of the Act prescribe how the Register shall be kept up to date, and who shall be entitled to be registered; other provisions of Parts II and III prescribe for the Board the circumstances, events or conditions when a person's name shall be removed from the Register; and other provisions prescribe for the Board certain ancillary, or derivative and secondary, duties in connection with the Board's primary responsibility for the maintenance and regular publication of the [[Register of Architects]].

Apart from officers, employees and agents of the Board, the Act creates no duties or obligations towards the Board which fall on any one else at all; and nothing in the Act itself creates any obligation which an architect owes to the Board.

===Not delegated===

Section 20 of the Architects Act 1997 mentions "architecture" (subsection (3)(b)) and the "services" of a person enrolled under the Act (subsection (5)). These are not defined by the Act, and it is quite obvious that [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] has not delegated to the Board the power to define them. In practice, as technology and the building process continue to evolve new specialisms, the concept of architecture can be seen as becoming ever more fluid, extensive and comprehensive, and at the same time becoming narrower while ever more ancillary specialities are identified.

==The Board's Professional Conduct Committee==

Sanctions are available to the Board under Part III of the Act against any person on the register who is found guilty under section 15 of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence, or else has been convicted with a criminal offence which has relevance to fitness to practise.

Although a criminal conviction is an objective criterion, no statutory definition is given that defines the level of professional conduct or incompetence that will attract a sanction, judgment in the matter being given to the Board's Professional Conduct Committee, subject to commonsense, reason and judicial review.

The PCC is constituted under the Act, Schedule 1 Part II, as amended. The Committee includes members of the Board, both elected and appointed, as well as persons appointed by the Board and nominees of the President of the Law Society. A bare quorum of the Committee meets for a disciplinary hearing, comprising a nominee of the President of the Law Society (invariably a [[solicitor]]), a person from the Register and another not on the Register. PCC members are paid for their service.

==Categorisation==
The [[Architects Registration Board]] is admittedly not a professional body or society in the sense explained in Wikipedia article "[[British Professional Bodies]]". The question whether or not it is a "[[regulatory agency]]" was publicly considered in 2003. The June 2003 issue of the ''[[RIBA Journal]]'' included the following:

:''"The words 'regulator' and 'regulation' are not used in the Act and that status is not conferred upon the Board. It could be argued that the Board's assumption of this role is adverse to the public interest... A contrary proposition to the Board's claim is that an essential characteristic of a regulatory body in this context is to have jurisdiction or control over particular functions or activities in the supply of goods or services... whether or not the regulatory method is in conjunction with a system of certificating or licensing (such as applies to solicitors or places of entertainment)... The Board's claim to regulatory status appears to be the result of want of understanding how it can usefully go about fulfilling the services that have been assigned to it by statute for the public benefit..."''&lt;ref&gt;''RIBA Journal'', June 2003, referred to on page 1 of ''The Status of the Architects Registration Board.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003 the [[Architects Registration Board]] published a summary of a barrister's opinion which included the following:

:''"The Board as 'Regulator'. It has been suggested that the Board is not a 'regulator' of the architects’ profession... The precise generic description that any individual chooses to give to the collection of statutory duties imposed upon, and the powers available to, the Board under the 1997 Act is in any event irrelevant for the purposes of the questions asked,"'' [by the Board when obtaining this information for its own use] ''"for they largely involve issues of statutory interpretation which require the legislation to be construed and not given epithets."''&lt;ref&gt;For curbs on regulatory functions, see the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative &amp; Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and its Explanatory Note].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of "Chartered Practice"==

The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], which is a professional body (see Wikipedia category list [[British Professional Bodies]]), operates a voluntary "Chartered Practice" scheme. The use of the title "Chartered Practice" is authorised under Article 4.7 of the RIBA Charter (see reference below). The Institute's website explains that the scheme requires all architectural work of a Chartered Practice to be under the supervision of a Chartered Architect. A directory listing Chartered Practices has been published annually by the Institute from 2007.

==Qualification for registration==

The standard of qualification is not equal for all persons applying to be included in the [[Register of Architects]].

The Registrar is bound, under section 4 of the Architects Act, to register any person who applies for registration if that person has "such qualifications and has gained such practical experience as may be prescribed".

An alternative route to registration is to satisfy the Board that an equivalent standard of competence has been achieved. A matrix can be applied as follows:

{| border="1"
! Qualifications !! Practical experience !! RIBA Part III
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in UK
| ''Required''
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in UK
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|}

The disparity arises from the [[European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Qualifications in Architecture 85/384/EC. (Go to Article 4 of the main text for the required duration of training. The original Directive has been updated.) It is clearly stated in that Directive that "the total length of education and training shall consist of a minimum of either four years of full-time studies at a university or comparable educational establishment or at least six years of study at a university or comparable educational establishment of which at least three must be full time".

As this is a minimum requirement there is nothing to stop a country applying higher standards to those obtaining qualifications and experience within its own jurisdiction. However it is widely held (and expressed in the report of Michael Highton to the RIBA Council) that any challenge to this disparity is likely to succeed on the grounds of irrationality. The report stated:

:''"In our view it is only a matter of time before a UK student, who has been denied registration on the grounds that he or she has not passed the Part 3 examination, yet who has been educated in the UK and achieved two years practical experience in the UK, successfully challenges such a decision on the basis that it is irrational to require a UK based student to possess a higher level of qualification and experience than is required of a non-UK based student or architect."''

If the Architects Registration Board reduced the registration requirement to four years full-time study, there is no reason why the RIBA should lower its entry standard.

==Break in annually produced copies of the Register==
At a time when there had occurred a hiatus in production under the legislation of printed copies of the Register in the annual series from 1933, the [[Architects Registration Board]] made a new departure and in 2012 announced an online version of the Register which registered persons were invited to use for demonstrating their professionalism to members of the public and to non-registered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architects-register.org.uk/ The Register of Architects] and as explained in ARB ebulletin of May 2012 {{cite web |url=http://www2.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120604184515/http%3A//www.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roslin Institute''' is an [[animal sciences]] research institute at Easter Bush, [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]], part of the [[University of Edinburgh]], and is funded by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/ |title=The Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh) - Home Page |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2017, Professor Eleanor Riley became the Director of the Roslin Institute and Dean of Research at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies of the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eid.ed.ac.uk/news/eleanor-riley-be-new-director-roslin-institute|title=Eleanor Riley to be new Director of the Roslin Institute {{!}} Edinburgh Infectious Diseases|website=www.eid.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace [[Professor]] [[David Hume (scientist)|David Hume]]. 

==History==

The Roslin Institute was established in 1993 as an entirely owned but then as an independent institute of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. However, its former are closely associated to animal genetics research unit at the University of Edinburgh in 1919.

==Honors==

The Institute won international fame in 1996, when [[Ian Wilmut]], [[Keith Campbell (biologist)|Keith Campbell]] and their colleagues created [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]], the first [[mammal]] to be [[cloning|cloned]] from an adult cell, at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = K.

Roslin has made many other contributions to animal sciences, especially in the area of livestock improvement and welfare through applications of Quantitative Genetics.  In 2007 a Roslin team developed genetically modified chickens capable of laying eggs containing proteins needed to make cancer-fighting drugs.

==Aims and objectives==

The Roslin Institute aims to enhance the lives of animals and humans through world class research in animal biology.  The principal objectives are to:

* Enhance animal health and welfare through knowledge of genetic factors affecting resistance to disease.
* Enhance sustainability and productivity of livestock systems and food supply chains through understanding of reproductive and developmental biology.
* Enhance food safety by understanding interactions between disease causing organisms and animals.
* Enhance human health through an understanding of basic mechanisms of health and disease and comparative biology of animal species.
* Identify new and emerging zoonoses and understand how pathogens might cross from animals to humans.
* Enhance quality of life for animals by studying the mechanisms and behaviours associated with optimising their environment and life experiences.

==Research==

The Roslin Institute are categorized by four Scientific Divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/research|title=Research at Roslin Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Developmental biology
* Genetics and genomics
* Infection and immunity
* Clinical sciences

==New building==

In April 2007, The Roslin Institute was joined by the Neuropathogenesis Unit of the [[Institute for Animal Health]], well known for its role in deciphering the biology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad cow disease, scrapie, CJD). In 2008, the Institute was incorporated with the [[Royal School of Veterinary Studies]] within the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine of The University of Edinburgh. There are currently more than 500 staff and students.

In March 2011, The Roslin Institute moved from its previous home in [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]], a village in [[Midlothian]], to a £60.6M building on the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s Veterinary Campus at Easter Bush, across the road from the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies' new teaching building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| issue = 2 
| pages = 34–34 
| year = 2011 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by global architecture firm, [[HDR, Inc.]]

The Roslin Institute and Vet School are part of a formal consortium, the Easter Bush Research Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrc.ac.uk/ ebrc.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Moredun Research Institute]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural College]].

The '''Rowman &amp; Littlefield Award in Innovative Teaching''' is the only national teaching award in [[political science]] given in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=GMU-Mayer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policy.gmu.edu/faculty/mayer/index.html|title=Jeremy Mayer, Associate, Professor and Director, Master's of Public Policy program|publisher=[[George Mason University School of Public Policy|School of Public Policy]] of [[George Mason University]]|accessdate=2008-07-12|date=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been awarded annually by the [[American Political Science Association]]&lt;ref name=APSA-VanVechten&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/content_53678.cfm|title=Professor Van Vechten Named to Receive 2008 Roman ''{{black|(sic)}}'' &amp; Littlefield Award |publisher=[[American Political Science Association]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |date=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first awarded in 1996.&lt;ref name=APSA-Rowman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section_481.cfm|title=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Award for Innovative Teaching in Political Science|publisher=[[American Political Science Association]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |date=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is sponsored by [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]].  It carries a [[US Dollar|US$]]500 cash [[stipend]] and is presented at the APSA's Annual Meeting to a winner selected from political science professors nominated by members of the award committee, chaired by L. Sandy Maisel, Professor of Government and Director of the [[Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement]] at [[Colby College]] in [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], [[Maine]].&lt;ref name=APSA-Rowman /&gt;  

According to the Association, the Award recognizes developers of "effective new approaches to teaching" among political scientists.  Its intent is to honor a wide range of new directions, rather than one in particular.  The annual winner is chosen from among a pool of nominees whose innovations had moved [[political science]] [[pedagogy]] forward.&lt;ref name=APSA-VanVechten /&gt;

==Recipients==

===2008===
The 2008 award was presented to Professor [[Renée Van Vechten]] of the [[University of Redlands]] Department of Government.  Van Vechten received the award for work done on collaborative simulations;  she created and facilitated three simultaneous interactive simulations, one where her students simulated [[Member of Congress|Members of Congress]] in her Congress course and two in her Introduction to American Governments courses, with one class playing lobbyists and the other playing the constituents of the Congressmembers.&lt;ref name=APSA-VanVechten /&gt;&lt;ref name=APSA-Rowman /&gt;

===2007===
Professors [[James Meernik]] and [[Kimi King]] of the [[University of North Texas]] for their  jointly taught study abroad class entitled ''[[International Law]]: Peace and Justice'', an intensive three-week program at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].  Students receive access to top officials, including two of the ICTY presidents and 10 of the ICTY judges, as well as to attorneys and to tribunal testimony.&lt;ref name=APSA-Rowman /&gt;

===2005===
The 2005 winner was Professor Barbara Allen of [[Carleton College]].&lt;ref name=APSA-Rowman /&gt;

[[Jeremy Mayer]], a [[professor]] of [[public policy]] and [[political science]] at the [[George Mason University School of Public Policy|School of Public Policy]] of [[George Mason University]], is a past winner of the Award.&lt;ref name=GMU-Mayer /&gt;

The '''Solar System'''&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;[[Capitalization]] of the name varies. The [[International Astronomical Union]], the authoritative body regarding astronomical nomenclature, specifies capitalizing the names of all individual astronomical objects, but uses mixed "Solar System" and "solar system" in their [http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/ naming guidelines document].

See [[Former planets]].&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder being smaller objects, such as the [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Dwarf planets|five dwarf planets]] and [[small Solar System bodies]]. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the [[Natural satellite|moons]]—two are larger than the smallest planet, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The two moons larger than Mercury are [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], which orbits [[Jupiter]], and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which orbits [[Saturn]]. Although bigger than Mercury, both moons have less than half the mass of Mercury.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solar System [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formed 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years ago]] from the [[gravitational collapse]] of a giant interstellar [[molecular cloud]]. The vast majority of the system's [[mass]] is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in [[Jupiter]]. The four smaller inner planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]] and [[Mars]], are [[terrestrial planet]]s, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are [[giant planet]]s, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], are [[gas giant]]s, being composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]; the two outermost planets, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], are [[ice giant]]s, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called [[volatiles]], such as water, [[ammonia]] and [[methane]]. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the [[ecliptic]].

The Solar System also contains smaller objects.{{refn |According to [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions]], objects orbiting the Sun are classified dynamically and physically into three categories: ''planets'', ''dwarf planets'', and ''small Solar System bodies''.
* A [[planet]] is any body orbiting the Sun whose [[mass]] is sufficient for [[Gravitation|gravity]] to have pulled it into a (near-)[[Sphere|spherical]] shape and that has [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its immediate neighbourhood]] of all smaller objects.

The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the [[interstellar medium]] known as the [[heliosphere]]. The [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the [[interstellar medium]]; it extends out to the edge of the [[scattered disc]]. The [[Oort cloud]], which is thought to be the source for [[long-period comet]]s, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the [[Orion Arm]], 26,000 light-years from the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the [[Late Middle Ages]]–[[Renaissance]] believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the [[universe]] and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristarchus of Samos]] had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was the first to develop a mathematically predictive [[heliocentric]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= The astronomical system of Copernicus|author=WC Rufus|magazine=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]|volume=31|page=510|date= 1923|bibcode=1923PA.....31..510R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Copernicus, Darwin, &amp; Freud: revolutions in the history and philosophy of science |first=Friedel |last=Weinert |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |date=2009 |page=21 |isbn=978-1405181839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects.

Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called [[natural satellite]]s, or moons (two of which, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], are larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), and, in the case of the four giant planets, by [[planetary ring]]s, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in [[synchronous rotation]], with one face permanently turned toward their parent.

[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] describe the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an [[ellipse]] with the Sun at one [[focus (geometry)|focus]]. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]]) travel more quickly because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its ''[[perihelion]]'', whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its ''[[aphelion]]''. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using [[numerical model of the Solar System|numerical models]].

Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref name="Marochnik1995"&gt;{{cite conference | isbn=0937707937 |author1=Marochnik, L. |author2=Mukhin, L. |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Is Solar System Evolution Cometary Dominated? | booktitle = Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | date = 1995| series = Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series | volume = 74 | editor = Shostak, G.S. | page = 83 | bibcode = 1995ASPC...74...83M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bi | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Li | first2 = T.D. | last3 = Li | first3 = L.H. | last4 = Yang | first4 = W.M. | title = Solar Models with Revised Abundance | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/731/2/L42 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 731 | issue = 2 | pages = L42 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = |arxiv = 1104.1032 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...731L..42B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.&lt;ref name="Marochnik1995" /&gt;

=== Distances and scales ===
The distance&lt;!--at this precision, doesn't matter which distance is measured--&gt; from Earth to the Sun is {{convert|1|AU|km mi|lk=on|abbr=~}}. For comparison, the radius of the Sun is {{cvt|0.0047|AU|km|sigfig=1}}. Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is {{convert|5.2|AU|km}} from the Sun and has a radius of {{convert|71000|km|AU|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is {{convert|30|AU|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from the Sun.

With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the [[Titius–Bode law]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn: A Journey to the Beginning of the Solar System |work=Space Physics Center: UCLA |url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/background.html |date=2005 |accessdate=3 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524184638/http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/background.html |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no such theory has been accepted.

If the Sun–Neptune distance is [[Solar System model|scaled]] to 100 metres, then the Sun would be about 3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3&amp;nbsp;mm, and Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3&amp;nbsp;mm) at this scale.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web | date=9 July 2004 | url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/5-8/features/F_Solar_System_Scale.html | title=Solar System Scale | work=NASA Educator Features | author=Office of Space Science | accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover [[small Solar System body|minor bodies]].

Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the [[asteroid belt]], [[Kuiper belt]], and [[Oort cloud]]. The [[Nice model]] is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.

Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of [[hydrogen]] in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin [[nuclear fusion|thermonuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=Yi2001&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sukyoung Yi |author2=Pierre Demarque |author3=Yong-Cheol Kim |author4=Young-Wook Lee |author5=Chang H.

The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a [[red giant]]. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.&lt;ref name=mnras386_1 /&gt; The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a [[white dwarf]], an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pogge, Richard W. |date=1997 |url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Lectures/vistas97.html |title=The Once &amp; Future Sun |work=New Vistas in Astronomy |accessdate=7 December 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050527094435/http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/Vistas/ |archivedate=27 May 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a [[planetary nebula]], returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with [[metallicity|heavier elements]] like carbon—to the interstellar medium.

==== Asteroid groups ====
: Asteroids in the asteroid belt are divided into [[asteroid group]]s and [[Asteroid family|families]] based on their orbital characteristics. [[Asteroid moon]]s are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The asteroid belt also contains [[main-belt comet]]s, which may have been the source of Earth's water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006 |author=Phil Berardelli |title=Main-Belt Comets May Have Been Source of Earths Water |work=SpaceDaily |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Main_Belt_Comets_May_Have_Been_Source_Of_Earths_Water.html |accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outer Solar System ==
The outer region of the Solar System is home to the [[giant planet]]s and their large moons. The [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]] and many [[short-period comet]]s also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.

== Comets ==
[[File:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997 hires adj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hale–Bopp]] seen in 1997]]
{{main|Comet}}

Comets are small Solar System bodies,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=footnoteB /&gt; typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] and [[ion]]ise, creating a [[coma (cometary)|coma]]: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.

Short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], are thought to originate in the [[#Oort cloud|Oort cloud]]. Many comet groups, such as the [[Kreutz Sungrazers]], formed from the breakup of a single parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sekanina, Zdeněk |date=2001 |title=Kreutz sungrazers: the ultimate case of cometary fragmentation and disintegration? |volume=89 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic |pages=78–93 |bibcode=2001PAICz..89...78S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some comets with [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult.&lt;ref name="hyperbolic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Królikowska |first=M. |date=2001 |title=A study of the original orbits of ''hyperbolic'' comets |journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] |volume=376 |issue=1 |pages=316–324 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20010945 |bibcode=2001A&amp;A...376..316K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whipple |first1=Fred L. |title=The activities of comets related to their aging and origin |journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]] |volume=54 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–11 |date=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF00049540 |bibcode=1992CeMDA..54....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trans-Neptunian region ==
Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the "[[trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian region]]", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is [[Orbital inclination|tilted toward the plane]] of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt. The entire region is still [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|largely unexplored]]. It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds—the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moon—composed mainly of rock and ice. This region is sometimes described as the "third zone of the Solar System", enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/journey-to-the-solar-systems-third-zone |title=Journey to the Solar System's Third Zone |author=[[Alan Stern]] |work=American Scientist |date=February 2015 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pluto and Charon ====
{{main|Pluto|Charon (moon)}}
: The dwarf planet Pluto (39&amp;nbsp;AU average) is the largest known object in the Kuiper belt. When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal [[definition of planet]]. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5&amp;nbsp;AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called [[plutino]]s.&lt;ref name="Fajans_et_al_2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fajans |first=J. |author2=L.

:Charon, the largest of [[Moons of Pluto|Pluto's moons]], is sometimes described as part of a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] with Pluto, as the two bodies orbit a [[barycentre]] of gravity above their surfaces (i.e. they appear to "orbit each other"). Beyond Charon, four much smaller moons, [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]], orbit within the system.

==== Makemake and Haumea ====
{{main|Makemake|Haumea}}

:Makemake (45.79&amp;nbsp;AU average), although smaller than Pluto, is the largest known object in the [[Classical Kuiper belt object|''classical'' Kuiper belt]] (that is, a Kuiper belt object not in a confirmed [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|resonance]] with Neptune). Makemake is the brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto.

=== Scattered disc ===
{{main|Scattered disc}}
The scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends much further outwards, is thought to be the source of short-period comets. Scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Planetary migration|Neptune's early outward migration]]. Most scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as "scattered Kuiper belt objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005 |author=David Jewitt |title=The 1000 km Scale KBOs |work=University of Hawaii |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/big_kbo.html |accessdate=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Centaurs.html |title=List of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects |work=IAU: Minor Planet Center |accessdate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the most massive of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]]. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a [[perihelion]] of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an [[aphelion]] of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane.

The point at which the Solar System ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this ''heliopause'', the outer boundary of the [[#Heliosphere|heliosphere]], is considered the beginning of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name="Voyager" /&gt; The Sun's [[Hill sphere]], the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized [[#Oort cloud|Oort cloud]].&lt;ref name=Littmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Littmann|first=Mark|title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System|date=2004|pages=162–163|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486436029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Heliosphere}}
[[File:NewHeliopause 558121.jpg|thumb|left|The bubble-like [[heliosphere]] with its various transitional regions moving through the [[interstellar medium]]]]

The heliosphere is a [[stellar-wind bubble]], a region of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km/s its [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the [[interstellar medium]].

The collision occurs at the ''termination shock'', which is roughly 80–100&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun downwind.&lt;ref name=fahr /&gt; Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent,&lt;ref name=fahr /&gt; forming a great oval structure known as the ''heliosheath''. This structure is thought to look and behave very much like a comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40&amp;nbsp;AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from ''[[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]]'' and [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cassini's Big Sky: The View from the Center of Our Solar System |publisher=NASA/JPL |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=2370&amp;msource=F20091119&amp;tr=y&amp;auid=5615216 |date=2009 |accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the [[fluid dynamics]] of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as [[solar magnetic field]]s prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9&amp;nbsp;AU farther than the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="fahr"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2000 |title=A 5-fluid hydrodynamic approach to model the Solar System-interstellar medium interaction |journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] | volume=357 | page=268 |url=http://aa.springer.de/papers/0357001/2300268.pdf | format=PDF | bibcode=2000A&amp;A...357..268F |author1=Fahr |first1=H.

=== Detached objects ===
{{main|Detached object|Sednoid}}
[[90377 Sedna]] (520 AU average) is a large, reddish object with a gigantic, highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76&amp;nbsp;AU at perihelion to 940&amp;nbsp;AU at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], who discovered the object in 2003, asserts that it cannot be part of the [[scattered disc]] or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed "distant detached objects" (DDOs), which also may include the object {{mpl-|148209|2000 CR|105}}, which has a perihelion of 45&amp;nbsp;AU, an aphelion of 415&amp;nbsp;AU, and an orbital period of 3,420 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2004 |author=David Jewitt |title=Sedna – 2003 VB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; |work=University of Hawaii |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/sedna.html|accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown terms this population the "inner Oort cloud" because it may have formed through a similar process, although it is far closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sedna |author=Mike Brown |date=2004 |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/sedna/ |work=Caltech |accessdate=2 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined.

[[File:Kuiper oort-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of the hypothetical {{nowrap|[[Oort cloud]]}}, with a spherical outer cloud and a disc-shaped inner cloud]]
The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000&amp;nbsp;AU (around 1&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]] (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000&amp;nbsp;AU (1.87&amp;nbsp;ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the [[galactic tide]], the [[tidal force]] exerted by the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2001 |vauthors=Stern SA, Weissman PR |title=Rapid collisional evolution of comets during the formation of the Oort cloud. |volume=409 |issue=6820 |pages=589–591 |work=Space Studies Department, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11214311&amp;dopt=Citation |accessdate=19 November 2006|doi=10.1038/35054508 |pmid=11214311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006 |author=Bill Arnett |title=The Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud |website=Nine Planets |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/kboc.html |accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the furthest known objects, such as [[Comet West]], have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun, but as the Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.

The Solar System's location in the Milky Way is a factor in the [[evolutionary history of life]] on Earth.

Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the [[#Oort cloud|Oort cloud]] and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life.&lt;ref name=astrobiology /&gt; Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005 |title=Supernova Explosion May Have Caused Mammoth Extinction |work=Physorg.com |url=http://www.physorg.com/news6734.html |accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with extrasolar systems ===
Compared to many other [[planetary system]]s, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury.&lt;ref name=Martin082015&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00931 The Solar System as an Exoplanetary System], Rebecca G.

Also, these super-Earths have closer orbits than Mercury.&lt;ref name=Martin082015/&gt; This led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06558 Consolidating and Crushing Exoplanets: Did it happen here?], Kathryn Volk, Brett Gladman, (Submitted on 23 February 2015 (v1), last revised 27 May 2015 (this version, v2))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/mercury-sole-survivor-of-close-orbiting-planets Mercury Sole Survivor of Close Orbiting Planets], Nola Taylor Redd. 8 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbits of Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref name=Martin082015/&gt; Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.&lt;ref name=Martin082015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404240 Final Stages of Planet Formation], Peter Goldreich, Yoram Lithwick, Re'em Sari, (Submitted on 13 April 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supergalactic coordinates''' are [[coordinates]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]] which was designed to have its [[equator]] aligned with the '''supergalactic plane''', a major structure in the local universe formed by the preferential distribution of nearby [[galaxy cluster]]s (such as the [[Virgo cluster]], the [[Great Attractor]] and the [[Pisces-Perseus supercluster]]) towards a (two-dimensional) [[plane (mathematics)|plane]].  The supergalactic plane was recognized by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] in 1953 from the [[Shapley-Ames Catalog]], although a flattened distribution of [[nebula]]e had been noted by [[William Herschel]] over 200 years earlier. [[Vera Rubin]] had also identified the supergalactic plane in the 1950s, but her data remained unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/10/vera-rubin|title=How Vera Rubin Discovered Dark Matter|last=Scoles|first=Sarah|date=4 October 2016|work=Astronomy.com|access-date=2017-10-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, supergalactic latitude and supergalactic longitude are usually denoted by SGB and SGL, respectively, by analogy to {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''l''}} conventionally used for [[galactic coordinates]].  The zero point for supergalactic longitude is defined by the intersection of this plane with the galactic plane.

==Definition==
*The north supergalactic pole (SGB = 90°) lies at galactic coordinates ({{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 47.37°, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} = +6.32°). In the [[equatorial coordinate system]] ([[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[J2000]]), this is approximately [[right ascension|RA]] = 18.9&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, [[declination|Dec]] = +15.7°.
*The zero point (SGB = 0°, SGL = 0°) lies at (''l''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 137.37°, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0°). In J2000 equatorial coordinates, this is approximately 2.82&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, +59.5°.
So the transformation from a triple of Cartesian supergalactic coordinates to a triple of galactic coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}_\text{gal} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos l_x \cos b_x &amp; \sin l_z \cos b_z \sin b_x - \sin b_z \sin l_x \cos b_x &amp; \cos l_z \cos b_z \\
    \sin l_x \cos b_x &amp; \sin b_z \cos l_x \cos b_x - \cos l_z \cos b_z \sin b_x &amp; \sin l_z \cos b_z \\
             \sin b_x &amp; \cos b_z \cos b_x \sin\left(l_x - l_z\right)                       &amp; \sin b_z
 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}_\text{superg}
&lt;/math&gt;

The left column in this matrix is the image of the origin of the supergalactic system in the galactic system, the right column in this matrix is the image of the north pole of the supergalactic coordinates in the galactic system, and the middle column is the cross product (to complete the right handed coordinate system).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="613">The '''tactical diameter''' of a [[ship]] is the distance:
* travelled on sea surface
* during a [[turning circle]] test
* with maximum rudder angle
* by the [[center of gravity]] of a ship
* taken perpendicular to the initial track followed at approach speed
* when the heading has changed by 180°

The ratio of the tactical diameter divided by the ship's length between [[perpendicular]]s gives a dimensionless parameter which can be used to compare ships maneuverability.

'''Tagundaing''' ({{lang-my|တံခွန်တိုင်}}) refers to an ornamented [[victory column]] or [[Flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]], typically {{convert|60|to|80|ft}}, found within the grounds of [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhist]] [[pagoda]]s and [[kyaung]]s (monasteries).&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niu.edu/burma/collections/art/sculptures/sculpture_38.shtml|title=Tagundaing|work=Burma Collections|publisher=Center for Burma Studies, Northern Illinois University|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ferrars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrars|first=Max|author2=Bertha Ferrars |title=Burma|publisher=S. Low, Marston &amp; Company|year=1900|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ornamented columns were raised within religious compounds to celebrate the submission of [[nat (spirit)|nats]] (local animistic spirits) to the [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dhamma]], the Buddhist doctrine and inspired by the [[Pillars of Ashoka]].&lt;ref name="niu"/&gt;

A mythical [[Hamsa (bird)|hintha]] (or more rarely a [[kinnara]]) is generally found perching atop the column, while the base of the column may be decorated with [[Thagyamin]].&lt;ref name="niu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ferrars"/&gt; [[Vasudhara]], the earth goddess, may also be found at the base.&lt;ref name="niu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">{{Distinguish|Units of measurement}}
In [[statistics]], a '''unit of observation''' is the unit described by the [[data]] that one analyzes. For example, in a study of the [[demand for money]], the unit of observation might be chosen as the individual, with different observations ('''data point'''s) for a given point in time differing as to which individual they refer to; or the unit of observation might be the country, with different observations differing only in regard to the country they refer to. A study may have a differing unit of observation and [[unit of analysis]]: for example, in [[community]] research, the [[research design]] may collect data at the individual level of observation but the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] might be at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals. Together, the unit of observation and the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] define the [[Sample population|population]] of a research enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blalock |first=Hubert M., Jr. |year=1972 |title=Social Statistics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |isbn=0-07-005751-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data point==
A '''data point''' or '''observation''' is a set of one or more [[Level of measurement|measurement]]s on a single member of unit of observation. For example, in a study of the determinants of [[money demand]] with the [[unit of observation]] being the individual, a data point might be the values of income, wealth, age of individual, and number of dependents. [[Statistical inference]] about the population would be conducted using a [[statistical sample]] consisting of various such data points.

In addition, in [[statistical graphics]], a "data point" may be an individual item with a statistical display; such points may relate to either a single member of a population or to a [[summary statistic]] calculated for a given subpopulation.

==Types of data==
The measurements contained a unit of observation are formally ''typed'', where here ''type'' is used in a way compatible with [[datatype]] in [[computing]]; so that the type of measurement can specify whether the measurement results in a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value from {yes, no}, an [[integer]] or [[real number]], the identity of some [[Category (mathematics)|category]], or some [[vector space|vector]] or [[Array data structure|array]]. 

The implication of ''point'' is often that the data may be plotted in a graphic display, but in many cases the data are [[data processing|processed numerically]] before that is done. In the context of [[statistical graphics]], measured values for individuals or summary statistics for different subpopulations are displayed as separate symbols within a display; since such symbols can differ by shape, size and colour, a single ''data point'' within a display can convey multiple aspects of the set of measurements for an individual or subpopulation.

The [[Visigoths]] entered [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) in 415, and they rose to be the dominant people there until the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of 711 brought their kingdom to an end.

This period in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] art is dominated by their style. '''Visigothic art''' is generally considered in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world to be a strain of [[Migration art]], while the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking worlds generally classify it as [[Pre-Romanesque]].

Branches of Visigothic art include their [[architecture]], their crafts (especially jewellery), and even their [[Visigothic script|script]].

==Visigothic architecture==

The only remaining examples of their architecture from the 6th century are the church of [[San Cugat del Vallés]] in [[Barcelona]], the hermitage and church of [[Santa Maria de Lara]] in Burgos, [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in ([[Braga]]), the [[Igreja de São Gião|church of São Gião]] in ([[Nazaré (Portugal)|Nazaré]]) and the few remnants of the church at [[Cabeza de Griego]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]. However, their style developed over the next centuries, though the prime remaining examples of it are mostly rural and often run-down. Some of the characteristics of their architecture are:
* Generally [[basilica]]n in layout, sometimes a [[Greek cross]] plan or, more rarely, a combination of the two. The spaces are highly compartmentalised.
* Horseshoe [[arch]]es without [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]].
* A rectangular, exterior [[apse]].
* Use of [[column]]s and pillars with Corinthian [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of unique design.
* [[Barrel vault]]s with [[cupola]]s at the crosses.
* Walls of [[ashlar]] blocks, occasionally alternating with Roman brickwork.
* Decoration commonly of animal or plant motifs.

Exemplars include:
* [[Church of San Juan Bautista, Baños de Cerrato|Church of San Juan Bautista]] in [[Baños de Cerrato]] ([[province of Palencia]])
* [[Crypt of San Antolín (Palencia)|Crypt of San Antolín]] in the [[cathedral of Palencia]] ([[province of Palencia]])
