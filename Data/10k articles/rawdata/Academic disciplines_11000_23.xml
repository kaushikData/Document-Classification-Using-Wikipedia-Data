'''''A Naturalist in Indian Seas''''', or, '''''Four Years with the Royal Indian Marine Survey Ship Investigator''''' is a 1902 publication by [[Alfred William Alcock]], a British [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[crustacean|carcinologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1903/02/14/archives/indian-seas-story-of-a-cruise-of-the-investigator-a-survey-ship.html INDIAN SEAS.; Story of a Cruise of the Investigator, a Survey Ship] ''New York Times'', February 14, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is mostly a narrative describing the ''Investigator''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s journey through areas of the [[Indian Ocean]], such as the [[Laccadive Sea]], the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Andaman Sea]].  It also details the history of the ''Investigator'', as well as the [[marine biology]] of the Indian Ocean.

The book is considered a classic in natural history travel,&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[William Thomas Calman|W. T. C.]], [[Stanley Wells Kemp|S. W. K.]] &amp; P.

'''Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College''' ('''ABAC''') is a state college of the [[University System of Georgia]]. Located in [[Tifton, Georgia]], ABAC offers [[bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] and [[associate degrees]]. The college is named after [[Abraham Baldwin]], a signer of the United States Constitution from Georgia and the first president of the [[University of Georgia]].

ABAC was established in 1908 as the '''Second District A&amp;M School'''.  The name was changed to the '''South Georgia A&amp;M College''' in 1924, and to the '''Georgia State College for Men''' in 1929.  It became Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in 1933 when ABAC became a part of the newly formed University System of Georgia.&lt;ref name="History of ABAC 1906 to Present"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abac.edu/history/documents/HISTORY_OF_ABAC.pdf |title=History of ABAC 1906 to Present |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123755/http://www.abac.edu/history/documents/HISTORY_OF_ABAC.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, ABAC's mission was devoted to associate level studies in agriculture, home economics, and related fields.  Today, ABAC offers a variety of bachelor's degree programs as well as associate degrees.

The college became the owner of [[Possum Poke]] in 1999.

==Academics==

The School of Agriculture and Natural Resources is the largest area of study at ABAC.  Nursing is the largest single major. This associate degree program prepares students to be certified as a [[Registered Nurse]] (R.N.).

Students can complete their bachelor's degrees at ABAC in Biology, Natural Resource Management (Forestry, Wildlife), Rural Studies (Arts and Culture, Business and Economic Development, Community and Social Affairs, Writing and Communication), Diversified Agriculture, and Turfgrass and Golf Course Management.  Over 50 associate degree programs are also available, in which students can spend two years at ABAC and then transfer to a university.

Learning laboratories such as the J.G. Woodroof Farm and the Forest Lakes Golf Club enhance the academic curriculum.  ABAC's 516-acre campus also includes the Georgia Museum of Agriculture and Historic Village, located one mile south of the main campus.  Key components of the museum include an 1890s village, a blacksmith shop, a grist mill, a cotton gin, a print shop, a saw mill, and a steam locomotive.

==Student life==
[[File:ABAC Students.jpg|thumb|Students at the ABAC campus]]
There are numerous student organizations on the ABAC campus. Students have the opportunity to get involved with organizations ranging from the Student Government Association to the Forestry-Wildlife Club.

===Campus media===
''The Stallion'' is the premier student newspaper in both the state and the southeast region. It wins annual awards for excellence in all categories, such as editorials, feature writing, photography, layout and design, given by the Georgia Press Association. Staff of the literary magazine, ''Pegasus'', and creative writing faculty sponsor numerous poetry readings each year. Other events include a Writer's Harvest and contributions to the George Scott Day festival.

ABAC also has its own radio station, WPLH 103.1.

===Athletics, music, and clubs===
Intercollegiate sports teams include baseball, golf, and tennis for men, and softball, tennis, and soccer for women. ABAC has five national championships, three in softball and two in men's tennis.

ABAC has achieved international attention through its music program. The music program at ABAC includes a jazz band, jazz choir, concert band, concert choir, bluegrass band, and pep band. The ABAC jazz band has been on three tours of Europe. ABAC vocalists performed in 2011 at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].

The ABAC Arts Connection brings art and cultural events to Tifton and surrounding counties. The Baldwin Players theatre troupe stage performances during the fall and spring semesters.

ABAC has a Greek system on campus with the [[Sigma Alpha]], [[Lambda Sigma Upsilon]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] and [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternities.

One of the more active clubs on campus is the Agricultural Engineering Technology Club. It is known for holding truck and tractor pulls on campus each fall and spring. The club maintains the ABAC Crackerjack pulling tractor, an Allis Chalmers 190XT, built in the 1970s by former staff member Jimmy Grubbs. The AET club has also recently completed work on a new pulling tractor, an AGCO Allis 9650, making the ABAC AET club the only college organization in the U.S. that currently has two running and competitive Super Farm pulling tractors. Almost all of the work building the new tractor and the work needed to maintain Crackerjack is performed by the students in the club. The club uses both tractors as recruiting tools not only for the organization, but for the school as well.

===Housing===
[[File:ABAC Lakeside.jpg|thumb|ABAC Lakeside]]
Over 1,200 students live on the ABAC campus in modern housing units. In ABAC Place, every student has a private bedroom in a four-bedroom, two-bath apartment. The ABAC Lakeside facility offers suite-style living for freshmen on the north shore of Lake Baldwin.

==Campus==

The ABAC campus is used as an open-air classroom for students in the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources due to the large number of trees, plants, shrubs, and fields on campus. ABAC faculty, staff, students and visitors also enjoy the well-manicured grounds of the college. A renovation project was recently completed for the original three buildings on campus, Tift, Lewis, and Herring Halls.  New landscaping and a new front lawn for ABAC were also a part of the renovation process. ABAC planned to start building a new Lab Science building, scheduled to break ground in the spring of 2015.

==Four-year curriculum==

ABAC continues to add bachelor's degree programs after receiving state college status from the Board of Regents. The college now offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology, a Bachelor of Applied Science in either Diversified Agriculture, Natural Resource Management or Turfgrass and Golf Course Management as well as a Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Arts in Rural Studies. Enrollment in ABAC's bachelor's degrees has quadrupled since their start in January 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2073">The '''accommodation index''' is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] used in the [[neuroscience]]s for describing [[spike train]] data. Many methods of experimental neuroscience, such as voltage clamp recordings, give their output in the form of measured voltages of individual neurons. Generally, the only important element of these voltage traces is the occurrence of spikes in the voltage, representing [[action potentials]]. It is often useful to be able to describe the data in terms of the spike timings, for instance we wish to optimize a compartmental model towards observed behaviour, then metrics such as this would be used as error functions. Various metrics are used to do this, such as [[spike rate]], average [[interspike interval]] and, the accommodation index.

It is similar to other measures of accommodation such as the local variance introduced by Shinomoto et al. in 2003. It is defined by the average of the difference in length of two consecutive interspike intervals (ISIs) normalized by the summed duration of these two ISIs.  The equation for the accommodation index is

&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{N-k-1}\displaystyle\sum_{i=k}^{N}\frac{(isi_i-isi_{i-1})}{(isi_i+isi_{i-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

Where N is the number of APs and k determines the number of ISIs that will be disregarded in order not to take into account possible transient behavior as observed in Markram et al., 2004. A reasonable value for k is either four ISIs or one-fifth of the total number of ISIs, whichever is the smaller of the two.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4580">'''Acid-neutralizing capacity''' or '''ANC''' in short is a measure for the overall buffering capacity against [[acid]]ification for a solution, e.g.  [[surface water]] or soil water.

ANC is defined as the difference between cations of strong bases and anions of strong acids (see below), or dynamically as the amount of acid needed to change the pH value from the sample's value to a chosen different value. &lt;ref&gt;Stumm, W. &amp; J. J. Morgan. 1981. Aquatic chemistry. New York: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-04831-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts [[alkalinity]] are nowadays often used as a synonym to positive ANC and similarly acidity is often used to mean negative ANC. Alkalinity and acidity however also have definitions based on an experimental setup (titration).

ANC is often used in models to calculate acidification levels from [[acid rain]] [[pollution]] in different geographical areas, and as a basis for calculating [[critical loads]] for forest soils and surface waters. 

[[Image:PH-ANCrelation.jpg|350px|right|Diagram showing sample pH-ANC relationships for natural waters]]
The relation between pH and ANC in natural waters depends on three conditions: Carbon dioxide, organic acids and aluminium solubility. The amount of dissolved carbon dioxide is usually higher than would be the case if there was an equilibrium with the carbon dioxide pressure in the atmosphere. This is due to biological activity: Decomposition of organic material releases carbon dioxide and thus increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide. An increase in carbon dioxide decreases pH but has no effect on ANC. Organic acids, often expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), also decrease pH and have no effect on ANC. Soil water in the upper layers usually have higher organic content than the lower soil layers. Surface waters with high DOC are typically found in areas where there is a lot of peat and bogs in the catchment. Aluminium solubility is a bit tricky and there are several curve fit variants used in modelling, one of the more common being

:&lt;math chem&gt;[\ce{Al^{3+}}] = k_G[\ce H^+]^3&lt;/math&gt;

In the illustration to the right, the relation between pH and ANC is shown for four different solutions. In the blue line the solution has 1 mg/l DOC, a dissolved amount of carbon dioxide that is equivalent to a solution being in equilibrium with an atmosphere with twice the carbon dioxide pressure of our atmosphere. For the other lines, all three parameters except one is the same as for the blue line. Thus the orange line is a solution loaded with organic acids, having a DOC of 80 mg/l (typically very brown lake water or water in the top soil layer in a forest soil). The red line has a high amount of dissolved carbon dioxide (pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=20 times ambient), a level that is not uncommon in ground water. Finally the black dotted line is a water with a lower aluminium solubility.

The reason why ANC is often defined as the difference between cations of strong bases and anions of strong acids is that ANC is derived from a charge balance: If we for simplicity consider a solution with only a few species and use the fact that a water solution is electrically neutral we get

:&lt;chem&gt;{[H^+]}+{2[Ca^{2+}]} + {[Na^+]} +{3[Al^{3+}]} + {2[Al(OH)^{2+}]} + {[Al(OH)_2^+]}\ =\ {[OH^-]} + {[Cl^-]} + {2[CO_3^{2-}]} +{[HCO_3^-]} + {[R^-]}&lt;/chem&gt;

where R&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; denote an anion of an organic acid. ANC is then defined by collecting all species controlled by equilibrium (i.e. species related to weak acids and weak bases) on one side and species not controlled by equilibrium (i.e. species related to strong acids and strong bases) on the other side. Thus, with the species above we get

:&lt;chem&gt;ANC\ =\ +{2[Ca^{2+}]} + {[Na^+]}\ -\ {[Cl^-]}&lt;/chem&gt;

or

:&lt;chem&gt;ANC\ =\ {[OH^-]}+{2[CO_3^{2-}]} + {[HCO_3^-]} + {[R^-]}\ -\ {[H^+]-3[Al^{3+}]}\ -\ {2[Al(OH)^{2+}]}\ -\ {[Al(OH)_2^+]}&lt;/chem&gt;

==Note== 
# that a change in DOC or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or for that matter Aluminium solubility, but Aluminium solubility is not something that is easily controlled) does NOT have any effect on ANC. 
# that once a pH-ANC relation for has been established for a lake the pH-ANC relation can be used to easily calculate the amount of limestone needed to raise lake pH to e.g. 5.5
# not all acid lakes are acid due to human influence since high DOC gives low pH. 
# that the concentrations are multiplied with the charge of the species, hence the unit mol charge per liter

{{Anthropology |theories}}

The '''alliance theory''', also known as the '''general theory of exchanges''', is a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] method of studying [[kinship]] relations. It finds its origins in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949) and is in opposition to the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] theory of [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. Alliance theory has oriented most [[Anthropology|anthropological]] French works until the 1980s; its influences were felt in various fields, including [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;!-- (who shared the belief in a universal [[incest taboo]])--&gt;, [[philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]].

The hypothesis of a "marriage-alliance" emerged in this frame, pointing out towards the necessary interdependence of various families and lineages. Marriages themselves are thus seen as a form of [[communication]] that anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] or [[Rodney Needham]] have described. Alliance theory hence tries to understand the basic questions about inter-individual relations, or what constitutes [[human society|society]].

Alliance theory is based on the [[incest taboo]]: according to it, only this [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards [[exogamy]]. Thus, inside a given society, certain categories of kin are forbidden to inter-marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. This theory echoes with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913). But the incest taboo of alliance theory, in which one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], ''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2ème édition, p.60''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds [[Affinity (law)|affinity]]. This global phenomenon takes the form of a "circulation of women" which links together the various social groups in one whole: society.

== Elementary structures and complex structures ==

According to Lévi-Strauss's alliance theory, there are two different structural "models" of marriage exchange. Either the women of ego's group are offered to another group "explicitly defined" by social institutions: these are the "elementary structures of kinship". Or the group of possible spouses for the women in ego's group is "indetermined and always open", to the exclusion, however, of certain kin-people ([[nuclear family]], aunts, uncles...), as in the [[Western world]]. Lévi-Strauss call these latter "complex structures of kinship".

Levi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousin]] marriage, sister-exchange, dual organisation and rules of [[exogamy]]. Marriage rules over time create social structures, as marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between the two individuals involved. When groups exchange women on a regular basis they marry together, with each marriage creating a debtor/creditor relationship which must be balanced through the "repayment" of wives, either directly or in the next generation. Levi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the incest taboo, which he deemed to be the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first rule to check natural impulses; and secondarily the sexual division of labour. The former, by prescribing exogamy, creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women and thus necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group ("marry out or die out"), which fosters exchange relationships with other groups; the latter creates a need for women to do "women's tasks". By necessitating wife-exchange arrangements, exogamy therefore promotes inter-group alliances and serves to form structures of social networks.

Levi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex - from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter in kinship abbreviation) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter in kinship abbreviation). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures, constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.

Elementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving a certain amount of room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.

The second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD ([[matrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD ([[patrilateral]] cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]). Levi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Barnard and Good, 1984:96&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of restricted exchange are found in some tribes residing in the [[Amazon basin]]. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties which often split up, thus rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, for instance amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.

From a structural perspective, matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Levi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk, as group A depends on being given a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, meaning that there is a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.

Levi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called the semi-complex structure, or the Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively come close to prescribing marriage to certain parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found amongst societies such as the [[Crow tribe|Crow]] and [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] native [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in [[North America]].

In Levi-Strauss' order of things, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This "mother's brother" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two different sides of the same coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

== Definition of religion==
One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

The term "'''Atomic engineering'''" appears to have been first used in 1946 by Theodore von Kármán,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore von Kármán, "Atomic Engineering?", Journal of Applied Physics 17 (1946) 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "And now it seems we are at the threshold of the new atomic age. I do not know whether or not this is true, but certainly, we shall have 'atomic engineering' in the fields of power and transportation. Are we prepared for the problems involved?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Atomic power]], which, today, is generally considered to be in the discipline of [[nuclear engineering]], is an example of what he had in mind.

Atomic engineering may be a superset of [[nuclear engineering]], due to the historical usage of terms like [[Atoms for Peace]] , [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], 'atomic engineer', etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.
An inclusive definition is: "exploiting the atomic characters of matter for [[engineering]] applications." For example, an [[atomic clock]] and potential applications of [[ultracold atoms|ultra-cold atom]] belong to atomic engineering. The atomic character could be the atomic spin (e.g. in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[quantum computing]] applications), atomic position (e.g. [[Optical lattice]]), atomic mass (e.g. atomic power), etc.

The creation of the atomic bomb by Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the "Father of the atomic bomb", is based on atomic engineering. Oppenheimer was a university professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.

[[Richard Feynman]], in his famous 1959 lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" on the trend of [[miniaturization]], envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to whether, ultimately – in the great future – we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them. … When we get to the very, very, small world – say circuits of seven atoms – we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. We can manufacture in different ways. We can use, not just circuits, but some system involving the quantized energy levels, or the interactions of quantized spins, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Feynman, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom", Caltech Engineering and Science 23 (5), 22 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most practices of [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] today have foci distinct from Feynman's ultimate vision of manipulating individual atomic position and spin, which may be better described by "Atomic engineering", that addresses characteristic length scales from 1 [[femtometer]] (the [[atomic nucleus]] size) to 1 [[nanometer]] (about 5 atoms across in linear dimension).  Coherent quantum control of individual atomic defect like the [[Nitrogen-vacancy center]], and the eventual "[[3D atom printing]]" ("2D atom printing" was realized in 1990 by IBM&lt;ref&gt;D. M. EIGLER and E. K. SCHWEIZER, "Positioning single atoms with a scanning tunnelling microscope", Nature 344 (1990) 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]), fit Feynman's ultimate vision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">The '''Bass Model''' or '''Bass Diffusion Model''' was developed by [[Frank Bass]].  It consists of a simple [[differential equation]] that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The model presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact. The basic premise of the model is that adopters can be classified as [[innovators]] or as imitators and the speed and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovativeness and the degree of imitation among adopters. The Bass model has been widely used in [[forecasting]], especially new products' [[sales forecasting]] and [[technology forecasting]]. Mathematically, the basic Bass diffusion is a [[Riccati equation]] with constant coefficients.

In 1969, Frank Bass published his paper on a new product growth model for consumer durables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Management Science |accessdate=September 22, 2016 |volume=50 |issue=12 |pages=1833–1840 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.1976&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |title=Comments on "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables": The Bass Model |first=Frank M. |last=Bass |year=2004 |quote=Perhaps the first thing to notice about the paper that has come to be known as the "Bass Model" (Bass 1969) is the title. It contains a typo. The paper was published with the title: "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables." The correct title should be: "A New Product Growth Model for Consumer Durables." |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0300}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1833}}&lt;ref name="Bass1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bass |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Bass  |year=1969 |title= A new product growth for model consumer durables |journal=Management Science |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=215–227 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1287/mnsc.15.5.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, [[Everett Rogers]] published ''Diffusion of Innovations'', a highly influential work that described the different stages of product adoption. Bass contributed some mathematical ideas to the concept.&lt;ref name="MgtScienceDec2004"&gt;''Management Science'' 50 Number 12 Supplement, Dec 2004 {{issn|0025-1909}} p1833-1840&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model formulation==
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = p + q F(t)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;\ f(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the change of the installed base fraction
* &lt;math&gt;\ F(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the installed base fraction
* &lt;math&gt;\ p &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of innovation
* &lt;math&gt;\ q &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of imitation

Sales &lt;math&gt;\ S(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of installed base (i.e. adoption) &lt;math&gt;\ f(t) &lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the ultimate market potential &lt;math&gt;\ m &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ S(t)=mf(t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ S(t)=m{ \frac{(p+q)^2}{p}} \frac{e^{-(p+q)t}}{(1+\frac{q}{p}e^{-(p+q)t})^2} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

The time of peak sales &lt;math&gt;\ t^* &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ t^*=\frac{\ln q - \ln p}{p+q} &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;ref name="Bass1969" /&gt;

===Explanation===
The coefficient ''p'' is called the coefficient of innovation, external influence or advertising effect.  The coefficient q is called the coefficient of imitation, internal influence or word-of-mouth effect.

Typical values of ''p'' and ''q'' when time ''t'' is measured in years:&lt;ref name="Empirical Generalizations"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahajan |first=Vijay |author2=Muller, Eitan |author3=Bass, Frank |year=1995 |title=Diffusion of new products: Empirical generalizations and managerial uses |journal=Marketing Science |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=G79–G88 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1287/mksc.14.3.G79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The average value of ''p'' has been found to be 0.03, and is often less than 0.01
*The average value of ''q'' has been found to be 0.38, with a typical range between 0.3 and 0.5

==Extensions to the model==
===Generalised Bass model (with pricing)===

Bass found that his model fit the data for almost all product introductions, despite a wide range of managerial decision variables, e.g. pricing and advertising.  This means that decision variables can shift the Bass curve in time, but that the shape of the curve is always similar.

Although many extensions of the model have been proposed, only one of these reduces to the Bass model under ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref name=Bass1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bass|first=Frank M.|author2=Trichy V. Krishnan |author3=Dipak C. Jain |title=Why the Bass Model Fits without Decision Variables|journal=Marketing Science|date=1994|volume=13|issue=2|pages=203–223|doi=10.1287/mksc.13.3.203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[image:Bass diffusion model.svg|right]] This model was developed in 1994 by Frank Bass, Trichy Krishnan and Dipak Jain:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = (p + {q}F(t)) x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is a function of percentage change in price and other variables

===Successive generations===
Technology products succeed one another in generations.  Norton and Bass extended the model in 1987 for sales of products with continuous repeat purchasing.  The formulation for three generations is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=John A.|author2=Frank M. Bass|title=A Diffusion Theory Model of Adoption and Substitution for Successive Generations of High-Technology Products|journal=Management Science|date=1987|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1069–1086|doi=10.1287/mnsc.33.9.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{1,t} = F(t_1) m_1 (1-F(t_2)) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{2,t} = F(t_2) (m_2 + F(t_1) m_1 ) (1-F(t_3)) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ S_{3,t} = F(t_3) (m_3 + F(t_2) (m_2 + F(t_1) m_1 )) &lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;\ m_i = a_i M_i &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ M_i &lt;/math&gt; is the incremental number of ultimate adopters of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ a_i &lt;/math&gt; is the average (continuous) repeat buying rate among adopters of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ t_i &lt;/math&gt; is the time since the introduction of the ''i''th generation product
* &lt;math&gt;\ F(t_i) = \frac{1-e^{-(p+q)t_i}}{1+\frac{q}{p} e^{-(p+q)t_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

It has been found that the p and q terms are generally the same between successive generations.

===Relationship with other s-curves===
There are two special cases of the Bass diffusion model.

*The first special case occurs when q=0, when the model reduces to the [[Exponential distribution]].
*The second special case reduces to the [[logistic distribution]], when p=0.

The Bass model is a special case of the Gamma/[[shifted Gompertz distribution]] (G/SG): Bemmaor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Bemmaor | given=Albert C. | year= 1994 |pages=201–223| chapter=Modeling the Diffusion of New Durable Goods: Word-of-Mouth Effect Versus Consumer Heterogeneity | editor=G. Laurent, G.L. Lilien &amp; B. Pras | title=Research Traditions in Marketing | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | place=Boston| isbn=0-7923-9388-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1994) 

'''Use in online social networks'''
The rapid, recent (as of early 2007) growth in online social networks (and other [[virtual communities]]) has led to an increased use of the Bass diffusion model.  The Bass diffusion model is used to estimate the size and growth rate of these social networks. The work by Christian Bauchkage and co-authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last= |first= |author-link= |eprint=1406.6529 |title=Strong Regularities in Growth and Decline of Popularity of Social Media Services|class= cs.SI|date= |last1= Bauckhage|first1= Christian|last2= Kersting|first2= Kristian|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the Bass model provides a more pessimistic picture of the future than alternative model(s) such as the Weibull distribution and the shifted Gompertz distribution.

==Adoption of this Model ==
The model is one of the most cited empirical generalizations in marketing; as of October 2018 the paper "A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables" published in Management Science had (approximately) 8499 citations in Google Scholar&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C45&amp;q=A+New+Product+Growth+for+Model+Consumer+Durables&amp;btnG=&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This model has been widely influential in marketing and management science.  In 2004 it was selected as one of the ten most frequently cited papers in the 50-year history of ''Management Science''.&lt;ref name=MgtScienceDec2004 /&gt;  It was ranked number five, and the only marketing paper in the list.  It was subsequently reprinted in the December 2004 issue of Management Science.&lt;ref name=MgtScienceDec2004 /&gt;

'''Bit-length''' is the number of binary digits, called [[bit]]s, necessary to represent an [[integer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/BitLength.html |title=Wolfram Mathematica 8 Documentation |accessdate=10 Jan 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[binary numeral system|binary number system]].

At their most fundamental level, digital computers and telecommunications devices (as opposed to [[analog signal|analog]] devices) can process only data that has been expressed in [[binary code|binary]] format.  The binary format expresses data as an arbitrary length series of values with one of two choices:  Yes/No, 1/0, True/False, etc., all of which can be expressed electronically as On/Off.  For information technology applications, the amount of information being processed is an important design consideration.  The term bit-length is technical shorthand for this measure.

For example, computer [[processors]] are often designed to process data group into [[data type|word]]s of a given length of bits (8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit, etc.). The bit-length of each [[word (data type)|word]] defines, for one thing, how many memory locations can be independently addressed by the processor. In [[public-key cryptography]], [[key (cryptography)|key]]s are defined by their length expressed in binary digits - their bit length.

A '''blueshift''' is any decrease in [[wavelength]], with a corresponding increase in frequency, of an [[electromagnetic wave]]; the opposite effect is referred to as [[redshift]]. In [[Light|visible light]], this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end.

== Doppler blueshift ==
[[File:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|Doppler redshift and blueshift]]
[[Doppler effect|Doppler]] blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength  and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the [[visible spectrum]]. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the [[naked eye]], but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Quest of the Universe|first=Karl F.|last=Kuhn|author2=Theo Koupelis|year= 2004|publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]|isbn=0-7637-0810-0|pages=122–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler blueshift is used in [[astronomy]] to determine relative motion:
* The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is moving toward our own [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] within the [[Local Group]]; thus, when observed from Earth, its light is undergoing a blueshift.
* Components of a [[binary star]] system will be blueshifted when moving towards Earth
* When observing spiral galaxies, the side spinning toward us will have a slight blueshift ''relative to'' the side spinning away from us (see [[Tully–Fisher relation]]).
* [[Blazar]]s are known to propel [[relativistic jet]]s toward us, emitting [[synchrotron radiation]] and [[bremsstrahlung]] that appears blueshifted.
* Nearby stars such as [[Barnard's Star]] are moving toward us, resulting in a very small blueshift.
* Doppler blueshift of distant objects with a high ''z'' can be subtracted from the much larger [[Hubble's law|cosmological redshift]] to determine relative motion in the [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].&lt;ref name="Aoki2005"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Largest Blueshifts of the [O III] Emission Line in Two Narrow-Line Quasars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | date = January 2005 | first = Kentaro | last = Aoki |author2=Toshihiro Kawaguchi|author3=Kouji Ohta | volume = 618 | issue = 2 | pages = 601–608 |arxiv = astro-ph/0409546 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...618..601A |doi = 10.1086/426075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gravitational blueshift ==
[[Image:Gravitional well.jpg|thumb|[[Matter waves]] (protons, electrons, photons, etc.) falling into a [[gravity well]] become more energetic and undergo observer-independent blueshifting.]]
Unlike the ''relative'' Doppler blueshift, caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon, gravitational blueshift is ''absolute'' and does not depend on the received angle of the photon:
{{Quote frame|Photons climbing out of a gravitating object become less energetic. This loss of energy is known as a "redshifting", as photons in the visible spectrum would appear more red. Similarly, photons falling into a gravitational field become more energetic and exhibit a blueshifting. ... Note that the magnitude of the redshifting (blueshifting) effect is not a function of the emitted angle or the received angle of the photon—it depends only on how far radially the photon had to climb out of (fall into) the potential well.&lt;ref name=R.N_1&gt;{{cite web| author=R.J. Nemiroff| title=Gravitational Principles and Mathematics| url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/nslens_math.html| date=1993| publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R.N_2&gt;{{cite journal| author=R.J. Nemiroff| title=Visual distortions near a neutron star and black hole| date=1993| journal=American Journal of Physics| volume=61| issue=7| pages=619–632| bibcode=1993AmJPh..61..619N| doi=10.1119/1.17224| arxiv=astro-ph/9312003v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is a natural consequence of [[conservation of energy]] and [[mass–energy equivalence]], and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]]. Gravitational blueshift contributes to [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) anisotropy via the [[Sachs–Wolfe effect]]: when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing, the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of [[gravitational redshift]] as it leaves the region.&lt;ref name="Bonometto2002"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bonometto | first1 = Silvio | last2 = Gorini | first2 = Vittorio | last3 = Moschella | first3 = Ugo | title = Modern Cosmology | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7503-0810-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue outliers ===
There are faraway [[active galaxies]] that show a blueshift in their [[Oxygen|[O III]]] emission [[Emission spectrum|lines]].  One of the largest blueshifts is found in the narrow-line [[quasar]], PG 1543+489, which has a relative velocity of -1150&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="Aoki2005" /&gt;  These types of galaxies are called "blue outliers".&lt;ref name="Aoki2005" /&gt;

==Cosmological blueshift==
In a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway [[big crunch]] contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted—the exact opposite of the actually observed [[cosmological redshift]] in the present [[expanding universe]].

==Discovery==

In an experiment published in 1959, zoologist [[Hilda Bruce]] of the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in London housed pregnant mice with male mice that were not the father of the carried [[embryo]]. As a result, the rate of [[miscarriage]]s increased, followed by mating with the new male. No increased rate of miscarriages occurred when pregnant mice were paired with [[castrated]] or juvenile male mice.&lt;ref name=Bruce1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=century&gt;{{cite book|author=MRC National Institute for Medical Research|title=A Century of Science and Health|date=2014|publisher=MRC National Institute for Medical Research|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0205239390|page=335|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect remained when the male mice were kept out of sight or hearing of the females. This suggested that females were distinguishing the males by smell. To test this hypothesis, Bruce and her colleague Alan Parkes recruited perfumers to smell pieces of cloth from the mouse cages. The perfumers could distinguish the smells of different mouse strains.&lt;ref name=century /&gt;

==Mechanisms of action==

===Detection of pheromones===
The [[vomeronasal|vomeronasal system]] serves as a “vascular pump” that, stimulated by the presence of a novel male, actively draws in substances.&lt;ref name=Guzzo&gt;{{cite journal |pages=255–63 |doi=10.1530/REP-09-0382 |title=Excretion and binding of tritium-labelled oestradiol in mice (Mus musculus): Implications for the Bruce effect |year=2009 |last1=Guzzo |first1=A. C |last2=Berger |first2=R. G |last3=Decatanzaro |first3=D. |journal=Reproduction |volume=139 |pmid=19793839 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male mouse [[urine]] contains [[MHC class I]] peptides that bind to receptors in the female’s [[vomeronasal organ]],&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zufall&gt;{{cite journal |pages=483–9 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2007.07.012 |title=Mammalian pheromone sensing |year=2007 |last1=Zufall |first1=Frank |last2=Leinders-Zufall |first2=Trese |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pmid=17709238}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[mucus|mucus-filled]] structure in the [[nasal septum]].&lt;ref name =Brennan2009&gt;{{cite journal |pages=287–94 |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.10.045 |title=Outstanding issues surrounding vomeronasal mechanisms of pregnancy block and individual recognition in mice |year=2009 |last1=Brennan |first1=Peter A. |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=200 |issue=2 |pmid=19071163}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemical signals, which are specific to each male, are learned by the female during mating,&lt;ref name=Brennan2006&gt;{{cite journal |pages=308–15 |doi=10.1038/nature05404 |title=Pheromonal communication in vertebrates |year=2006 |last1=Brennan |first1=Peter A. |last2=Zufall |first2=Frank |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7117 |pmid=17108955|bibcode = 2006Natur.444..308B }}&lt;/ref&gt; or shortly after.&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; The hormone [[vasopressin]] is crucial in coupling a [[chemosensory]] cue with an appropriate physiological response. When the [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 1B|vasopressin 1b receptor]] gene is [[gene knock out|knocked out]] in females, the presence of an unfamiliar male does not trigger pregnancy disruption.&lt;ref name=Wersinger&gt;{{cite journal |pages=116–21 |doi=10.1210/en.2007-1056 |pmc=2194605 |title=Inactivation of the Oxytocin and the Vasopressin (Avp) 1b Receptor Genes, but Not the Avp 1a Receptor Gene, Differentially Impairs the Bruce Effect in Laboratory Mice (Mus musculus) |year=2007 |last1=Wersinger |first1=S.

===Recognizing familiar males===
Exposure to a male’s urinal [[pheromones]] will activate a neuroendocrine pathway leading to pregnancy failure. However, if the pheromones correspond with those memorized by the female (usually the male mating partner), a release of [[noradrenaline]] will lower the receptivity of the [[olfactory bulb|accessory olfactory bulb]] to these pheromones.&lt;ref name=Brennan2006 /&gt; The pregnancy disruption will, thus, be averted. This role for noradrenaline has recently been called into question.&lt;ref name=Brennan2009 /&gt; The hormone [[oxytocin]] is also important in this [[memory|social memory]] process. Females treated with an oxytocin [[antagonist]] are unable to recognize the urinary scent of their mate, and will terminate pregnancy when exposed to any male, known or unknown.&lt;ref name=Neumann&gt;{{cite journal |pages=858–65 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01726.x |title=Brain Oxytocin: A Key Regulator of Emotional and Social Behaviors in Both Females and Males |year=2008 |last1=Neumann |first1=I. D. |journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology |volume=20 |issue=6 |pmid=18601710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroendocrine pathway===
The activation of vomeronasal neuron receptors by male pheromones triggers a complex [[neuroendocrine]] pathway. The pheromonal information travels via [[nerves]] to the accessory olfactory bulb, and then to the [[corticomedial amygdala]], [[olfactory tract|accessory olfactory tract]], and [[stria terminalis]].&lt;ref name=Brennan2009 /&gt; These areas stimulate the [[hypothalamus]] to increase the release of [[dopamine]],&lt;ref name=Brennan2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosser&gt;{{cite journal |pages=553–9 |doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0870553 |title=Restricted exposure of mice to primer pheromones coincident with prolactin surges blocks pregnancy by changing hypothalamic dopamine release |year=1989 |last1=Rosser |first1=A. E. |last2=Remfry |first2=C. J. |last3=Keverne |first3=E. B. |journal=Reproduction |volume=87 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which thus prevents the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary.&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; In the absence of [[prolactin]], an essential hormone for maintaining the [[corpus luteum]], [[luteolysis]] takes place.&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; As the corpus luteum can no longer release [[progesterone]], the [[uterus]] remains unprimed for embryo implantation, and the pregnancy fails.&lt;ref name=Rosser /&gt;

===Role of estrogens===
[[Androgens]] and [[estrogens]], particularly [[estradiol]] (E2), are also crucial chemosignals regulating the Bruce effect.&lt;ref name=Guzzo /&gt; However, they are believed to act via a separate pathway to that discussed above. Small [[steroid hormone|steroid molecules]] such as E2 can enter the [[bloodstream]] directly via [[nose|nasal]] [[ingestion]]&lt;ref name=Guzzo /&gt; and travel to the [[uterus]], which has a high density of suitable receptors. Normally, E2 is essential in preparing both the [[blastocyst]] and [[uterus]] for implantation. However, excessive E2 will prevent implantation from taking place.&lt;ref name=Valbuena&gt;{{cite journal |pages=962–8 |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(01)02018-0 |title=Increasing levels of estradiol are deleterious to embryonic implantation because they directly affect the embryo |year=2001 |last1=Valbuena |first1=Diana |last2=Martin |first2=Julio |last3=De Pablo |first3=Jose Luis |last4=Remohı́ |first4=José |last5=Pellicer |first5=Antonio |last6=Simón |first6=Carlos |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=76 |issue=5 |pmid=11704118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ma&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2963–8 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0530162100 |pmc=151449 |title=Estrogen is a critical determinant that specifies the duration of the window of uterine receptivity for implantation |year=2003 |last1=Ma |first1=W.-g. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=100 |issue=5 |pmid=12601161 |last2=Song |first2=H |last3=Das |first3=SK |last4=Paria |first4=BC |last5=Dey |first5=SK|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2963M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castrated males are incapable of terminating female pregnancies,&lt;ref name=Bruce1965&gt;{{cite journal |pages=141–3 |doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0100141 |title=Effect of Castration on the Reproductive Pheromones of Male Mice |year=1965 |last1=Bruce |first1=H. M. |journal=Reproduction |volume=10 |pmid=14337805 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; except when castrated males are given [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]].&lt;ref name=Guzzo /&gt; estradiol, a metabolic product of testosterone, is known to disrupt pregnancy in females,&lt;ref name=Guzzo /&gt; and is present in male urine.

===Timing===
The incidence of the Bruce effect depends on the timing of pheromone exposure. Post-mating, females experience twice-daily surges of [[prolactin]].&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; Pregnancy is only terminated if exposure to novel male scent coincides with two prolactin surges, one of these occurring in a [[photoperiodism|daylight period]].&lt;ref name=Rosser /&gt;

==Evolutionary benefits==
In order to have [[evolution|evolved]] and persisted in the population, the Bruce effect must afford individuals a [[fitness (biology)|fitness advantage]].&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; The possible advantages of pregnancy block are widely debated.

===Males===
When given the opportunity, male mice tend to direct their urine in the female’s direction.&lt;ref name=deCatanzaro&gt;{{cite journal |pages=240–7 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.10.013 |title=Exposure to developing females induces polyuria, polydipsia, and altered urinary levels of creatinine, 17β-estradiol, and testosterone in adult male mice (Mus musculus) |year=2009 |last1=Decatanzaro |first1=Denys |last2=Khan |first2=Ayesha |last3=Berger |first3=Robert G. |last4=Lewis |first4=Elaine |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=55 |pmid=19027019 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows males to improve their fitness success by “sabotaging” the pregnancy of a male competitor,&lt;ref name=Becker /&gt; and more quickly returning the female to [[estrus]].&lt;ref name=Huck&gt;{{cite journal |pages=181–4 |doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0660181 |title=Pregnancy block in laboratory mice as a function of male social status |year=1982 |last1=Huck |first1=U. W. |journal=Reproduction |volume=66 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruce effect can also aid in maintaining [[social rank|social status]], with [[dominance (ethology)|dominant]] males leaving more [[scent marking|urinal scent markings]],&lt;ref name=Desjardins&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1973Sci...182..939D |title=Social Rank in House Mice: Differentiation Revealed by Ultraviolet Visualization of Urinary Marking Patterns |author1=Desjardins |first1=Claude |last2=Maruniak |first2=J.

===Females===
Females can control their likelihood of terminating pregnancy by pursuing or avoiding novel male contact during their most susceptible periods.&lt;ref name=Becker2009&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1723–9 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1780 |title=Female behaviour plays a critical role in controlling murine pregnancy block |year=2009 |last1=Becker |first1=S.

L |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=276 |issue=1662 |pmid=19324836 |pmc=2660991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, females can exert a post-copulatory [[mate choice]], reserving their reproductive resources for the highest-quality male. Certainly, females are more likely to seek proximity to dominant males.&lt;ref name=Becker2009 /&gt; In many rodent species, males [[Infanticide (zoology)|kill unrelated young]]; pregnancy block may avoid the wasted investment of gestating offspring likely to be killed at birth.&lt;ref name=Labov /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwagmeyer&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2460564 |pages=932–938 |last1=Schwagmeyer |first1=P.

==History==

===The road to the CLS: 1972–1999===
[[Image:CSRF Grasshopper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[monochromator]] from the first CSRF beamline, now a museum piece at the CLS]]
[[Image:SAL LINAC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The SAL LINAC, seen at the CLS in 2011]]

Canadian interest in [[synchrotron radiation]] dates from 1972, when Bill McGowan of the [[University of Western Ontario]] (UWO) organised a workshop on its uses. At that time there were no users of synchrotron radiation in Canada. In 1973 McGowan submitted an unsuccessful proposal to the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC) for a feasibility study on a possible synchrotron lightsource in Canada. In 1975 a proposal to build a dedicated synchrotron lightsource in Canada was submitted to NRC. This was also unsuccessful. In 1977 [[G. Michael Bancroft|Mike Bancroft]], also of UWO, submitted a proposal to NRC to build a Canadian [[beamline]], as the [[Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (CSRF), at the existing [[Synchrotron Radiation Center]] at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], USA, and in 1978 newly created [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|NSERC]] awarded capital funding. CSRF, owned and operated by NRC, grew from the initial beamline to a total of three by 1998.

A further push towards a Canadian synchrotron light source started in 1990 with formation of the Canadian Institute for Synchrotron Radiation (CISR), initiated by Bruce Bigham of [[AECL]]. AECL and [[TRIUMF]] showed interest in designing the ring, but the [[Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory]] (SAL) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] became prominent in the design. In 1991 CISR submitted a proposal to NSERC for a final design study.  This was turned down, but in later years, under President Peter Morand, NSERC became more supportive. In 1994 NSERC committee recommended a Canadian synchrotron light source and a further NSERC committee was formed to select between two bids to host such a facility, from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Western Ontario. In 1996 this committee recommended that the Canadian Light Source be built in Saskatchewan.

With NSERC unable to supply the required funds it was not clear where funding would come from. In 1997 the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) was created to fund large scientific projects, possibly to provide a mechanism to fund the CLS. In 1998 a University of Saskatchewan team led by [http://awards.usask.ca/faculty/recipients/skopik.php Dennis Skopik], the SAL director, submitted a proposal to CFI.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;{{Cite journal
|last=Bancroft |first=G. M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was to fund 40% of the construction costs, with remaining money having to come from elsewhere. Assembling these required matching funds has been called "an unprecedented level of collaboration among governments, universities, and industry in Canada"&lt;ref name="SPHistory"&gt;[http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/Canadian_Light_Source.html "Synchrotron: Canadian Light Source 70 years in the making'"],''The Star-Phoenix'' 20 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Bancroft – leader of the rival UWO bid – anckowledged the "Herculean" efforts of the Saskatchewan team in obtaining funds from the University, the City of Saskatoon, [[Saskatchewan Power]], NRC, the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan, and [[Western Economic Diversification]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; At a late hour CFI told the proponents that it would not accept the SAL [[LINAC]] as part of the proposal, and the resulting shortfall was met in part by the spontaneous announcement by the Saskatoon city council and then Mayor [[Henry Dayday]] that they would double their contribution as long as other partners would. On 31 March 1999 the success of the CFI proposal was announced.

The following month Skopik took a position at [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|Jefferson Lab]] in the USA. He decided not to stay on as director of the Saskatoon facility because his expertise was in subatomic particles, and, he argued, the head of the CLS should be a researcher who specializes in using such a facility. His successor was Mike Bancroft&lt;ref name="SPHistory" /&gt;

===Construction: 1999–2004===

At the start of the project, all staff members with the former SAL were transferred into a new [[nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] corporation, Canadian
Light Source Inc., CLSI, which had primary responsibility for the technical design, construction and operation of the facility. As a separate corporation from the University, CLSI had the legal and organizational freedom suitable for this responsibility. UMA, an experienced engineering firm, now part of [[AECOM]], with extensive experience managing large technical and civil construction projects, was hired as [[project management|project managers]].&lt;ref name="CLSI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/weilh04.pdf|title=Industrial involvement in the construction of synchrotron lightsources| year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new building – attached to the existing SAL building, and measuring 84m by 83m in area with a maximum height of 23m – was completed in early 2001.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; The footprint of the CLS has been described as equivalent to that of a football field.&lt;ref name="Reinvent" /&gt;

Bancroft's appointment ended in October 2001 and he returned to UWO, with Mark de Jong appointed acting director. Bancroft remained as acting Scientific Director until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightsource.ca/enews/newsletter_October2001.php CLS Newsletter October 2001 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the CLS Project was awarded the National Award for Exceptional Engineering Achievement by the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers]].&lt;ref name="Engaward"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lightsource.ca/media/synchrotronaward.php| title=U of S-Owned Synchrotron Project Wins National Engineering Award  | date=27 May 2002| accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAL LINAC was refurbished and placed back into service in 2002 while the booster and storage rings were still under construction.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; First turn was achieved in the booster ring in July 2002 with full booster commissioning completed by September 2002.&lt;ref name="booster"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/PAPERS/THPKF025.PDF |title=Commissioning report of the CLS booster synchrotron | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New director Bill Thomlinson, an expert in synchrotron medical imaging, arrived in November 2002. He was recruited from the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] where he had been the head of the medical research group.&lt;ref name="Thom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/02-aug-09/news17.shtml | title=Thomlinson to head CLS Nov. 1| date=9 August 2002 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 proposal to NSERC envisioned a 1.5 GeV storage ring, since at this time the interest of the user community was mainly in the soft X-ray range. The ring was a racetrack layout of four to six [[dipole magnet|bend]] regions surrounding straights with extra [[quadrupole magnets|quadrupoles]] to allow for variable functions in the straights. The design contemplated the use of [[superconductivity|superconducting]] bends in some locations to boost
the [[photon]] energies produced. The drawback of this design was the limited number of straight sections. In 1994 a more conventional machine with 8 straight sections was proposed, again with 1.5 GeV energy. At this time more users of hard X-rays were interested and it was felt that both the energy and number of straight sections were too low. By the time funding was secured in 1999 the design had changed to 2.9 GeV, with longer straight sections to enable two [[insertion devices]] per straight, delivering beam to two independent beamlines.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/p03/PAPERS/TOPA001.PDF| title=The Canadian Light Source | year=2003 | format=PDF | accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the storage ring was completed in August 2003 and commissioning began the following month. Although beam could be stored, in March 2004 a large obstruction was found across the center of the chamber. Commissioning proceeded quickly after this was removed, and by June 2004 currents of 100mA could be achieved .&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/Accelconf/e04/PAPERS/THPKF007.PDF | title=Canadian Light Source status and commissioning results | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 2004 the CLS officially opened, with an opening ceremony attended by federal and provincial dignitaries, including then-Federal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] [[Ralph Goodale]] and then-[[Premier of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Premier]] [[Lorne Calvert]], university presidents and leading scientists. October 2004 was declared "Synchrotron Month" by the city of Saskatoon and the Saskatchewan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/04-sep-24/news07.shtml|title= October declared Synchrotron Month |date=24 September 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Mansbridge]] broadcast the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s nightly [[newscast]] [[The National (CBC)|''The National'']] from the top of the storage ring the day before the official opening.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/04-nov-05/news01.shtml| title=Dignitaries gather to mark synchrotron's grand opening| date=5 November 2004| accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Lynne Yelich]] said "There were many challenges to overcome, but thanks to the vision, dedication and persistence of its supporters, the Canadian Light Source synchrotron is open for business in Saskatoon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://openparliament.ca/debates/2004/10/21/lynne-yelich-1/only/|title= Lynne Yelich on Canadian Light Source |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation and expansion: 2005–2012===
[[Image:CLS in 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The CLS building in 2008, with the expansion for the BMIT beamline on the left]]
[[Image:Brockhouse construction.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The expansion for the Brockhouse beamlines under construction in July 2012]]
The initial funding included seven beamlines, referred to as Phase I, which covered the full spectral range: two [[infrared]] beamlines, three soft X-ray beamlines and two hard X-ray beamlines.&lt;ref name="Bancroft" /&gt; Further beamlines were built in two further phases, II (7 beamlines) and III (5 beamlines), announced in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Most of these were funded through applications to CFI by individual universities including UWO, the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Guelph University]]&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

In March 2005 leading infrared researcher Tom Ellis joined the CLS from [[Acadia University]] as Director of Research. He had previously spent 16 years at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://announcements.usask.ca/news/archive/2005/03/leading_scienti.html |title=Leading Scientist Recruited as Research Director for Canadian Light Source at the U of S |date=1 March 2005 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409000406/http://announcements.usask.ca/news/archive/2005/03/leading_scienti.html |archivedate=9 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first external user was hosted in 2005, and the first research papers with results from the CLS were published in March 2006 – one from the University of Saskatchewan on [[peptide]]s and the other from the University of Western Ontario on materials for [[OLED|organic light-emitting diodes]].&lt;ref name="Flow"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=7799751a-5551-44c7-aa98-439657b83dad| title=Research results begin to flow from synchrotron| date=18 April 2006| accessdate=27 July 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625091033/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=7799751a-5551-44c7-aa98-439657b83dad#| archive-date=25 June 2014| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was set up in 2006 to [[peer review]] proposals for beamtime, under the chairmanship of Adam Hitchcock of [[McMaster University]].

By the end of 2010 more than 1000 individual researchers had used the facility, and the number of publications had passed 500.&lt;ref name="EllisPiC" /&gt;
From 2009–2012 several key metrics doubled, including the number of users and the number of publications, with more than 190 papers published in 2011. More than 400 proposals were received for beam time in 2012, with approximately a 50% oversubscription rate averaged over the operational beamlines. By 2012 the user community spanned all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries.&lt;ref name="Stride" /&gt; That year a high school group from [[La Loche]] Saskatchewan became the first to use the purpose built educational beamline IDEAS.&lt;ref name="IDEAS" /&gt; Also in 2012 the CLS signed an agreement with the [[Advanced Photon Source]] synchrotron in the USA to allow Canadian researchers access to their facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aps.anl.gov/News/APS_News/Content/APS_NEWS_20120618.php

An international team led by [[University of Calgary]] professor Ken Ng solved the detailed structure of [[RNA polymerase]] using X-ray crystallography at the CLS. This enzyme replicates itself as the [[Norwalk virus]] spreads through the body, and has been linked to other [[supervirus]]es such as [[hepatitis C]], [[West Nile virus]] and the [[common cold]]. Its duplication is responsible for the onset of such viruses.&lt;ref name="Norwalk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=865bf07a-f32f-4a35-b970-ed3f26068e72 |title=U of C researcher cracks Norwalk code |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625091024/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/city/story.html?id=865bf07a-f32f-4a35-b970-ed3f26068e72# |archive-date=25 June 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLS scientist Luca Quaroni and University of Saskatchewan professor Alan Casson used infrared microscopy to identify [[biomarker]]s inside individual cells from tissue associated with [[Barrett's esophagus]]. This disease can lead to an aggressive form of cancer known as [[esophageal adenocarcinoma]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news163563060.html|title=Researchers Shed Light on Esophageal Disease| date= 8 June 2009 | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from [[Lakehead University]] and the University of Saskatchewan used the CLS to investigate the deaths of [[Royal Navy]] sailors buried in [[Antigua]] in the late 1700s. They used X-ray fluorescence to look for trace elements such as lead and [[strontium]] in bones from a recently [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] naval cemetery&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innovationanthology.com/news.php?id=782|title=Synchrotron reveals tales told by old bones| date= 30 April 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists from [[Stanford University]] worked with CLS scientists to design a cleaner, faster [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The new battery charges in less than two minutes, thanks to a newly developed [[carbon]] [[nanostructure]]. The team grew [[nanocrystal]]s of iron and nickel on carbon. Traditional batteries lack this structure, mixing iron and nickel with conductors more or less randomly. The result was a strong chemical bond between the materials, which the team identified and studied at the synchrotron.&lt;ref name="Battery"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2012-07-cleaner-faster-battery.html|title=A cleaner, faster battery| date= 9 July 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team led by the [[Politecnico di Milano]], including scientists from the [[University of Waterloo]] and the University of British Columbia, found the first experimental evidence that a [[charge density wave]] instability competes with superconductivity in [[high-temperature superconductors]]. They used four synchrotrons including the REIXS beamline at CLS.&lt;ref name="Super"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lightsource.ca/media/media_release_20120712.php|title=Synchrotrons help bring superconductors out of the cold| date= 13 July 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the X-ray spectromicroscopy beamline, a research team led by scientists from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York, Buffalo]] produced images of [[graphene]] showing how folds and ripples act as [[speed bump]]s for electrons, affecting its [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]].

From inception, the CLS showed a "strong commitment to industrial users and private/public partnerships",{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}} with then-director Bancroft reporting "more than 40 letters of support from industry indicating that [the CLS] is important for what they do".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=167}} This commitment has been criticised, notably by University of Saskatchewan professor Howard Woodhouse, since only two private companies provided capital funding, with the rest coming from public funds,{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}} while up to 25% of beamline time at CLS is allocated to commercial use.{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}}&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; The CLS has an industrial group, within the larger experimental facilities division, with industrial liaison scientists who make synchrotron techniques available to a "non-traditional" user base who are not synchrotron experts. By 2007 more than 60 projects had been carried out,&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; although in a speech in the same year, then-CLS director Bill Thomlinson said that "one of the biggest challenges for the synchrotron...is to get private users through the door", with less than 10% of time actually used by industry.{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=170}} 
 
In 1999 then-Saskatoon mayor Dayday stated that "the CLS will add $122 million to Canada's GDP during construction and $12 million annually after that".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=163}} An [[economic impact analysis|economic impact study]] of the two [[financial year]]s 2009/10 and 10/11 showed the CLS had added $45 million per year to the Canadian GDP, or about $3 for every $1 of operating funding.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightsource.ca/media/media_release_20111122.php |title=Canadian Light Source making positive economic, scientific impacts for Canada |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CLS has been cited as an example of the commercialization of university research endangering "other areas of scholarship and research that is perceived to be of little immediate utility for generating private monetary wealth".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=8}} The CLS itself has stated that "the primary means of accessing the CLS is through a system of peer review, which ensures that the proposed science is of the highest quality and permits access to the facility to any interested researcher, regardless of regional, national, academic, industrial or governmental affiliation."&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

==Official Visitors==

==Medical Isotope Project==

With the [[National Research Universal reactor|NRU]] reactor at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] due to close in 2016, there was a need to find alternative sources of the medical isotope [[technetium-99m]], a mainstay of [[nuclear medicine]]. In 2011 the Canadian Light Source received $14 Million in funding to investigate the feasibility of using an electron [[LINAC]] to produce [[molybdenum-99]], the parent isotope of technetium-99.&lt;ref name="CBCisotopes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/01/24/sk-synchrotron-isotopes-1101.html |title=Sask. Synchrotron to make medical isotopes |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this project a 35MeV LINAC has been installed in an unused underground experimental hall previously used for [[photodisintegration|photonuclear]] experiments with the SAL LINAC. First [[irradiation]]s are planned for late summer 2012, with the results to be evaluated by the [[Winnipeg]] [[Health Sciences Centre (Winnipeg)|Health Sciences Centre]].&lt;ref name="isotope2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC2012/papers/thxa01.pdf|title=Producing medical isotopes using X-rays| year=2012 | format=PDF | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education program==
[[Image:Students on the beamline.jpg|thumb|left|250px|High school students from La Loche at the Canadian Light Source]]
The CLS has an education program – "Students on the Beamlines" – funded by NSERC Promoscience. This outreach program for science allows high school students to fully experience the work of a scientist, in addition to having the chance to use the CLS beamlines.

"The program allows students the development of active research, a very rare phenomena in schools and provides direct access to the use of a particle accelerator, something even rarer!" said teacher Steve Desfosses form College Saint-Bernard, [[Drummondville]], Quebec.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;[http://www.journalexpress.ca/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9/%C3%89ducation/2012-03-03/article-2914331/Le-synchrotron-de-Saskatoon-mis-a-la-portee-de-jeunes-scientifiques-du-College-SaintBernard/1 "Le synchrotron de Saskatoon mis à la portée de jeunes scientifiques du Collège Saint-Bernard"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130115150408/http://www.journalexpress.ca/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9/%C3%89ducation/2012-03-03/article-2914331/Le-synchrotron-de-Saskatoon-mis-a-la-portee-de-jeunes-scientifiques-du-College-SaintBernard/1# |date=15 January 2013 }},''L'Express'' 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Dene]] students from La Loche, Saskatchewan have taken part in this program twice, looking at effects of [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name="Dene"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lightsource.ca/media/spotlight_northern_exposure.php| title=Northern Exposure: Students from Saskatchewan's North do synchrotron science | date=October 2011| accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student Jontae DesRoches commented "Elders have noticed that the landscape, where trees used to grow, there's none growing anymore. They're pretty concerned because wildlife is disappearing. Like, here there used to be rabbits and now there's none".&lt;ref name="ammsa"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ammsa.com/publications/saskatchewan-sage/experiment-teaches-students-hands-chemistry-curriculum| title=Experiment teaches students hands-on chemistry curriculum | year=2011| accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 three student groups were at the CLS simultaneously, with the La Loche students as the first to use the IDEAS beamline.&lt;ref name="IDEAS" /&gt;

"The aim for the students," according to CLS education and outreach coordinator Tracy Walker, "is to get an authentic scientific inquiry that's different from the examples in textbooks that have been done thousands of times."&lt;ref name="CFIschool"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innovation.ca/node/5116 | title=Particle accelerating ... in high school | date=10 March 2010| accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from six [[Canadian province|provinces]] as well as the [[Northwest Territories]] have been directly involved in experiments, some of which have yielded publishable-quality research.&lt;ref name="Stride" /&gt;

In 2012 the CLS was awarded the [[Canadian Nuclear Society]]'s Education and Communication Award "in recognition of its commitment to community outreach, increasing public awareness of synchrotron science, and developing innovative and outstanding secondary educational programs such as Students on the Beamlines".&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Technical description==

===Accelerators===
[[Image:CLS synchrotron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The booster and storage rings inside the experimental hall]]
[[Image:Chicaned Undulators.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chicaned undulators inside the storage ring]]

====Injection system====

The injection system consists of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line.&lt;ref name="Injection"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/thpkf008.pdf| title=Injection system for the Canadian Light Source | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LINAC was operated for over 30 years as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab&lt;ref name="update 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/thpkf008.pdf|title=The Canadian Light Source: an update | year=2001 | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates at 2856&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, with an RF frequency of 500&amp;nbsp;MHz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.&lt;ref name="Injection"/&gt;

====Storage Ring====

The storage ring cell structure has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, [[microwave cavity|RF cavities]] and 9 sections available for insertion devices. Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As well as the two bend magnets each cell has three families of quadrupole magnets and two families of [[sextupole magnet]]s. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m.&lt;ref name="PAC2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/proceedings/PAPERS/WPPH093.PDF | title=The Canadian Light Source: an update | year=2001 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032624/http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/proceedings/PAPERS/WPPH093.PDF# | archive-date=2 May 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLS is the smallest of the newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal [[beam emittance]] of 18.2&amp;nbsp;nm-rad.&lt;ref name="Newest" /&gt;  The CLS was also one of the first facilities to [[chicane]] two [[undulator]]s in one straight section, to maximize the number of insertion device beamlines.&lt;ref name="SRNupdate"/&gt;

All five of the phase I X-ray beamlines use insertion devices. Four use permanent magnet undulators designed and assembled at the CLS, including one in-vacuum undulator and one elliptically polarized undulator (EPU). The HXMA beamline uses a superconducting [[wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] built by the [[Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in [[Novosibirsk]].&lt;ref name="SRNupdate"/&gt; Phase II added two further devices including another Budker superconducting wiggler, for the BMIT beamline.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lightsource.ca/operations/insertion_devices.php|title=Insertion devices| accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase III will add four more devices, filling 8 of the 9 available straight sections. Longer term development includes the replacement of two of the phase I undulators with elliptically polarizing devices.&lt;ref name="IDdev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC10/papers/wepd005.pdf|title=Insertion Device Development at the Canadian Light Source| year=2010 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ring operates at a fill current of 250mA with two injections per day.&lt;ref name="EllisPiC"/&gt; Facility status is shown on a "machine status" [http://mstatus.lightsource.ca/ webpage], and using the [https://twitter.com/clsfc CLSFC] account on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Gems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialmediatoday.com/dezguy/267745/three-useful-twitter-case-studies |title=Three useful Twitter case studies |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613182326/http://socialmediatoday.com/dezguy/267745/three-useful-twitter-case-studies |archivedate=13 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Superconducting RF Cavity ====
The CLS was the first light source to use a [[wikipedia:Superconducting radio frequency|superconducting RF (SRF) cavity]] in the storage ring from the beginning of operations.&lt;ref name="SRNupdate" /&gt; The [[niobium]] cavity is based on the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz design used at the [[Cornell Electron Storage Ring]] (CESR) which allows potentially beam-perturbing high order modes to propagate out of the cavity where they can be very effectively damped.&lt;ref name="PAC2001" /&gt;  The superconducting nature of the niobium cavity means only 0.02% of the RF power put into the cavity is wasted in heating the cavity as compared to roughly 40% for normal-conducting (copper) cavities.  However, a large portion of this power saving - about 160&amp;nbsp;kW out of the 250&amp;nbsp;kW saved - is needed to power the cryogenic plant required to supply liquid helium to the cavity.  The SRF cavity at CLS is fed with RF from a 310&amp;nbsp;kW Thales klystron.

The '''Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies''' ('''CCCS''') was a research centre at the University of Birmingham, England. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Graeme |title=British cultural studies : an introduction |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415252287 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of [[cultural studies]].

== History ==
The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'.  After its first director, [[Richard Hoggart]] departed in 1968, the Centre was led by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987).  The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the "Americanization" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Stuart |title=Race, Culture, and Communications: Looking Backward and Forward at Cultural Studies |journal=Rethinking Marxism |date=March 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |doi=10.1080/08935699208657998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dworkin |first1=Dennis |title=Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain : history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies |date=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822319144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a variety of influences ([[feminism]], [[structuralism]], [[Marxism]] - - especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[sociology]], [[critical race theory]], and [[post-structuralism]]), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Norma |title="Conditions of their Own Making: An Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham" |journal=Canadian Journal of Communication |date=1993 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stencilled Occasional Papers of the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/publications/stencilled-occasional-papers.aspx |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   


== Noted staff members ==
The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal ''Encoding/Decoding'' model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on "mugging" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.

Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media,  cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.

Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: [[Paul Gilroy]] (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, [[Angela McRobbie]] (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race,  Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies,  Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures,  and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.

[[Empirical]] researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced ''[[The Nationwide Project]]'' at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.

In later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), [[Sadie Plant]], noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of ''Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture''), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America'' and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]], a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.

== Closure in 2002 ==
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of "inexperienced 'macho management.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be "retained" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.

In April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a "very bad" 3a mark in a recent [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.

Students and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former [[alumni]] all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.

Additionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being "belatedly punished" for its political [[Radicalization|radicalism]], as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly [[leftwing]] Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all{{dubious|date=August 2016}} who had studied at the [[University of Birmingham]] between the 1960s and the 1980s.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Of the four staff members who were "retained", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).

Professor [[David Marsh (political scientist)|David Marsh]], a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.

The Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.

== 50th anniversary ==

{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the [[University of Birmingham]]– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[File:Codex on the Flight of Birds.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ms B Fol 88v: Design for a flying machine or catapul, taken from the codex.]]
'''''Codex on the Flight of Birds''''' is a relatively short [[codex]] of circa 1505&lt;ref&gt;Pedretti, 37&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It comprises 18 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s and measures 21 × 15 centimetres.  Now held at the [[Biblioteca Reale]] in [[Turin]], Italy, the codex begins with an examination of the [[bird flight|flight]] behavior of [[bird]]s and proposes mechanisms for flight by machines. Leonardo constructed a number of these machines, and attempted to launch them from a hill near [[Florence]]. However, his efforts failed.&lt;ref&gt;Cremante, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the codex, Leonardo  notes for the first time that the [[center of gravity]] of a flying bird does not coincide with its [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]].

==Summary==
The following summaries are from the codex whose English translation was prepared by Culturando and Smithsonian Institution.

===Front Page===
The front page is titled "On Casting Medals". The first paragraph gives a brief recipe that consists of "emery", "nitric acid", "iron filings", "vinegar", "ashes of walnut leaves", and "finely ground straw ash". The second paragraph tells of the process of crushing diamonds into diamond powder and separating the powder from lead. The last paragraph explains how to crush large crystals into smaller crystals, and how to grind, purify, and color enamel.&lt;ref name="Front Page of codex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-2-3|pages=2–3|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folio 1===
The first page in the folio one contains 11 diagrams with captions for each that relate to gravity, density, balance, and oscillations. The next page contains four diagrams and a lengthy paragraph on velocity and the differences in movement along the arc and chord of part of a circle.&lt;ref name="Folio 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-4-5|pages=4–5|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo comments on how gravity, which is caused by the "attraction of one object to another", takes place when an object is placed above another object and the top object is heavier than the bottom object. He also writes on the workings of a balance by describing how "the vertical center of a balance must always be perpendicular" and how the length of the arm on the balance is proportional to the amount of oscillations and the oscillation angle. A short commentary is included on relating density to weight, and he questions why ice floats in water if it is the denser of the two.&lt;ref name="Folio 1"/&gt;

In the last page of this folio, Leonardo explains why an object falling down the arc of a curve will fall faster than if the object falls down the chord of a curve. He explains this saying that the angle of the chord is half of the angle the curve makes between the midpoint, endpoint, and horizontal, and since this angle is half then the speed will also be half. He compares this with the angle the arc makes with the endpoint, midpoint, and horizontal. An object falling down an arc is then said to be 7/8 faster than if it were to fall down the chord of a curve.&lt;ref name="Folio 1"/&gt;

===Folio 2===
Folio 2 contains two images on each of the two pages along with commentary on the following: gravity,  powder amount vs. shot diameter, center of gravity for pyramids, and round balances.&lt;ref name="Folio 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-8-9|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=9 November 2013|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first paragraph, Leonardo restates his theory on gravity and expands on it to say that the motion caused by gravity acts in the direction of the imaginary line between the two object's centers. He goes on to say that motion due to gravity is only caused because the objects have no way to resist gravity.&lt;ref name="Folio 2"/&gt;

Leonardo then goes on to talk about the relation between the amount of powder and the size of ball. He writes that the amount of powder needed is proportional to the diameter of the ball. Expanding on that, he comes up with the amount of powder needed is "directly proportional to the square of the diameter".&lt;ref name="Folio 2"/&gt;

The center of gravity of a pyramid is written to lie "in the third point along of its length toward the base". He uses this geometry to explain how to find the center of gravity of a semicircle. If one were to divide the semicircle into pyramids whose bases were almost straight, then by finding the center of gravity of those pyramids one could find the center of gravity for the semicircle.&lt;ref name="Folio 2"/&gt;

The last page of folio 2 talks about rounded balances and how they react to gravity. Leonardo writes that if a balance was suspended in its center of gravity, then it would not move or oscillate, regardless of position. He then goes on to say that if there are two weights of equal mass on the ends of this balance, then, when moved from its starting position, the balance will never return to the starting position. After this, he theorizes that a balance in this same situation will move if one of the weights is along a straighter line of descent as compared to the other weight. He then disproves his theory by showing the balance and weights as symmetrically equal, meaning there is no reason for the balance to move.&lt;ref name="Folio 2"/&gt;

===Folio 3===
The third folio contains 10 drawings and commentary on the following: science of machines, balances, energy, and circular motion.&lt;ref name="Folio 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-14-15|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=9 November 2013|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo begins folio 3 with a declaration stating the science of machines is the most useful science overall because of its use by any moving object.&lt;ref name="Folio 3"/&gt;

He goes on to state that objects of different shapes that are on different degrees of slope have different amounts of energy. His next topic is about the construction of a certain balance in which circular motion is prevented. The diagrams in this folio represent round balances and multiple shaped objects on differing slopes that are connected together.&lt;ref name="Folio 3"/&gt;

===Folio 4===
Folio 4 contains nine diagrams and a page of text on gravity and its effect on different shapes connected together on a balance. The back page of this folio has Leonardo's first reference to birds and his explanation on how they fly.&lt;ref name="Folio 4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-16-17|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 November 2013|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo writes a lengthy amount of text about two weights that each weigh three pounds that are connected together on either side of a balance. The slopes that each object rests on are at different angles, however. Leonardo goes on to write that, because of the slopes, one weight may weigh three pounds, but it is only providing two pounds of force. The other weight, also three pounds, is similarly stated to only provide one pound of force because it is resting on a smaller incline. Later on this page, he writes on the forces a balance experiences depending on the location of weights on the balance. The first reference to pressure for this codex is made towards the end of this folio, relating it to the working of a balance.&lt;ref name="Folio 4"/&gt;

The first commentary on birds, for this codex, are made on the second page of the fourth folio. Leonardo describes how the tips of a bird's feathers are always the highest part of the bird, when its wings are lowered, and how the bones in the wing are the highest part of a bird when its wings are raised. He writes on the heaviest part of a body being the location that guides movement for that body. He also questions what part of the wing of a bird experiences the greatest amount of air pressure. To end this folio, Leonardo states how an object, "that does not bend under the pressure of objects of different sizes and weights", will distribute its weight to its supporting points that surround the center of the object.&lt;ref name="Folio 4"/&gt;

===Folio 5===
The fifth folio contains six diagrams and commentary on birds and flight.&lt;ref name="Folio 5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-18-19|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 November 2013|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo starts off folio 5 by stating that if a man were to be in a flying machine, nothing should get in his way from the waist up, so that he can balance himself as one does in a boat. He goes on to write on how a bird's direction will change with the direction of the wind. A bird which is going in a straight line that comes into a cross breeze at a perpendicular angle will now be heading in a direction that is in between the two endpoints of each direction. He ends the first page by explaining that if a bird in a descent wants to turn left or right, then it will lower the wing on the side of the direction it wants to turn.&lt;ref name="Folio 5"/&gt;

Birds can gain altitude, as stated by Leonardo, by "[raising] the shoulders and [beating] the tips of the wings towards itself, thus condensing the air that stands between the tips of [its] wings and itself". He also describes the flight of a kite as seeking a wind current. When the winds are high, one will see the bird very high in the sky, but when the winds are low, the bird stays closer to the ground. Leonardo describes how a bird rests in the air, after flapping its wings to gain altitude, by gliding downward to the ground.&lt;ref name="Folio 5"/&gt;

===Folio 6===
Folio 6 contains multiple diagrams of birds flying and their bone structure, and all of the commentary is on flight and how birds fly the way that they do.&lt;ref name="Folio 6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-20-21|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 November 2013|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo starts off by describing how a bird ascends or descends in different wind conditions. Here is a summary.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ How birds fly depending on wind direction, based on Leonardo's ''On the Flight of Birds''&lt;ref name="Folio 6"/&gt;
|-
! Wind Direction !! Ascent !! Descent
|-
| Headwind || Over the wind, with wind on breast || Under the wind, with wind on back
|-
| Left Wind || Left wing under wind || Left wing under the wind
|-
| Tailwind || Under the wind (debatable, according to Leonardo) ||
|}

He states that the only way for a bird to ascend when in a tailwind is for the bird, at its peak ascent, to turn in a semicircle and face the wind to continue its ascension in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="Folio 6"/&gt;

Leonardo explains that a bird should fly above the clouds to prevent its wings from getting wet and to avoid the circular air patterns that come from mountainous terrain. If a bird flies above the clouds and somehow gets turned over, then it should have plenty of time to turn itself back over by either "[falling] immediately with the wingtip downwind, or lowering the opposite wing to below halfway". He also comments on the rib structure of a bird and theorizes which ribs are the most useful. He ends folio 6 by stating he needs to do more practical tests on the ribs of birds.&lt;ref name="Folio 6"/&gt;

===Folio 7===
The seventh folio contains a very detailed diagram of either the tip of a bird's wing or the wing of a possible flying machine along with five more diagrams of birds in flight.&lt;ref name="Folio 7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-22-23|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 November 2013|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo starts writing on a flying machine and comparing it with the notes he has already taken on the flight of birds. He states that "the bird" (machine) must attain a high altitude it case it were to turn over so as to have enough time to right itself. He notes that the framework needs to be strong with leather laces and raw silk for the ribs. He also adds that there should not be any metal in the machine because of its tendency to wear or break under stress.&lt;ref name="Folio 7"/&gt;

He continues his notes on the flying machine by writing on the "nerve" of the machine. It was to be made of a "thick ribbon of tanned leather" that would spread the wing in flight. He was going to use this same framework in the "nerves" above and below this one for safety reasons.&lt;ref name="Folio 7"/&gt;

The rest of folio 7 is Leonardo's notes and instructions on how to fly his machine like a bird. Here is a quick summary:&lt;ref name="Folio 7"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Situation !! Note
|-
| Wingtip is turned toward the wind || This wing must be put above or below the wind along with the side of the tail and the rudder of the wing's humorous 
|-
| While descending || The side nearest to the center of gravity will descend first
|-
| While descending || The heavier part of the machine will be in front of the geometric center
|-
| While airborne, without wing-flapping, and without assistance from the wind || The machine's geometric center and center of gravity correspond
|-
| While descending || The heavier part of the machine will never be equal to or higher than the lighter part
|-
| While descending tail first || If tail rotates backward, the machine will regain balance. If tail rotates forward, the machine will flip over
|-
| While stably flying || If the resistance from the wing is moved behind the center of gravity, the machine will descend head first
|-
| While stably flying || If the resistance from the wing is moved in front of the center of gravity, the machine will descend tail first
|}

===Folio 8===
Leonardo's eighth folio in ''On the Flight of Birds'' contains 11 diagrams of birds flying and more instructions for his flying machine. Here is a quick summary of the first half of Folio 8:&lt;ref name="Folio 8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-24-25|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 November 2013|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Situation !! Note
|-
| If the wing and belly of the machine are too far above the wind || Lower the opposite wing to be righted by the wind
|-
| If the wing and belly of the machine are too far below the wind || Raise the opposite wing to be righted by the wind, as long as the lifted wing is less slanted than the lower wing
|-
| If the wing and belly of the machine are too far below the wind || Raise the opposite wing in favor of the wind to straighten the machine
|-
| If the wing and back of the machine are too far below the wind || Raise the opposite wing and shelter it from the wind to straighten the machine
|-
| If the back of the machine is to the wind || The tail must be below the wind
|-
| If the back of the machine is below the wind || The tail must be above the wind
|}

Leonardo goes on to write that if the "bird" is above the wind but turning into the wind, the "bird" must lower its tail otherwise it will overturn. He states that the action of lowering the tail to be less susceptible to wind in this situation will make it impossible for the "bird" to be overturned. He goes on to prove this by referencing the "Elements of Machinery". Afterwards, he writes on the compression of air due to the wings, and he states that the entire length of the wing is not used in the compression of air in front of the wing. To prove this, he asks readers to examine bird wings for themselves and to check the larger spacing in between the not as large feathers.&lt;ref name="Folio 8"/&gt;

===Folio 9===
Folio 9 contains another 12 diagrams of birds in flight and structure framework.&lt;ref name="Folio 9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex on the Flight of Birds|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/codex/codex.cfm#page-26-27|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 November 2013|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur Devis 001.jpg|thumb|''Sir George and Lady Strickland in the Grounds of Boynton Hall'', oil on canvas, 1751. A conversation piece by [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/3921/sir-george-and-lady-strickland-in-the-grounds-of-boynton-hall-arthur-devis&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''conversation piece''' is an informal group [[portrait]], especially those painted in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, beginning in the 1720s. They are distinguished by their portrayal of the group apparently engaged in genteel conversation or some activity, very often outdoors. Typically the group will be members of a family, but friends may be included, and some groups are of friends, members of a society or hunt, or some other grouping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/conversation-piece Glossary: Conversation Piece.] The National Gallery. Retrieved 7 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the paintings are relatively small, about the same size as a half-length portrait but in horizontal or "landscape" format; others are much larger.

==Origins==
[[File:Johan Zoffany - Tribuna of the Uffizi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Zoffany]] paints a group of Englishmen in Rome for the [[Grand Tour]], united only by their wealth and love of art; unlike most conversation pieces, this was not a commissioned work.]]
The genre was developed from 17th century portraiture in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gaunt (art historian)|Gaunt, William]]. (1964) ''A concise history of English painting''. London: [[Thames and Hudson]], p. 58. {{ISBN|0500200165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  compositions of merrymaking companies (''vrolijk gezelschap'') and garden parties (''buitenpartij'') painted by artists such as [[Dirck Hals]], [[David Vinckbooms]], [[Adriaen van de Venne]] and [[Willem Buytewech]] were an important influence on the genre.  In addition, representations of elegant companies and balls by [[Hieronymus Janssens]] and the works of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], in particular his ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'' ([[Prado Museum]]), gave an impetus and direction to the development of the genre.  In this last work, Rubens showed how a garden could be used as a setting for amorous dalliance and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Tavener, ''Nicolas Lancret: Dance Before a Fountain'', Holmes Getty Publications, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Low Countries many group portraits were painted, both of family groups and groups such as Governors or Regents of institutions, or militia officers. [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]] and other artists had adopted a variety of poses to liven up the group portrait, for example the famous ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]''.  The name derives from the Italian term, also used in English, ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' for a similarly informal painting of the [[Virgin and Child]] with saints, a genre developed in the Renaissance.

==Varieties==
There are many varieties of conversation piece. People may be portrayed sharing common activities such as hunts, meals, or musical parties. Dogs and/or horses are also frequently featured. [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]] was a regional painter famous for his small conversation pieces, popular with the gentry of [[Cheshire]]. [[William Hogarth]] also worked in the genre, and parodied it in his print ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'', which depicted a group of men whose conversation has degenerated into drunken incoherence. [[Johann Zoffany]] specialized in complicated conversation pieces, and most portraits by [[George Stubbs]] take this form, with horses and carriages in the composition. [[Joshua Reynolds]] would on request produce conversation pieces in the [[Grand Manner]], and at his usual near-life scale.

==Conversation starters==
The phrase "conversation piece" later acquired a different meaning. It came to refer to objects that were perceived to be interesting enough to spark conversation about them. They provide a stimulus for prop-based [[conversation opener]]s. The original conversation pieces sometimes depicted a group united in conversation about an object, which would typically be an item linked to science or scholarship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Diplomatics''' (in American English, and in most anglophone countries), or '''diplomatic''' (in British English),&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|diplomatic, adj. and n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beal"/&gt; is a scholarly discipline centred on the critical analysis of [[document]]s: especially, [[historical document]]s. It focuses on the conventions, protocols and formulae that have been used by document creators, and uses these to increase understanding of the processes of document creation, of information transmission, and of the relationships between the facts which the documents purport to record and reality.

The discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official [[charter]]s and [[diploma]]s issued by royal and papal [[chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]]. It was subsequently appreciated that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and [[legal instrument]], to non-official documents such as private [[Letter (message)|letters]], and, most recently, to the [[metadata]] of electronic records.

Diplomatics is one of the [[auxiliary sciences of history]]. It should not be confused with its sister-discipline of [[palaeography]].&lt;ref name="Duranti12"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duranti |first=Luciana |authorlink=Luciana Duranti |title=Diplomatics: New uses for an Old Science |journal=Archivaria |volume=28 |year=1989 |url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/11567/12513 |pages=7–27 (12) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, its techniques have more in common with those of the literary disciplines of [[textual criticism]] and [[historical criticism]].

==Etymology==
[[File:De re diplomatica 17765.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Jean Mabillon]]'s ''De re diplomatica'' (1681)]]

Despite the verbal similarity, the discipline has nothing to do with [[diplomacy]]. Both terms are derived, by separate linguistic development, from the word ''diploma'', which originally referred to a folded piece of writing material—and thus both to the materials which are the focus of study in diplomatics, and to accreditation papers carried by diplomats.

The word ''diplomatics'' was effectively coined by the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Jean Mabillon]], who in 1681 published his treatise, ''De re diplomatica'' ([[Latin]]: roughly, "The Study of Documents"). From there, the word entered the French language as ''diplomatique'', and then English as ''diplomatic'' or ''diplomatics''.

==Definitions==
''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' (1828) defines diplomatics as the "science of diplomas, or of ancient writings, literary and public documents, letters, decrees, charters, codicils, etc., which has for its object to decipher old writings, to ascertain their authenticity, their date, signatures, etc."&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Dictionary'' (1828); quoted in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (2d ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio Cencetti (1908–1970) defined the discipline as "the study of the ''Wesen'' [being] and ''Werden'' [becoming] of documentation, the analysis of genesis, inner constitution and transmission of documents, and of their relationship with the facts represented in them and with their creators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Giorgio |last=Cencetti |chapter=La Preparazione dell'Archivista |title=Antologia di Scritti Archivistici |editor-first=Romualdo |editor-last=Giuffrida |place=Rome |publisher=Archivi di Stato |year=1985 |page=285}} Translation from Duranti 1989, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission International de Diplomatique]] has defined diplomatics as "the science which studies the tradition, the form and the issuing of written documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cei.lmu.de/VID/VID.php?1 |title=Vocabulaire Internationale de Diplomatique |editor-first=Maria Milagros |editor-last=Cárcel Ortí |edition=2nd |place=Valencia |year=1997 |publisher=Collecció Oberta |page=21 |quote=La Diplomatique est la science qui étudie la tradition, la forme et l'élaboration des actes écrits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Peter Beal defines diplomatics as "the science or study of documents and records, including their forms, language, script and meaning. It involves knowledge of such matters as the established wording and procedures of particular kinds of document, the deciphering of writing, and document analysis and authentication".&lt;ref name="beal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter|last=Beal |title=A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450–2000 |year=2008 |place=Oxford| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo Kölzer defines diplomatics as "the teaching and the study of charters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kölzer |first=Theo |chapter=Diplomatics |title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – methods – trends |editor-first=Albrecht |editor-last=Classen |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |year=2010 |isbn=9783110184099 |volume=1 |pages=405–424 (405) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He treats the terms "charter", "diploma", and "document" as broadly synonymous, and refers to the German scholar [[Harry Bresslau]]'s definition of "documents" as "written declarations recorded in compliance with certain forms alternating according to the difference in person, place, time, and matter, which are meant to serve as a testimony of proceedings of a legal nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bresslau |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Bresslau |title=Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien |volume=1 |edition=4th |year=1969 |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly speaking, and as usually understood by present-day scholars, diplomatics is concerned essentially with the analysis and interpretation of the linguistic and textual elements of a document. It is, however, closely associated with several parallel disciplines, including [[palaeography]], [[sigillography]], [[codicology]], and [[provenance]] studies, all of which are concerned with a document's physical characteristics and history, and which will often be carried out in conjunction with a diplomatic analysis. The term diplomatics is therefore sometimes used in a slightly wider sense, to encompass some of these other areas (as it was in Mabillon's original work, and as is implied in the definitions of both Webster and Beal quoted above). The recent development of the science in non-English Europe is expanding its scope to a cultural history of documentation including aspects of [[pragmatic literacy]] or [[symbolic communication]].

[[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], a distinguished teacher of diplomatics, referred to the discipline's reputation in 1970 as that of "a formidable and dismal science ... a kind of game played by a few scholars, most of them medievalists, harmless so long as it does not dominate or obscure historical enquiry; or, perhaps, most commonly of all, an aid to understanding of considerable use to scholars and research students if only they had time to spare from more serious pursuits".&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooke |first=Christopher N. L. |authorlink=Christopher N. L. Brooke |title=The teaching of Diplomatic |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=4 |year=1970 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1080/00379817009513930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[image:Traité de diplomatique tome 4 17008.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume 4 of [[René-Prosper Tassin|Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain|Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'' (1759)]]
In the [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] periods, the authenticity of a document was considered to derive from the document's place of preservation and storage, in, for example, temples, public offices, and archives. As a result, those with nefarious motives were able to give [[Forgery|forged documents]] a spurious authenticity by depositing them in places of authority. Diplomatics grew from a need to establish new standards of authenticity through the critical analysis of the textual and physical forms of documents.&lt;ref name="Duranti12"/&gt;

The first notable application of diplomatics was by [[Nicolas of Cusa]], in 1433, and [[Lorenzo Valla]], in 1440, who determined, independently, that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which had been used for centuries to legitimize papal temporal authority, was a forgery.  Diplomatics became important during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its emergence as a recognisably distinct sub-discipline, however, is generally dated to the publication of [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon's]] ''De re diplomatica'' in 1681. Mabillon had begun studying old documents with a view towards establishing their authenticity as a result of the doubts raised by the [[Jesuit]] [[Daniel van Papenbroek]] over supposed [[Merovingian]] documents from the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the production of spurious [[charter]]s and other documents had been common, either to provide written documentation of existing rights or to bolster the plausibility of claimed rights. Mabillon's work engendered a far livelier awareness of the potential presence of forged or spurious documents, in the fields of both [[history]] and [[law]].

Although Mabillon is still widely seen as the "father" of diplomatics, a more important milestone in the formation of the battery of practical techniques which make up the modern discipline was the publication of [[René-Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'', which appeared in six volumes in 1750–65.

The most significant work in English was [[Thomas Madox]]'s ''Formulare Anglicanum'', published in 1702. In general, however, the discipline was always studied more intensively by continental scholars than by those in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison |first=Charlotte |title=Thomas Madox and the Origins of English Diplomatic Scholarship |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=147–169 |doi=10.1080/00379810902916282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatics is often associated with the study of documents of the medieval period. However, scholars such as [[Luciana Duranti]] have argued that many of its theories and principles can be adapted and applied to contemporary [[archival science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams |first=Caroline |title=Diplomatic Attitudes: from Mabillon to Metadata |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=26 |year=2005 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1080/00039810500047417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The study of diplomatics is a valuable tool for [[historian]]s, enabling them to determine whether alleged [[historical document]]s and [[archive]]s are in fact genuine or [[forgery|forgeries]]. Its techniques may also be used to help date undated documents.

Diplomatics has many similar applications in the field of [[law]].

Some famous cases in which the principles of diplomatics have been employed have included:
* [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s proof of the forgery of the [[Donation of Constantine]]. Valla's work preceded Mabillon by roughly two centuries, and was the first application of the principles of modern, scientific diplomatics.
* The [[Hitler diaries]] [[hoax]] (1983).
* The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|National Archives forgeries]] (the Martin Allen forgeries, or [[Himmler]] forged documents) (2005).

==Diplomatic editions and transcription==
A '''diplomatic edition''' is an edition (in print or online) of an historic manuscript text that seeks to reproduce as accurately as possible in typography all significant features of the manuscript original, including spelling and punctuation, abbreviations, deletions, insertions, and other alterations. Similarly, '''diplomatic transcription''' attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs all features of a manuscript original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory A. |last=Pass |title=Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts |place=Chicago |publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries |year=2003 |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''semi-diplomatic'' is used for an edition or transcription that seeks to reproduce only some of these features of the original. A diplomatic edition is thus distinguished from a ''normalized edition'', in which the editor, while not altering the original wording of the text, renders it using normal (modern) [[orthography]].

A diplomatic edition is also to be distinguished both from a ''[[facsimile]] edition'', which, in the modern era, normally employs photographic or digital images; and from a ''type facsimile'' (such as [[Abraham Farley]]'s [[Publication of Domesday Book#Abraham Farley's edition (1773–1783)|edition of ''Domesday Book'']]), which seeks to reproduce the appearance of the original through the use of a [[Record type|special typeface]] or [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative|digital font]].

It arises from a deficit within the [[phoneme]]-to-[[grapheme]] conversion process in a [[Cognition|cognitive]] function specialized in the conversion of the voicing feature of phonemes into graphemes – a distinct function within the phoneme-to-grapheme conversion route. This deficit does not result from impairments in [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory processing]] or in [[Speech disorder|speech production]]. It can occur with completely intact graphemic buffer, phonological output [[lexicon]], phonological output buffer, and allographic stage – the function that processes the voicing feature for writing may be selectively impaired without deficits in other functions of the conversion route. Dyscravia may or may not be accompanied by a parallel [[reading disability]] (i.e. a [[dyslexia]] in which letters denoting [[voiceless]] consonants are pronounced as voiced and vice versa).

An '''environmental gradient''' is a gradual change in [[Abiotic component|abiotic factors]] through space (or time). Environmental gradients can be related to factors such as [[altitude]], [[temperature]], depth, ocean proximity and soil humidity.

Species [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]]s usually change along environmental gradients in a more or less predictive way. However, the species abundance along an environmental gradient is not only determined by the abiotic factor but, also by the change in the [[biotic interaction]]s, like [[competition (biology)|competition]], along the environmental gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinckley |first=Tom |title=Gradients |url=http://www.sefs.washington.edu/classes.esc.401/Gradients.htm |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=18 September 2013 |author2=Combs, Julie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415130557/http://www.sefs.washington.edu/classes.esc.401/Gradients.htm |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an [[ecotone]], species [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]]s change relatively quickly compared to the environmental gradient.

The [[species distribution]] along environmental gradients has been studied intensively due to large databases of species presence data (e.g. [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility|GBIF]])

Environmental Gradients are linked to Connectivity and natural disturbance when considering river systems. A river restoration scheme must consider all of these factors before undertaking a program as these three factors are what leads to a larger biodiversity.

Each species are not found in every type of habitat or in every part of the world. Within the environment there are multiple factors which affects organisms. The organisms in the polar region can not survive the climate at the equator.

[[Huisman–Olff–Fresco models]] describe unimodal species responses over an environmental gradient.

'''Harry Halbreich''' ([[Berlin]], 9 February 1931 – [[Brussels]], 27 June 2016)  was a Belgian [[musicologist]].&lt;ref name=Halb2007dust&gt;Dust jacket biography of Harry Halbreich from [[#Halbreich2007|Halbreich (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2016/07/01/mort-d-harry-halbreich-musicologue-belge_4962041_3382.html|title=Mort d’Harry Halbreich, musicologue belge|first=Philippe-Jean|last=Catinchi|date=1 July 2016|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diapason"&gt;Patrick Szersnovicz. Harry Halbreich (obituary). ''[[Diapason (magazine)|Diapason]]'', September 2016, No.649, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of a [[Jewish-German]] father and English mother, Halbreich studied with [[Arthur Honegger]] and later with [[Olivier Messiaen]] at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gaining a first prize in analysis and history of music.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt; He later made his base in Belgium. From 1970 to 1976 he was Lecturer ({{lang-de|Dozent}}) in Musical Analysis at the Royal Conservatory in [[Mons]]. He worked on numerous radio broadcasts and co-founded the Belgian music magazine ''Crescendo'' for which he was a major contributor.&lt;ref name=Halb2007dust/&gt; From 1973 to 1976 he was artistic director of the Festival de Royan.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

He was known for a number of books, articles and studies on modern and contemporary music, including monograph works on [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Arthur Honegger]], and [[Bohuslav Martinů]]. He prepared musical catalogues of the works of Honegger and Martinů, and their works are therefore sometimes referred to by their '''H&amp;nbsp;number'''. He assisted Nicolas Bacri in orchestrating Honegger's [[opera]], ''La morte de Sainte Alméenne'', originally written in 1918 for voice and piano; the new version was premiered in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] on 26 November 2005, on the 50th anniversary of the composer's death.

Halbreich's interest in modern music led to him writing articles on composers including contemporary music, particularly [[Spectral music]]: [[Horațiu Rădulescu]], [[Iancu Dumitrescu]], [[Ana-Maria Avram]], [[Gérard Grisey]], and [[Tristan Murail]]. He has also written on composers of the past, including [[Edgard Varèse]], [[George Enescu]], [[Maurice Ohana]] as well as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. A personal friend of contemporary performers and composers such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Giacinto Scelsi]], [[György Ligeti]] and [[Witold Lutosławski]], he was a keen defender of younger composers.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

He had a broad interest in culture, and while a convert to Catholicism, he was open to, and expressed deep knowledge of eastern spiritual history alongside Christian mystics.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

He died on 27 June 2016 at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slippedisc.com/2016/06/death-of-h-number-musicologist/ Death of H-number musicologist]&lt;/ref&gt;
Of his three children, the eldest Frédéric is a painter.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

'''Hydraulics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: Υδραυλική) is a technology and [[applied science]] using [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], and other sciences involving the mechanical properties and use of [[liquid]]s. At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid counterpart of [[pneumatics]], which concerns [[gas]]es. [[Fluid mechanics]] provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the applied engineering using the properties of fluids. In its [[fluid power]] applications, hydraulics is used for the generation, control, and transmission of [[Power (physics)|power]] by the use of [[pressure|pressurized]] liquids. Hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and most of engineering modules, and cover concepts such as pipe [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], [[dam]] design, [[fluidics]] and fluid control circuitry. The principles of hydraulics are in use naturally in the human body within the vascular system and erectile tissue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industrialoutpost.com/human-circulatory-system-heart-modern-hydraulic/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501112640/http://www.industrialoutpost.com/human-circulatory-system-heart-modern-hydraulic/ |date=1 May 2017 }}{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meldrum |first1=David R. |last2=Burnett |first2=Arthur L. |last3=Dorey |first3=Grace |last4=Esposito |first4=Katherine |last5=Ignarro |first5=Louis J. |title=Erectile Hydraulics: Maximizing Inflow While Minimizing Outflow |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=1208–20 |year=2014 |pmid=24521101 |doi=10.1111/jsm.12457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Free surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with [[free surface]] flow, such as occurring in [[river]]s, [[canal]]s, [[lake]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[sea]]s. Its sub-field [[open-channel flow]] studies the flow in open [[channel (geography)|channels]].

The word "hydraulics" originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ὑδραυλικός}} (''hydraulikos'') which in turn originates from {{lang|grc|ὕδωρ}} (''hydor'', Greek for [[water]]) and {{lang|grc|αὐλός}} (''aulos'', meaning [[plumbing|pipe]]).

==Ancient and medieval era==
[[File:Tuebingen-gerstenmuehle.jpg|thumb|200px|Waterwheel.]]
Early uses of water power date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], where [[irrigation]] has been used since the 6th millennium BC and [[water clock]]s had been used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of [[water]] power include the [[Qanat]] system in ancient Persia and the [[Turpan water system]] in ancient Central Asia.

===Greek / Hellenistic age===
The Greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems. An example is the construction by [[Eupalinos]], under a public contract, of a watering channel for [[Samos]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]]. An early example of the usage of hydraulic wheel, probably the earliest in Europe, is the Perachora wheel (3rd century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomlinson |first1=R. A. |title=The Perachora Waterworks: Addenda |journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens |volume=71 |year=2013 |pages=147–8 |jstor=30103359 |doi=10.1017/S0068245400005864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the first hydraulic [[automata]] by [[Ctesibius]] (flourished c. 270 BC) and [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10 – 80 AD) is notable. Hero describes a number of working machines using hydraulic power, such as the [[force pump]], which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.&lt;ref&gt;Museum, Victoria and Albert.

=== Ancient Persia ===
The Persians constructed an intricate system of water mills, canals and dams known as the [[Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System]]. The project, commenced by [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] king [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] and finished by a group of Roman engineers captured by Sassanian king [[Shapur I]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1315|title=Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been referred to by [[UNESCO]] as "a masterpiece of creative genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1315|title=Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the inventors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The qanats of Iran|last=Goldsmith|first=Edward|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Qanat]], an underground aqueduct.

===China===
In [[ancient China]] there was [[Sunshu Ao]] (6th century BC), [[Ximen Bao]] (5th century BC), [[Du Shi]] (circa 31 AD), [[Zhang Heng]] (78 – 139 AD), and [[Ma Jun]] (200 – 265 AD), while medieval China had [[Su Song]] (1020 – 1101 AD) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). Du Shi employed a [[waterwheel]] to power the [[bellows]] of a [[blast furnace]] producing [[cast iron]]. Zhang Heng was the first to employ hydraulics to provide motive power in rotating an [[armillary sphere]] for [[Chinese astronomy|astronomical observation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71370433|title=Origins of Chinese science and technology|last=1974-|first=Fu, Chunjiang,|last2=Liping.|first2=Yang,|last3=N.|first3=Han, Y.|last4=Editorial.|first4=Asiapac|date=2006|publisher=Asiapac|isbn=978-9812293763|oclc=71370433}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Innovations in Ancient Rome===
[[File:Segovia Aqueduct.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Aqueduct of Segovia]], a 1st-century AD masterpiece.]]

In [[Ancient Rome]], many different hydraulic applications were developed, including public water supplies, innumerable [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s, power using [[watermill]]s and [[hydraulic mining]]. They were among the first to make use of the [[siphon]] to carry water across valleys, and used [[hushing]] on a large scale to prospect for and then extract metal [[ore]]s. They used [[lead]] widely in [[plumbing]] systems for domestic and public supply, such as feeding [[thermae]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Hydraulic mining]] was used in the gold-fields of northern Spain, which was conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC. The alluvial [[gold-mine]] of [[Las Medulas]] was one of the largest of their mines. It was worked by at least 7 long aqueducts, and the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits, and then wash the tailings for the valuable gold content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/803|title=Las Médulas|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patrimoniocastillayleon.com/en/las-medulas|title=Las Médulas|last=ricardo|date=2014-10-30|work=Castilla y León World Heritage UNESCO|access-date=2017-06-13|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, David.

==Modern era (c. 1600 – 1870)==

===Benedetto Castelli===
In 1619 [[Benedetto Castelli]] (1576 – 1578–1643), a student of [[Galileo Galilei]], published the book ''Della Misura dell'Acque Correnti'' or "On the Measurement of Running Waters", one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics. He served as a chief consultant to the Pope on hydraulic projects, i.e., management of rivers in the Papal States, beginning in 1626.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/castelli.html|title=The Galileo Project – Science – Benedetto Castelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blaise Pascal===
[[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the [[hydraulic press]], which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application of a larger force totaled over a larger area, transmitted through the same pressure (or same change of pressure) at both locations. [[Pascal's law]] or principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest, the difference in pressure is proportional to the difference in height and this difference remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by applying an external force. This implies that by increasing the pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other point in the container, i.e., any change in pressure applied at any point of the fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids.

===Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille===
A French physician, [[Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille|Poiseuille]] researched the flow of blood through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Sutera and Skalak, Salvatore and Richard. The History of Poiseuille's Law. Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 1993. 25: 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===In the UK===
Several cities developed citywide [[hydraulic power network]]s in the 19th century, to operate machinery such as lifts, cranes, capstans and the like. [[Joseph Bramah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robinsonlibrary.com/technology/engineering/biography/bramah.htm |title=Joseph Bramah |publisher=Robinsonlibrary.com |date=2014-03-23 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early innovator and [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/technology/engineers/armstrong.html |title=William George Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Cragside (1810-1900) |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; perfected the apparatus for power delivery on an industrial scale.  In London, the [[London Hydraulic Power Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/h/hydraulic_power_in_london/index.shtml |title=Subterranea Britannica: Sites: Hydraulic power in London |publisher=Subbrit.org.uk |date=1981-09-25 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a major supplier its pipes serving large parts of the [[West End of London]], [[City of London|City]] and the [[London Docks|Docks]], but there were schemes restricted to single enterprises such as docks and [[railway]] [[goods yard]]s.

=== Hydraulic models ===

After students understand the basic principles of hydraulics, some teachers use a hydraulic [[analogy]] to help students learn other things.
For example:
* The [[MONIAC Computer]] uses water flowing through hydraulic components to help students learn about economics.
* The [[thermal resistance#Analogies|thermal-hydraulic analogy]] uses hydraulic principles to help students learn about thermal circuits.
* The electronic–[[hydraulic analogy]] uses hydraulic principles to help students learn about electronics.

The [[conservation of mass]] requirement combined with fluid [[compressibility]] yields a fundamental relationship between pressure, fluid flow, and volumetric expansion, as shown below &lt;ref&gt;http://opac.vimaru.edu.vn/edata/DHHH/2017/02/22/SDHLT%2002954%20-%20Hydraulic%20control%20systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac \beta V \cdot \left( \sum_{IN} Q - \frac{dV}{dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming an incompressible fluid or a "very large" ratio of compressibility to contained fluid volume, a finite rate of pressure rise requires that any net flow into the contained fluid volume create a volumetric change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">In [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]], '''image-based modeling and rendering''' ('''IBMR''') methods rely on a set of two-dimensional images of a scene to [[3D reconstruction from multiple images|generate a three-dimensional model]] and then [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] some novel views of this scene.

The traditional approach of computer graphics has been used to create a geometric model in 3D and try to reproject it onto a two-dimensional image.  Computer vision, conversely, is mostly focused on detecting, grouping, and extracting features (edges, faces, ''etc.'') present in a given picture and then trying to interpret them as three-dimensional clues.  Image-based modeling and rendering allows the use of multiple two-dimensional images in order to generate directly novel two-dimensional images, skipping the manual modeling stage.

== Light modeling ==
Instead of considering only the physical model of a solid, IBMR methods usually focus more on light modeling.  The fundamental concept behind IBMR is the [[plenoptic illumination function]] which is a parametrisation of the [[light field]]. The plenoptic function describes the light rays contained in a given volume. It can be represented with seven dimensions: a ray is defined by its position &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;, its orientation &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, its wavelength &lt;math&gt;(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and its time &lt;math&gt;(t)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;P (x,y,z,\theta,\phi,\lambda,t)&lt;/math&gt;.  IBMR methods try to approximate the plenoptic function to render a novel set of two-dimensional images from another.  Given the high dimensionality of this function, practical methods place constraints on the parameters in order to reduce this number (typically to 2 to 4).

==IBMR methods and algorithms==
*View [[morphing]] generates a transition between images
*Panoramic imaging renders panoramas using image mosaics of individual still images
*Lumigraph relies on a dense sampling of a scene
*Space carving generates a 3D model based on a [[photo-consistency]] check
&lt;!--The above deserve better explanations here--&gt;

The '''Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA)''' is an independent research organisation founded as a joint initiative of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in cooperation with the pharmaceutical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]]. IMBA operates in close collaboration with the [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology]], Boehringer's basic research center both located next to each other at the [[Vienna Biocenter]] (VBC).

==Research==
IMBA's research aims to understand the fundamental [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] processes and is currently focused on [[cell biology]], [[RNA interference]], and [[epigenetics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Associated projects===
The Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) is located at IMBA, and is available to researchers worldwide.&lt;ref name="IMBAFlies"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fly House | website=IMBA - Institute of Molecular Biotechnology | url=https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/scientific-facilities/fly-house/ | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It collects an RNAi library of over 22,000 [[Drosophila]] strains.

==History==
The Institute of Molecular Biotechnology was founded in 1999 as a joint initiative of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and Boehringer Ingelheim. The Austrian Government and the city of Vienna would also contribute to its funding and in 2002 the geneticist [[Josef Penninger]] started  as the Scientific Director of IMBA who would recruit [[Barry Dickson]] as the first group leader; Dickson became managing director of the neighbouring institute [[Research Institute of Molecular Pathology]] (IMP) in 2006.

The construction of the institute started in 2003 and completed in 2006. The institute lies wall-to-wall with the IMP, to enhance collaborations and with whom they share the scientific facilities.

IMBA went on expanding and in 2007 the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) in collaboration with the IMP is opened.

Since 2007 IMBA has a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for decision making chaired by Nobel prize winner [[Eric Kandel]].

==Awards==
Being a newcomer in the Molecular Biology community, the IMBA has soon received recognition in the form of awards to its researchers and grants for projects. Josef Penninger, the scientific director, has been elected as a full member of The Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW). He has been awarded the [[Ernst Jung Prize]] for Medicine by the Jung-Stiftung for Science and Research, the [[Descartes Prize]] for Research by the [[European Commission]] and has received the Carus-Medal of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. In 2012, Josef Penninger was awarded with the Innovator Award for his project "Novel Approaches to Breast Cancer Prevention and Inhibition of Metastases" through the [[US Department of Defense]].

In 2013 Josef Penninger received his second [[European Research Council]]’s (ERC) Advanced Investigator Grant for his research in the field of [[haploid]] [[stem cells]].

Jürgen Knoblich, deputy scientific director at IMBA, was recognized with the [[Wittgenstein Award]], awarded by the Austrian [[Ministry of Education (Austria)|Ministry of Science]].

The institute has also received support by the European Research Council and Kazufumi Mochizuki has received one of the [[European Research Council]]'s first "ERC Starting grants".

==Science Communication==
In collaboration with the incorporated society Dialog Gentechnik, in 2006 IMBA opened the Vienna Open Lab, a hands-on biomolecular laboratory open to the public.&lt;ref name="Open Science"&gt;{{cite web | title=Open Science | website=Open Science | url=http://www.viennaopenlab.at/ | language=de | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16384">'''[[Island]] [[ecology]]''' is the study of island organisms and their interactions with each other and the environment.  Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth’s total land area,&lt;ref name="Paulay"&gt;Paulay, G. 1994. Biodiversity on Oceanic Islands: Its Origin and Extinction. ''American Zoology'' 34: 134-144.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the ecology of island ecosystems is vastly different from that of mainland communities.  Their isolation and high availability of empty [[Ecological niche|niche]]s leads to increased [[speciation]].  As a result, island ecosystems comprise 30% of the world’s [[biodiversity hotspots]], 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.&lt;ref name="Gerlach"&gt;Gerlach, Justin.  2008. [http://islandbiodiversity.com/gim.htm Island biodiversity - issues and opportunities]. World Conservation Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Many species still remain unknown.

The diversity of species on islands is highly impacted by human activities such as [[deforestation]] and introduction of [[exotic species]].  In response, ecologists and managers are directing attention towards [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of island species.  Because they are simple systems, islands provide an opportunity to study processes of [[extinction]] that can be extrapolated to larger ecosystems.

== Ecological processes on islands ==

Islands are attractive sites for ecological research because they provide clear examples of evolution in action.  They show interesting patterns of colonization, adaptation, and speciation.

===Colonization and establishment===

Islands are surrounded by water, and may or may not exist as part of a continental land mass.  Oceanic islands arise due to volcanic activity or reef growth, and usually subside over time due to erosion and changing sea levels.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  When islands emerge, they undergo the process of [[ecological succession]] as species colonize the island (see theory of [[island biogeography]]).  New species cannot immigrate via land, and instead must arrive via air, water, or wind.  As a result, organisms with high [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] capabilities, such as plants and birds, are much more common on islands than are poorly dispersing taxa like mammals.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  However, some mammals are present on islands, presumably from swimming or riding on natural “rafts” that are washed away from the mainland.

Of the species that arrive, only some will be able to survive and establish populations.  As a result, islands have fewer species than mainland habitats.  Island populations are small and exhibit low genetic variability (see [[founder effect]]), but are isolated from the predators and competitors that they initially evolved with.  This can lead to a process called [[ecological release]], where a species is released from its ancestral community interactions and then colonizes new niches.

===Adaptation===

In response to these changing ecological pressures, island species can become much more docile than their mainland counterparts, and may grow larger (see [[island gigantism]]) or smaller (see [[island dwarfism]]).  Some of these unique adaptations are reflected in charismatic island species such as the [[giant tortoise]], [[Komodo dragon]], or [[pygmy mammoth]]s.  
[[File:Varanus komodoensis 2.jpg|thumb|The Komodo dragon is an example of island gigantism.]] After immigration, birds, and some reptiles or mammals, tend to become larger and predatory,&lt;ref&gt;Alcover, J. A. and M. McMinn. 1994. Predators of Vertebrates on Islands. ''BioScience'' 44(1): 12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; showing relaxed [[intraspecific competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Stamps, J.A. and M. Buechner. 1985. The Territorial Defense Hypothesis and the Ecology of Insular Vertebrates. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 60(2): 155-181.&lt;/ref&gt;  For mammals, small species will increase in size and large species will decrease in size.&lt;ref&gt;Van Valen, L.M. 1973. Pattern and the Balance of Nature. ''Evolutionary Theory'' 1: 31−49.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as the “island rule,” and is suggested to minimize energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="McNab"&gt;McNab, B.K. 2002. Minimizing energy expenditure facilitates vertebrate persistence on oceanic islands. Ecology Letters 5(5): 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other adaptations to life on islands include increased [[poikilothermy]],&lt;ref name="McNab" /&gt; relaxed anti-predator behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Blumstein, D.T. 2002. Moving to suburbia: ontogenetic and evolutionary consequences of life on predator-free islands.

''Journal of Ecology'' 84(1): 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; in plants.

===Speciation===

The formation of new islands and their isolation from the mainland provides many unoccupied niches for species to adapt to.  Since immigration of predators and competitors is limited, many organisms are able to persist in these new niches.  This results in a high occurrence of [[endemism]], where species are unique to a localized area.  For example, 50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands.&lt;ref name="Gerlach" /&gt;

Endemism is often the result of [[adaptive radiation]].&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  Adaptive radiation is when a single species colonizes an area and rapidly diversifies to fill all of the available niches.  A common example is the assemblage of finch species documented by [[Charles Darwin]] in the [[Galapagos Islands]].  Darwin’s finches exhibited adaptive radiation by evolving different beak sizes to exploit the diversity of seeds present on the different islands.  [[File:Palila.jpg|thumb|The palila, one of several endangered honeycreepers that evolved through adaptive radiation and are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.]]

Because the distributions of these populations are limited by their island habitats, they tend to have fewer individuals than their mainland counterparts and lower genetic variation.  This, along with the behavioral and ecological factors mentioned above, makes island species more vulnerable to extinction.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;

===Survival===

The continued survival of species on islands depends on factors such as natural [[Selection (biology)|selection]], genetic variation, natural disturbances (hurricanes, volcanic eruptions) and human-caused disturbances (introduced species, habitat loss).  Human-caused disturbances tend to be the greatest cause of mortality, and understanding the causes of extinction facilitates conservation efforts.

=== Human impacts on island ecosystems ===

The movement of humans to islands has led to rapid extinction of native island species either from hunting, [[habitat destruction]], or [[introduced species]].

===Hunting===

Many large animals on islands have been hunted to extinction by humans.  A well-known example is the [[dodo]], once found on the island of [[Mauritius]].  It evolved to become large, flightless and docile, and was subsequently driven to extinction by humans and introduced predators.

===Habitat destruction===
The depletion of natural resources can have dramatic effects on island ecology.  On [[Easter Island]], the depletion of the forest by humans not only resulted in widespread loss of species, but also the collapse of the island civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P and J. Flenley. 1992. Easter Island, Earth Island. Thames and Hudson, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Luftbild Osterinsel.jpg|thumb|Easter Island has been a site of dramatic ecological change.]] Today there are over 500 million people on islands, all dependent on local resources either directly (traditional use) or indirectly (ecotourism revenue).  Population growth and development result in heavy [[deforestation]], [[pollution]], and [[over-exploitation]].  Overharvesting of ocean fauna is particularly troubling as yields of [[coral reef fish]] species are an important food source for island populations.

===Introduced species===

Humans have contributed to globalization and decreased effective isolation of island communities, allowing for invasion of exotic species.  This can have a profound effect on the native species.  In [[Guam]], the introduced [[brown tree snake]] ate nearly all of the native vertebrate species to extinction.  Feral cats and dogs have also greatly diminished native vertebrate populations on islands, through both predation and disease.  Introduced [[ungulate]]s are another major threat, as they graze on native vegetation and can destroy entire forests.&lt;ref&gt;Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. ''Trends in Evolution and Ecology'' 8(12): 452-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exotic grasses can out-compete native [[understory]] species and increase the risk of fire.&lt;ref&gt;D’Antonio, C.M. and P.M. Vitousek. 1992. Biological Invasions by Exotic Grasses, the Grass/Fire Cycle, and Global Change. Annual Review of Ecological Systematics 23: 63-87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, [[social insects]] such as ants also cause major problems.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, F. R., A.C. Medeiros, L.L. Loope, and W.W. Zuehlke. 1992. Effects of the Argentine ant on arthropod fauna of Hawaiian high-elevation shrubland. ''Ecology'' 73: 1313-1322.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===

Global warming is emerging as a strong cause of species loss on islands.  This can be due to [[Current sea level rise|sea level rise]], intrusion of salt water into freshwater habitats, or species inability to adapt to increasing temperatures and extreme weather events.  Plant species are particularly susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, H., W. Jetz, J. Mutke, G. Kier, and W. Barthlott. 2008. Global diversity of island floras from a macroecological perspective. ''Ecology Letters'' 11(2): 116-127.&lt;/ref&gt;  In more isolated areas, such as the Southern Ocean Islands, indirect effects such as invasive species and global warming can play a greater role in influencing populations than overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Chown, S.L., J.E. Lee, and J.D. Shaw. 2008. Conservation of Southern Ocean Islands: Invertebrates as exemplars. ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' 12(4): 277-291.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:NukutoaHighTide.JPG|thumb|[[Current sea level rise|Sea level rise]] is a pressing concern for many island people.]]

===Trophic cascades===

Human activities and the introduction of non-native species often cause [[trophic cascade]]s, where direct effects on one species result in indirect effects on other species in the food web.  An example is on [[Santa Cruz Island]] of the [[California Channel Islands]], where [[DDT]] poisoning reduced [[bald eagle]] populations. This, along with an abundance of introduced feral pigs for prey, allowed [[golden eagle]]s to colonize the island and replace bald eagles.  However, the golden eagles also ate native [[island fox]]es.  Fox population levels decreased to near extinction, while [[skunk]] populations increased due to relaxed competition with foxes.

== Island conservation ==

=== Conservation on islands ===

Since island ecosystems are self-contained, it should be possible to mitigate many of the threats to species.  Ecologists and managers are working together to prioritize areas for conservation and to quickly design and implement action plans.  Not everything can be put into a reserve, so it is important to first compile pertinent information and prioritize areas of concern.&lt;ref name="Kepler"&gt;Kepler, C.B. and J.M. Scott. 1985. Conservation of Island Ecosystems. ICBP Technical Publication Number 3: 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once an area has been chosen, managers must then acquire ownership and gain support.  Local experts and indigenous populations should also be involved in this process.&lt;ref name="Kepler" /&gt;  Having clearly defined goals will facilitate the many necessary interactions between people and agencies.&lt;ref name="Kepler" /&gt;  Once a reserve is in place, managers can then practice [[adaptive management]] and do continued community education.  

On land, island conservation focuses on the protection of species and their habitat.  In some cases, conservation can be integrated with agricultural production.  For example, the ''[[Acacia koa]]'' plantations and wooded pastures in [[Hawaii]] are anthropogenically altered ecosystems, yet allow connectivity between forest fragments and thus maintain higher diversity than would open pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, R.L., L.P. Goldstein, and G.C. Daily. 2008. Assessing the conservation value of a human-dominated island landscape: Plant diversity in Hawaii. Biodiversity and Conservation 17(7): 1765-1781.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other directions include habitat restoration, and eradication of introduced predators, ungulates, and exotic plants (via hunting, removal or [[biological control]]).

In marine ecosystems, there has been increasing establishment of “no-take” reserves.  This allows for reestablishment of native species, and also augmentation of commercially harvested species.&lt;ref&gt;Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. Trends in Evolution and Ecology 8(12): 452-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in both terrestrial and marine systems, these actions are expensive and do not always result in the desired outcomes.  For example, some non-natives become [[keystone species]] and their removal can cause more harm than good to the ecosystem.  To be more effective, managers of island ecosystems should share information and learn from each other’s mistakes.&lt;ref name="Cronk"&gt;Cronk, Q.C.B. 1997. Islands: stability, diversity, conservation. Biodiversity and Conservation 6: 477-493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Europäischer hummer.jpg|thumb|Lobster benefit greatly from the establishment of no-take zones on islands such as Great Britain, New Zealand, and Tonga.]]

=== Island restoration ===
{{main|Island restoration}}

Island conservation tends to focus on preservation of individual species and their habitats.  However, many ecologists caution that ecological and evolutionary processes should be conserved as well.&lt;ref name="Cronk" /&gt;  The conservation of island communities as a whole is closely linked to [[Restoration ecology|restoration]].  

Active restoration on islands can be done for both animal species (translocations, induced breeding) and plant species (reforestation).  Creating goals for restoration can be challenging because it is often impossible to restore the ecosystem to its “historic” or “normal” state, if that state can even be clearly defined.  Restoration is never complete, as ecological communities are always in a state of change.

=== Sustainable use ===

As resource depletion is a major issue on islands, the needs of human populations must also be taken into account.  On many islands, scientists and managers are studying traditional practices of indigenous populations as potential conservation solutions.  In some cases, limited-take systems that serve the community may provide a better alternative to fully closed protected areas, if there are not enough resources for proper enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Cinner, J.E., M.J. Marnane, and T.R. McClanahan. 2005. Conservation and community benefits from traditional coral reef management at Ahus Island, Papua New Guinea. Conservation Biology 19(6): 1714-1723.&lt;/ref&gt;  Public education plays an important role.

'''''Karius and Bactus''''' ({{ISBN|0961539410}}) ({{lang-no|Karius og Baktus}} is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[children's novel]] written and illustrated by [[Thorbjørn Egner]]. The book was first published in 1949 and produced as a 15-minute [[animatronics|puppet animation film]] by [[Ivo Caprino]] in 1954. An English translation by Mike Sevig and Turi Olderheim was published in the United States in 1986.

The main characters are Karius (black haired) and Bactus (red haired). Their names are puns on [[Caries]] and [[Bacteria]], and they are two small "[[tooth troll]]s" that live inside cavities in the teeth of a boy named [[Jens (given name)|Jens]]. They have a very good life, especially when Jens eats [[white bread]] with [[syrup]] and fails to [[Toothbrush|brush his teeth]] afterwards. Eventually their homes are destroyed by the work of a [[dentist]] and they are rinsed out of Jens' mouth through proper [[Dentistry|dental care]].

The story of Karius and Bactus, with its humorous illustrations and important message, has become a classic of Norwegian children's literature. Since its publication, the idea of "tooth trolls" has been used as a pedagogical device for generations of Scandinavian children.

{{Linguistics}}

'''Language education''' refers to the process and practice of acquiring a second or foreign language. It is primarily a branch of [[applied linguistics]], however can be considered an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, B., &amp; Hult, F.M. (Eds.). (2008). ''Handbook of educational linguistics.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., (Ed.). (2010). ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics.''  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main learning categories for language education: communicative competencies, proficiencies, [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural experiences]], and multiple literacies.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J. K. (2007). Foreign Language Education: Whose Definition?. ''The Modern Language Journal'', ''91''(2), 266–268. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 00267902&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need ==
Increasing [[globalization]] has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages. Common languages are used in areas such as trade, tourism, international relations, technology, media, and science. Many countries such as [[Korea]] (Kim Yeong-seo, 2009), [[Japan]] (Kubota, 1998) and [[China]] (Kirkpatrick &amp; Zhichang, 2002) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels. However, some countries such as [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[Philippines]] use a second official language in their governments. According to [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] (2010), China has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning, especially [[the English language]].

==History==

===Ancient to medieval period===
The need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself. In the Ancient Near East, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the language of diplomacy, as in the [[Amarna letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scoville |first1=Priscila |title=Amarna Letters |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries, [[Latin]] was the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of Europe, but it was displaced for many purposes by French, Italian, and English by the end of the 16th century. [[John Amos Comenius]] was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He wrote a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his ''Opera Didactica Omnia'', 1657.

In this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of [[language acquisition]]. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, or else pictures of them. He published the world's first illustrated children's book, ''[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]''. The study of Latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum. This decline demanded a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.

"Grammar schools" from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |ISBN=0-521-00843-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the [[grammar translation|grammar-translation method]].&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===
{{globalize/US|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Sweet Henry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Henry Sweet]] was a key figure in establishing the [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching]]
Innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manes ca, [[Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff]] (1803–1865), [[Henry Sweet]] (1845–1912), [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860–1943), and [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]] (1877–1949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who have a foreign language as a major attain "minimum professional proficiency". Even the "reading knowledge" required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English. Even a number of famous linguists are monolingual.&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0-912066-22-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs. This tends to make the research of [[second language acquisition]] emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the [[grammar translation method]] and the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] are dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.

Most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past, often ending with the author's new method. These new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author's mind, as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method. For example, descriptive linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the [[audio-lingual method]] developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary. It is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely, though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g. the [[Maximilian Berlitz|Berlitz]] version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;5)

There have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and theoretical, and these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another. Examples of researchers on the empiricist side are Jesperson, Palmer, and [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who promote mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species.

On the theoretical side are, for example, Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and [[Emile B. De Sauzé]], whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. These have led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin's "series method" to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauzé. With these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. This follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species. Given that human languages share many common traits, the idea is that humans share a [[universal grammar]] which is built into our brain structure. This allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Over time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/21stCenturySkillsMap/p21_worldlanguagesmap.pdf|title=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages|website=www.actfl.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to [[Languages Other Than English|LOTE]] or Language Other Than English. In the majority of English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English As A Second Language is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.

==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==
{{main article|Methods of teaching foreign languages}}

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]
Language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized '''[[language school]]'''. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

While sometimes confused, the terms "approach", "method" and "technique" are hierarchical concepts.

An '''approach''' is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning, but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting. Such can be related to [[second language acquisition theory]].

There are three principal "approaches":
# The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

A '''method''' is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned, and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.
# Examples of structural methods are [[grammar translation]] and the [[audio-lingual method]].
# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.
# Examples of interactive methods include the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the series method, [[communicative language teaching]], [[language immersion]], the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], the [[Natural Approach]], [[Tandem language learning|Tandem Language Learning]], [[Total Physical Response]], [[Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling]] and [[Dogme language teaching]].

A '''technique''' (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

==Online and self-study courses==
Hundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Self-Study Courses: Comparison, Problems, Ratings|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.

===Audio recordings and books===
Audio '''recordings''' use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Accents|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadowing Step by Step|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24|work=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs and websites.

Most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner's own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Hear-Say'', by Donald Rivera, Penton Overseas Inc., {{ISBN|1-56015-677-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-350-0}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-353-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-349-7}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aaa.Lang1234.com | title=Lessons for Beginners in English, mp3 | date=15 August 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

Language '''books''' have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hhh.Lang1234.com | title=Workers and Guests Have Different Language Needs in a Hotel | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.

Also, various other "language learning tools" have been entering the market in recent years.

===Internet and software===
'''Software''' can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:

# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.
# Software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language Guide|url=http://Languageguide.org|publisher=Language Guide|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

'''Websites''' provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:

# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.
# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.
# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.
# [[Language exchange]] sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat ''knowledge of a language'' as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, 'Language Perfect' - an online vocabulary learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students' progress as students gain a "point" for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Language Perfect contest held in May.

Many other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained and marketed for other purposes:

# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study conducted by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/ | title=Google Translate | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator | title=Bing Translator | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Speech synthesis]] or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.
# Course development and [[learning management system]]s such as [[Moodle]] are used by teachers, including language teachers.
# [[Web conferencing]] tools can bring remote learners together; e.g. [[Elluminate Live]].
# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual worlds]]. In 2005, the virtual world [[Second Life]] started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Study and teach in Second Life |url=http://www.its-teachers.com/destinations/second_life/second_life03.asp |work=iT's Magazines |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Apprendre une langue dans un monde virtuel |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-935560,0.html |work=Le Monde |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Spain’s language and cultural institute [[Instituto Cervantes]] has an "island" on Second Life.
Some Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as [[Bbc Online#Knowledge and Learning|BBC Online]], Book2, [[Foreign Service Institute]], with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.

==Learning strategies==
[[Language learning strategies]] have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.

===Listening as a way of learning===
Clearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners employ it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/improving-listening-skills/ focused listening]&lt;/ref&gt; is not something that most learners employ as a strategy.

===Reading as a way to learn===
Many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/learning-grammar/ strategy of reading]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning vocabulary===

Translation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been employed traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. [http://www.duolingo.com DuoLingo], [http://www.LingoMonkey.com LingoMonkey] and [http://www.vocabularystickers.com Vocabulary Stickers]). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/how-to-remember-vocabulary/ How to remember vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code switching===
{{Main article|Code-switching}}
Code switching, that is, changing between languages at some point in a sentence or [[utterance]], is a commonly used communication strategy among language learners and bilinguals. While traditional methods of formal instruction often discourage code switching, students, especially those placed in a language immersion situation, often use it. If viewed as a [[study skills|learning strategy]], wherein the student uses the target language as much as possible but reverts to their native language for any element of an utterance that they are unable to produce in the target language (as, e.g., in [[Wolfgang Butzkamm]]'s concept of enlightened monolingualism), then it has the advantages that it encourages fluency development and motivation and a sense of accomplishment by enabling the student to discuss topics of interest to him or her early in the learning process—before requisite vocabulary has been memorized. It is particularly effective for students whose native language is English, due to the high probability of a simple English word or short phrase being understood by the conversational partner.&lt;ref&gt;Butzkamm, Wolfgang (1998). "Code-Switching in a Bilingual History Lesson: The Mother Tongue as a Conversational Lubricant". ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism'' 1:2, pp. 81–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching strategies==

===Blended learning===
{{Main article|Blended learning}}
Blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with [[distance education]], frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. {{when|date=May 2016}}

Some people, though, use the phrase 'Blended Learning' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).

===Skill teaching===
When talking about language skills, the four basic ones are: listening, speaking, reading and writing. However, other, more socially based skills have been identified more recently such as summarizing, describing, narrating etc. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite book |title=English language teaching |last=Holden |first=Susan |author2=Mickey Rodgers  |year=1998 |publisher=DELTI |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-6820-12-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. However, since then, it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises.&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt; Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.

More recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt;

===Sandwich technique===
{{main article|Sandwich technique}}
In [[second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]], the '''sandwich technique''' is the oral insertion of an [[idiom|idiomatic translation]] in the [[mother tongue]] between an unknown phrase in the [[second language|learned language]] and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.

When modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 =&gt; L1 =&gt; L2. For example, a [[German language|German]] teacher of [[English language|English]] might engage in the following exchange with the students:

: Teacher: "Let me try - lass mich versuchen - let me try."
: Students: "Let me try."

===Mother tongue mirroring===
{{main article|Mother tongue mirroring}}
Mother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honoured technique of [[literal translation]] or word-for word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and, in many cases, spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from [[literal translation]] and [[interlinear text]] as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. This technique is seldom referred to or used these days.

===Back-chaining===
{{main article|Back-chaining}}
Back-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with [[polysyllabic]] or difficult words.&lt;ref name="ue"&gt;"Backchaining." ''Glossary.'' Retrieved April 4, 2009, from http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/backchaining.html&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher pronounces the last syllable, the student repeats, and then the teacher continues, working backwards from the end of the word to the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;"Backchaining." ''Teaching English.'' Retrieved April 4, 2009, from http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/backchaining&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, to teach the name ‘[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]' a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: ''-sky,'' and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with ''-sorg-'' attached before: ''-sorg-sky,'' and all that remains is the first syllable: ''Mus-sorg-sky.''

==By region==
{{main article|Language education by region}}

Practices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorisation and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]], in [[Asia]] or in [[Australia]].

The languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and Mandarin Chinese.

==Language study holidays==
{{See also|Language school}}
An increasing number of people are now combining [[tourism|holiday]]s with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a [[homestay]], perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta &amp; UK being the most popular because almost everyone speaks English as a first language) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and [[ACUPARI|Peru]]. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/travel-agents-missing-profitable-language-travel-holidays-sprachcaffe/ |title=Travel agents missing out on profitable language travel holidays – Sprachcaffe |publisher=TravelWeek|date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;


With the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one's disposal. This is also evident in businesses outsourcing their departments to Eastern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Minority language education==

===Minority language education policy===
The principal policy arguments in favor of promoting minority language education are the need for multilingual workforces, intellectual and cultural benefits and greater inclusion in global information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=76 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to education in a minority language is also seen as a human right as granted by the [[European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[UN Human Rights Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |title=The right to education and minority language |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=de Varennes |first=Fernand |year=2004 |publisher=EUMAP: EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program Online Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404121819/http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.

===Materials and e-learning for minority language education===
Suitable resources for teaching and learning minority languages can be difficult to find and access, which has led to calls for the increased development of materials for minority language teaching. The internet offers opportunities to access a wider range of texts, audios and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=61–62 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language [[learning 2.0]] (the use of web 2.0 tools for language education)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.plymouth.ac.uk/e-learning/conference_proceedings_2009.pdf |title=Language learning 2.0 in action: web .0 tools to enhance language learning |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Diouri |first=Mourad |year=2009 |publisher=4th Plymouth e-Learning Conference 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122165045/http://www2.plymouth.ac.uk/e-learning/conference_proceedings_2009.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers opportunities for material development for lesser-taught languages and to bring together geographically dispersed teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/5011 |title=New Roles for Technology in Language Maintenance and Revitalization |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Ikeda |first=A.

'''Mind-blindness''' is a concept of a [[Neurodiversity|cognitive divergence]] where an individual is unable to attribute mental states to others. As a result of this kind of social&lt;ref name=cory&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frith | first=Uta | author-link=Uta Frith | title=Mind Blindness and the Brain in Autism | journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] | publisher=Cell Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=20 December 2001 | volume=32 | issue=6 | pages=969–979 | doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00552-9 | pmid=11754830}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[empathy#Cognitive empathy|empathetic cognitive]] phenomenon, the individual is incapable in putting themselves "into someone else's shoes" and cannot conceptualize, understand or predict knowledge, thoughts and beliefs, emotions, feelings and desires, behaviour, actions and intentions of another person.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt; Such an ability to develop a mental awareness of what is in the other minds is known as the [[theory of mind]] (ToM),&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Pijnenborg ''[[et al]]''.| author4=Aleman, A. | date=June 2013 | title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy | journal=[[European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience]] | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] | volume=263 | issue=4 | pages=299–307 | doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0 | pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "mind-blindness" theory asserts that children who delay in this development often are or will be [[autism|autistic]].&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | authorlink=Simon Baron-Cohen | date=25 March 2009 | title=Autism: The Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) Theory | journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] | location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | volume=1156, The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience | pages=68–80 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | pmid=19338503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jurecic | first1=Ann | date=Spring 2006 | title=Mindblindness: Autism, Writing, and the Problem of Empathy | journal = [[Literature and Medicine]] | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=1–23 | doi=10.1353/lm.2006.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to autism, ToM and mind-blindness research has recently been extended to other fields such as [[schizophrenia]], [[dementia]], [[bipolar disorder]]s, [[antisocial personality disorder]]s as well as normal aging.&lt;ref name=brune&gt;{{cite journal | last=Brune | first=M. | title="Theory of Mind" in Schizophrenia: A Review of the Literature | journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1 January 2005 | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=21–42 | doi=10.1093/schbul/sbi002 | pmid=15888423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mind-blindness is a state where the ToM has not been developed, or has been lost in an individual. According to the theory, ToM is implicit in neurotypical individuals. This enables one to make automatic interpretations of events taking into consideration the mental states of people, their desires and beliefs. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] described how an individual lacking a ToM would perceive the world in a confusing and frightening manner, leading to a withdrawal from society.&lt;ref name=cohen1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Autism: a specific cognitive disorder of 'mind-blindness |journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=1990 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=81–90 |doi=10.3109/09540269009028274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to the social impairment observed in mind-blindness focuses on emotion of subjects. Based on empirical evidence, [[Uta Frith]] concluded that the processing of complex cognitive emotions is impaired compared to simpler emotions. In addition, attachment does not seem to fail in the early childhood of autistics. This suggests that emotion is a component of social cognition that is separable from [[mentalization|mentalizing]].&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

Lombardo and Cohen updated the theory and pinpointed some additional factors that play an important part in ToM of autistic people. They highlighted that the middle [[cingulate cortex]] which is outside the traditional mentalizing region was underactive in autistic patients, while the rest of ToM activation was normal. This region was important in deciding how much to invest in a person and hence required mentalization.&lt;ref name=lamcohen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lombardo |first=Michael V. |author2=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=The role of the self in mindblindness in autism |journal=[[Consciousness and Cognition]] |publisher=[[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]] |date=1 March 2011 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=130–140 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.006 |pmid=20932779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological basis ===
Neural correlates of the ToM point towards three regions of the brains. The anterior paracingulate cortex (Brodmann), is considered at the key region of mentalizing. It is located anterior corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate cortex. This cortex is associated with the medial frontal cortex where activation is associated with the mentalization of states. The cells of the ACC develops at the age of 4 months suggesting that the manifestations of mind-blindness may occur around this time.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gallagher | first=Helen L. | author2=Frith, Christopher D. | title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' | journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | publisher=[[Cell Press]] | location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] | date=1 February 2003 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=77–83 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 | pmid=12584026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anterior paracingulate cortex is the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles that are involved with the ToM and its nature. However, these areas are not uniquely associated with mentalization. They aid in the activation of the regions that are associated with the ToM. The superior temporal sulcus is involved in the processing of behavioural information while the temporal poles are involved in the retrieval of personal experiences. These are considered important regions for the activation of the ToM regions and are associated with the mind-blindness. The temporal poles provide personal experiences for mentalization such as facial recognition, emotional memory and familiar voices. In patients suffering from semantic dementia, the temporal regions of these patients undergo atrophy and lead to certain deficits which can cause mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt;

[[File:250px-Gray726-STS.png|thumb|right|Superior temporal sulcus]]
The amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex also are a part of the ToM.  It is in involved in the interpretation of behaviour which plays an important role in social cognition and therefore contributes to the theory of the mind. It is suspected that the damage to the orbitofrontal cortex brings upon subtle impairments, but not a total loss of the ToM that would to mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt; Some studies{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with the theory of the mind or mind-blindness. However, a study by Stone and colleagues were able to show impaired ToM on mentalisation tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stone | first=V.E. | last2=Baron-Cohen | first2=S. | last3=Knight | first3=R.T. | title=Frontal lobe contributions to the theory of mind | journal=[[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]] | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=September 1998 | volume=10 | pages=640–656 | doi=10.1162/089892998562942 | pmid=9802997 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the frontal lobe is associated with executive function, researchers theorize that the frontal lobe plays an important role in ToM and its associated nature. It has also been suggested that the executive function and the theory of mind share the same regions.&lt;ref name=jose&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Josef Perner  | author2=Birgit Lang | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Development of theory of mind and executive control | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | publisher=Cell Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=1 September 1999 | volume=3 | issue=9 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01362-5 | pages=337–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that ToM and mind-blindness can explain executive function deficits, it is argued that autism is not identified with the failure of the executive function.&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;{{cite book | last=Carruthers | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) | editor1=Carruthers, Peter | editor2=[[Peter K.

Lesion studies show that when lesions are imposed to the medial frontal lobe, performance on mentalization tasks is reduced, similar to typical mind-blindness cases.&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Havet-Thomassin, P. Allain, F. Etcharry-Bouyx, &amp; D. le Gall | title=What about theory of mind after severe brain injury? | journal=[[Brain Injury (journal)|Brain Injury]] | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=2006 | volume=20 | issue=1 | pages=83–91 | doi=10.1080/02699050500340655 | pmid=16403703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients that experienced frontal lobe injuries due to severe head trauma showed signs of mind blindness, as a result of a lost ToM. However, it is still debated whether the inactivation of the medial frontal lobe is involved in mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird|first=C. M.|title=The impact of extensive medial frontal lobe damage on 'Theory of Mind' and cognition|journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=14 January 2004|volume=127|issue=4|pages=914–928|doi=10.1093/brain/awh108|pmid=14998913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frith and Frith proposed that a neural network that comprised the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the STS, is crucial for the normal functioning of ToM and self monitoring. This so formed dorsal system is crucial for social cognition. Disruption of this neural network leads to mind-blindness in schizophrenic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frith | first=Uta | author2=Frith, C.D | title=The biological basis of social interaction | journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] | date=October 2001 | volume=10 | pages=151–155 | issue=5 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another clue towards a possible explanation of mind-blindness in autistics was done by Castelli and colleagues. They were able to show that the connectivity between occipital and the temporo-parietal regions were weaker in the autistic group than the control group. The under activation of this network may inhibit the interactive influences between regions that process higher and lower perceptual items.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

=== Relationship to diagnostic criteria ===

=== Relationship to autism ===
Mind-blindness is usually associated with [[Autism|autistic]] people. Lower performance on the mentalization tasks were the first screening task used to diagnose the autism, with a good prediction level.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

Cohen proposed the mind-blindness theory of autism as "deficits in the normal process of empathising". He described empathising to include the ToM, mind reading and taking an intentional stance. According to this view empathising includes the ability to attribute mental states and to react in an appropriate emotional manner which is appropriate to another's mental state.  More deficits tend to occur in reference to one's own mental states compared to the other's mental states. It has been proposed that autistic people undergo a specific developmental delay in the area of metarepresentational development. The delay facilitates mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=cohen2&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen |first=S. | title=The cognitive neuroscience of autism | journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]] | publisher=[[BMJ (company)|BMJ]] | location=London | date=1 July 2004 | volume=75 | issue=7 | pages=945–948 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.018713| pmc=1739089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that suggests that certain patients develop a rudimentary ToM and do not suffer from complete lack of ToM causing mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt; A study by Bowler concluded that mind-blindness and social impairment is not as straightforward as previously thought. It showed that a complete possession of ToM was not enough to protect from social impairments in autistic people. Conversely the absence or impairment of the ToM that leads to mind-blindness does not lead to social impairments.&lt;ref name=bowler&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bowler | first=Dermont. M. | title=Theory of Mind in Asperger's syndrome | journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=877–893 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and cognitive differences seen in autistic people are often attributed due to mind blindness. Abnormal behaviour of autistic children are perceived to include a lack of reciprocity. Some cases in which mind-blindness manifests includes the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as not being able to make eye contact while in other cases the individual may attempt to interact with other people. However, global asocial behaviours is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in autistic people as a "triad of deficits". The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' mind.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt;

Ozonoff and colleagues were able to discriminate between autistic people diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]] and other autistic people by their ability to solve ToM tasks. It is due to those diagnosed with AS seem more neurotypical in development early on in childhood. The siblings of individuals diagnosed with AS were shown to have a lesser variant of ToM deficits. This shows that the cognitive deficits that affect the ToM play central role in the phenotype expressed in AS diagnosed.&lt;ref name=ozonoff&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ozonoff | first=S | author2=Rogers, S. &amp; Pennington, B. | title=Asperger's syndrome: Evidence for an empirical distinction from high-functioning autism | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=November 1991 |volume=32 | issue=7 | pages=1107–1122 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1991.tb00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to schizophrenia ===
People with [[schizophrenia]] also show deficits associated with mind-blindness.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether individuals with schizophrenia have an impaired ToM leading to mind-blindness or display an exaggerated ToM. Unlike autism, schizophrenia is a late onset condition. It is speculated that this difference in the condition may account for differences seen in the ToM abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Other Minds. How Humans Bridge the Divide Between Self And Others | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJqB_NboEYYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UxE1nwEACAAJ 2005] | year=2007 | publisher=[[Guilford Press]]| location=New York City | author=Langdon, Robyn |editors=Malle, Bertram F.; Hodges, Sara D. |chapter=Chapter 21.

It is unknown whether the ToM in schizophrenia deteriorates in the affected person as the condition progresses.&lt;ref name= brune /&gt;

The cognitive impairment linked to mind-blindness is best explained by a modular theory; the domain specific capabilities that account for mindreading and mentalization are lost in schizophrenia. Furthermore, Frith has predicted that the extent of mind-blindness depends on whether the objective/behavioural or subjective symptoms of ToM abilities prevail.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt; Patients with the behavioural symptoms perform the poorest in ToM tasks, similar to autistic subjects, while patients displaying subjective/experiential symptoms have a ToM. However, these patients are impaired in using contextual information to infer what these mental states are.&lt;ref name= brune /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The mind-blindness theory helps to explain the impairment in the social development of individuals as well as the impairment in the communication skills of autistics. However one of the most important limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait attributed to autistic people. This triad is explained through the process of systemising.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt; The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt; These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autistic people, fails to explain such patients' penchants for narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis.  Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to autistic people, since conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] to various [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s and/or [[anti-social personality disorder]]s all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt;

Another issue associated with the mind-blindness theory is that researchers are unable to predict whether the social deficits are a primary or secondary result of mind-blindness. In addition, Klin and his fellow researchers highlighted another limitation that was that the mind-blindness theory failed to delineate whether the ToM deficits are a generalised deficit or a specific discrete of a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klin, Ami., Folkmar, Fred R., Sparrow, Sara S.| title=Autistic Social Dysfunction: Some limitations of the Theory of Mind hypothesis | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=861–876 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01961.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Shanker also argued in favour of Klin's argument, that a major part of the mind-blindness theory depicts the ToM as an autonomous cognitive capacity compared to being part of a more general ability for reflective thinking and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shanker | first=S. | title=The Roots of Mindblindness |journal=[[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | date=1 October 2004 | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=685–703 | doi=10.1177/0959354304046179}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|A boy with autism, obsessively stacking cans.]]

Other researchers have pointed out the inherent flaws of assuming autistic traits develops from a "theory of mind" deficit, pointing out that this presupposes autistic traits derives from a single, core insufficiency within the brain.  This contrasts, they say, with the very same researchers' description of autism as a "puzzle", which implies a far more diverse range of causes than a single, unifying theory.&lt;ref name="smukler"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Smukler, David | title=Unauthorized Minds: How 'Theory of Mind' Theory Misrepresents Autism | journal=Mental Retardation | date=February 2005 | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=11-24 | doi=10.1352/0047-6765(2005)43&lt;11:UMHTOM&gt;2.0.CO;2 | pmid=15628930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have also pointed out that Mind-blindness wrongly categorizes autism as a problem to be fixed, rather than a condition to be accommodated. This assumes an inherent lack of [[intelligence]] in autistic people, which ignores the nuanced view of intelligence (as in varying types of intelligence) that has been observed in cognitive research.&lt;ref name="smukler" /&gt;

The drawbacks in the Mind-blindness theory of autistic people paved way for the [[Empathizing–systemizing theory|E-S theory]] which helps to explain the observations seen in these individuals. The E-S theory accounts for both the triad of deficits which is the loss of empathising and the triad of strengths is related to hyper systemisation of certain behaviours. The theory also helps to explain the exaggerated male spectrum termed as the extreme male behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen | first=S. | author2=Knickmeyer, Rebecca S. | author3= Belmonte, Mathew S. | title=Sex Differences in the Brain: Implications for Explaining Autism | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] | date=4 November 2005 | volume=310 | issue=5749 | pages=819–823 | doi=10.1126/science.1115455 | pmid=16272115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally in [[Western classical music|Western music]], a '''musical tone''' is a steady [[periodic function|periodic]] sound. A musical tone is characterized by its [[duration (music)|duration]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[amplitude|intensity]] (or [[loudness]]), and [[timbre]] (or quality).&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Musical note|note]]s used in [[music]] can be more complex than musical tones, as they may include aperiodic aspects, such as attack [[transient (acoustics)|transients]], [[vibrato]], and [[Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release|envelope modulation]].

A simple tone, or [[Pure tone|pure tone]], has a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[waveform]].  A '''complex tone''' is a combination of two or more pure tones that have a periodic pattern of repetition, unless specified otherwise.

The [[Fourier theorem]] states that any periodic waveform can be approximated as closely as desired as the sum of a series of sine waves with frequencies in a [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] and at specific [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationships to each other. The common denominator frequency, which is also often the lowest of these frequencies is the [[fundamental frequency]], and is also the inverse of the period of the waveform. The fundamental frequency determines the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the tone, which is perceived by the human hearing. In music, [[Musical note|note]]s are assigned to tones with different fundamental frequencies, in order to describe the pitch of played tones.

== Cancer-associated neochromosomes ==

Cancer-associated neochromosomes are giant supernumerary chromosomes. They harbor the mutations that drive certain cancers (highly amplified copies of key [[oncogene]]s, such as [[Mdm2|MDM2]], [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 4|CDK4]], [[HMGA2]]). They may be circular or linear chromosomes. They have functional [[centromere]]s, and [[telomere]]s when linear. They are rare overall, being found in about 3% of cancers, but are common in certain rare cancers. For example, they are found in 90% of parosteal [[osteosarcomas]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Neochromosomes from well- and de-differentiated [[liposarcoma]] have been studied at high resolution by isolation (using flow sorting) and sequencing, as well as microscopy. They consist of hundreds of fragments of DNA, often derived from multiple normal chromosomes, stitched together randomly, and contain high levels of DNA amplification (~30-60 copies of some genes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Using [[statistical inference]] and [[mathematical model]]ling, the process of how neochromosomes initially form and evolve has been made clearer. Fragments of DNA, produced following [[chromothripsis|chromothriptic]] shattering of [[Chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]] undergo [[DNA repair]] to form of a circular or [[ring chromosome]]. This undergoes hundreds of circular [[breakage-fusion-bridge cycle]]s, causing random amplification and deletion of DNA with selection for the amplification of key oncogenes. DNA from additional chromosomes is somehow added during this process. Erosion of [[centromere]]s can lead to the formation of [[neocentromere]]s or the capture of new native centromeres from other chromosomes. The process ends when the neochromosome forms a linear chromosome following the capture of telomeric caps, which can be chromothriptically derived.

The '''network probability matrix''' describes the probability structure of a network based on the historical presence or absence of edges in a network.  For example, individuals in a social network are not connected to other individuals with [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform random]] probability.  The probability structure is much more complex.  Intuitively, there are some people whom a person will communicate with or be connected more closely than others.  For this reason, real-world networks tend to have clusters or cliques of nodes that are more closely related than others (Albert and Barabasi, 2002, Carley [year], Newmann 2003).  This can be simulated by varying the probabilities that certain nodes will communicate. The network probability matrix was originally proposed by Ian McCulloh.

'''Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution''' is a term used to describe pollution resulting from many diffuse sources, in direct contrast to [[point source pollution]] which results from a single source. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult.&lt;ref name="epa-nps-overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/what-nonpoint-source |title=What is Nonpoint Source? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-02 |website=Polluted Runoff |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-point source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[agricultural]] areas draining into a river, or wind-borne [[debris]] blowing out to sea. Non-point source air pollution affects air quality from sources such as [[smokestack]]s or car [[tailpipe]]s. Although these pollutants have originated from a point source, the long-range transport ability and multiple sources of the pollutant make it a non-point source of pollution. Non-point source pollution can be contrasted with [[point source (pollution)|point source pollution]], where discharges occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location.

NPS may derive from many different sources with no specific solution may change to rectify the problem, making it difficult to regulate. Non point source water pollution is difficult to control because it comes from the everyday activities of many different people, such as lawn [[fertilizer|fertilization]], applying [[pesticide]]s, [[road construction]] or [[building construction]].&lt;ref name="tceq-nps"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/waterquality/nonpoint-source/mgmt-plan/index.html |title=Management Program for Nonpoint Source Water Pollution |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-22 |publisher=Texas Commission on Environmental Quality |location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States today, with polluted runoff from agriculture and [[hydromodification]] the primary sources.&lt;ref name="EPA-2004-wq-report"&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress; 2004 Reporting Cycle |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-08-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} &lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2003 |title=National Management Measures to Control Non-point Source Pollution from Agriculture |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-agriculture |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-03-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant sources of runoff include [[habitat destruction|habitat modification]] and [[silviculture]] (forestry).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2005 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-forestry |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-05-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminated stormwater washed off parking lots, roads and highways, and lawns (often containing [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s) is called [[urban runoff]]. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution. Some people may also consider it a point source because many times it is channeled into municipal storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to nearby [[surface water]]s. However, not all urban runoff flows through [[storm drain]] systems before entering water bodies. Some may flow directly into water bodies, especially in developing and suburban areas. Also, unlike other types of point sources, such as industrial discharges, [[sewage treatment]] plants and other operations, pollution in urban runoff cannot be attributed to one activity or even group of activities. Therefore, because it is not caused by an easily identified and regulated activity, urban runoff pollution sources are also often treated as true non-point sources as municipalities work to abate them.

==Principal types==
[[Image:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] of [[soil]] and [[fertilizer]] during a rain storm]]

===Sediment===
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) includes [[silt]] (fine particles) and [[suspended solids]] (larger particles). Sediment may enter surface waters from eroding stream banks, and from [[surface runoff]] due to improper plant cover on urban and rural land.&lt;ref name="IAfact"&gt;Iowa State University. University Extension. Ames, IA. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/EDC232A.pdf "Iowa Fact Sheet: Agriculture and Water Quality."] October 2001. Document No. EDC232a.&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment creates [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) in water bodies, reducing the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |last1=Stevenson |first1=J. Court |last2=Piper |first2=Catherine B. |last3=Confer |first3=Nedra |date=1979 |title=Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay |url=https://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Annapolis, MD |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; High turbidity levels also inhibit drinking [[water purification]] systems.

Sediment can also be discharged from multiple different sources.  Sources include [[construction]] sites (although these are point sources, which can be managed with [[erosion control]]s and [[sediment control]]s), agricultural fields, stream banks, and highly disturbed areas.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"&gt;Penn State University. Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO. [http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727035540/http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===
[[File:Nonpoint Source Pollution.svg|thumb|Nonpoint source pollution is caused when precipitation (1) carries pollutants from the ground such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants which come from fertilizers used on farm lands (2) or urban areas (3). These nutrients can cause [[eutrophication]] (4).]]
Nutrients mainly refers to inorganic matter from runoff, [[landfill]]s, [[livestock]] operations and crop lands. The two primary nutrients of concern are phosphorus and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;Rob Leeds, Larry C. Brown, Nathan L. Watermeier. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020223144636/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0465.html "Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering."] Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phosphorus]] is a nutrient that occurs in many forms that are [[bioavailable]]. It is notoriously over-abundant in human sewage [[sludge]]. It is a main ingredient in many fertilizers used for agriculture as well as on residential and commercial properties, and may become a [[limiting nutrient]] in freshwater systems and some [[estuaries]]. Phosphorus is most often transported to water bodies via [[soil erosion]] because many forms of phosphorus tend to be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on to soil particles. Excess amounts of phosphorus in aquatic systems (particularly freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) leads to proliferation of microscopic algae called [[phytoplankton]]. The increase of organic matter supply due to the excessive growth of the phytoplankton is called [[eutrophication]]. A common symptom of eutrophication is [[algae]] blooms that can produce unsightly surface scums, shade out beneficial types of plants, produce taste-and-odor-causing compounds, and poison the water due to toxins produced by the algae. These toxins are a particular problem in systems used for drinking water because some toxins can cause human illness and removal of the toxins is difficult and expensive. Bacterial decomposition of algal blooms consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, generating [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] with detrimental consequences for fish and aquatic invertebrates.

[[Nitrogen]] is the other key ingredient in fertilizers, and it generally becomes a pollutant in saltwater or brackish estuarine systems where nitrogen is a limiting nutrient. Similar to phosphorus in fresh-waters, excess amounts of bioavailable nitrogen in marine systems lead to eutrophication and algae blooms. Hypoxia is an increasingly common result of eutrophication in marine systems and can impact large areas of estuaries, bays, and near shore coastal waters. Each summer, hypoxic conditions form in [[bottom water]]s where the [[Mississippi River]] enters the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. During recent summers, the aereal extent of this "dead zone" is comparable to the area of [[New Jersey]] and has major detrimental consequences for fisheries in the region.

Nitrogen is most often transported by water as [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The nitrogen is usually added to a watershed as organic-N or [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), so nitrogen stays attached to the soil until [[oxidation]] converts it into nitrate. Since the nitrate is generally already incorporated into the soil, the water traveling through the soil (i.e., [[interflow]] and [[tile drainage]]) is the most likely to transport it, rather than surface runoff.

===Toxic contaminants and chemicals===
Compounds including heavy metals like [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[cadmium]], organics like [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), fire retardants, and other substances are resistant to breakdown.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These contaminants can come from a variety of sources including human sewage sludge, [[mining]] operations, vehicle emissions, [[fossil fuel]] combustion, urban runoff, industrial operations and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Toxic chemicals mainly include [[organic compounds]] and [[inorganic compounds]]. These compounds include pesticides like [[DDT]], acids, and salts that have severe effects to the ecosystem and water-bodies. These compounds can threaten the health of both humans and aquatic species while being resistant to environmental breakdown, thus allowing them to persist in the environment.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These toxic chemicals could come from croplands, nurseries, orchards, building sites, gardens, lawns and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Acids and salts mainly are inorganic pollutants from irrigated lands, mining operations, urban runoff, industrial sites and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

===Pathogens===
[[Pathogens]] are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; Typically, pathogens cause disease when they are present in public drinking water supplies. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include:
* ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]''
* ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''
* ''[[Salmonella]]''
* ''[[Novovirus|Norovirus]]'' and other [[virus]]es
* [[Parasitic worm]]s (helminths).
[[Coliform bacteria]] and [[fecal matter]] may also be detected in runoff.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;  These [[bacteria]] are a commonly used [[indicator bacteria|indicator]] of water pollution, but not an actual cause of disease.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. Reston, VA. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-027-01/ "A Primer on Water Quality."] FS-027-01. March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens may contaminate runoff due to poorly managed livestock operations, faulty [[septic system]]s, improper handling of pet waste, the over application of human sewage [[sludge]], contaminated storm sewers, and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s.&lt;ref name="IAfact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;

==Principal sources==

===Urban and suburban areas===
[[Urban Area|Urban]] and [[Suburban|suburban areas]] are a main sources of nonpoint source pollution due to the amount of runoff that is produced due to the large amount of paved surfaces. Paved surfaces, such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] are impervious to water penetrating them. Any water that is on contact with these surfaces will run off and be absorbed by the surrounding environment. These surfaces make it easier for stormwater to carry pollutants into the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Washington D.C. [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_pollution/lessons/pollution_tutorial.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution"] September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction sites tend to have disturbed soil that is easily eroded by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] like [[rain]], [[snow]], and [[hail]]. Additionally, discarded debris on the site can be carried away by runoff waters and enter the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Typically, in suburban areas, chemicals are used for lawn care. These chemicals can end up in runoff and enter the surrounding environment via storm drains in the city. Since the water in storm drains is not treated before flowing into surrounding water bodies, the chemicals enter the water directly.

===Agricultural operations===
Agricultural operations account for a large percentage of all nonpoint source pollution in the United States. When large tracts of land are [[plow]]ed to grow [[crops]], it exposes and loosens soil that was once buried. This makes the exposed soil more vulnerable to [[erosion]] during [[rainstorm]]s. It also can increase the amount of fertilizer and pesticides carried into nearby bodies of water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Atmospheric inputs===
{{Cite check|section|date=July 2016}}
Atmospheric inputs of pollution into the air can come from multiple sources. Typically, industrial facilities, like [[factory|factories]], emit air pollution via a [[smokestack]]. Although this is a point source, due to the distributional nature, long-range transport, and multiple sources of the pollution, it is considered a nonpoint source. Additionally, atmospheric pollution can become water pollution, by being washed out of the atmosphere in the form of rain or snow.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}

===Highway runoff===
Highway runoff accounts for a small but widespread percentage of all nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M.K., Agnew, R.W., Gruber, D., and Kreutzberger, W.A., 1981, Constituents of highway runoff, in v. IV, Characteristics of runoff from operating highways—Research report: [https://archive.org/details/constituentsofhi00gupt_1 "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA/RD–81/045"], 171 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, E.D., Shelley, P.E., and Strecker, E.W., 1990, Pollutant loadings and impacts from highway stormwater runoff, v.

===Forestry and mining operations===
[[Forestry]] and [[environmental impact of mining|mining]] operations can have significant inputs to non-point source pollution.

====Forestry====
Forestry operations reduce the number of trees in a given area, thus reducing the oxygen levels in that area as well. This action, coupled with the heavy machinery (harvesters, etc.) rolling over the soil increases the risk of [[erosion]].

====Mining====
Active [[mining]] operations are considered point sources, however runoff from abandoned mining operations contribute to nonpoint source pollution. In [[strip mining]] operations, the top of the mountain is removed to expose the desired [[ore]]. If this area is not properly reclaimed once the mining has finished, [[soil erosion]] can occur. Additionally, there can be chemical reactions with the air and newly exposed rock to create acidic runoff. Water that seeps out of abandoned [[underground mining|subsurface mines]] can also be highly acidic. This can seep into the nearest body of water and change the pH in the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas and boating activities===
Chemicals used for boat maintenance, like [[paint]], [[solvent]]s, and [[oil]]s find their way into water through runoff. Additionally, spilling fuels or leaking fuels directly into the water from boats contribute to nonpoint source pollution. Nutrient and bacteria levels are increased by poorly maintained sanitary waste receptacles on the boat and pump-out stations.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

==Control==
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment|Erosion control}}
[[Image:Contour buffer strips NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Contour [[buffer strip]]s used to retain soil and reduce [[erosion]]]]

===Urban and suburban areas===
To control non-point source pollution, many different approaches can be undertaken in both urban and suburban areas. [[Buffer strip]]s provide a barrier of grass in between impervious paving material like parking lots and roads, and the closest body of water.  This allows the soil to absorb any pollution before it enters the local aquatic system. [[Retention pond]]s can be built in drainage areas to create an aquatic buffer between runoff pollution and the aquatic environment. Runoff and storm water drain into the retention pond allowing for the contaminants to settle out and become trapped in the pond. The use of [[permeable paving|porous pavement]] allows for rain and storm water to drain into the ground beneath the pavement, reducing the amount of runoff that drains directly into the water body. Restoration methods such as [[Constructed wetland|constructing wetlands]] are also used to slow runoff as well as absorb contamination.

Construction sites typically implement simple measures to reduce pollution and runoff. Firstly, sediment or [[silt fence]]s are erected around construction sites to reduce the amount of sediment and large material draining into the nearby water body.  Secondly, laying grass or straw along the border of construction sites also work to reduce nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

In areas served by single-home septic systems, local government regulations can force septic system maintenance to ensure compliance with water quality standards. In [[Washington (state)]], a novel approach was developed through a creation of a "shellfish protection district" when either a commercial or recreational shellfish bed is downgraded because of ongoing nonpoint source pollution. The shellfish protection district is a geographic area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources, and provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control nonpoint sources of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psparchives.com/restore-habs/|title=Restore Habitat|author=|date=10 April 2018|website=Marine|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two shellfish protection districts in south [[Puget Sound]] have instituted septic system operation and maintenance requirements with program fees tied directly to property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.thurston.wa.us/health/ehrp/nisqually.html |title=PHSS HomeA-Z TopicsPrograms/Serv |publisher=Co.thurston.wa.us |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural operations===
To control sediment and runoff, farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops or installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-95–4-96}}&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Conservation tillage]]'' is a concept used to reduce runoff while planting a new crop. The farmer leaves some crop reside from the previous planting in the ground to help prevent runoff during the planting process.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer; animal [[manure]]; or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p. 2–9}} Farmers can develop and implement [[nutrient management]] plans to reduce excess application of nutrients.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-37–4-38}}&lt;ref&gt;NRCS.

August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/595.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 595.

===Forestry operations===
With a well-planned placement of both logging trails, also called skid trails, can reduce the amount of sediment generated. By planning the trails location as far away from the logging activity as possible as well as contouring the trails with the land, it can reduce the amount of loose sediment in the runoff. Additionally, by replanting trees on the land after logging, it provides a structure for the soil to regain stability as well as replaces the logged environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas===
Installing shut off valves on fuel pumps at a marina dock can help reduce the amount of spillover into the water. Additionally, pump-out stations that are easily accessible to boaters in a marina can provide a clean place in which to dispose of sanitary waste without dumping it directly into the water. Finally, something as simple as having trash containers around a marina can prevent larger objects entering the water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

'''Nutrition and pregnancy''' refers to the nutrient intake, and dietary planning that is undertaken before, during and after pregnancy. Nutrition of the fetus begins at conception. For this reason, the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception (probably several months before) as well as throughout pregnancy and breast feeding. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child, up to and including the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes throughout life.

An inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus, and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished.&lt;ref name="mary_e_barasi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barasi EM |year=2003 |title=Human Nutrition - A Health Perspective |location=London |publisher=Arnold |isbn=0-340-81025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 24% of babies worldwide are born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/nutrition/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; 10 facts on nutrition |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal habits such as consumption of alcohol or large amounts of caffeine can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby, which happens in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;{{cite book|title=Pregnancy: The Ultimate Week-by-Week Pregnancy Guide|publisher=Meredith Books|isbn=0-696-22221-3|pages=21–22| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7BKtTKqAQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pregnancy+books&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_B58Tv6iCYO3rAeuvbT0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pregnancy%20books&amp;f=false|author=Riley L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caffeine]] consumption during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss.&lt;ref name=Chen2016/&gt; The available research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; 

==Nutrition before pregnancy==

As with most diets, there are chances of over-supplementing, however, as general advice, both state and medical recommendations are that mothers follow instructions listed on particular vitamin packaging as to the correct or recommended daily allowance (RDA). Daily prenatal use of iron substantially improves birth weight, potentially reducing the risk of [[Low birth weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Haider, BA, Olofin, I, Wang, M|title= Anaemia, prenatal iron use, and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=21| year=2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.f3443|display-authors=etal| pages=f3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Folic acid]] supplementation is recommended prior to conception, to prevent development of [[spina bifida]] and other [[neural tube defect]]s. It should be taken as at least 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day throughout the first [[Trimesters|trimester]] of pregnancy, 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg/day through the pregnancy, and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day while breastfeeding in  addition to eating foods rich in folic acid such as green leafy vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation: Handbook of Prescription Drugs and Comparative Risk Assessment|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CE569saGK70C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=folic+acid+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0jFTVe7zGMW6ggSTqoDACA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=folic%20acid%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing|date = 2001|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780444507631|first = Christof|last = Schaefer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iodine]] levels are frequently too low in pregnant women, and iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function and mental development of the fetus, even [[cretinism]]. Pregnant women should take prenatal vitamins containing iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S5oCjZZZ1ggC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=iodine+levels+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vTBTVa39KImegwTB9oG4CQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iodine%20levels%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2006|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780781741330|first = Maurice Edward|last = Shils|first2 = Moshe|last2 = Shike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vitamin D]] levels vary with exposure to sunlight. While it was assumed that supplementation was necessary only in areas of high latitudes, recent studies of Vitamin D levels throughout the United States and many other countries have shown a large number of women with low levels. For this reason, there is a growing movement to recommend supplementation with 1000&amp;nbsp;IU of Vitamin D daily throughout pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Association between maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date = 2013|issn = 1756-1833|pmid = 23533188|pages = f1169|volume = 346|first = Fariba|last = Aghajafari|first2 = Tharsiya|last2 = Nagulesapillai|first3 = Paul E.|last3 = Ronksley|first4 = Suzanne C.|last4 = Tough|first5 = Maeve|last5 = O'Beirne|first6 = Doreen M.|last6 = Rabi|doi=10.1136/bmj.f1169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A large number of pregnant women have been found to have low levels of  [[vitamin B12]], but supplementation has not yet been shown to improve pregnancy outcome or the health of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OIgTE4aynrMC&amp;pg=PA1573&amp;dq=vitamin+b12+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PDFTVcPCM9HxggSRz4H4Cw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vitamin%20b12%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2011|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9781608317080|first = Gerald G.|last = Briggs|first2 = Roger K.|last2 = Freeman|first3 = Sumner J.|last3 = Yaffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), are beneficial for fetal development. Several studies have shown lower risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight in mothers with higher intakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effect of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid intake during pregnancy on maternal, infant, and child health outcomes: a systematic review|journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology|date = Jul 2012|issn = 1365-3016|pmid = 22742604|pages = 91–107|volume = 26 Suppl 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2012.01292.x|first = Beth|last = Imhoff-Kunsch|first2 = Virginia|last2 = Briggs|first3 = Tamar|last3 = Goldenberg|first4 = Usha|last4 = Ramakrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation|journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date = Jun 2006|issn = 0002-9165|pmid = 16841854|pages = 1452S-1457S|volume = 83|issue = 6 Suppl|first = CL|last = Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iron]] is needed for the healthy growth of the fetus and placenta, especially during the second and third trimesters.  It is also essential before pregnancy for the production of hemoglobin.There is no evidence that a hemoglobin level of 7 grams/100 ml or higher is detrimental to pregnancy, but it must be acknowledged that maternal hemorrhage is a major source of maternal mortality worldwide, and a reserve capacity to carry oxygen is desirable. According to the Cochrane review conclusions iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña-Rosas|first=Juan Pablo|last2=De-Regil|first2=Luz Maria|last3=Garcia-Casal|first3=Maria N.|last4=Dowswell|first4=Therese|date=2015-07-22|title=Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004736|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004736.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26198451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition during pregnancy==
The United States and the European Union have established vitamin and mineral recommendations for during pregnancy and lactation. The amounts in the table below are the higher of the two. The citations separately list recommendations for pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations (RDAs = Recommended Dietary Allowances and PRIs = Population Reference Intakes) are set higher than what has been determined to be average requirements so as to address women who have above average needs. For some nutrients there is not enough information to set a recommendation, so the term Adequate Intake (AI) is used based on what appears to be sufficient.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended /&gt;

Supplementing one's diet with foods rich in [[folic acid]], fruits and dark green leafy vegetables helps to prevent [[neural tube]] birth defects in the fetus. In addition, [[prenatal vitamins]] typically contain increased amounts of [[folic acid]], iodine, iron, vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc, and calcium over the amounts found in standard multi-vitamins.&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt; Zinc supplements have reduced preterm births by around 14% mainly in low income countries where zinc deficiency is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ota|first1=E|last2=Mori|first2=R|last3=Middleton|first3=P|last4=Tobe-Gai|first4=R|last5=Mahomed|first5=K|last6=Miyazaki|first6=C|last7=Bhutta|first7=ZA|title=Zinc supplementation for improving pregnancy and infant outcome.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2 February 2015|volume=2|pages=CD000230|pmid=25927101|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000230.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the World Health Organisation does not routinely recommend zinc supplementation for all pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zinc supplementation during pregnancy |url=http://www.who.int/elena/titles/zinc_pregnancy/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
{{main|Alcohol and pregnancy}}
[[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]s are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, hearing loss and vision problems.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about FASDs|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=April 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523194618/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|archivedate=23 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol and recreational drug use.&lt;ref name=Cor2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coriale|first1=G|last2=Fiorentino|first2=D|last3=Di Lauro|first3=F|last4=Marchitelli|first4=R|last5=Scalese|first5=B|last6=Fiore |first6=M|last7=Maviglia |first7=M|last8=Ceccanti|first8=M|title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD): neurobehavioral profile, indications for diagnosis and treatment.|journal=Rivista di psichiatria|date=2013|volume=48|issue=5|pages=359–369|pmid=24326748|doi=10.1708/1356.15062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four drinks per day.

The American Academy of Pediatrics established a conservative set of recommendations in 2015: "During pregnancy:no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk; and binge drinking poses dose-related risk to the developing fetus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams JF, Smith VC |title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders |journal=Pediatrics |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=e1395–e1406 |year=2015 |pmid=26482673 |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3113 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88335.pdf |publisher=World Health Organisation |title=Framework for alcohol policy in the WHO European Region }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish and omega-3 fatty acids===
Fish consumption during pregnancy is encouraged by European,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=EFSA Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition, and Allergies (NDA)|date=2014-07-01|title=Scientific Opinion on health benefits of seafood (fish and shellfish) consumption in relation to health risks associated with exposure to methylmercury |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55|title=Australian Dietary Guidelines (2013) {{!}} National Health and Medical Research Council|last=Council|first=National Health and Medical Research|date=2013-02-07|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given is that fat-containing fish such as salmon and tuna contain [[eicosapentaenoic acid|eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]]. These are termed long chain, [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]], [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]], and are considered as important for fetal neurodevelopment.&lt;ref name=Starling2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starling|first=Phoebe|last2=Charlton|first2=Karen|last3=McMahon|first3=Anne T.|last4=Lucas|first4=Catherine|date=2015-03-18|title=Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopment—A Systematic Review of the Evidence|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/3/2001|journal=Nutrients|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=2001–2014|doi=10.3390/nu7032001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, fish are good sources of vitamins A, D, and B12, as well as the mineral iodine.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt;

Due to risks of heavy-metal toxicity on fetal neurodevelopment, many mothers are concerned about eating fish during pregnancy. Overall, current research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Current research suggests that 2-3 servings of low-methylmercury containing fish per week in pregnancy is both safe and beneficial.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Mercury accumulates in fish through their own diet ([[bioaccumulation]]). A general rule of thumb is that fish higher up on the food chain, and with longer life spans will contain higher levels of mercury. Fish lower on the food chain and with shorter life spans will have lower metal content. However, it is important to note that the bioaccumulation of metals in fish is also dependent on geographical location, so it is hard to make global recommendations on specific fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=Adina C|last2=O'Neill|first2=Bernadette|last3=Sigge|first3=Gunnar O|last4=Kerwath|first4=Sven E|last5=Hoffman|first5=Louwrens C|date=2016-01-15|title=Heavy metals in marine fish meat and consumer health: a review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.7360/abstract|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|language=en|volume=96|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.1002/jsfa.7360|issn=1097-0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to consuming fish is to use fish oil dietary supplements containing both EPA and DHA, or algae-derived DHA-only oils. The New York Times reported on a laboratory evaluation of 30 popular fish oil supplements. Some of those had less than the label claimed amounts of DHA. As for safety, "All of the products tested contained only very low levels of mercury, ranging from one to six parts per billion per serving. That range is far below the upper safety limit of 100 parts per billion set by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, an industry trade group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/whats-in-your-fish-oil-supplements/ |title=What’s in Your Fish Oil Supplements? |last=Conner |first=Anahad |date=22 January 2014 |website=The New York Times |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folic acid ===
Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin [[folate]], is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; Deficiencies in folic acid may cause [[neural tube defects]] (NTDs). Women who had 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg of folic acid in their systems due to supplementing 3 months before childbirth significantly reduced the risk of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recommendations {{!}} Folic Acid {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/recommendations.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80 countries use [[Food fortification|fortification of certain foods]] with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wald NJ, Morris JK, Blakemore C |title=Public health failure in the prevention of neural tube defects: time to abandon the tolerable upper intake level of folate |journal=Public Health Rev |volume=39 |issue= |pages=2 |date=2018 |pmid=29450103 |pmc=5809909 |doi=10.1186/s40985-018-0079-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins C and E===
The combination of vitamin E and vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women does not appear to be efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name="Rumbold2015" /&gt; Antioxidant vitamins as dietary supplements had been proposed as having benefits if consumed during pregnancy. For the combination of vitamin E with vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women, a Cochrane review of 21 clinical trials concluded that the data do not support vitamin E supplementation - majority of trials alpha-tocopherol at 400 IU/day plus vitamin C at 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/day - as being efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name=Rumbold2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold A, Ota E, Hori H, Miyazaki C, Crowther CA |title=Vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD004069 |date=September 2015 |pmid=26343254 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004069.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review identified only three small trials in which vitamin E was supplemented without co-supplementation with vitamin C. None of these trials reported any clinically meaningful information.&lt;ref name=Rumbold2015/&gt; A second Cochrane review of 29 trials, published same year, reported on the same combination trials but added analysis of trials with vitamin C alone.

==Nutrition after pregnancy==
Proper nutrition is important after delivery to help the mother recover, and to provide enough food energy and nutrients for a woman to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]] her child. Women having serum [[ferritin]] less than 70&amp;nbsp;µg/L may need [[iron]] supplements to prevent [[iron deficiency anaemia]] during pregnancy and postpartum.&lt;ref name="pmid16733739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milman N, Byg KE, Bergholt T, Eriksen L, Hvas AM |title=Body iron and individual iron prophylaxis in pregnancy--should the iron dose be adjusted according to serum ferritin? |journal=Ann. Hematol. |volume=85 |issue=9 |pages=567–573 |year=2006 |pmid=16733739 |doi=10.1007/s00277-006-0141-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sethi V, Kapil U |title=Iodine deficiency and development of brain |journal=Indian J Pediatr |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=325–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15107513 |doi=10.1007/BF02724099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During lactation, water intake may need to be increased. Human milk is made of 88% water, and the IOM recommends that breastfeeding women increase their water intake by about 300 mL/day to a total volume of 3000 mL/day (from food and drink);  approximately 2,400 mL/day from fluids.&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt;

Oogenesis is initiated in the embryonic stage.  

==Oogenesis in mammals==
[[File:Gray5.svg|thumb|260px|Diagram showing the reduction in number of the [[chromosomes]] in the process of maturation of the [[ovum]]. (In mammals, the first polar body normally disintegrates before dividing, so only two polar bodies are produced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}})]]

In [[mammal]]s, the first part of oogenesis starts in the [[germinal epithelium (female)|germinal epithelium]], which gives rise to the development of [[ovarian follicles]], the functional unit of the [[ovary]].

Oogenesis consists of several sub-processes: oocytogenesis, [[ootidogenesis]], and finally maturation to form an ovum (oogenesis proper). [[Folliculogenesis]] is a separate sub-process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub-processes.

===The creation of oogonia===
The creation of [[oogonia]] traditionally doesn't belong to oogenesis proper, but, instead, to the [[Gametogenesis#Common path|common process]] of gametogenesis, which, in the female human, begins with the processes of [[folliculogenesis]], oocytogenesis, and [[ootidogenesis]].

==Human oogenesis==

===Oogenesis===
Oogenesis starts with the process of developing primary oocytes, which occurs via the transformation of [[oogonium|oogonia]] into primary [[oocyte]]s, a process called oocytogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.4695 NCBI - The saga of the germ line]&lt;/ref&gt; Oocytogenesis is complete either before or shortly after birth.

====Number of primary oocytes====
It is commonly believed that, when oocytogenesis is complete, no additional primary oocytes are created, in contrast to the male process of spermatogenesis, where gametocytes are continuously created. In other words, primary oocytes reach their maximum development at ~20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lobo RA |title=Early ovarian ageing: a hypothesis. What is early ovarian ageing? |journal=Hum.

Recently, however, two publications have challenged the belief that a finite number of oocytes are set around the time of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Johnson J, Bagley J, Skaznik-Wikiel M, etal |title=Oocyte generation in adult mammalian ovaries by putative germ cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood |journal=Cell |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=303–15 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16051153 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.06.031 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson J, Canning J, Kaneko T, Pru J, Tilly J | title = Germline stem cells and follicular renewal in the postnatal mammalian ovary | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 145–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15014492 | doi = 10.1038/nature02316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells (originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood) has been reported in the postnatal mouse ovary. In contrast, DNA clock measurements do not indicate ongoing oogenesis during human females' lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster P, Hohoff C, Dunkelmann B, Schürenkamp M, Pfeiffer H, Neuhuber F, Brinkmann B |title=Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers |journal=Proc R Soc B |volume=282 |issue= |pages=20142898 |year=2015 |pmid=25694621 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 |pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, further experiments are required to determine the true dynamics of small follicle formation.

===Ootidogenesis===
The succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the [[primary oocyte]] develops into an ootid. This is achieved by the process of meiosis. In fact, a primary oocyte is, by its biological definition, a cell whose primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/primary_oocyte.html Biochem]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although this process begins at prenatal age, it stops at [[prophase I]]. In late fetal life, all oocytes, still primary oocytes, have halted at this stage of development, called the [[dictyate]]. After [[menarche]], these cells then continue to develop, although only a few do so every [[menstrual cycle]].

====Meiosis I====
[[Meiosis I]] of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development, but halts in the [[diplotene]] stage of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate ([[Leptotene stage|leptotene]], [[Meiosis#Zygotene|zygotene]] and [[Meiosis#Pacytene|pachytene]]) stages of meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guli CL, Smyth DR | year = 1988 | title = UV-induced DNA repair is not detectable in pre-dictyate oocytes of the mouse | url = | journal = Mutat Res | volume = 208 | issue = 2| pages = 115–119 | pmid = 3380109 | doi=10.1016/s0165-7992(98)90010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those primary oocytes that continue to develop in each menstrual cycle, however, [[synapsis]] occurs and [[Meiosis#Meiosis I|tetrads]] form, enabling [[chromosomal crossover]] to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the [[secondary oocyte]] and the first [[polar body]].

====Meiosis II====
Immediately after meiosis I, the [[haploid]] secondary oocyte initiates [[meiosis II]]. However, this process is also halted at the [[metaphase II]] stage until [[fertilization]], if such should ever occur. When meiosis II has completed, an ootid and another polar body have now been created.

====Folliculogenesis====
{{Main article|Folliculogenesis}}
Synchronously with ootidogenesis, the [[ovarian follicle]] surrounding the ootid has developed from a primordial follicle to a preovulatory one.

===Maturation into ovum===
Both polar bodies disintegrate at the end of Meiosis II, leaving only the ootid, which then eventually undergoes maturation into a mature ovum.

The function of forming polar bodies is to discard the extra haploid sets of chromosomes that have resulted as a consequence of meiosis.

===In vitro maturation===
{{Main article|In vitro maturation}}
''In vitro maturation'' (''IVM'') is the technique of letting [[ovarian follicle]]s mature [[in vitro]]. It can potentially be performed before an [[IVF]]. In such cases, [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] isn't essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to IVF. Hence, no (or at least a lower dose of) gonadotropins have to be injected in the body.&lt;ref name=vejledning&gt;[http://www.sst.dk/publ/Publ2006/KOT/kunstig_befrugtning/Vejl_ivf_oa_dec06.pdf Vejledning om kunstig befrugtning 2006 (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Immature eggs have been grown until maturation ''in vitro'' at a 10% survival rate, but the technique is not yet clinically available.&lt;ref name="McLaughlinAlbertini2018"&gt;

==Oogenesis in non-mammals==
[[File:Parasite160001-fig6 - Oogenesis in Crepidostomum metoecus (Digenea) (diagram).png|thumb|Diagram of oogenesis in a [[digenea]]n ([[Platyhelminthes]])]]
{{Main article|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}

Some [[algae]] and the [[oomycete]]s produce eggs in [[oogonia]]. In the brown alga ''[[Fucus]]'', all four egg cells survive oogenesis, which is an exception to the rule that generally only one product of female meiosis survives to maturity.

In [[plant]]s, oogenesis occurs inside the female [[gametophyte]] via [[mitosis]]. In many plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and [[gymnosperm]]s, egg cells are formed in [[archegonia]]. In [[flowering plant]]s, the female gametophyte has been reduced to an eight-celled [[embryo sac]] within the [[ovule]] inside the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] of the flower. Oogenesis occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule.

In ''[[ascaris]]'', the oocyte does not even begin meiosis until the [[sperm]] touches it, in contrast to mammals, where meiosis is completed in the [[estrus]] cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1213">Originally used by Jesuits as a learning aid for students, '''painted enigmas''' are visual riddles - generally speaking, a picture with an easily understood superficial subject that contains a hidden meaning, usually one word.  This differed from similar visual riddles such as the [[emblem]] or hieroglyph ([[Horapollo]]'s "''Hieroglyphica''" for instance)which were simpler in design and intended to represent moral precepts. The emblem and painted enigma were similar in that each usually contained some clue that the composition contained a hidden meaning, usually a "written legend which might be a verbal riddle or rebus to be solved by the same word,or a simple epigrammatic motto such as constituted the 'soul' of the emblem." First developed at the Jesuit college Pont a Mousson in 1588, it developed into an erudite courtly entertainment by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Montagu]], “The Painted Enigma and French Seventeenth-Century Art,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 31 (1968), 307-309, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest verifiable painted enigmas from this era were painted by [[Charles Le Brun]].

The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines '''personnel recovery''' as "The sum of military, [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian, DOD contractor personnel, or other personnel designated by the [[President of the United States|President]] or [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], who are isolated, missing, detained, or captured (IMDC) in an operational environment.  Also called PR." 
The [[Joint Personnel Recovery Agency]] is the Chairman's Controlled Activity and is designated as DoD's office of primary responsibility for DoD-wide personnel recovery (PR) matters, less policy. 

The [[European Personnel Recovery Centre]] facilitates the harmonisation of personnel recovery policy, doctrine and standards through clear lines of communications with partners stakeholders (nations and international organizations)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eprc.it/structure/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The five PR execution tasks==
# Report: Begins with the recognition of an isolating event.  It must be both timely and accurate.
# Locate: Involves the effort to find and authenticate isolated personnel.  Accurate position and positive ID are generally required prior to committing forces.
# Support: Involves support for isolated personnel and their families.  It can include establishing two-way communications, dropping supplies, or suppressing enemy threats.
# Recover: Involves coordinated actions of commanders and staffs, recovery forces and the isolated individual.
# Reintegrate: The primary consideration is the physical and mental health of the recovered personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1056a: Reintegration of recovered Department of Defense personnel; post-isolation support activities for other recovered personnel|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section1056a&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim#sourcecredit|website=uscode.house.gov|publisher=uscode.house.gov|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20II ''Natural History'' (Book II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Photius]] in 418 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Photius. [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/philostorgius.htm ''Epitome of the Church History of Philosturgius''], accessed 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these dates and times have confirmed [[Lists of solar eclipses|eclipses]]. In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archaeological remains and dating methods such as [[dendrochronology]] refute, rather than support, "phantom time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Amalie |last=Fößel |title=Karl der Fiktive? |work=[[Damals]], Magazin für Geschichte und Kultur |issue=8 |year=1999 |pages=20f }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig. Kalendertechnische und kalenderhistorische Einwände.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Württembergische Landesgeschichte.'' Band 60, 2001, S. 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">'''Pressure piling''' describes phenomena related to [[combustion]] of [[gas]]es in a [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]] or long vessel.  As the flame front propagates along the tube, the unburned gases ahead of the front are compressed, and hence heated. The amount of compression varies depending on the [[geometry]] and can range from twice to eight times the initial [[pressure]]. Where multiple vessels are connected by piping, ignition of gases in one vessel and pressure piling may result in a [[deflagration to detonation transition]] and very large [[explosion]] pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Chemical Process Safety  ''Safe Design and Operation of Process Vents and Emission Control'', Center for Chemical Process Safety/AIChE 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-471-79296-3}} pages 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical equipment in hazardous areas]], if two [[electrical enclosure]]s are connected by a [[Electrical conduit|conduit]], an explosion of a gas in one of the compartments travels through the conduit into the next enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest C. Magison, ''Electrical Innstruments in Hazardous Locations 4th edition'', International Society of Automation, 1998  {{ISBN|978-0-97923-431-6}},  page  153&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure of the 'primary' explosion together with the pressure from the 'secondary' explosion in the other compartment produces one huge explosion that the equipment cannot handle. Heat, arcs or sparks escape from the equipment and ignite any gas or [[vapour]] that may be around.

Operators avoid this by not using conduits to join classified equipment together and by using barrier glands on cables going into the enclosure. This ensures that compartments remain separate at all times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47572">'''Radiation protection''', also known as '''radiological protection''', is defined by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) as "The protection of people from harmful effects of exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], and the means for achieving this". The IAEA also states "The accepted understanding of the term radiation protection is restricted to protection of people. Suggestions to extend the definition to include the protection of non-human species or the protection of the environment are controversial".&lt;ref&gt;IAEA Safety Glossary - draft 2016 revision.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure can be from a radiation source external to the human body or due to the bodily intake of a radioactive material.

Ionizing radiation is widely used in industry and medicine, and can present a significant health hazard by causing microscopic damage to living tissue. This can result in skin burns and [[radiation sickness]] at high exposures, known as "tissue" or "deterministic" effects (conventionally indicated by the [[Gray (unit)|gray]]), and statistically elevated risks of [[radiation-induced cancer|cancer]] at low exposures, known as "[[stochastic]] effects" (conventionally measured by the [[sievert]]).

Fundamental to radiation protection is the reduction of expected dose and the measurement of dose uptake. For radiation protection and [[dosimetry]] assessment the [[ICRP|International Committee on Radiation Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) publish recommendations and data which is used to calculate the biological effects on the human body of certain levels of radiation, and thereby advise acceptable dose uptake limits. Supporting these are preventive dose reduction techniques such as radiation shielding, exposure planning and avoidance of ingestion of radioactive substances. Radiation protection instruments are used to indicate radiation hazards, and personal dosimeters and bioassay techniques are used to measure personal dose uptake.

==Principles==
[[File:International policy system radiological protection.png|thumb|400px|International policy relationships in radiological protection]]
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry - based on ICRU report 57]]
[[File:Radioactivity and radiation.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation]]
The ICRP recommends, develops and maintains the International System of Radiological Protection, based on evaluation of the large body of scientific studies available to equate risk to received dose levels. The system's health objectives are "to manage and control exposures to ionising radiation so that deterministic effects are prevented, and the risks of stochastic effects are reduced to the extent reasonably achievable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=para 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP's recommendations flow down to national and regional regulators, which have the opportunity to incorporate them into their own law; this process is shown in the accompanying block diagram. In most countries a national regulatory authority works towards ensuring a secure radiation environment in society by setting dose limitation requirements that are generally based on the recommendations of the ICRP.

===Exposure situations===
The ICRP recognises planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations, as described below;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=Section 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Planned exposure''' – defined as "...where radiological protection can be planned in advance, before exposures occur, and where the magnitude and extent of the exposures can be reasonably predicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=para 253|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are such as in occupational exposure situations, where it is necessary for personnel to work in a known radiation environment. 
*  '''Emergency exposure''' – defined as "...unexpected situations that may require urgent protective actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=para 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be such as an emergency nuclear event. 
* '''Existing exposure''' – defined as "...being those that already exist when a decision on control has to be taken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=para 284|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be such as from [[naturally occurring radioactive material]]s which exist in the environment.

===Regulation of dose uptake===
The ICRP uses the following overall principles for all controllable exposure situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=Introduction|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Justification:''' No unnecessary use of radiation is permitted, which means that the advantages must outweigh the disadvantages. 
* '''Limitation:''' Each individual must be protected against risks that are too great, through the application of individual radiation dose limits.
* '''Optimization:''' This process is intended for application to those situations that have been deemed to be justified. It means "the likelihood of incurring exposures, the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses" should all be kept as Low As Reasonably Achievable (known as [[ALARA]] or ALARP).  It takes into account economic and societal factors.

===Factors in external dose uptake===
{{main|sievert}}
There are three factors that control the amount, or dose, of radiation received from a source.  Radiation exposure can be managed by a combination of these factors:
#'''Time''': Reducing the time of an exposure reduces the [[Effective dose (radiation safety)|effective dose]] proportionally.  An example of reducing radiation doses by reducing the time of exposures might be improving operator training to reduce the time they take to handle a radioactive source.
#'''Distance''': Increasing distance reduces dose due to the [[inverse square law]].  Distance can be as simple as handling a source with [[forceps]] rather than fingers.
#'''Shielding''': Sources of radiation can be shielded with solid or liquid material, which absorbs the energy of the radiation.  The term 'biological shield' is used for absorbing material placed around a nuclear reactor, or other source of radiation, to reduce the radiation to a level safe for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/biological-shield.html |title=Biological shield  |publisher=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal dose uptake===
{{main|committed dose}}
[[File:NNSA-NSO-58.jpg|thumb|Large scale glovebox in the nuclear industry used to contain airborne radioactive particles.]]
Internal dose, due to the inhalation or ingestion of radioactive substances, can result in stochastic or deterministic effects, depending on the amount of radioactive material ingested and other [[internal dosimetry#Biokinetic modelling|biokinetic]] factors.

The risk from a low level internal source is represented by the dose quantity [[committed dose]], which has the same risk as the same amount of external [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]].

The intake of radioactive material can occur through four pathways:

*inhalation of airborne contaminants such as [[radon]] gas and radioactive particles
*ingestion of radioactive contamination in food or liquids
*absorption of vapours such as [[tritium]] oxide through the skin
*injection of medical radioisotopes such as [[technetium-99m]]

The occupational hazards from airborne radioactive particles in nuclear and radio-chemical applications are greatly reduced by the extensive use of [[glovebox]]es to contain such material. To protect against breathing in radioactive particles in ambient air, [[respirators]] with particulate filters are worn. 

To monitor the concentration of radioactive particles in ambient air, [[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring|radioactive particulate monitoring]] instruments measure the concentration or presence of airborne materials. 

For ingested radioactive materials in food and drink, specialist laboratory radiometric assay methods are used to measure the concentration of such materials.

=== Recommended limits on dose uptake ===
[[File:027 dose-ranges-sievert.jpg|thumb|USA Dept of Energy 2010 dose chart in sieverts for a variety of situations and applications.]][[File:Exposure chart-XKCD.svg|thumb|Various doses of radiation in sieverts, ranging from trivial to lethal.]]
The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of ICRP report 103. These limits are "situational", for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for certain exposed groups;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ICRP|title=Report 103|pages=Table 8, section 6.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Planned exposure – limits given for occupational, medical and public exposure. The occupational exposure limit of effective dose is 20 mSv per year, averaged over defined periods of 5 years, with no single year exceeding 50 mSv. The public exposure limit is 1 mSv in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dose limits||first1= International Commission on Radiological Protection|last1= ICRP|url=http://www.icrp.org/icrpaedia/limits.asp|website=ICRPedia|publisher=ICRP|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emergency exposure – limits given for occupational and public exposure 
* Existing exposure – reference levels for all persons exposed

Further detail of some of the limits can be found on the ICRPedia page.&lt;ref name="icrpedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ICRPedia on-line|url=http://www.icrp.org/icrpaedia/limits.asp|accessdate=28 July 2017|title = ICRP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public information dose chart of the USA Department of Energy, shown here on the right, applies to USA regulation, which is based on ICRP recommendations. Note that examples in lines 1 to 4 have a scale of dose rate (radiation per unit time), whilst 5 and 6 have a scale of total accumulated dose.

===ALARP &amp; ALARA===
{{Main|ALARA}}
'''ALARP''' is an acronym for an important principle in exposure to radiation and other occupational health risks and stands for "''As Low As Reasonably Practicable''".&lt;ref&gt;This is the wording used by the national regulatory authority that coined the term, in turn derived from its enabling legislation: [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]]: {{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/theory/alarpglance.htm|title=Risk management: ALARP at a glance|publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]]|accessdate=13 February 2011|location=London|quote='ALARP' is short for 'as low as reasonably practicable'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to minimize the risk of [[exposure (radiation)|radioactive exposure]] or other hazard while keeping in mind that some exposure may be acceptable in order to further the task at hand. The equivalent term '''ALARA''', ''"As Low As Reasonably Achievable"'', is more commonly used outside the UK.

This compromise is well illustrated in [[radiology]]. The application of [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] can aid the patient by providing doctors and other health care professionals with a medical diagnosis, but the exposure should be reasonably low enough to keep the statistical probability of [[cancer]]s or [[sarcoma]]s (stochastic effects) below an acceptable level, and to eliminate deterministic effects (e.g. skin reddening or cataracts). An acceptable level of incidence of stochastic effects is considered to be equal for a worker to the risk in another work generally considered to be safe.

This policy is based on the principle that any amount of radiation exposure, no matter how small, can increase the chance of negative biological effects such as [[cancer]].  It is also based on the principle that the probability of the occurrence of negative effects of radiation exposure increases with cumulative lifetime dose. These ideas are combined to form the [[linear no-threshold model]]. At the same time, radiology and other practices that involve use of radiations bring benefits to population, so reducing radiation exposure can reduce the efficacy of a medical practice. The economic cost, for example of adding a barrier against radiation, must also be considered when applying the ALARP principle. [[CT scan|Computed Tomography]], better known as [[CT scans|C.T. Scans]] or CAT Scans have made an enormous contribution to medicine, however not without some risk. They use [[ionizing radiation]] which can cause cancer, especially in children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Appeal for Safe and Appropriate Imaging of Children|url = http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=01209203-201409000-00001|journal = Journal of Patient Safety|pages = 121–124|volume = 10|issue = 3|doi = 10.1097/pts.0000000000000116|first = Stephen J.|last = Swensen|first2 = James R.|last2 = Duncan|first3 = Rosemary|last3 = Gibson|first4 = Stephen E.|last4 = Muething|first5 = Rebecca|last5 = LeBuhn|first6 = Jean|last6 = Rexford|first7 = Carol|last7 = Wagner|first8 = Stephen R.|last8 = Smith|first9 = Becky|last9 = DeMers}}&lt;/ref&gt; When caregivers follow proper indications for their use and [http://www.imagegently.org/Procedures/Interventional-Radiology/Protocols child safe techniques] rather than adult techniques, downstream cancer can be prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Image Gently|url = http://www.imagegently.org|website = www.imagegently.org|access-date = 2016-02-08|publisher = Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging (the Image Gently Alliance)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal radiation dosimeters==
{{main|Dosimeter}}
The radiation dosimeter is an important personal dose measuring instrument. It is worn by the person being monitored and is used to estimate the radiation dose deposited in the individual wearing the device.  They are used for Gamma, X-ray, beta and other strongly penetrating radiation, but not for weakly penetrating radiation such as alpha particles. Traditionally film badges were used for long term monitoring, and quartz fibre dosimeters for short term monitoring. However, these are being superseded by such as thermoluminescent dosimetry badges and electronic dosimeters. Electronic dosimeters can give an alarm warning if a preset dose threshold has been reached, enabling safer working in potentially higher radiation levels, where the received dose must be continually monitored.

Workers exposed to radiation, such as [[radiographer]]s, [[nuclear power plant]] workers, doctors using [[radiotherapy]], those in laboratories using [[radionuclide]]s, and [[HAZMAT]] teams are required to wear dosimeters so a record of occupational exposure can be made. Such devices are generally termed "legal dosimeters" if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes.

Dosimeters can be worn to obtain a whole body dose and there are also specialist types that can be worn on the fingers or clipped to headgear, to measure the localised body irradiation for specific activities.

Common types of wearable dosimeters for ionizing radiation include:&lt;ref&gt;Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry by Hill et al in http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/59/6/R183/article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/20/R303 | volume=59 | title=Review on the characteristics of radiation detectors for dosimetry and imaging | journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology | pages=R303–R347|bibcode = 2014PMB....59R.303S | pmid=25229250 | date=Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation shielding==
[[File:Alfa beta gamma neutron radiation.svg|thumb|Diagram showing various forms of [[ionizing radiation]], and the sort of material that is used to stop or reduce that type.]]
[[File:Pb-gamma-xs.svg|thumb|The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here, the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production starts to dominate.]]
[[File:Lead shielding.jpg|thumb|A [[lead castle]] built to shield a radioactive sample in a lab]]
Almost any material can act as a shield from [[gamma ray|gamma]] or x-rays if used in sufficient amounts. Different types of [[ionizing radiation]] interact in different ways with shielding material. The effectiveness of shielding is dependent on the [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|Stopping power of radiation particles]], which varies with the type and energy of radiation and the shielding material used. Different shielding techniques are therefore used dependent on the application and the type and energy of the radiation.

Shielding reduces the intensity of radiation depending on the thickness. This is an exponential relationship with gradually diminishing effect as equal slices of shielding material are added. A quantity known as the [[Half-value layer|halving-thicknesses]] is used to calculate this. For example, a practical shield in a [[fallout shelter]] with ten [[Half-value layer|halving-thicknesses]] of packed dirt, which is roughly {{convert|115|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} reduces gamma rays to 1/1024 of their original intensity (i.e. 1/2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).

The effectiveness of a shielding material in general increases with its atomic number, called ''Z'', except for neutron shielding which is more readily shielded by the likes of [[neutron absorber]]s and [[neutron moderator|moderators]] such as compounds of [[boron]] e.g. [[boric acid]], [[cadmium]], [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] respectively.

{{anchor|Graded-Z shielding}}
'''Graded-''Z'' shielding''' is a laminate of several materials with different ''Z'' values ([[atomic number]]s) designed to protect against [[ionizing radiation]]. Compared to single-material shielding, the same mass of graded-''Z'' shielding has been shown to reduce electron penetration over 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fan | first1 = W.C. | last2 = Drumm | first2 = C.R. | last3 = Roeske | first3 = S.B. | last4 = Scrivner | first4 = G.J. | title = Shielding considerations for satellite microelectronics | doi = 10.1109/23.556868 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 2790–2796 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = | display-authors = 1|bibcode = 1996ITNS...43.2790F }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used in satellite-based particle detectors, offering several benefits:

* protection from radiation damage
* reduction of background noise for detectors
* lower mass compared to single-material shielding

Designs vary, but typically involve a gradient from high-''Z'' (usually [[tantalum]]) through successively lower-''Z'' elements such as [[tin]], [[steel]], and [[copper]], usually ending with [[aluminium]]. Sometimes even lighter materials such as [[polypropylene]] or [[boron carbide]] are used.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = D.M. | title = The RHESSI Spectrometer | last2 = Lin | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Turin | first3 = P. | last4 = Curtis | first4 = D.W. | last5 = Primbsch | first5 = J.H. | last6 = Campbell | first6 = R.D. | last7 = Abiad | first7 = R. | last8 = Schroeder | first8 = P. | last9 = Cork | first9 = C.P. | last10 = Hull | first10 = E.L. | last11 = Landis | first11 = D.A. | last12 = Madden | first12 = N.W. | last13 = Malone | first13 = D. | last14 = Pehl | first14 = R.H. | last15 = Raudorf | first15 = T. | last16 = Sangsingkeow | first16 = P. | last17 = Boyle | first17 = R. | last18 = Banks | first18 = I.S. | last19 = Shirey | first19 = K. | last20 = Schwartz | first20 = Richard | journal = Solar Physics | volume = 210 | pages = 33–60 | year = 2002 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022400716414 |bibcode = 2002SoPh..210...33S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pia | first1 = Maria Grazia | last2 = Weidenspointner | first2 = Georg | last3 = Augelli | first3 = Mauro | last4 = Quintieri | first4 = Lina | last5 = Saracco | first5 = Paolo | last6 = Sudhakar | first6 = Manju | last7 = Zoglauer | first7 = Andreas | doi = 10.1109/TNS.2009.2033993 | title = PIXE Simulation with Geant4 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 3614–3649 | year = 2009 | display-authors = 1 |bibcode = 2009ITNS...56.3614P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical graded-''Z'' shield, the high-''Z'' layer effectively scatters protons and electrons. It also absorbs gamma rays, which produces [[X-ray fluorescence]]. Each subsequent layer absorbs the X-ray fluorescence of the previous material, eventually reducing the energy to a suitable level. Each decrease in energy produces [[bremsstrahlung]] and [[Auger electron]]s, which are below the detector's energy threshold. Some designs also include an outer layer of aluminium, which may simply be the skin of the satellite.
The effectiveness of a material as a biological shield is related to its [[Cross section (physics)|cross-section for scattering and absorption]], and to a first approximation is proportional to the total mass of material per unit area interposed along the line of sight between the radiation source and the region to be protected. Hence, shielding strength or "thickness" is conventionally measured in units of ''g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. The radiation that manages to get through falls exponentially with the thickness of the shield. In [[x-ray]] facilities, walls surrounding the room with the x-ray generator may contain lead sheets, or the plaster may contain [[barium sulfate]]. Operators view the target through a [[lead glass|leaded glass]] screen, or if they must remain in the same room as the target, wear [[lead shielding|lead aprons]].

===Particle radiation===
[[Particle radiation]] consists of a stream of charged or neutral particles, both charged ions and subatomic elementary particles. This includes [[solar wind]], [[cosmic radiation]], and [[neutron flux]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s.
* [[Alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]) are the least penetrating.  Even very energetic [[alpha particle]]s can be stopped by a single sheet of paper.
* [[Beta particle]]s ([[electrons]]) are more penetrating, but still can be absorbed by a few millimeters of [[aluminum]]. However, in cases where high energy beta particles are emitted shielding must be accomplished with low atomic weight materials, ''e.g.'' [[plastic]], [[wood]], [[water]], or [[acrylic glass]] (Plexiglas, Lucite).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oseh.umich.edu/TrainP32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This is to reduce generation of [[Bremsstrahlung]] X-rays.  In the case of beta+ radiation ([[positron]]s), the gamma radiation from the [[electron-positron annihilation]] reaction poses additional concern.
* [[Neutron radiation]] is not as readily absorbed as charged particle radiation, which makes this type highly penetrating. [[Neutron]]s are absorbed by [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of atoms in a [[nuclear reaction]]. This most often creates a secondary radiation hazard, as the absorbing nuclei transmute to the next-heavier isotope, many of which are unstable.
* [[Cosmic ray|Cosmic radiation]] is not a common concern, as the [[Earth's atmosphere]] absorbs it and the [[magnetosphere]] acts as a shield, but it poses a problem for [[satellite]]s and [[astronaut]]s. Frequent fliers are also at a slight risk. Cosmic radiation is extremely high energy, and is very penetrating.

===Electromagnetic radiation===
[[Electromagnetic radiation]] consists of emissions of [[electromagnetic wave]]s, the properties of which depend on the [[wavelength]].
* [[X-ray]] and [[gamma radiation]] are best absorbed by [[atom]]s with heavy [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; the heavier the nucleus, the better the absorption. In some special applications, [[depleted uranium]] or [[thorium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanfordchallenge.org/cmsAdmin/uploads/Historical_use_of_thorium_at_Hanford.pdf Historical Use of Thorium at Hanford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512230612/http://www.hanfordchallenge.org/cmsAdmin/uploads/Historical_use_of_thorium_at_Hanford.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are used, but [[lead]] is much more common; several centimeters are often required. [[Barium sulfate]] is used in some applications too. However, when cost is important, almost any material can be used, but it must be far thicker. Most nuclear reactors use thick concrete shields to create a bioshield with a thin water cooled layer of lead on the inside to protect the porous concrete from the coolant inside.  The concrete is also made with heavy aggregates, such as [[Baryte]] or MagnaDense (Magnetite), to aid in the shielding properties of the concrete. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray.
* [[Ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation is ionizing in its shortest wavelengths but it is not penetrating, so it can be shielded by thin opaque layers such as [[sunscreen]], clothing, and protective eyewear.  Protection from UV is simpler than for the other forms of radiation above, so it is often considered separately.
In some cases, improper shielding can actually make the situation worse, when the radiation interacts with the shielding material and creates secondary radiation that absorbs in the organisms more readily. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding [[photon]]s, using them to shield [[beta particle]]s may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of [[bremsstrahlung]] x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high [[neutron activation]] [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.

== Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - Radiation ==

[[Personal protective equipment|Personal Protection Equipment]] (PPE) includes all clothing and accessories which can be worn to prevent severe illness and injury as a result of exposure to radioactive material. Because radiation can affect humans through internal and external contamination, various protection strategies have been developed to protect humans from the harmful effects of radiation exposure from a spectrum of sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.remm.nlm.gov/radiation_ppe.htm|title=Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in a Radiation Emergency - Radiation Emergency Medical Management|website=www.remm.nlm.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A few of these strategies developed to shield from internal, external, and high energy radiation are outlined below.

=== Internal Contamination Protective Equipment ===
Internal contamination protection equipment protects against the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Internal deposition of radioactive material result in direct exposure of radiation to organs and tissues inside the body. The respiratory protective equipment described below are designed to minimize the possibility of such material being inhaled or ingested as emergency workers are exposed to potentially radioactive environments. 

'''Reusable Air Purifying Respirators (APR)'''

* Elastic face piece worn over the mouth and nose
* Contains filters, cartridges, and canisters to provide increased protection and better filtration

'''[[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air-Purifying Respirator]] (PAPR)''' 

* Battery powered blower forces contamination through air purifying filters
* Purified air delivered under positive pressure to face piece

'''Supplied-Air Respirator (SAR)'''

* Compressed air delivered from a stationary source to the face piece

'''Auxiliary Escape Respirator'''

* Protects wearer from breathing harmful gases, vapors, fumes, and dust
* Can be designed as an air-purifying escape respirator (APER) or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) type respirator

=== External Contamination Protective Equipment ===
External contamination protection equipment provides a barrier to shield radioactive material from being deposited on external structures like skin, hair, and clothing. The dermal protective equipment described below acts as a barrier to block radioactive material from physically touching the skin, but does not protect against externally penetrating high energy radiation.

=== Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment ===
Many solutions to low energy radiation exposure like [[X-ray|X-rays]] already exist. [[Lead apron|Lead aprons]], for example, can protect patients from the potentially harmful radiation effects of day to day medical examinations. It is quite feasible to protect large surface areas of the body from radiation in the lower energy spectrum because very little shielding material is required to provide the necessary protection. Shielding against high energy radiation is very difficult to achieve as the necessary mass of shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from externally penetrating [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] would make functional movement nearly impossible. There have been recent scientific studies, however,  which demonstrate the feasibility of partial body shielding as a viable protection strategy from externally penetrating [[Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]]. This strategy requires intentional shielding of the body's most radio-sensitive systems and organs. The immediate danger of intense exposure to high energy [[Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]] is [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)]], a result of irreversible bone marrow damage. The concept of selective shielding is based in the regenerative potential of the [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic stem cells]] found in bone marrow. The regenerative quality of stem cells make it only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the body with unaffected stem cells after the exposure: a similar concept which is applied in [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]] which is a common treatment for patients suffering from leukemia. This scientific advancement allows for the development of a new class of relatively light weight protective equipment which shields high concentrations of bone marrow to defer the hematopoietic sub-syndrome of [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome]] to much higher dosages. An Israeli-American company, [[StemRad]], has developed the 360 gamma, one of the first radiation protective solutions, which applies selective shielding to protect the high concentration of bone marrow stored in the hips and other radio-sensitive organs in the abdominal area. Protective equipment like this allows first responders a safe way to perform necessary missions in radioactive environments. The [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]] published a brief section outlining the benefits of partial body shielding in the 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management].

==Radiation protection instruments==
Practical radiation measurement using calibrated radiation protection instruments is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of protection measures, and in assessing the radiation dose likely to be received by individuals. The measuring instruments for radiation protection are both "installed" (in a fixed position) and portable (hand-held or transportable).

===Installed instruments===
Installed instruments are fixed in positions which are known to be important in assessing the general radiation hazard in an area. Examples are installed "area" radiation monitors, Gamma interlock monitors, personnel exit monitors, and airborne particulate monitors.

The area radiation monitor will measure the ambient radiation, usually X-Ray, Gamma or neutrons; these are radiations which can have significant radiation levels over a range in excess of tens of metres from their source, and thereby cover a wide area.

Gamma radiation "interlock monitors" are used in applications to prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to an excess dose by preventing personnel access to an area when a high radiation level is present. These interlock the process access directly.

[[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring|Airborne contamination monitors]] measure the concentration of radioactive particles in the ambient air to guard against radioactive particles being ingested, or deposited in the lungs of personnel. These instruments will normally give a local alarm, but are often connected to an integrated safety system so that areas of plant can be evacuated and personnel are prevented from entering an air of high airborne contamination. 

'''Personnel exit monitors''' (PEM) are used to monitor workers who are exiting a "contamination controlled" or potentially contaminated area. These can be in the form of hand monitors, clothing frisk probes, or whole body monitors. These monitor the surface of the workers body and clothing to check if any [[radioactive contamination]] has been deposited. These generally measure alpha or beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

The UK [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] publishes a good practice guide through its Ionising Radiation Metrology Forum concerning the provision of such equipment and the methodology of calculating the alarm levels to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Operational Monitoring Good Practice Guide "The Selection of Alarm Levels for Personnel Exit Monitors" Dec 2009 - National Physical Laboratory, Teddington UK [http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/alarm_levels_personnel_exit_monitors.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portable instruments===
[[File:RTG radiation measurement.jpg|thumb|250px|Hand-held ion chamber survey meter in use for surface dose rate on one of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for the Cassini spacecraft.]]
{{main|survey meter}}
Portable instruments are hand-held or transportable.
The hand-held instrument is generally used as a [[survey meter]] to check an object or person in detail, or assess an area where no installed instrumentation exists. They can also be used for personnel exit monitoring or personnel contamination checks in the field. These generally measure alpha, beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

Transportable instruments are generally instruments that would have been permanently installed, but are temporarily placed in an area to provide continuous monitoring where it is likely there will be a hazard. Such instruments are often installed on trolleys to allow easy deployment, and are associated with temporary operational situations.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned.&lt;ref name = "ukhse"&gt;[http://files.site-fusion.co.uk/webfusion117640/file/instrumentsirp7.pdf.pdf] Selection, use and maintenance of portable monitoring instruments. UK HSE&lt;/ref&gt; This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide.

===Instrument types===
A number of commonly used detection instrument types are listed below, and are used for both fixed and survey monitoring.

*[[ionization chamber]]s
*[[proportional counter]]s
*[[Geiger counter]]s
*[[Semiconductor detector]]s
*[[Scintillation counter|Scintillation detectors]] 
*[[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring]]

==Radiation related quantities==
The following table shows the main radiation related quantities and units.

{{Radiation related quantities}}

==Spacecraft radiation challenges==
Spacecraft, both manned and unmanned, must cope with the high radiation environment of outerspace. Radiation emitted by the Sun and [[Cosmic ray|other galactic sources]], and trapped in [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation "belts"]] is more dangerous and hundreds of times more intense than radiation sources such as medical X-rays or normal cosmic radiation usually experienced on Earth.&lt;ref name='behind the scenes'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/researching/radiation/ | title = Behind the scenes - NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory | accessdate = 2012-07-25 | year = 2003 | work = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the intensely ionizing particles found in space strike human tissue, it can result in cell damage and may eventually lead to cancer.

The usual method for radiation protection is material shielding by spacecraft and equipment structures (usually aluminium), possibly augmented by polyethylene in human spaceflight where the main concern is high energy protons and cosmic ray ions. On unmanned spacecraft in high electron dose environments such as Jupiter missions, or medium Earth orbit (MEO), additional shielding with materials of a high atomic number can be effective. On long duration manned missions, advantage can be taken of the good shielding characteristics of liquid hydrogen fuel and water.

The [[NASA Space Radiation Laboratory]] makes use of a particle accelerator that produces beams of protons or heavy ions. These ions are typical of those accelerated in cosmic sources and by the Sun. The beams of ions move through a 100-meter (328-foot) transport tunnel to the 37-square-meter (400-square-foot) shielded target hall. There, they hit the target, which may be a biological sample or shielding material.&lt;ref name="behind the scenes"/&gt; In a 2002 NASA study, it was determined that materials that have high hydrogen contents, such as [[polyethylene]], can reduce primary and secondary radiation to a greater extent than metals, such as aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/radiation.pdf | title = Understanding Space Radiation | accessdate = 2012-07-25 | date = October 2002 | format = PDF | work = Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center | publisher = NASA | quote = FS-2002-10-080-JSC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this "passive shielding" method is that radiation interactions in the material generate secondary radiation.

Active Shielding, that is, using magnets, high voltages, or artificial magnetospheres to slow down or deflect radiation, has been considered to potentially combat radiation in a feasible way. So far, the cost of equipment, power and weight of active shielding equipment outweigh their benefits. For example, active radiation equipment would need a habitable volume size to house it, and magnetic and electrostatic configurations often are not homogenous in intensity, allowing high-energy particles to penetrate the magnetic and electric fields from low-intensity parts, like cusps in dipolar magnetic field of Earth. As of 2012, NASA is undergoing research in [[superconducting]] magnetic architecture for potential active shielding applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2012_phaseII_fellows_westover.html | title = Radiation Protection and Architecture Utilizing High Temperature Superconducting Magnets

==Early radiation dangers==
[[File:Crookes tube xray experiment.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Taking an X-ray image with early [[Crookes tube]] apparatus in 1896. The Crookes tube is visible in the centre. The standing man is viewing his hand with a [[fluoroscope]] screen. This was a common method of setting up the tube power. No precautions against radiation exposure are being taken; its hazards were not known at the time.]]
The dangers of radioactivity and radiation were not immediately recognized. The discovery of x‑rays in 1895 led to widespread experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as early as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of [[Vanderbilt University]] performed an experiment involving x-raying Dudley's head that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, of his suffering severe hand and chest burns in an x-ray demonstration, was the first of many other reports in ''Electrical Review''.&lt;ref name="SansareKhanna2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sansare |first1=K. |last2=Khanna |first2=V. |last3=Karjodkar |first3=F. |title=Early victims of X-rays: a tribute and current perception |journal=Dentomaxillofacial Radiology |volume=40 |issue=2 |year=2011 |pages=123–125 |issn=0250-832X |doi=10.1259/dmfr/73488299 |pmc=3520298 |pmid=21239576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experimenters including [[Elihu Thomson]] at [[Thomas Edison]]'s lab, [[William J. Morton]], and [[Nikola Tesla]] also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering.&lt;ref name="physics.isu.edu"&gt;[http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/50yrs.htm Ronald L. Kathern and Paul L. Ziemer, he First Fifty Years of Radiation Protection, physics.isu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Other effects, including ultraviolet rays and ozone were sometimes blamed for the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Nikola Tesla and the Discovery of X-rays |journal=RadioGraphics |date=July 2008 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pmid=18635636 |pages=1189–92 |doi=10.1148/rg.284075206 |last1=Hrabak |first1=M. |last2=Padovan |first2=R. S. |last3=Kralik |first3=M. |last4=Ozretic |first4=D. |last5=Potocki |first5=K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicians claimed that there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all.&lt;ref name="physics.isu.edu"/&gt;

As early as 1902 [[William Herbert Rollins]] wrote almost despairingly that his warnings about the dangers involved in careless use of x-rays was not being heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time Rollins had proved that x-rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a fetus.&lt;ref name="taming"&gt;{{citation |title=Taming the Rays - A history of Radiation and Protection. |author=Geoff Meggitt |publisher=[[Lulu.com]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4092-4667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that "animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X-light" and warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means of x-rays.

Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicians and corporations began marketing radioactive substances as [[patent medicine]] in the form of glow-in-the-dark pigments. Examples were radium [[enema]] treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. [[Marie Curie]] protested against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died from [[aplastic anaemia]], likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium-containing medicinal products had been largely removed from the market ([[radioactive quackery]]).

[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] was a controversial [[Governor of Buenos Aires Province]] during the [[Argentine Civil Wars]]. Deposed during the [[battle of Caseros]], he spent his later life in exile in [[Southampton]], [[England]], where he died on March 14, 1877. He was buried at the [[Southampton Old Cemetery]], and after a number of failed attempts he was repatriated to Argentina and taken to [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], his current grave location.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 108-122. ''Chapter Four:'' "The Repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas" By Jeffrey M. Shumway.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] was the [[Governor of Buenos Aires Province]] from 1829 to 1832 and 1835 to 1852. At the time the country fought many [[Argentine Civil Wars|civil wars]] between [[Federales (Argentina)|Federals]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]], Rosas being a federal leader. He was ousted from power by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], governor of the [[Entre Ríos Province]], at the [[battle of Caseros]]. Defeated, he was rescued by a British warship and moved to [[Southampton]], where he stayed the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 108-111 ''(ibidem).''&lt;/ref&gt; He died on March 14, 1877, and he was buried at the [[Southampton Old Cemetery]]. Fearing pro-Rosas demonstrations, the Argentine government forbid any commemoration in his honour, and made instead a mass for the people that died during Rosas's government.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 113 ''(ibidem).''&lt;/ref&gt;

With Rosas out of the country, the Unitarians returned to Buenos Aires. They sought to erase or denigrate the legacy of Rosas, confiscated their {{specify}} property and charged him with [[high treason]]. [[Bartolomé Mitre]], who fought in Caseros, did so with the first histographic works of Argentina, with a high negative bias against Rosas and other ''[[caudillos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt; This historiographical perspective was soon confronted by the end of the 19th century by [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] scholars like [[Adolfo Saldías]] and [[Ernesto Quesada]], who described Rosas under a positive light.

==Repatriation projects==
[[File:Rosas memorial.JPG|thumb|180px|Rosas memorial in [[Southampton Old Cemetery]].]]
Anticipating the controversy, Rosas wrote in his will that "''once my country recognizes, along with its government, the justice owed me by my services''", then his body shall be returned to Argentina. Revisionism kept growing, specially in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1930s saw the establishment of the Pro-Repatriation of Rosas Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist authors got state recognition during the [[Revolution of '43]] (the United Kingdom was fighting [[World War II]] at that time) and lost it during the first presidencies of [[Juan Perón]], as Perón tried to avoid ideological disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 268-271&lt;/ref&gt; Perón was deposed in 1955 by the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' military coup and sent to exile, and Peronism was proscribed. Perón became a supporter of revisionism in the 1960s, and helped Manuel de Anchorena in the renewed efforts of the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Perón returned from exile and became president in 1973. He appointed Anchorena ambassador in England, and instructed him to negotiate the repatriation of Rosas's body. Great Britain authorized it, and the Argentine Congress passed a resolution for this purpose. The repatriation was imminent, but the country began a period of turmoil: Perón died in 1974, his wife Isabel Perón could not keep the [[Dirty War]] under control (a conflict between left-wing guerrillas and right-wing anti-communist groups), and a new military coup, the [[National Reorganization Process]], deposed Isabel Perón. It is unknown if the repatriation was paused by the military or by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

The military left in 1983, and [[Raúl Alfonsín]] became the new president. He did not take action to resume the repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final repatriation==

Alfonsín was followed by Peronist [[Carlos Menem]] in 1989, amid an economic crisis. Menem announced that the main task of his presidency would be the national reconciliation, the end of the dichotomies that once plagued the country. In the case of Rosas, he claimed that he wanted to be "the president of Rosas and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]", of "Mitre and [[Facundo Quiroga|Quiroga]]". Both pairs were historical enemies, and Menem sought to end those conflicts. With those ideas in mind, Menem gave the final boost to the repatriation project. The body would be taken from the cemetery, placed in a new coffin in France, and them moved by plane to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

There were projects to place the coffin in the [[Buenos Aires Cathedral]], next to the one of [[José de San Martín]], but a 1982 papal regulation forbid to bury people in cathedrals except for popes, archbishops and cardinals. The committee attempted to bypass the regulation, to no avail. As a result, it was placed in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The body was received in France with the honours of a head of state: red carpet, full military honours and the flag at half staff. In Argentina, the newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' (founded by Bartolomé Mitre) declared that it was not against the repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The huge procession took place on September 30, 1989, and had the presence of both descendants of Rosas and descendants of Rosas's enemies, who marched together in peace.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager''' ('''RHESSI''', originally '''High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager''' or '''HESSI''') is a [[NASA]] solar flare observatory. It is the sixth mission in the [[Small Explorer program]], selected in October 1997&lt;ref name="eoPortal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nugget100"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.ssl.berkeley.edu/~tohban/wiki/index.php/RHESSI_-_Concept_to_Fruition |title=RHESSI - Concept to Fruition |publisher=[[Space Sciences Laboratory]] |first=Brian |last=Dennis |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched on 5 February 2002. Its primary mission is to explore the physics of [[particle acceleration]] and energy release in [[solar flare]]s.

HESSI was renamed to RHESSI on 29 March 2002 in honor of [[Reuven Ramaty]], a pioneer in the area of high energy solar physics. RHESSI is the first space mission named after a NASA scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0203/29rhessi/ |title=New solar flare satellite gets renamed, now on line |work=Spaceflight Now |publisher=University of California–Berkeley |date=29 March 2002 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; RHESSI was built by [[Spectrum Astro]] for Goddard Space Flight Center and is operated by the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. The [[principal investigator]] from 2002 to 2012 was [[Robert Lin]], who was succeeded by Säm Krucker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/PI_AcceptanceLetter.jpg |subject=RHESSI Principal Investigator Appointment |first=John M. |last=Grunsfeld |recipient=Sämuel Krucker |date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission concept==
RHESSI is designed to image solar flares in energetic photons from soft [[X-ray]]s (~3 keV) to [[gamma ray]]s (up to ~20 MeV) and to provide high resolution spectroscopy up to gamma-ray energies of ~20 MeV. Furthermore, it has the capability to perform spatially resolved spectroscopy with high spectral resolution.

==Scientific objectives==
Researchers believe that much of the energy released during a flare is used to accelerate, to very high energies, electrons (emitting primarily X-rays) and protons and other ions (emitting primarily gamma rays). The new approach of the RHESSI mission is to combine, for the first time, high-resolution imaging in hard X-rays and gamma rays with high-resolution spectroscopy, so that a detailed energy spectrum can be obtained at each point of the image.

This new approach will enable researchers to find out where these particles are accelerated and to what energies. Such information will advance understanding of the fundamental high-energy processes at the core of the solar flare problem.

The primary scientific objective of RHESSI is to understand the following processes that take place in the magnetized plasmas of the solar atmosphere during a flare:
*Impulsive energy release,
*Particle acceleration,
*Particle and energy transport.

These high-energy processes play a major role at sites throughout the universe ranging from magnetospheres to active galaxies. Consequently, the importance of understanding these processes transcends the field of solar physics; it is one of the major goals of space physics and astrophysics.

The high energy processes of interest include the following:
*The rapid release of energy stored in unstable magnetic configurations,
*The equally rapid conversion of this energy into the kinetic energy of hot plasma and accelerated particles (primarily electrons, protons and ions),
*The transport of these particles through the solar atmosphere and into interplanetary space,
*The subsequent heating of the ambient solar atmosphere.

These processes involve:
*Particle energies to many GeV,
*Temperatures of tens or even hundreds of millions of degrees,
*Densities as low as 100 million particles per square cm,
*Spatial scales of tens of thousands of kilometers, and
*Magnetic containment times of seconds to hours.

It is impossible to duplicate these conditions in laboratories on the Earth.

The acceleration of electrons is revealed by hard X-ray and gamma-ray bremsstrahlung while the acceleration of protons and ions is revealed by gamma-ray lines and continuum. The proximity of the Sun means, not only that these high-energy emissions are orders of magnitude more intense than from any other cosmic source, but also that they can be better resolved, both spatially and temporally.

==Imaging==
[[File:Rhessi.jpg|thumb|left|RHESSI observing the Sun]]

Since X-rays are not easily reflected or refracted, imaging in X-rays is difficult.  One solution to this problem is to selectively block the X-rays.  If the X-rays are blocked in a way that depends on the direction of the incoming photons, then it may be possible to reconstruct an image.  The imaging capability of RHESSI is based on a Fourier-transform technique using a set of 9 [[Rotational Modulation Collimator]]s (RMCs) as opposed to mirrors and lenses. Each RMC consist of two sets of widely spaced, fine-scale linear grids.  As the spacecraft rotates, these grids block and unblock any X-rays which may be coming from the Sun modulating the photon signal in time.  The modulation can be measured with a detector having no spatial resolution placed behind the RMC since the spatial information is now stored in the time domain. The modulation pattern over half a rotation for a single RMC provides the amplitude and phase of many spatial Fourier components over a full range of angular orientations but for a small range of spatial source dimensions. Multiple RMCs, each with different slit widths, provide coverage over a full range of flare source sizes. Images are then reconstructed from the set of measured Fourier components in exact mathematical analogy to multi-baseline radio interferometry.

RHESSI provides spatial resolution of 2 arcseconds at X-ray energies from ~4 keV to ~100 keV, 7 arcseconds to ~400 keV, and 36 arcseconds for gamma-ray lines and continuum emission above 1 MeV.

RHESSI can also see gamma rays coming from off-solar directions.  The more energetic gamma rays pass through the spacecraft structure, and impact the detectors from any angle.  This mode is used to observe [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs).  The incoming gamma rays are not modulated by the grids, so positional and imaging information is not recorded.  However, a crude position can still be derived by the fact that the detectors have front and rear pickups.  Also, the detectors near the burst shield the ones away from the burst.  Comparing signal strengths around the nine crystals, and front-to-back, then gives a coarse, two-dimensional position in space.

When combined with high-resolution time stamps of the detector hits, the RHESSI solution can be [[multilateration|cross-referenced]] on the ground with other spacecraft in the IPN (Interplanetary Network) to provide a fine solution.  The large area and high sensitivities of the Ge crystal assembly make RHESSI a formidable IPN component.  Even when other spacecraft can provide burst locations, few can provide as high-quality spectra of the burst (in both time and energy) as RHESSI.

Rarely, however, a GRB occurs near the Sun, in the collimated field of view.  The grids then provide full information, and RHESSI can provide a fine GRB location even without IPN correlation.

==Spacecraft and instrument==
The entire spacecraft rotates to provide the necessary signal modulation.  The four, fixed solar panels are designed to provide enough gyroscopic moment to stabilize rotation about the solar vector.  This largely eliminates the need for attitude control.

The instrument detectors are nine high-purity [[germanium]] crystals.  Each is cooled to cryogenic temperatures by a mechanical cryocooler. Germanium provides not only detections by the [[photoelectric effect]], but inherent spectroscopy through the charge deposition of the incoming ray.  The crystals are housed in a cryostat, and mounted with low-conductivity straps.

A tubular telescope structure forms the bulk of the spacecraft. Its purpose is to hold the collimators above the Ge crystals at known, fixed positions.

==Results==
RHESSI observations have changed our perspective on solar flares, particularly on high-energy processes in flares.  RHESSI observations has led to numerous publications in scientific journals and presentations at conferences. {{As of|2008|09}}, RHESSI is mentioned in 970 publications, books, and presentations (as listed on NASA ADS). Between February 2006 to 2008, 200 publications have been published about RHESSI observations.

*RHESSI was the first satellite to image gamma rays from a solar flare.&lt;ref name="gammarayimage"&gt;{{cite journal |title=First Gamma-Ray Images of a Solar Flare |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |first1=G. J. |last1=Hurford |first2=R. A. |last2=Schwartz |first3=S. |last3=Krucker |first4=R. P. |last4=Lin |first5=D.

*RHESSI was the first satellite to accurately measure [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es that come from [[thunderstorm]]s, and RHESSI found that such flashes occur more often than thought and the gamma rays have a higher [[frequency]] on average than the average for cosmic sources.

A '''sand fence''' or '''sandbreak''', like a [[snow fence]], is used to force windblown, drifting [[sand]] to accumulate in a desired place. Sand fences are employed to control erosion, help [[sand dune stabilization]], keep sand off roadways, and to recruit new material in desert areas. Sand fences are also commonly employed following storm events in order to aid in the dune recovery process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Deborah L.|last2=Thetford|first2=Mack|last3=Yager|first3=Lisa|date=2001-01-01|title=Evaluation of Sand Fence and Vegetation for Dune Building following Overwash by Hurricane Opal on Santa Rosa Island, Florida|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=17|issue=4|pages=936–948|jstor=4300253}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in developed areas where dunes are critical for protection of property. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nordstrom|first=Karl F.|last2=Lampe|first2=Reinhard|last3=Vandemark|first3=Lisa M.|date=2000-01-01|title=Reestablishing Naturally Functioning Dunes on Developed Coasts|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679910004|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1007/s002679910004|pmid=10552101|issn=0364-152X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical construction is to attach a perforated [[plastic]] sheet to stakes at regular intervals, similar to construction site fencing or temporary sports field fencing. Another is a [[Cedar wood|cedar]] or other lightweight wood strip and wire fence, also attached to metal stakes.  A permanent sand fence is generally of larger wooden poles set deeply into the ground with large wooden planks running horizontally across them. 

The drifting and settling  of sand behind and in front of such a fence occurs because the wind speed on both the downwind and windward sides is less than that on the far windward side, allowing light materials such as sand to settle.&lt;ref&gt;

Fort Collins CO: General Technical Report RM-9, USDA-Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a pile both in front of and behind the sand fence causing more sand to drop out.  Conveniently the sand does not drop on the barrier itself, otherwise it would soon be buried and rendered useless.&lt;ref&gt;

It is uncertain if there is a link between [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) and [[sex]]. Males are more likely than females to be [[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] with autism, but there is some debate about whether [[Sex differences in autism#Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis|females are just underdiagnosed]], of if there really is a gender difference in autism [[Incidence (epidemiology)#Incidence rate|incidence rates]].

Autism spectrum disorders are currently more commonly diagnosed in males, with a ratio of about 1 female for every 4 males diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;Fombonne, E. (2009). Epidemiology of pervasive developmental disorders. Pediatric Research, 65(6), 591–598. http://doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7203&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, one in every 189 females and one in 42 males in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate=2014-04-18 |df= }} Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Data &amp; Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that females may also receive diagnoses somewhat later than males, however thus far results have been contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Begeer, S., Mandell, D., Wijnker-Holmes, B., Venderbosch, S., Rem, D., Stekelenburg, F., &amp; Koot, H. M. (2013). Sex Differences in the Timing of Identification Among Children and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43, 1151–1156. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-012-1656-z&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in presentation of [[Autism#Characteristics|autistic traits]] are widely supported within the [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism#Autistic culture and community|autistic community]], and gaining support in the professional field. [[Hans Asperger]] was one of the first people to study autism, yet all of his four students were male. Another early researcher, [[Leo Kanner]] described "autistic disturbances of affective contact" in the group consisting of eight boys and three girls.&lt;ref&gt;Kanner, L. (1943). Autistic disturbances of affective contact. Nervous Child, 2, 217-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Since biological differences exist between males and females, it follows that the presentation of autism would differ as well. Recent studies suggest this to be true, with evidence of increased incidence of [[social anxiety]],&lt;ref name="ludlow2015" /&gt; [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S., Jaffa, T., Davies, S., Auyeung, B., Allison, C., &amp; Wheelwright, S. (2013). Do girls with anorexia nervosa have elevated autistic traits? Molecular Autism, 4(1), 24. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-4-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhind, C., Bonfioli, E., Hibbs, R., Goddard, E., Macdonald, P., Gowers, S., … Treasure, J. (2014). An examination of autism spectrum traits in adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their parents. Molecular Autism, 5(1), 56. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-5-56&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-harm]] in autistic females.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, I. L., Tsiouris, J. A., Flory, M. J., Kim, S.-Y., Freedland, R., Heaney, G., … Brown, W. T. (2010).

J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 599–609.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female protective effect hypothesis==
According to the female protective effect hypothesis, more extreme genetic mutations are required for a girl to develop autism than for a boy. In 2012, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] researchers published findings suggesting that, on average, more genetic and environmental risk factors are required for girls to develop autism, compared to boys. The researchers analyzed DNA samples of nearly 800 families affected by autism and nearly 16,000 individuals with a variety of [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s. They looked for various types of [[Mutation|gene mutations]]. Overall, they found that females diagnosed with autism or another neurodevelopmental disorder had a greater number of harmful mutations throughout the [[genome]] than did males with the same disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquemont, S., Coe, B., Hersch, M., Duyzend, M., Krumm, N., Bergmann, S., Beckmann, J., Rosenfeld, J., Eichler, E. (2014) A Higher Mutational Burden in Females Supports a “Female Protective Model” in Neurodevelopmental Disorders. The American Society of Human Genetics, http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(14)00059-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality and gender variance==
[[Sexuality]] is often discussed within the autistic community, with many observations that identities other than [[Cisgender|cis]]-[[Heterosexuality|hetero]] seem to be more common than is observed in the [[neurotypical]] population. There have not been many formal studies on this to date, however members of the community speculate that autistic individuals generally have different ideals, perceptions, and desires than neurotypicals, or simply do not comprehend or agree with society's expectation, making them more apt to diverge from the norm.

===Gender identity===
A study looking at the co-occurrence of ASD in patients with [[gender dysphoria]] found 7.8% of patients to be on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, A. L. C., Noens, I. L. J., Cohen-Kettenis, P. T., van Berckelaer-Onnes, I. A., &amp; Doreleijers, T. A. (2010). Autism Spectrum Disorders in Gender Dysphoric Children and Adolescents. J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 930–936. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-010-0935-9&lt;/ref&gt; This is much higher than the estimated 1% of people with ASD in the general population, suggesting a link between autism and gender variance.

As of yet, there have been no studies specifically addressing the occurrence of autism in [[intersex]] individuals, and this is an area that requires further research.

=== Sexual satisfaction ===
A study conducted by Byers and Nichols (2014), explored the level of sexual satisfaction of [[High-functioning autism|high functioning autistic individuals]], with researchers testing the sexual and relationship satisfaction of neurotypical versus high functioning autistic individuals. The results suggest that men with ASD are generally less satisfied with their relationship or marriage compared to neurotypical men and women, and women with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sexual Satisfaction of High-Functioning Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder|last = Byers|first = E|date = 2014|journal = Sexuality and Disability Sex|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis ==
Some authors, clinicians and experts like [[Judith Gould (psychologist)|Judith Gould]], [[Tony Attwood]], [[Lorna Wing]] and [[Christopher Gillberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/gender.aspx |title=Gender and autism |publisher=The National Autistic Society |date= |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that autism in females may be underdiagnosed due to better natural superficial [[Imitation|social mimicry]] skills in females, partially different set of symptoms and less knowledge about autism in females among experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwood|first1=Tony|title=Asperger's and Girls|date=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1932565409|pages=2–6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Foreword|preword]] to the book ''Asperger's and Girls'', Tony Attwood writes: "These tentative explanations for the apparent underrepresentation of girls with Asperger's Syndrome have yet to be examined by objective research studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwood|first1=Tony|title=Asperger's and Girls|date=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1932565409|page=6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically Judith Gould has discussed the idea that a pervasive developmental disorder called [[pathological demand avoidance]], which is not officially included in [[Psychiatry#Diagnostic manuals|diagnostic manuals]] may offer a glimpse about how autism in females may present in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shiggs55.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pda-conference-plenary-session-jacqui-smith-and-judy-gould.pdf |title=Missed Diagnosis or Misdiagnosis?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">'''Steklov Institute of Mathematics''' or '''Steklov Mathematical Institute''' ({{lang-ru|Математический институт имени В.А.Стеклова}}) is a premier research institute based in [[Moscow]], specialized in [[mathematics]], and a part of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The institute is named after [[Vladimir Andreevich Steklov]], who in 1919 founded the Institute of Physics and Mathematics in  [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. In 1934, this institute was split into separate parts for physics and mathematics, and the mathematical part became the Steklov Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|first=Yakov|last=Sinai|authorlink=Yakov Sinai|publisher=World Scientific|year=2003|isbn=9789812383853|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC&amp;pg=PA38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it was moved to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, pp. 530 and 697.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first director of the Steklov Institute was [[Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sinai|2003}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961-1964, the institute's director was the notable mathematician [[Sergei Chernikov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ershov|first1=Y.L. et al.|title=Sergei Nikolaevich Chernikov (obituary)|journal=Russian Math. Surveys|date=1988|volume=43|issue=2|pages=153–155|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/RM1988v043n02ABEH001714/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old building of the Institute in Leningrad became its Department in Leningrad. Today, that department has become a separate institute, called the ''[[St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences]]'' or '''PDMI RAS''', located in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The name ''St. Petersburg Department'' is misleading, however, because the St. Petersburg Department is now an independent institute. In 1966, the Moscow-based [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] (Russian: Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша) split off from the Steklov Institute.

'''Testability''', a property applying to an [[empirical]] [[hypothesis]], involves two components:
#The logical property that is variously described as [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]], [[defeasibility]], or [[falsifiability]], which means that [[counterexample]]s to the hypothesis are logically possible.
#The [[practical]] feasibility of observing a [[reproducibility|reproducible]] series of such counterexamples if they do exist. 
In short, a [[hypothesis]] is testable if there is some real hope of deciding whether it is true or false of real experience. Upon this property of its constituent hypotheses rests the ability to decide whether a [[theory]] can be supported or falsified by the data of actual experience. If hypotheses are tested, initial results may also be labeled inconclusive.

'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion''''' (retitled '''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by the Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]]. ''The Golden Bough'' was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). The influence of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] and thought was substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Karbiener, K. &amp; Stade, G., |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume =2|publisher= Infobase Publishing|date= 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA189#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]''—an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or [[pomegranate]] to the new king, who must kill the old king - Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully]]

Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]], and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamel, Frazer (Editor)|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] and periodic [[sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]]. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Frazer's thesis was developed in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of [[Nemi]], "[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s Mirror", where religious ceremonies and the "fulfillment of vows" of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic marriage to a [[goddess]] of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:fane|fane]] of [[Rex Nemorensis|Nemi]], who was ritually murdered by his successor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (''Aftermath'', p. vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by Turner, in which [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' that while he had never studied [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his friend James Ward, and the philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of "the nature and historical relations of magic and religion". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that "we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection." Frazer included an extract from Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frazer, James George |title=The Golden Bough.

==Critical reception==
''The Golden Bough'' scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of [[Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection]] in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] in a speculative appendix; the discussion of [[Christianity]] was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leach, Edmund R. |url= http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |title= Kingship and divinity: The unpublished Frazer Lecture |location= Oxford |origyear= 28 October 1982 |journal= ''HAU: ''Journal of Ethnographic Theory ''1.1'' |date= 2011 |pages= 279–298 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922093723/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |archivedate= 22 September 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Jonathan Z. |title= When the bough breaks |work= History of Religions ''12.4'' |date=1973 |pages= 342–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=E.C.|last=Cawte|page=38|chapter=It's an Ancient Custom—But How Ancient?|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R. Angus|last=Downie|title=Frazer and the Golden Bough|location=London|publisher=Victor Gallancz|page=112|isbn=978-0-575-00486-3|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, at the inauguration of the [[Frazer Lecture|Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology]], he said: "It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists "had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" while they now dissociate themselves "from much that he wrote." While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as "little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism", while 
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], in his ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'' (1979), wrote: "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Initially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Hays &amp; L.L. Langness (Editor) |title= From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology |pages= 75, 314 |work= The Study of Culture |location= Corte Madera |publisher= Chandler &amp; Sharp |date= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas "began to belong to the past": {{Quote|In 1922, simultaneously with the publication of the first abridged edition of ''The Golden Bough'', came Malinowski's ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' and Radcliffe-Brown's ''The Andaman Islanders'', the first outstanding products of the British field research tradition that Frazer had very actively encouraged. As every first-year student knows, these monographs began to point students towards empirical studies of Frazer's 'savages', who, when spoken to in their own homes and languages, were found to have much more of interest to say for themselves than Frazer had to say about them. The central theme (or, as he thought, theory) of ''The Golden Bough''—that all mankind had evolved intellectually and psychologically from a superstitious belief in magicians, through a superstitious belief in priests and gods, to enlightened belief in scientists—had little or no relevance to the conduct of life in an Andamanese camp or a Melanesian village, and the whole, supposedly scientific, basis of Frazer's anthropology was seen as a misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;}}

[[Edmund Leach]], "one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect", was scathing of the [[artistic license]] exercised by Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'', saying: "Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to ''illustrate'' propositions which he had arrived at in advance by ''a priori'' reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!"&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

[[René Girard]], a French historian, literary critic, and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]], "grudgingly" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as "a key primitive ritual", but described his interpretation of the ritual as "a grave injustice to ethnology."&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence|journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]|first=Robert A.|last=Segal|pages=4–25|issue=1|volume=37|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scapegoat|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1986|page=120|isbn=978-0-801-83315-1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girard's "grievances" against ''The Golden Bough'' were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the [[New Testament]] Gospels were "just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be "revelatory texts" rather than myths or the remains of "ignorant superstition", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, "whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Girard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1978|page=180|isbn=978-0-804-72215-5|publisher=Athlone Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948). [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem "[[Sailing to Byzantium]]". The horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s understanding of religion was influenced by ''The Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joshi, S. T. |title=H. P. Lovecraft: A Life |publisher=Necronomicon Press |location=West Warwick |year=1996 |page=209 |isbn=0-940884-88-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lovecraft, H.

[[William Carlos Williams]] refers to ''The Golden Bough'' in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PatersonWCW|title=Paterson - William Carlos Williams|first=|last=William Carlos Williams|date=5 May 1963|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Bough'' influenced [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; the novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt; [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt;

The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] drew on ''The Golden Bough'' in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, California |year=2008 |pages=330 |isbn=978-1-57731-593-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later described Frazer's work as "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=164 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Weston La Barre]], writing in ''[[The Human Animal (book)|The Human Animal]]'' (1955), described Frazer as "the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]" and wrote that Frazer's work was "an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the musician [[Jim Morrison]]'s song "[[Not to Touch the Earth]]" were influenced by the table of contents of ''The Golden Bough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hopkins, Jerry |author2=Sugarman, Danny |title=No One Here Gets Out Alive |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=978-0446602280 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s commentaries on ''The Golden Bough'' have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|title=Phil.uni-passau.de|author=|date=|website=uni-passau.de|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202203/http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman, in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists'' (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]]. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has cited ''The Golden Bough'' as one of the most important influences on her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination." Paglia acknowledged that "many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology "will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 | title= Pelosi’s victory for women | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171608/http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | archivedate= 1 May 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of ''The Golden Bough'' is "bland" and should be "avoided like the plague."&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | date= 10 March 1999 | title= In defense of "The Golden Bough" | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 28 April 2017 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072038/http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | archivedate= 12 May 2016 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Yehuda Liebes was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; His father, [[:he:יוסף גרהרד ליבס|Joseph Gerhard Liebes]] (1910–1988), a noted Hebrew translator of classic literature, left his native Germany at the age of 18 to study at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He returned to his homeland to continue his education, but was expelled from his university due to the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. He then undertook agricultural training in [[Latvia]] with a Zionist movement. There he married his first wife, with whom he settled in [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Pardes Hanna]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and had two daughters before they divorced. In 1941 Liebes married his second wife, Mira, a native of [[Riga]] who had grown up in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1250272|title=דמותו של פרופ' יהודה ליבס: חוקר קבלה שנוי במחלוקת ודתי ציוני|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Professor Yehuda Liebes: A Controversial Kabbalah Scholar and Religious Zionist|first=Dalia|last=Karpal|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, a daughter (Tamar, today head of the Department of Communications at Hebrew University) and a son (Yehuda).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; On his mother's side, Yehuda was a cousin of Israeli intellectual [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; 

Liebes was acquainted with [[Gershom Scholem]], the father of modern Kabbalah scholarship, from an early age, as his parents were friends of Scholem. Scholem attended Yehuda's [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] and gave him as a gift [[:he:ישעיה תשבי|Yeshayahu Tishby]]'s book ''Mishnat HaZohar'' ("The Wisdom of the [[Zohar]]").&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt;

 |quote=I do not really like the term 'Jewish mysticism'. The order of the words is not correct. You have to say 'mystical Judaism', because Kabbalah is first and foremost an interpretation of an aspect of the Jewish religion. … The inclusion of all mystical phenomena under the heading 'mysticism' is a mistake, because it causes people to think everything is the same—Christian mysticism, Jewish mysticism, Muslim mysticism. The Kabbalah is an interpretation of the Jewish religion, of [[Torah]] and [[Mitzva|mitzvot]], of the people and the land of Israel".

==Controversial views==
Challenging the traditional ascription of the Zohar to the 2nd-century disciples of [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Israel]], Liebes asserts that a group of 13th-century Spanish Kabbalists, which included [[Moses de León]], composed the work, each reflecting his own approach to Kabbalah.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; Liebes claims that the ''Ketem Paz'' on the Zohar and the Kabbalistic hymn ''[[Bar Yochai (song)|Bar Yochai]]'' were written by two different authors with similar names, not the one [[Shimon Lavi]] who is traditionally credited with authoring both works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nlis/he/Song/pages/Articles/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8_%D7%A8'_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90.aspx |title= ר' שמעון לביא |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Rabbi Shimon Lavi|publisher=[[National Library of Israel]]|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebes also finds Christian and Sabbatean inspiration in the ideas of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]]&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; and, at the same time, Sabbatean influences on the disciples of the Vilna Gaon [[Misnagdim|who opposed Hasidism]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes angered [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] Jews in Israel when he claimed to find a Christian allusion in the [[Amidah]], the central prayer of the [[Jewish prayer|Jewish liturgy]]. Liebes asserted that the conclusion of the 14th blessing, "''keren yeshua''" ("horn of salvation") refers not to [[David]], but to [[Jesus]] (''Yeshua'' in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes publishes in Hebrew and has expressed opposition to the study of Jewish thought in English. He has allowed only a few of his works to be translated into English, in conjunction with his academic degree and tenure.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Liebes received the 1997 [[Bialik Prize]] for his book ''The Secret of the Sabbatean Faith'' (1995).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; In 1999 he received the Peace Prize for the study of Kabbalah&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; and the Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academy.ac.il/RichText/GeneralPage.aspx?nodeId=1079|title=Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research|publisher=[[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2006 [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture| EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], in the category of Humanities, for his work on Sabbateanism.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.emetprize.org/laureates/humanities/jewish-philosophy/prof-yehuda-liebes/|title=Emet Prize Laureates|publisher=Emet Prize for Science, Art and Culture|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he received the [[Israel Prize]] for his work on Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/380233|title=Israel Prize for Kaballah to Professor Yehuda Liebes|date=5 February 2017|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=[[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
