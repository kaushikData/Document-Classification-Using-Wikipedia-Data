An '''acronym''' is a [[word]] or name formed as an [[abbreviation]] from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in ''[[NATO]]'' or ''[[laser]]'') and sometimes syllables (as in ''[[Benelux]]'').

There are no universal standards for the [[#Nomenclature|multiple names for such abbreviations]] or for their [[#Orthographic styling|orthographic styling]]. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of [[word formation]] process, and they are viewed as a subtype of [[Blend word|blend]]ing.

==Nomenclature==

Whereas an [[abbreviation]] may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, ''Rd'' for ''road'' or ''Dr'' for ''[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]''), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as ''[[sonar]]'', created from ''{{uu|so}}und {{uu|na}}vigation and {{uu|r}}anging''). Attestations for ''{{lang|de|Akronym}}'' in German are known from 1921, and for ''acronym'' in English from 1940.&lt;ref name="Paris_Gazette_and_Brockhaus_Handbuch"&gt;
Paris Gazette, by Lion Feuchtwanger; translated (from Exil) by Willa and Edwin Muir, New York, Viking Press, 1940. Chapter 47, Beasts of Prey, pp.{{nbsp}}665–66:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His first glance at the ''Paris German News'' told Wiesener that this new paper was nothing like the old ''P.G.''. "They can call it the ''P.G.N.'' if they like", he thought, "but that's the only difference. Pee-gee-enn; what's the word for words like that, made out of initials? My memory is beginning to fail me. Just the other day there was a technical expression I couldn't remember. I must be growing old. "''P.G.'' or ''P.G.N.'', it's six of one and half a dozen of the other.... Pee-gee-enn. It's an acronym, that's what it is. That's what they call words made up of initials. So I remember it after all; that's at least something.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For "Akronym" used in 1921 or 1922, giving an example of "Agfa" film: Brockhaus Handbuch des Wissens in vier Bänden. Leipzig, F. A. Brockhaus, [1922–23, c1921–23] v.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Initialisms}}Although the word ''acronym'' is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters,&lt;ref name="MWDEU"&gt;Merriam-Webster, Inc. ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-87779-132-5}}. pp. 21–22:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''acronyms'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A number of commentators (as Copperud 1970, Janis 1984, Howard 1984) believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The powder metallurgy industry has officially adopted the acronym 'P/M Parts'"—''Precision Metal Molding'', January 1966.&lt;br /&gt;"Users of the term ''acronym'' make no distinction between those pronounced as words ... and those pronounced as a series of characters" —Jean Praninskas, ''Trade Name Creation'', 1968.&lt;br /&gt;"It is not J.C.B.'s fault that its name, let alone its acronym, is not a household word among European scholars"—''Times Literary Supp.'' 5 February 1970.&lt;br /&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the confusion in the Pentagon about abbreviations and acronyms—words formed from the first letters of other words"—Bernard Weinraub, ''N.Y. Times'', 11 December 1978. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Pyles &amp; Algeo 1970 divide acronyms into "initialisms", which consists of initial letters pronounced with the letter names, and "word acronyms", which are pronounced as words. ''Initialism'', an older word than ''acronym'', seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with ''acronym'' in a narrow sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; some dictionaries and usage commentators define ''acronym'' to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word,{{refn|&lt;ref name = "Oxford"&gt;"acronym". ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' (1991), Oxford University Press. p. 12: "a word, usu[ally] pronounced as such, formed from the initial letters of other words (e.g. ''Ernie'', ''laser'', ''Nato'')".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;"acronym" [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=acronym*1+0&amp;dict=A "Cambridge Dictionary of American English"], accessed October 5, 2008: "a word created from the first letters of each word in a series of words."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahdictionary.com"&gt;"acronym" [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=acronym "The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language"], accessed August 13, 2015: "1.

The distinguishing feature of an acronym is that it is pronounced as if it were a single word, in the manner of NATO and NASA. Acronyms are often distinguished from initialisms like FBI and NIH, whose individual letters are pronounced as separate syllables.

The distinction is not well-maintained. According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'':&lt;ref name="MWDEU" /&gt; "A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... ''Initialism'', an older word than ''acronym'', seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with ''acronym'' in a narrow sense."  About the use of ''acronym'' to only mean those pronounced as words, ''Fowler's Modern English Usage'' (3rd ed.) states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fowler's Modern English Usage |edition=Third Revised |editor-first=R.

Thus ''EC'' (European Community), ''FBI'' (Federal Bureau of Investigation), and ''VCR'' (videocassette recorder). Such terms are also called ''initialisms''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, ''acronym'' is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called ''initialisms''."

A clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles &amp; Algeo (1970),&lt;ref name="MWDEU" /&gt; who divided ''acronyms'' as a general category into ''word acronyms'' pronounced as words, and ''initialisms'' sounded out as letters.&lt;!--Better to obtain and cite the original source rather than MW's summary of it, but it's good enough for now per [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT]].--&gt;

There is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as ''[[JPEG]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|p|ɛ|ɡ}} and ''[[MS-DOS]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|m|ɛ|s|ˈ|d|ɒ|s}}.  There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms ''[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]'' and ''[[Individual Retirement Account|IRA]]'' can be pronounced as individual letters: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|juː|ˌ|ɑːr|ˈ|ɛ|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|ˌ|ɑːr|ˈ|eɪ}}, respectively; or as a single word: {{IPAc-en|ɜːr|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|r|ə}}, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Historical and current use==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Acronymy, like [[retronym]]y, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no [[Metalanguage|naming]], conscious attention, or [[Linguistics|systematic analysis]] until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.

Ancient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was [[metalanguage]] at the time to describe it) include the following:
* Acronyms were used in Rome before the Christian era. For example, the official name for the Roman Empire, and the Republic before it, was abbreviated as ''[[SPQR]]'' (''{{lang|la|Senatus Populusque Romanus}}''). Inscriptions dating from antiquity, both on stone and on coins, use a lot of abbreviations and acronyms to save room and work. For example, [[praenomen|Roman first names]], of which there was only a small set, were almost always abbreviated. Common terms were abbreviated too, such as writing just "F" for ''{{lang|la|filius}}'', meaning "son of", a very common part of memorial inscriptions mentioning people. Grammatical markers were abbreviated or left out entirely if they could be inferred from the rest of the text.
* So-called ''{{lang|la|[[nomina sacra]]}}'' were used in many Greek biblical manuscripts. The common words "God" ({{lang|grc|Θεός}}), "Jesus" ({{lang|grc|Ιησούς}}), "Christ" ({{lang|grc|Χριστός}}), and some others, would be abbreviated by their first and last letters, marked with an overline. This was just one of many kinds of conventional scribal abbreviation, used to reduce the time-consuming workload of the scribe and save on valuable writing materials. The same convention is still commonly used in the inscriptions on religious [[icon]]s and the stamps used to mark the eucharistic bread in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]].
* The early Christians in Rome, most of whom were Greek rather than Latin speakers, used the image of a fish as a symbol for [[Jesus]] in part because of an acronym—''fish'' in Greek is ''{{transl|grc|[[ichthys]]}}'' ({{lang|grc|ΙΧΘΥΣ}}), which was said to stand for {{lang|grc|Ἰησοῦς Χριστός Θεοῦ Υἱός Σωτήρ}} (''{{transl|grc|Iesous CHristos THeou hUios Soter}}'': "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior"). This interpretation dates from the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is preserved in the [[catacombs]] of Rome. And for centuries, the Church has used the inscription ''[[INRI]]'' over the crucifix, which stands for the Latin ''{{lang|la|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum}}'' ("Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews").
* The Hebrew language has a long history of formation of acronyms pronounced as words, stretching back many centuries. The Hebrew Bible ("Old Testament") is known as "[[Tanakh]]", an acronym composed from the Hebrew initial letters of its three major sections: [[Torah]] (five books of Moses), [[Nevi'im]] (prophets), and [[K'tuvim]] (writings). Many rabbinical figures from the Middle Ages onward are referred to in rabbinical literature by their pronounced acronyms, such as [[Maimonides|Rambam]] and [[Rashi]] from the initial letters of their full Hebrew names: Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon and Rabbi Shlomo Yitzkhaki.

During the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating [[corporation]] names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of [[railroad car]]s (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&amp;P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on [[ticker tape]] and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&amp;T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include [[Nabisco]] (National Biscuit Company),&lt;ref name=Davenport/&gt; [[Esso]] (from S.O., from [[Standard Oil]]), and [[Sunoco]] (Sun Oil Company).

Another driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the [[American Civil War]] (acronyms such as [[Army of Northern Virginia|ANV]] for "Army of Northern Virginia" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in [[World War I]] and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/baloney.php|title=Baloney|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves were referred to as [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s.

The widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') records the first printed use of the word ''initialism'' as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after ''acronym'' had become common.

By 1943, the term ''acronym'' had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words.&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;B. Davenport ''American Notes and Queries'' (February 1943) vol 2 page 167 "Your correspondent who asks about words made up of the initial letters or syllables of other words may be interested in knowing that I have seen such words called by the name ''acronym'', which is useful and clear to anyone who knows a little Greek."&lt;/ref&gt; (It was formed from the Greek words {{lang|grc|ἄκρος}}, ''{{transl|grc|akros}}'', "topmost, extreme" and {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}}, ''{{transl|grc|onoma}}'', "name.") For example, the army offense of being ''absent without official leave'' was abbreviated to "[[Desertion|A.W.O.L.]]" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (''awol''), it became an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;S. V. Baum (1962) ''American Speech'' Vol. 37 No. 1, The Acronym, Pure and Impure&lt;/ref&gt; While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was "a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words",&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' (1943) Vol. 18, No. 2, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[UNIVAC I|UNIVAC]] from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' (1950) Vol. 25 No. 2 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, acronyms ''pronounced as words'' may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in ''Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends'' claims that "forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is ''colinderies'' or ''colinda'', an acronym for the [[Colonial and Indian Exposition]] held in London in that year."&lt;ref name="Wilton"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cp0r3aa8EM8C&amp;dq=Word+Myths:+Debunking+Linguistic+Urban+Legends&amp;pg=PP1#PPA79,M1 |title=Word myths: debunking linguistic urban legends|publisher=|date= |author=Wilton, David|accessdate=September 16, 2010|isbn=978-0-19-517284-3|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/acronyms.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Language (Acronyms) |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although acronymic words seem not to have been ''employed in general vocabulary'' before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the ''concept of their formation'' is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, "[[How to Write a Blackwood Article]]", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.

===Early examples in English===
The use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in [[vernacular]]s has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:

*''[[12-hour clock|A.M.]]'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|ante meridiem}}'', "before noon") and ''[[12-hour clock|P.M.]]'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|post meridiem}}'', "after noon")
*''A.D.'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Anno Domini]]}}'', "in the year of our Lord"), whose complement in English, ''B.C.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Before Christ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is English-sourced
*''[[Okay|O.K.]]'', a term of disputed origin, dating back at least to the early 19th century, now used around the world

The earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|''OED'']] is "abjud" (now "[[abjad]]"), formed from the original first four letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=abjad, ''n.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/271930 |title=Oxford English Dictionary }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[acrostics]] predate this, however, such as the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] witticism arranging the names of some members of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the [[Cabal ministry|"CABAL" ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=cabal, ''n.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25693 |title=Oxford English Dictionary }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current use===
Acronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The [[Military|armed forces]] and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the "[[alphabet agencies]]" (also jokingly referred to as "[[alphabet soup (linguistics)|alphabet soup]]") created by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (also of course known as FDR) under the [[New Deal]]. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for ''commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific''; it's also seen as "ComCruDesPac". "YABA-compatible" (where YABA stands for "yet another bloody acronym") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., "When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'."&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Nilsen &amp; A. P. Nilsen (1995) ''The English Journal'' Vol. 84, No. 6.,"Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language"&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as "GF" (girlfriend), "LOL" (laughing out loud), and "DL" (download or down low) have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8|Txtng: The Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivist]]s disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use "pure" or "proper" English.  Others point out that [[language change]] has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in "proper" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper [[column inch]]es).

====Aids to learning the expansion without leaving a document====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
In formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a [[common noun]] such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a [[proper noun]] such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at [[#Casing of expansions|Case &gt; Casing of expansions]]).

In addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).

Expansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as [[tooltip]]s, [[hyperlink]]s, and rapid search via [[search engine technology]].

====Jargon====
Acronyms often occur in [[jargon]]. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.

The medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.
&lt;ref name="PMID19150279"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Patel CB, Rashid RM |title=Averting the proliferation of acronymophilia in dermatology: effectively avoiding ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=340–4 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19150279 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.10.035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As mnemonics====
Acronyms are often taught as [[mnemonic]] devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are [[ROY G. BIV]] (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: [[GUMPS]], which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include [[CAN SLIM]], and [[PAVPANIC]] as well as [[PEMDAS]].

====Acronyms as legendary etymology====
{{See also|Backronym}}

It is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of [[false etymology]], called a ''folk etymology'', for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in [[historical linguistics]], and are examples of language-related [[urban legend]]s. For example, ''[[police officer|cop]]'' is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from "constable on patrol,"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/cop.asp Snopes article].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Posh (nautical term)|posh]]'' from "[[Port Outward, Starboard Home|port out, starboard home]]".&lt;ref name="posh"&gt;
{{Cite book|title=Port Out, Starboard Home: And Other Language Myths|publisher=Penguin Books|last=Quinion|first=Michael|isbn=0-14-101223-4|year=2005}}; published in the US as
{{Cite book|title=Ballyhoo, Buckaroo, and Spuds|last=Quinion|first=Michael|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-085153-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With some of these specious expansions, the "belief" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been [[tongue-in-cheek]] among many citers, as with "gentlemen only, ladies forbidden" for ''[[golf]]'', although many other (more [[wikt:credulous|credulous]]) people have uncritically taken it for fact.&lt;ref name="posh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/golf.asp |title=See article at Snopes |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taboo word]]s in particular commonly have such false etymologies: ''[[shit]]'' from "ship/store high in transit"&lt;ref name="Wilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/baloney.php |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "special high-intensity training" and ''[[fuck]]'' from "for unlawful carnal knowledge", or "fornication under consent/command of the king".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com2"/&gt;

==Orthographic styling==

===Punctuation===

====Showing the ellipsis of letters====
In English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a [[full stop|full stop/period/point]] in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and [[apostrophe]] have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. "A.&amp;nbsp;D."). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: ''initialism''. " Globe &amp; Mail (Toronto)  22 May 10/4   Americanization has also largely done away with periods in acronyms and initialisms."&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ellipsis-is-understood style=====
Some influential [[style guide]]s, such as that of the [[BBC]], no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of ''The [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] Guide to Punctuation'', states categorically that, in [[British English]], "this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node28.html |title=Abbreviations |publisher=Informatics.susx.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070410113359/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node28.html| archivedate=April 10, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pronunciation-dependent style and periods=====
Nevertheless, some influential [[style guide]]s, many of them [[American English|American]], still require periods in certain instances. For example, [[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage|The New York Times' guide]] recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in ''[[KGB|K.G.B.]]'', but not when pronounced as a word, as in ''[[NATO]]''.&lt;ref name = "NY Times"&gt;
{{Cite news

|title=Secret Obsessions at the Top
|first=Nicholas D.
|last=Kristoff
|work=The New York Times
|date=February 7, 2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.

=====Other conventions=====
When a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. ''TV'', for example, may stand for a ''single'' word (''television'' or ''transvestite'', for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although ''PS'' stands for the single word ''postscript'' (or the Latin ''postscriptum''), it is often spelled with periods (''P.S.'').

The [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] ('/', or ''solidus'') is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in ''N/A'' (''not applicable, not available''), ''c/o'' (''care of'') and ''w/o'' (''without'').

Inconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, ''i18n'' abbreviates ''[[internationalization]]'', a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The ''18'' represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in ''internationalization''. ''Localization'' can be abbreviated ''l10n'', ''[[multilingualization]]'' ''m17n'', and ''[[accessibility]]'' ''a11y''. In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general "x" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include ''Crxn'' for ''crystallization'' and the series familiar to physicians for [[medical history|history]], [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], and [[therapy|treatment]] (''hx'', ''dx'', ''tx'').

====Representing plurals and possessives====

There is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, [[Kate Turabian]], writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s". The [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so "compact discs" would be "CDs" or "C.D.s"), whereas ''[[The New York Times]]'' style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's").&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, ''the C.D.'s' labels'' (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is ''S'', as in ''SOS's'' (although abbreviations ending with S can also take ''-es'', e.g. ''SOSes''), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar96.htm |title=Writer's Block&amp;nbsp;– Writing Tips&amp;nbsp;– Plural and Possessive Abbreviations |publisher=Writersblock.ca |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726124408/http://www.writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar96.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert |url=http://www.editfast.com/english/grammar/apostrophes/apostrophe_plurals.htm |title=EditFast Grammar Resource: Apostrophes: Forming Plurals |publisher=Editfast.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027001351/http://editfast.com/english/grammar/apostrophes/apostrophe_plurals.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is ''Member of Parliament'', which in plural is ''Members of Parliament''. It is possible then to abbreviate this as ''M's P.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an41354070 |title=Libraries Australia&amp;nbsp;– T.H.

The argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, "If ''D'' can stand for ''disc'', it can also stand for ''disc'''s'''''") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, ''U.S.'' is short for ''United State'''s''''', but not ''United State''. In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final ''s'' may seem awkward: for example, ''U.S.'', ''U.S.'s'', etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple [[adjective|attributive]] usage (for example, ''the '''U.S.''' economy'') or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and ''then'' making the possessive (for example, ''the '''United States'''' economy''). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation ''United States's'' sometimes is used.

Abbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as ''TV'' (''television'')—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (''two TVs''); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (''the TV's antenna'').

{{anchor|pp|PP|pP|Pp|page|pages}} In some languages, the convention of doubling the letters in the acronym is used to indicate plural words: for example, the Spanish ''{{lang|es|EE. UU.}}'', for ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos}}'' ('United States'). This old convention is still followed for a limited number of English abbreviations, such as ''SS.'' for "Saints", ''pp.'' for the Latin plural of "pages", ''{{lang|la|paginae}}'', or ''MSS'' for "manuscripts". In the case of ''pp.'' it derives from the original Latin phrase per procurationem meaning 'through the agency of';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pp Definition|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pp|website=en.oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English translation alternative is ''particular pages'' in a book or document: see pp. 8–88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|title=Cambridge Dictionary - English Dictionary, Translations &amp; Thesaurus|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case===

====All-caps style====
The most common [[capitalization]] scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase ([[All caps|all-caps]]), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words ''[[scuba set|scuba]]'', ''[[laser]]'', and ''[[radar]]''—these are known as ''anacronyms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anacronyms (note well ''-acro-'') should not be [[homophone|homophonously]] confused with [[misnomer#Anachronym|anachronyms (note well ''-chron-''), which are a type of misnomer]].

=====Small-caps variant=====
[[Small caps]] are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}; thus "U.S." and "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]]" in normal caps, but "{{smallcaps|nato}}" in small caps. The acronyms "[[Anno Domini|AD]]" and "[[Before Christ|BC]]" are often smallcapped as well, as in: "From {{nowrap|4004 {{smallcaps|bc}} to {{smallcaps|ad}} 525}}".

=====Mixed-case variant=====
Words derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, ''pre-WWII politics'', ''post-NATO world'', ''[[DNAase]]''. In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, [[messenger RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]] become mRNA and tRNA.

====Pronunciation-dependent style and case====
Some publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms "Nato" and "Aids" in mixed case, but the initialisms "USA" and "FBI" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide |title=Styleguide |publisher=Guardian.co.uk | location=London | date=December 19, 2008 |quote=Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as [[AWOL|awol]], [[laser]] and, more recently, [[asbo]], [[pin number]] and [[sim card]]. Note that [[pdf]] and [[public limited company|plc]] are lowercase.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC News]] typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/newsstyleguide.pdf |title=BBC News Style Guide |publisher=bbc.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214856/http://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/newsStyleGuide.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.

Some style manuals also base the letters' [[Letter case|case]] on their number. ''The New York Times'', for example, keeps ''NATO'' in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it ''Nato''), but uses lower case in ''[[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]'' (from "United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of "shouting capitals").

===Numerals and constituent words===
While abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short [[function word]]s (such as "and", "or", "of", or "to"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in [[Letter case#Headings and publication titles|headers and publication titles]].) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE ([[Congress of Racial Equality]]). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL ([[Transport for London]]) and ''LotR'' (''[[Lord of the Rings]]''); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.

Numbers (both [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[Ordinal number|ordinal]]) in names are often represented by [[numerical digit|digit]]s rather than initial letters: as in ''4GL'' ([[Fourth generation language]]) or ''G77'' ([[Group of 77]]). Large numbers may use [[SI prefix#Use outside SI|metric prefixes]], as with ''[[Y2K]]'' for "Year 2000" (sometimes written ''Y2k'', because the SI symbol for 1000 is ''k''—not ''K'', which stands for ''[[kelvin]]''). Exceptions using initials for numbers include ''[[three letter acronym|TLA]]'' (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and ''GoF'' ([[Gang of Four (software)|Gang of Four]]). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as ''[[W3C]]'' ("World Wide Web Consortium") and ''[[WVOX#Notable Past Programming|T3]]'' (''Trends, Tips &amp; Tools for Everyday Living''); pronunciation, such as ''[[Business-to-business|B2B]]'' ("business to business"); and [[numeronym]]s, such as ''i18n'' ("internationalization"; ''18'' represents the 18 letters between the initial ''i'' and the final ''n'').

===Casing of expansions===
Although many authors of [[expository writing]] show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of [[English orthography]], which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for [[proper noun]]s. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- the only citation is to the AMA Manual of Style; what do other style guides say? --&gt; [[Case folding|case-fold]] such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography.  Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} For example,
"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)" or "the onset of '''c'''ongestive '''h'''eart '''f'''ailure (CHF)" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as "the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)" in the final published article when following the [[AMA Manual of Style]].&lt;ref name="AMA10p442"&gt;{{Citation |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |page=442 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to (or word play on) the expanded meaning==
===Pseudo-acronyms=== &lt;!-- [[Pseudo-acronym]] and [[Orphan initialism]] are redirects to this section --&gt;
Some apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such '''pseudo-acronyms''' may be pronunciation-based, such as [[BBQ]] (bee-bee-cue), for "barbecue", or [[K9 (disambiguation)|K9]] (kay-nine) for "canine". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as "'''orphan initialisms'''"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning.&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003555.html|title=Language Log: Orphan initialisms|website=itre.cis.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/06/02/what-does-bp-stand-for.htm What Does "BP" Stand For?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118220424/http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/06/02/what-does-bp-stand-for.htm |date=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters of the [[SAT]], a US college entrance test originally dubbed "Scholastic Aptitude Test", no longer officially stand for anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/us/insisting-it-s-nothing-creator-says-sat-not-sat.html  |title=Insisting It's Nothing, Creator Says SAT, Not S.A.T. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 2, 1997 |last=Applebome |first=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Changes to SAT Make Test More Coachable |last=Komarek |first=Dan |newspaper=Daily Californian| date=July 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is common with companies that want to retain [[brand recognition]] while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]],&lt;ref name=upenn /&gt; [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] became [[KFC]] to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n8_v25/ai_10403447 |title=KFC shuns 'fried' image with new name&amp;nbsp;– Kentucky Fried Chicken has changed its name to KFC |author=Peter O. Keegan |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=February 21, 1991 |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This change was also applied to other languages, with ''Poulet Frit Kentucky'' becoming ''PFK'' in French Canada.}} and [[BP|British Petroleum]] became BP.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=287|title=BP plc History|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia Today]] has rebranded itself as [[RT (TV network)|RT]]. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Pseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets:{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} for example, some national [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]]s of [[International Business Machines]] are legally incorporated as "IBM" (for example, "IBM Canada") to avoid translating the full name into local languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Likewise, "[[UBS AG|UBS]]" is the name of the merged [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] and [[Swiss Bank Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2833426/UBS-means-RIP-for-Warburg.html UBS means RIP for Warburg]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', November 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and  "[[HSBC]]" has replaced "The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation." Sometimes,{{when|date=October 2017}} companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as [[TD Canada Trust|TD Bank]],{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} just as [[Royal Bank of Canada]] used its full name in Canada (a [[constitutional monarchy]]), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called [[RBC Bank]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Redundant acronyms and RAS syndrome===
{{Main|RAS syndrome}}
Rebranding can lead to [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym syndrome]],{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} as when [[Trustee Savings Bank]] became TSB Bank,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} or when [[Railway Express Agency]] became REA Express.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} A few{{vague|date=October 2017}} [[high-tech]] companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme{{according to whom|date=October 2017}}: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Examples in entertainment include the television shows ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|Navy: NCIS]]''{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ("Navy" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely{{weasel inline|date=October 2017}} designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The same reasoning{{according to whom|date=November 2017}} was in evidence when the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]'s Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} or when [[Bank of Montreal]] rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Another common example{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} is "[[Random-access memory|RAM]] memory", which is redundant because "RAM" ("random-access memory") includes the initial of the word "memory".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} "PIN" stands for "personal identification number", obviating the second word in "[[PIN number]]"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word "pin".{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} Other examples include "[[Automated teller machine|ATM]] machine," "[[EAB bank]]," "[[Cable Ace|CableACE Award]]," "[[DC Comics]]," "[[HIV]] virus," Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant "[[SAT]] test," now simply "SAT Reasoning Test").{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[Spike (TV network)|TNN]] (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself "The New TNN" for a brief interlude.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Simple redefining===
Sometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:
*[[DVD]] was originally an acronym of the unofficial term ''digital video disc'', but is now stated by the [[DVD Forum]] as standing for ''Digital Versatile Disc''.
*[[GAO]] changed the full form of its name from ''General Accounting Office'' to ''Government Accountability Office''.
*[[United States Government Publishing Office|GPO]] (in the United States) changed the full form of its name from ''Government Printing Office'' to ''Government Publishing Office''.
*[[RAID]] used to mean ''Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks'', but is now commonly interpreted as ''Redundant Array of Independent Disks''.
*WWF originally stood for ''World Wildlife Fund'', but now stands for ''[[Worldwide Fund for Nature]]'' (although the former name is still used in Canada and the United States).
*The [[Union for International Cancer Control|UICC]], whose initials came from the [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] versions of its name (such as French ''{{lang|fr|Union Internationale Contre le Cancer}}'', "International Union Against Cancer"), changed the English expansion of its name to Union for International Cancer Control (from International Union Against Cancer) so that the English expansion, too, would correspond to the UICC initials.

===Backronyms===
{{Main|Backronym}}

A ''backronym'' (or ''bacronym'') is a [[phrase]] that is constructed "after the fact" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic [[Anthony Burgess]] once proposed that the word "book" ought to stand for "'''B'''ox '''O'''f '''O'''rganized '''K'''nowledge."&lt;ref&gt;''99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939'' (New York: Summit Books, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The [[Apple Lisa]], which was said to refer to "Local Integrated Software Architecture", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.

Backronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) "A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men".

===Contrived acronyms===
Acronyms are sometimes [[wikt:contrive#Verb|contrived]], that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are ''[[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT]]'', [[Can Spam Act|''CAN SPAM'']], ''[[CAPTCHA]]'' and ''[[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The clothing company [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]] began referring to itself as ''fcuk'', standing for "French Connection United Kingdom." The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word "[[fuck]]."

The US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including ''RESURRECT'', ''NIRVANA'', and ''DUDE''. In July 2010, [[Wired Magazine]] reported that DARPA announced programs to "..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science" named ''BATMAN'' and ''ROBIN'' for ''Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature'' and ''Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/holy-acronym-darpa-batman-robin-to-master-biology-outdo-evolution/| title= Holy Acronym, Darpa! 'Batman &amp; Robin' to Master Biology, Outdo Evolution | author= Katie Drummond | work=Wired| date=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] comic-book superheroes.

The short-form names of [[clinical trial]]s and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as [[name]]s within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of [[mnemonic]] reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in [[medicine]] include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that [[RAS syndrome]] is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the [[archetype|archetypal]] form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of clinical trial acronyms, as with [[gene nomenclature#Symbol and name|gene and protein symbols]], is simply to have a syntactically usable and [[recall (memory)|recallable]] short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not [[memorization|memorized]]. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of "cutesy" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a [[name]], rather than being a [[wikt:cryptic#Adjective|cryptic]] and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document,&lt;ref name="PMID-12767559"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cheng |first=Tsung O |year=2003 |title=No more unexplained trial acronyms please. Trial Acronyms: Better Obvious than Obscure (TABOO) |journal=Int J Cardiol |volume=89 |issue=2-3 |pages=303 |pmid=12767559 |doi=10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00411-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication.&lt;ref name="PMID-12767559"/&gt; At least one study has evaluated the [[citation impact]] and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others,&lt;ref name="PMID-16823008"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanbrook |first=MB |last2=Austin |first2=PC |last3=Redelmeier |first3=DA |year=2006 |title=Acronym-named randomized trials in medicine—the ART in medicine study |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=355 |issue=1 |pages=101–102 |pmid=16823008 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc053420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws ([[connotation|connotatively]] driven [[bias]]).&lt;ref name="PMID-16823008"/&gt;

Some acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, ''[[Verliebt in Berlin]]'' (ViB), a German [[telenovela]], was first intended to be ''Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)'', but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym ''[[anal sex|ANAL]]''. Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as ''CLaIT'',&lt;ref name="CIE.org.uk_CLaIT"&gt;{{Citation|author=University of Cambridge International Examinations team |title=University of Cambridge International Examinations &gt; CLAiT–International page |url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/vocational/clait/overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114062047/http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/vocational/clait/overview |archivedate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''[[clitoris|CLIT]]''. In Canada, the [[Canadian Alliance|Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party)]] was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced "see [[feces|crap]]"). (The satirical magazine ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]].) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology ([[breast|TIT]]). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology ([[wikt:git|GIT]]). The charity sports organization [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society#Fundraising|Team in Training]] is known as "TNT" and not "TIT". [[Technological Institute of Textile &amp; Sciences]] is still known as TITS. [[George Mason University]] was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law ([[asshole|ASSOL]]) in honor of the late [[Antonin Scalia]], only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473339332/unfortunate-acronym-forces-law-school-name-change| title= Unfortunate Acronym Forces Law School Name Change | author= Morning Edition | work=NPR| date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macronyms/nested acronyms===
A '''macronym''', or '''nested acronym''', is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word "macronym" is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[wikt:macro-|macro-]]" and "acronym".

Some examples of macronyms are: &lt;!-- with citations in each individual article's references --&gt;
* [[XHR]] stands for "XML HTTP Request", in which [[XML]] is "eXtensible Markup Language", and [[HTTP]] stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol".
* [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] stands for ''Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC'', in which [[RISC]] stands for ''Reduced Instruction Set Computing''.
* [[VHDL]] stands for "VHSIC Hardware Description Language", in which [[VHSIC]] stands for "Very High Speed Integrated Circuit".
* [[XSD]] stands for "XML Schema Definition", in which [[XML]] stands for "eXtensible Markup Language".
* [[SECS]] stands for "SEMI equipment communication standard", in which [[SEMI]] stands for "Semiconductor equipment manufacturing industries".
* [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] stands for "AOL Instant Messenger", in which [[AOL]] stands for "[[America Online]]".
* [[Houston Automatic Spooling Priority|HASP]] stood for Houston Automatic Spooling Priority, but [[spooling]] itself was an acronym&amp;nbsp;– simultaneous peripheral operations on-line

Some macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'', a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the "Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service"; ATOVS is "Advanced TOVS"; TOVS is "[[TIROS]] operational vertical sounder"; and TIROS is "Television infrared observational satellite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727681.100-very-deep-multiply-nested-acronyms.html |title=Very deep multiply nested acronyms |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914033751/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727681.100-very-deep-multiply-nested-acronyms.html| archivedate= September 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully expanded, "RARS" might thus become "Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service". However, to say that "RARS" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in [[syntax]] (in the same way that "CHF" can be usefully interchanged with "congestive heart failure"), is a [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to [[#All-caps style|anacronymic]] than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to "spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations," but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be [[gloss (annotation)|annotated]] with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words ''laser'' and ''radar'' function as words in [[syntax]] and [[cognition]] without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as "RARS" and "[[CHA2DS2–VASc score]]" are irreducible in [[natural language]]; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, [[protein]] and [[gene]] nomenclature, [[gene nomenclature#Symbol and name|which uses symbols extensively]], includes such terms as the name of the [[NACHT domain|NACHT protein domain]], which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from ''Podospora anserine''), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a [[name]] within a [[clause]] clearly [[parsing|parsable]] by human readers or listeners.

====Recursive acronyms====
{{Main|Recursive acronym}}
A special type of macronym, the [[recursive acronym]], has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in ''[[The Hacker's Dictionary]]'' as [[Mung (computer term)|MUNG]], which stands for "MUNG Until No Good".

Some examples of recursive acronyms are:
* [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's Not Unix"
* [[LAME]] stands for "LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder"
* [[PHP]] stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
* [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator"
* [[GNU Hurd|HURD]] stands for "HIRD of Unix-replacing daemons", where HIRD itself stands for "HURD of interfaces representing depth" (a "mutually recursive" acronym)

==Non-English languages==

===Specific languages===

====Chinese====
In English language discussions of languages with [[syllabary|syllabic]] or [[logographic]] writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), "acronyms" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.

For example, in Chinese, "university" ({{lang|zh-hant|大學}}/{{lang|zh-hans|大学}}, literally "great learning") is usually abbreviated simply as {{lang|zh|大}} ("great") when used with the name of the institute. So ''[[Peking University]]'' ({{lang|zh-hans|北京大学}}) is commonly shortened to {{lang|zh|北大}} ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "north-great") by also only taking the first character of ''Peking'', the "northern capital" ({{zh | c=北京| p=Beijing | labels=no}}). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of ''[[Hong Kong University]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|香港大學}}) uses ''Kong'' ({{lang|zh-hant|港大}}) rather than ''Hong''.

There are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC), is "Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the "Communist Party of China" part of its name through acronyms, then the "Standing Committee" part, again through acronyms, to create "中共中央政治局常委". Alternatively, it omitted the "Communist Party" part altogether, creating "Politburo Standing Committee" (政治局常委会), and eventually just "Standing Committee" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are "Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply ''Changwei'' (常委), with the term ''Ruchang'' (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word "全国人民代表大会" ([[National People's Congress]]) can be broken into four parts: "全国" = "the whole nation", "人民" = "people", "代表" = "representatives", "大会" = "conference". Yet, in its short form "人大" (literally "man/people big"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part ("全国") and the third part ("代表") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term ''initialism'' is inapplicable.{{Original research inline|date=November 2012}}

Many proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]], whose full name is literally read as "China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to "Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply ''Chunwan'' (春晚). Along the same vein, ''Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai'' (中国中央电视台) was reduced to ''Yangshi'' (央视) in the mid-2000s.

====Korean====
Many aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for "big" or "great" i.e. ''dae'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대}}), to refer to universities ({{lang|ko-Hang|대학}}; ''daehak,'' literally "great learning" although "big school" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as "UPenn" or "Texas Tech."

Some acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how [[Hongik University]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|홍익대학교}}, ''Hongik Daehakgyo'') is shortened to ''Hongdae'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|홍대}}, "Hong, the big [school]" or "Hong-U") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. [[Korea National University of Education]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|한국교원대학교}}, ''Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo'') is shortened to ''Gyowondae'' (교원대, "Big Ed." or "Ed.-U"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The [[KAIST|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|한국과학기술원}}, ''Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon'') is referred to as KAIST ({{lang|ko-Hang|카이스트}}, ''Kaiseuteu'') in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, ''seukai''), combining the first letter of their English names ('''S'''eoul National, '''K'''orea, and '''Y'''onsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test ({{lang|ko-Hang|대학수학능력시험}}, ''Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom'') is shortened to ''Suneung'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|수능}}, "S.A.").

====Japanese====
{{main|Japanese abbreviated and contracted words}}
The [[Japanese language]] makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.

Chinese-based words ([[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like {{nihongo|''Tōdai''|東大}} for {{nihongo|''Tōkyō Daigaku''|東京大学|Tokyo University}}. In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in [[Saikyō Line|Saikyō]] for 埼京, from {{nihongo|''[[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]]'' + ''[[Tōkyo]]''|埼玉＋東京}}, rather than Sai'''tō'''.

Non-Chinese foreign borrowings ([[gairaigo]]) are instead frequently abbreviated as [[clipped compound]]s, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in [[katakana]] transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in [[hiragana]]). For example, the ''[[Pokémon]]'' media franchise's name originally stood for "pocket monsters" ({{lang|ja-Kana|'''ポケ'''ット·'''モン'''スター}} → {{lang|ja-Kana|ポケモン}}), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and "[[wāpuro]]" stands for "[[word processor]]" ({{lang|ja-Kana|'''ワー'''ド·'''プロ'''セッサー}} → {{lang|ja-Kana|ワープロ}}).

====German====
To a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are ''[[Gestapo]]'' rather than ''GSP'' (for ''{{lang|de|Geheime Staatspolizei}}'', 'secret state police'); ''{{lang|de|Flak}}'' rather than ''FAK'' (for ''{{lang|de|Fliegerabwehrkanone}}'', [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun); ''{{lang|de|Kripo}}'' rather than ''KP'' (for ''{{lang|de|[[Kriminalpolizei]]}}'', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:de:Aküfi|Aküfi]]}}'' (for ''{{lang|de|Abkürzungsfimmel}}'', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of {{lang|de|Aküfi}} include ''{{lang|de|Vokuhila}}'' (for ''{{lang|de|vorne kurz, hinten lang}}'', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]) and the mocking of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s title as ''{{lang|de|[[Gröfaz]]}}'' (''{{lang|de|Größter Feldherr aller Zeiten}}'', Greatest General of all Times).

====Hebrew====
{{Main|Hebrew acronyms}}

It is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign [[gershayim]] {{angle bracket|״}} is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word.  Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): {{lang|he|ארה״ב|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ארצות הברית|rtl=yes}}, the United States); {{lang|he|ברה״מ|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ברית המועצות|rtl=yes}}, the Soviet Union); {{lang|he|ראשל״צ|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ראשון לציון|rtl=yes}}, [[Rishon LeZion]]); {{lang|he|ביה״ס|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|בית הספר|rtl=yes}}, the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is {{lang|he|צה״ל|rtl=yes}} (''Tzahal'', for {{lang|he|צבא הגנה לישראל|rtl=yes}}, [[Israel Defense Forces]]). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign [[gershayim]] remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. "report", singular: {{lang|he|דו״ח|rtl=yes}}, plural: {{lang|he|דו״חות|rtl=yes}}; "squad commander", masculine: {{lang|he|מ״כ|rtl=yes}}, feminine: {{lang|he|מ״כית|rtl=yes}}).

====Indonesian====
{{see also|List of Indonesian acronyms and abbreviations}}
There is also a widespread use of acronyms in [[Indonesia]] in every aspect of social life. For example, the ''[[Golkar]]'' political party stands for Partai ''Gol''ongan ''Kar''ya, ''[[Monas]]'' stands for "''Mo''numen ''Nas''ional" (National Monument), the ''Angkot'' public transport stands for "''Ang''kutan ''Kot''a" ([[Share taxi#indonesia|city public transportation]]), ''warnet'' stands for "''war''ung inter''net''" ([[internet cafe]]), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, [[slang]] or [[colloquial]].

The capital's metropolitan area ([[Jakarta]] and its surrounding [[satellite city|satellite regions]]), ''[[Jabodetabek]]'', is another infamous acronym. This stands for ''Ja''karta-''Bo''gor-''De''pok-''Ta''ngerang-''Bek''asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. ''Jalan Tol'' (Toll Road) ''Jagorawi'' (''Ja''karta-Bo''gor''-Ci''awi'') and ''Purbaleunyi'' (''Pur''wakarta-''Ba''ndung-Ci''leunyi''), Joglo Semar (''Jog''ja-so''lo''-''semar''ang).

In some languages, especially those that use certain [[alphabets]], many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The [[Indonesian military]] (TNI—''Tentara Nasional Indonesia'') and [[Indonesian police]] (POLRI—''Kepolisian Republik Indonesia'') are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the ''[[Kopassus]]'' (''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan Khu''sus''; [[Special Forces]] Command), ''[[Kopaska]]'' (''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan ''Ka''tak; [[Frogmen]] Command), ''Kodim'' (''Ko''mando ''Di''strik ''M''iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's [[administrative divisions]]), ''Serka'' (''Ser''san ''K''ep''a''la; Head [[Sergeant]]), ''Akmil'' (''Ak''ademi ''Mil''iter; Military Academy—in [[Magelang]]) and many other terms regarding [[military ranks|ranks]], units, divisions, procedures, etc.

Heavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] to seek information and news in Indonesian [[media (communication)|media]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====Russian====
Acronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. {{lang|ru|Газпром}} ([[Gazprom]]), for {{lang|ru|Газовая промышленность}} (''{{transl|ru|Gazovaya promyshlennost}}'', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (''SMI'', for {{lang|ru|средства массовой информации}} ''{{transl|ru|sredstva massovoy informatsii}}'', means of mass informing, i.e. [[mass media]]). Another Russian acronym, {{lang|ru|ГУЛаг}} ([[GULag]]) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for {{lang|ru|Главное управление лагерей}} (''{{transl|ru|Glavnoe upravlenie lagerey}}'', Chief Administration of Camps).

Historically, [[OTMA]] was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of [[Emperor]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and his consort, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.

====Swahili====
In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for ''{{lang|sw|Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili}}'' (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.

====Vietnamese====
In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include ''[[wikt:TP.HCM|TP.HCM]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh}}'', [[Ho Chi Minh City]]), ''[[wikt:THPT|THPT]]'' (''{{lang|vi|trung học phổ thông}}'', high school), ''[[wikt:CLB|CLB]]'' (''{{lang|vi|câu lạc bộ}}'', club), ''[[wikt:CSDL|CSDL]]'' (''{{lang|vi|cơ sở dữ liệu}}'', database), ''[[wikt:NXB|NXB]]'' (''{{lang|vi|nhà xuất bản}}'', publisher), ''[[wikt:ÔBACE|ÔBACE]]'' (''{{lang|vi|ông bà anh chị em}}'', a general form of address), and ''[[wikt:CTTĐVN|CTTĐVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|các Thánh tử đạo Việt Nam}}'', [[Vietnamese Martyrs]]). Longer examples include ''[[wikt:CHXHCNVN|CHXHCNVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}'', [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]) and ''[[wikt:MTDTGPMNVN|MTDTGPMNVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam}}'', [[Viet Cong]]). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Từ viết tắt|trans-title=Abbreviations|publisher=[[BBC Academy]]|accessdate=September 4, 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/vietnamese/article/art20131007102738486|language=vi|quote=Chưa kể cách viết này còn dễ bị cho là lười biếng hoặc tỏ ra quan trọng, vì đây là cách chép nguyên xi, máy móc các cụm từ viết tắt từ văn bản pháp quy của chính quyền, như TTLT-VKSNDTC-TANDTC, khá phổ biến ở Việt Nam hiện nay.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.

Each letter in an initialism corresponds to one [[morpheme]]—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example ''ĐNA'' or ''ĐNÁ'' for ''{{lang|vi|Đông Nam Á}}'' ([[Southeast Asia]]) and ''LMCA'' or ''LMCÂ'' for ''Liên minh châu Âu'' ([[European Union]]). The letter "[[Ư]]" is often replaced by "W" in initialisms to avoid confusion with "U", for example ''UBTWMTTQVN'' or ''UBTƯMTTQVN'' for ''Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam'' (Central Committee of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]]).

Initialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the [[Vietnamese alphabet#Letter names and pronunciation|names of many Vietnamese letters]] are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ''{{linktext|SIĐA|lang=vi}}'' ({{IPA-vi|s̪i˧˧ ˀɗaː˧˧|pron}}), a respelling of the French acronym ''SIDA'' ([[AIDS]]); ''{{linktext|VOA|lang=vi}}'' ({{IPA-vi|vwaː˧˧|pron}}), a literal reading of the English initialism for [[Voice of America]]; and ''[[NASA]]'' ({{IPA-vi|naː˧˧ zaː˧˧|pron}}), borrowed directly from the English acronym.

As in [[#Chinese|Chinese]], many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] is derived from the first syllables of "Việt Nam" (Vietnam) and "Cộng sản" (communist). This mechanism is limited to [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]]. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered [[portmanteau]] words or [[blend word]]s rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.

===General grammatical considerations===

====Declension====
In languages where nouns are [[declension|declined]], various methods are used. An example is [[Finnish language|Finnish]], where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:
*An acronym is pronounced as a word: Nato {{IPA-fi|nato|}}—''{{lang|fi|Natoon}}'' {{IPA|[natoːn]}} "into Nato", Nasalta "from [[NASA]]"
*An acronym is pronounced as letters: EU {{IPA|[eː uː]}}—''{{lang|fi|EU:hun}}'' {{IPA|[eː uːhun]}} "into EU"
*An acronym is interpreted as words: EU {{IPA|[euroːpan unioni]}}—''{{lang|fi|EU:iin}}'' {{IPA|[euroːpan unioniːn]}} "into EU"
The process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus ''pre-NATO policy'' (rather than ''preNATO'').

====Lenition====
In languages such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], where [[lenition]] (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case "h" is added after the initial consonant; for example, ''[[BBC Scotland]]'' in the genitive case would be written as ''BhBC Alba'', with the acronym pronounced "VBC". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for "television" (''gd: telebhisean'') is ''TBh'', pronounced "TV", as in English.

==Extremes==
*The longest acronym, according to the 1965 edition of ''Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary'', is ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC, a [[United States Navy]] term that stands for "Administrative Command, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet Subordinate Command."  Another term COMNAVSEACOMBATSYSENGSTA, which stands for "Commander, Naval Sea Systems Combat Engineering Station" is longer but the word "Combat" is not shortened.
*The world's longest acronym, according to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', is НИИОМТПЛАБОПАРМБЕТЖЕЛБЕТРАБСБОМОНИМОНКОНОТДТЕХСТРОМОНТ {{transl|ru|(NIIOMTPLABOPARMBETZHELBETRABSBOMONIMONKONOTDTEKHSTROMONT)}}. However, this is more precisely a combination acronym/[[clipped compound]], as multiple initial letters of some constituent words are used. The 56-letter term (54 in [[Cyrillic]]) is from the ''Concise Dictionary of Soviet Terminology'' and means "The laboratory for shuttering, reinforcement, concrete and ferroconcrete operations for composite-monolithic and monolithic constructions of the Department of the Technology of Building-assembly operations of the Scientific Research Institute of the Organization for building mechanization and technical aid of the Academy of Building and Architecture of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]." ({{lang|ru|'''н'''аучно-'''и'''сследовательская '''[...]''' '''лаб'''оратория '''оп'''ераций по '''арм'''ированию '''бет'''она и '''жел'''езо'''бет'''онных '''раб'''от по сооружению '''сбо'''рно-'''мон'''олитных '''и''' '''мон'''олитных '''кон'''струкций '''отд'''ела '''тех'''нологии '''стро'''ительно-'''монт'''ажного управления}})
*The card-game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has a playing card called "Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental", with text on it saying: "Just call it OMRSTPLRLCNSWMTCTHTALCNEE for short."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74237|title=Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental (Unhinged) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|website=gatherer.wizards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balbino de Freitas Archaeological Collection was one of the collections on display in [[National Museum of Brazil]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It reunited works belonging to the house of [[Balbino Luiz de Freitas]], one of the first archaeological collections of Brazil. The collection was [[Cultural heritage management|listed]] by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage|IPHAN]] in [[1938]].

The collection was assembled by Freitas, especially with indigenous objects of [[Torres, Rio Grande do Sul|Torres]]. A [[basket]] was one of the main elements of the collection, collected in a [[sambaqui]] in the coastal area. The importance of the piece is given by the difficult maintenance of objects made with organic material in tropical countries, such as [[Brazil]].

This archaeological collection was, at least in part, destroyed in the fire of 2018 in the National Museum [[National Museum of Brazil fire|the fire of 2018 in the National Museum]].

Started in 2007, the site was developed by mathematicians and scientific advisers from Oxford University and analyses historical usage patterns to predict future usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8063615.stm| title = Academics tot up costs of mobiles | work = [[BBC News]] | date =May 22, 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its UK competitors, Mobile Phone Checker and [[moneysupermarket.com]], the service recommends plans based on a user’s stated needs, in terms of minutes per month, texts, data and international use. The service also offers a monthly bill-tracking facility that allows users with online billing to give the site access to their past bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Emma| last = Lunn | url =https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/mar/08/consumer-affairs-mobilephones | title =How to find your ideal tariff and cut that phone bill | work = [[The Observer]] | date =March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cochin State Manual''''' was a 1911 CE publication of the then-[[princely state]] of [[Cochin]], detailing the social, economic, and historical conditions of the state. It was compiled by C. Achutha Menon (1862-1937), secretary to the Devaswom of Cochin, and bore close similarity to the district manuals and gazetteers of the British Raj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Indian Gazetteers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNUmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Travancore+State+Manual%22&amp;dq=%22Travancore+State+Manual%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iKWJT6fZJuLy0gG62-DnCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTge |page=24 |accessdate=14 July 2015 |year=1967 |publisher=Ministry of Education, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' M. H. de Young Memorial Museum''', commonly referred as the '''de Young''', is a [[fine art]]s [[museum]] located in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]], and one of the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] along with the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor|Legion of Honor]]. The de Young is named for its founder, early San Francisco newspaperman [[M. H. de Young]]. Since Nov 1, 2018, [[Thomas_P._Campbell|Thomas P. Campbell]] has served as the Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, overseeing the de Young and Legion of Honor museums.

==History==
The museum opened in 1895 as an outgrowth of the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894]] (a fair modeled on the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of the previous year). It was housed in an [[Egyptian revival]] structure which had been the Fine Arts Building at the fair. The building was badly damaged in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], and was closed for a year and a half for repairs. Before long, the museum's steady development called for a new space to better serve its growing audiences. Michael de Young responded by planning the building that would serve as the core of the de Young facility through the 20th century. [[Louis Christian Mullgardt]], the coordinator for architecture for the [[1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition]], designed the [[Plateresque|Spanish-Plateresque-style]] building. The new structure was completed in 1919 and formally transferred by de Young to the city's park commissioners. In 1921, de Young added a central section, together with a tower that would become the museum's signature feature, and the museum began to assume the basic configuration that it retained until 2001. Michael de Young's great efforts were honored with the changing of the museum's name to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. Another addition, a west wing, was completed in 1925, the year de Young died. In 1929 the original Egyptian-style building was declared unsafe and demolished. By 1949, the elaborate cast concrete ornamentation of the original de Young was determined to be a hazard and removed because the salt air from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] had rusted the supporting steel.

As part of the agreement that created the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] in 1972, the de Young's collection of European art was sent to the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor|Legion of Honor]]. In compensation, the de Young received the right to display the bulk of the organization's anthropological holdings. These include significant pre-Hispanic works from [[Teotihuacan]] and Peru, as well as indigenous tribal art from [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. The building was severely damaged by the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Dorning"&gt;[https://archive.is/20071020152554/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/6/2006_6_21.shtml Amy Weaver Dorning] "Museum Renovation: A Great Institution Gets Greater," ''American Heritage'', Nov./Dec. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It in turn was demolished and replaced by a new building in 2005. The only remaining original elements of the old de Young are the vases and sphinxes located near the Pool of Enchantment. The palm trees in front of the building are also original to the site.

==Collections==
The de Young showcases [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] from the 17th through the 21st centuries, international [[contemporary art]], [[textile arts|textiles]], and [[costume]]s, and art from the Americas, the Pacific and Africa.

===American===
The American art collection consists of over 1,000 paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/deyoung/collections/american-painting|title=American Painting|work=de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; 800 sculptures, and 3,000 decorative arts objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/deyoung/collections/american-sculpture-decorative-art|title=American Sculpture &amp; Decorative Art|work=de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; With works ranging from 1670 to the present day, this collection represents the most comprehensive museum survey of American art in the [[American West]] and is among the top ten collections nationally that encompass the entire history of non-indigenous American art. Since its inception in the Fine Arts Building at the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894]] in Golden Gate Park, its subsequent institutionalization in the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in 1924, and its reinstallation in the new de Young in 2005, the permanent collection has evolved exponentially.

In 1978, the American art collections were transformed by the decision of [[John D. Rockefeller III]] and [[Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller|Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller]] to donate their renowned collection of 110 paintings, 29 drawings, and 2 sculptures to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco where they would be on view at the de Young. His bequest in 1979 together with her bequest in 1993 are among the Fine Arts Museums’ single most important gifts of art.

The de Young’s chronological survey of American art includes galleries devoted to art in the following areas: [[Native American art|Native American]] and Spanish Colonial; Anglo-Colonial; Federal era art and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]]; [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[genre art|genre]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]]; [[trompe l’oeil|trompe l’oeil still life]]; the [[Hudson River School]], [[Barbizon]], and [[Tonalism]]; [[American Impressionism|Impressionism]] and the [[Ashcan School]]; [[Arts and Crafts]]; [[Modern Art|Modernism]]; [[Social Realism]] and American Scene; [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract art|Abstraction]]; [[Beat Movement|Beat]], [[Pop Art|Pop]], and Figurative; and Contemporary.

Although the permanent collection is national in scope, art made in California from the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] era to the present day is also on display in the de Young. Important California collections with national significance include examples of Spanish colonial, Arts and Crafts, and Bay Area Figurative and [[Assemblage art]]. Important among them are the most significant museum collections of works by Bay Area painter [[Chiura Obata]] and sculptor [[Ruth Asawa]].

The permanent collection galleries integrate decorative arts objects with paintings and sculptures, emphasizing the artistic, social, and political context for the works on display. While essentially chronological, the installation also juxtaposes works from different cultures and time periods to emphasize the historical connections between works in the collection. Painters with paintings in this art museum include; [[John Singleton Copley]], [[John Vanderlyn]], [[Thomas Cole]] (''Prometheus Bound''), [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill]], [[Thomas Waterman Wood|Thomas Wood]] (''Newspaper Vendor''), Samuel Brookes, [[John Peto]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell]] (''The Blue Veil''), [[George Hitchcock (artist)|George Hitchcock]], [[Maynard Dixon]], [[Otis Oldfield]], [[Granville Redmond]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] (''Susannah and the Elders''), [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Mel Ramos]], and [[Wayne Thiebaud]].

In January 2017, the institution announced a significant new addition to its collection of American Art through the acquisition of 62 works by 22 contemporary African American Arts, including Thornton Dial's ''Blood And Meat: Survival For the World'' (1992) and ''Lost Cows'' (2000-1), Joe Light's ''Dawn'' (1988), Jessie T. Pettway's ''Bars'' and ''String-Pierced Columns'' (1950's), Lonnie Holley's ''Him and Her Hold the Root'' (1994) and Joe Minter's ''Camel at the Watering Hole'' (1995) The works are currently exhibited in [https://deyoung.famsf.org/exhibitions/revelations-art-african-american-south Revelations: Art from the African American South], on view until April 1, 2018.&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.artforum.com/archive/id=66410 &lt;nowiki&gt;[12].&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;

;Archives of American Art
Since 1991, the American Art Department has housed a set of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s [[Archives of American Art]] microfilm collection. In conjunction with the Bothin Library and department research files, the American Art Study Center is the most important research center for American art on the West Coast.

===International contemporary===
In 1988, the Fine Arts Museums made a commitment to collect international contemporary art. In addition to works in traditional media, this commitment has expanded the museums’ holdings of works in new or multiple media––including installation and conceptual works, video and other time-based media, and photography and other lens-based media––to more accurately reflect contemporary art practice.
	
Recent contemporary acquisitions include ''Wall of Light Horizon'' (2005), by [[Sean Scully]] and signature sculptures by [[Zhan Wang]] and [[Cornelia Parker]]. The strength of the collection lies in artists associated with California, including 
[[Piotr Abraszewski]], Christopher Brown, [[Squeak Carnwath]], Jim Christiansen, [[Robert Colescott]], [[Hung Liu]], [[Bruce Nauman]], Rachel Neubauer, [[Ed Ruscha]] and [[Masami Teraoka]].

Lens-based and time-based media represent a new area of growth, with works by Nigel Poor, Catherine Wagner, Rebeca Bollinger, Alan Rath and the Propeller Group. The museums have also acquired works by international artists such as [[Anish Kapoor]], [[Odd Nerdrum]], [[Gottfried Helnwein]], [[Doris Salcedo]], [[David Nash (artist)|David Nash]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], and [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]].

===Textiles and costumes===
The Fine Arts Museums’ textiles collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/deyoung/collections/textile-arts|title=Textile Arts|work=de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; boasts more than 13,000 textiles and costumes from around the world. It is one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of its type in the United States. It comprises costume and costume accessories; [[loom|loom-woven]] textiles; non-woven fabrics such as bark cloth, [[felt]], and [[knitting]]; and objects whose primary decoration is produced through techniques such as [[beadwork|beading]] and [[embroidery]]. With holdings that span two and a half millennia and represent cultures from 125 countries, the textile arts collection enables the museums to draw connections across cultures and enrich its other collections.

Highlights from the collection include extraordinary [[Turkmenistan|Turkme]]n carpets, rare 12th through 15th-century Central Asian and [[North India]]n silks, the most important group of [[Anatolia]]n [[kilim]]s outside [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], European [[tapestry|tapestries]], and contemporary [[fiber art]].

The de Young has exhibited fashion since the 1930s and is known for its 20th-century couture, particularly from the post–[[World War II]] era, with pieces by [[Dior]], [[Balenciaga]], [[Grès|Madame Grès]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Chanel]], [[Ralph Rucci]], and Kaisik Wong. There are equally compelling collections of 18th and 19th-century European [[hand fan|fans]], an excellent [[lace]] collection, a spectacular group of European [[ecclesiastic]]al [[vestment]]s and furnishings, and a growing collection of contemporary wearable art. With holdings that span two and a half millennia and represent cultures from 125 countries, the textile arts collection enables the museums to draw connections across cultures and enrich other areas of the permanent collection.

Throughout the year, the Lonna and Marshall Wais and Diana Dollar Knowles and Gorham B. Knowles costume and textile arts gallery hosts several exhibitions featuring the diverse range of these collections as well as important traveling exhibitions. In addition to the larger rotating textiles presentations in the main gallery, the T.B Walker Family Education Gallery houses small, didactic displays and contains study drawers illustrating representative pieces from the entire collection accentuate different textile techniques.

In August 2017 [https://deyoung.famsf.org/summer-love-art-fashion-and-rock-roll The Summer of Love Experience: Art, Fashion, and Rock &amp; Roll] marked another highlight at the de Young. The exhibition celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/summer-love-experience-brings-1960s-idealism-san-franciscos-de-young-museum-584697|title=The Summer of Love returns to San Francisco|date=18 April 2017|work=Newsweek|access-date=22 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured fashion from the late sixties from the museum's permanent collection and on loan from Bay Area independent designers. Record breaking 270,000 visitors&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.famsf.org/press-room/summer-love-experience-art-fashion-and-rock-roll-closes-record-attendance-numbers''], Press Release by [[de Young Museum]], accessed on 20 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; from around the world came to the de Young to relieve the Summer of Love.

===Africa, Pacific, and the Americas===
More than 1,400 stellar examples from the eastern Sudan, the Guinea coast, west and central Africa, eastern and southern Africa, and elsewhere on the continent are included in the Fine Arts Museums’ African art collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/deyoung/collections/african-art|title=African Art|work=de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the de Young. The African art collection is presented thematically rather than geographically, emphasizing the aesthetic and expressive qualities of the art.

The Oceanic collections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/deyoung/collections/oceanic-art|title=Oceanic Art|work=de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; were charter collections of the de Young, their nucleus formed in 1894 at the California Midwinter International Exposition in Golden Gate Park. Additional Oceanic works of [[sculpture]], [[basketry]], [[tapa cloth|tapa]], [[ceramic]]s, and [[Stone tool|lithic]]s have since been acquired, bringing the holdings to more than 3,000. Highlights of the collection include a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} housepost from the [[Iatmul people]] of the [[Sepik River]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], a group of brightly painted carvings used in [[malanggan]] ceremonials of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], a roll of feather money from Nindu Island of Santa Cruz, a fan from the [[Marquesas Islands]] of [[Polynesia]], a rare navigation figure from the [[Caroline Islands]] of [[Micronesia]], and a selection of powerful [[wood carving]]s from the [[Māori people|Maori]] peoples of New Zealand.

The Art of the Americas collections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deyoung.famsf.org/deyoung/collections/art-americas|title=Art of the Americas|work=de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; are of national significance to [[art history]], [[anthropology]], and [[world history]], and they have helped establish the de Young as a primary source for cultural research and study. The extensive collection of ancient American and Native American art comprises nearly 2,000 works of art from Meso-America, Central and South America, and the West Coast of North America. Art from cultures indigenous to the American continents was a defining feature of the museum’s charter collection and continues to be an area of significant growth. Special galleries are devoted to ancient objects from Mexico, including an outstanding grouping of [[Teotihuacan]] murals.

==Architecture==
[[File:De Young Museum pano.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Museum, with Hamon Tower on the right]]

The current building was completed by architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron|Jacques Herzog]], [[Pierre de Meuron]] and Fong + Chan and opened on October 15, 2005. Structural, civil and geotechnical engineering was provided by [[Rutherford &amp; Chekene]]; [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] provided mechanical and electrical engineering. [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] won the competition in January 1999 beating out other short-listed architects [[Tadao Ando]] and [[Antoine Predock]]. The terrain and seismic activity in San Francisco posed a challenge for the designers [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] and principal architects Fong &amp; Chan.  To help withstand future earthquakes, “[the building] can move up to three feet (91 centimeters) due to a system of ball-bearing sliding plates and viscous fluid dampers that absorb [[kinetic energy]] and convert it to heat”.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmore&lt;/ref&gt;

A new museum structure located in the middle of an urban park was initially controversial. San Francisco voters twice defeated bond measures that were to fund the new museum project. After the second defeat, the museum itself planned to relocate to a location in the [[financial district]]. However, an effort led by generous supporters arose and kept the museum in the Golden Gate Park.

The designers were sensitive to the appearance of the building in its natural setting. [[Walter Hood]], a landscape architect based in [[Oakland]], designed the museum's new gardens. The entire exterior is clad in {{convert|163118|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of copper, which is expected to eventually oxidize and take on a [[Patina|greenish tone]] and a distinct texture to echo the nearby [[eucalyptus tree]]s. In order to further harmonize with the surroundings, shapes were cut into the top to reveal gardens and courtyards where 48 trees had been planted, the giant tree-ferns that form a backdrop for the museum entrance are particularly dramatic. 5.12 acres (20,700 square meters) of new landscaping were planted as well, with 344 transplanted trees and 69 historic boulders. The building is clad with variably perforated and dimpled copper plates, whose [[patina]] will slowly change through exposure to the elements. This exterior facade was developed and fabricated by engineers at Zahner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20050919/sheet-metal-magicians | title=Sheet Metal Magicians | publisher =Metropolis Magazine | author=Peter Hall | accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 144&amp;nbsp;ft. (44 m) observation tower allows visitors to see much of Golden Gate Park's Music Concourse (see below) and rises above the Park's treetops providing a view of the [[Golden Gate]] and [[Marin Headlands]].

The twisting 144 foot (44 m) tall tower is a distinctive feature, and can be seen rising above the canopy of Golden Gate Park from many areas of San Francisco. The museum offers a two-floor museum store, free access to the lobby and tower, and a full-service cafe with outdoor seating in the Osher Sculpture Garden. The executive chef is Lance Holton.

The '''''Dictionary of Australian Biography''''', published in 1949, is a reference work by [[Percival Serle]] containing information on notable people associated with Australian history. With approximately a thousand entries, the book took more than twenty years to complete. Published by [[Angus and Robertson]], the dictionary was compiled as two volumes, Volume 1: A-K; and Volume 2: L-Z.

The book contains 1,030 biographies of Australians, or people who were closely connected with Australia, who died before the end of 1942. According to Serle in his preface:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Serle, Percival |authorlink=Percival Serle |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h.html |title=Dictionary of Australian Biography |year=1949 |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg Australia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{blockquote|"This date closed the first one hundred and fifty years of Australia's history, for although the first fleet arrived in January 1788, the first emigrant ship, the Bellona, did not come until January 1793. Until then Australia had been merely a dumping ground for convicts, but the arrival of free emigrants foreshadowed the founding of a nation."|Pervical Serle, 1949}}

==Format==
The average length of the biographies is about 640 words. Serle classified them roughly  into the following twelve groups:
{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:left;"
|-
! scope="col" colspan="2" | Group
! scope="col" rowspan="2" | No. of&lt;br/&gt;profiles

|}

Of the above profiles, the number of women included was 42 or 4&amp;nbsp;percent of the biographies. Forty-seven percent of those included in the book were born in England, 27 percent in Australia, 12 percent Scotland, 8 percent Ireland, 1 percent Wales and remaining 5 percent were from the rest of the world which included twelve from the United States, nine from Germany, and six from New Zealand.

The '''Dutton House''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]; it is also known as the Salmon Dutton House.&lt;ref name="Hill 1955"&gt;Hill, Ralph Nading and Lilian Baker Carlisle. The Story of The Shelburne Museum. 1955. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Dutton House constitutes the first dwelling brought to Museum property.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=8 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204190707/http://shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=8 |archive-date=2009-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to relocate the structure to Museum grounds, builders dismantled the house. Museum workers photographed the house prior to and while the house was being dismantled.  Samples of each stenciled border were excised from the plaster walls. These samples were used as models for recreating the stenciled decoration of Dutton House’s interior. The sunburst stencil painted motif over a second floor fireplace mantle was also retained and installed in the re-erected house. Museum workers added dentil molding, copied from a house in [[Alburg, Vermont]], to the structure’s cornice.&lt;ref name="Hill 1955"/&gt; 

==History==
Salmon Dutton built Dutton House in [[Cavendish, Vermont]] in 1781. Having emigrated from [[Massachusetts]], Dutton worked as a road surveyor ''(see [[Surveying]])'', a [[justice of the peace]], and the [[treasurer]] of the town of Cavendish. Like many homes of the period, Dutton used his house as both a residence and place of business.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Shelburne Museum |date=1993 |title=Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections |url= |location=Shelburne |publisher=Shelburne Museum, Inc. |isbn=978-0-939384-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuing his tradition, Dutton’s descendants, who occupied the house until 1900, operated Dutton House as a store, an inn, and a boarding house for local mill workers.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt; Although Dutton originally constructed Dutton House in the indigenous [[Saltbox]] style, as the building’s function changed over time, Dutton and his descendants expanded the structure. The many additions that extend from the Saltbox core reflect the tradition of “continuous” architecture common in New England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;  

In the late 1940s [[Redfield Proctor, Jr.]], Dutton’s great-great-grandson, offered the house to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, now [[Historic New England]]. As part of considering the house, architect [[Frank Chouteau Brown]] measured and delineated the house and its stencil painted walls for the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="HABS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/vt0062.sheet.00009a/resource/ |title=Salmon Dutton House |last=Brown |first=Frank Chouteau |date=December 14, 1946 |website=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |page=9 of 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Proctor donated the house to the [[Vermont Historical Society]]; however, in 1950 when the Vermont Highway Department’s planned road improvements threatened the structure, the Society offered it to Shelburne Museum.&lt;ref&gt;http://vermonthistory.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216152559/http://vermonthistory.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 |date=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall treatments collection==
Nineteenth-century American homeowners employed many methods in ornamenting their interiors. Rich paint colors and wallpaper were widely available in America as early as 1725 and by 1830 thousands of trade painters offered wallpapering, mural painting, and stenciling among their marketable talents. Shelburne Museum’s collection includes examples of all three types of wall treatments.

Members of the upper class often imported French and English wallpaper to adorn formal rooms such as parlors, ballrooms, and dining rooms. These papers frequently represented scenic landscapes and possessed bright colors and bold patterning that could stand out even in weak candlelight.

Mural painting offered an equally decorative but less expensive mode of adornment for those who could not afford to import expensive papers. Jonathan Poor, and his partner, Paine, worked as limners. Traveling around Maine, they offered their services as decorative painters charging $10 for a completed room. Represented in the Museum’s collection is an ornamental over-mantel and chimney-surround that Poor and Paine created in about 1830. Designed as part of a painted chamber of landscape murals, these paintings, with their views of busy harbors, farms, and forests, are outstanding examples of a decorative technique that is frequently lost to demolition.

In the early nineteenth century, itinerant artists would stencil walls in exchange for room and board. These artists would cut patterns from thin wood or heavy paper and use them to decorate walls and furniture. [[Stencil House]]’s parlor, dining room, and entrance hall exhibit a variety of stenciled patterns, including a grape leaf border, vases of flowers, and patriotic eagles. [3]

The stencil painting in the Dutton House can be found in the front four rooms and, by and large, is only found along the outer borders of the plaster walls, dating to about 1800.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Ann Eckert |date=2003 |title=American wall stenciling, 1790-1840 |location=Lebanon, N.H. |publisher=University Press of New England |isbn=1-58465-194-6 |pages=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sunburst is painted over the fireplace mantle in one of the second floor rooms, and is the only plaster replaced in the house after the move from Cavendish. Samples of each of the borders from the four rooms were removed and served as guides when the house was re-erected in Shelburne. Motifs used in the Dutton House borders are found in other houses in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire. One of the motifs, a freehand decoration used in a first floor room, is also found in the Grimes House in [[Keene, New Hampshire]]. The stencil painted decoration in that house has been attributed to either Jothan Stearns or Jedutham Bullin, thus one of them may have painted the Dutton House interiors.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

[[Image:Tallinn24Feb1918.jpg|thumb|200px|The first celebration of Estonian Independence Day in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] on 24 February 1919]]
The '''Estonian Declaration of Independence''', also known as the '''Manifesto to the Peoples of Estonia''' ({{lang-et|Manifest Eestimaa rahvastele}}), is the founding act of the [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]] from 1918. It is celebrated on 24 February, the [[National Day]] or Estonian [[Independence Day (Estonia)|Independence Day]].

The declaration was drafted by the [[Salvation Committee]] elected by the elders of the [[Estonian Provincial Assembly]]. Originally intended to be proclaimed on 21 February 1918, the proclamation was delayed until the evening of 23 February, when the manifesto was printed and read out aloud publicly in [[Pärnu]]. On the next day, 24 February, the manifesto was printed and distributed in the capital, [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Küllo |last=Arjakas |title=23. ja 24. veebruar 1918: kuidas iseseisvust kuulutati |url=http://www.postimees.ee/230208/esileht/ak/313571.php |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=23 February 2008 |accessdate=24 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226122729/http://www.postimees.ee/230208/esileht/ak/313571.php |archivedate=26 February 2008 |df= }} {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauri |last=Vahtre |title=89 aastapäeva – sinimustvalgega ja ilma |url=http://www.postimees.ee/240207/esileht/ak/246513.php |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=24 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302071247/http://www.postimees.ee/240207/esileht/ak/246513.php |archivedate=2 March 2007 |df= }} {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
During [[World War I]], between retreating Russian and advancing German troops, the [[Occupation of Estonia by German Empire]] nearing, the [[Salvation Committee]] of the Estonian National Council, [[Maapäev]], declared the independence of Estonia on 24 February 1918. The German Empire did not recognise the newly declared Republic of Estonia. However, after the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in World War I in November 1918, Germany withdrew its troops from Estonia and formally handed over power in Estonia to the Estonian Provisional Government on 19 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1914-1920_The_First_World_War_and_Estonian_independence/World_War_I/ |title=World War I |last=Rosenthal |first=Reigo |date=3 October 2012 |website=Estonica |access-date=24 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627212414/http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1914-1920_The_First_World_War_and_Estonian_independence/World_War_I/ |archivedate=27 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Bolshevik invasion and The [[Estonian War of Independence]] followed. On 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Peace Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the [[Republic of Estonia]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1914-1920_The_First_World_War_and_Estonian_independence/Estonian_War_of_Independence/ |title=Estonian War of Independence |last=Rosenthal |first=Reigo |date=3 October 2012 |website=Estonica |access-date=24 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512040625/http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1914-1920_The_First_World_War_and_Estonian_independence/Estonian_War_of_Independence/ |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1920-1939_The_Republic_of_Estonia_between_the_two_World_Wars/Years_of_parliamentarian_democracy/ |title=Years of parliamentarian democracy |last=Pajur |first=Ago |date=3 October 2012 |website=Estonica |access-date=24 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531234953/http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1920-1939_The_Republic_of_Estonia_between_the_two_World_Wars/Years_of_parliamentarian_democracy/ |archivedate=31 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Declaration==
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}
[[Image:Estonian Declaration of Independence.jpg|right|thumb|Estonian Declaration of Independence]]

''MANIFESTO TO THE PEOPLES OF ESTONIA''

''In the course of centuries never have the Estonian people lost their desire for independence. From generation to generation have they kept alive the hidden hope that in spite of enslavement and oppression by hostile invaders the time will come to Estonia "when all splints, at both end, will burst forth into flames" and when "Kalev will come home to bring his children happiness."''

''Now that time has arrived.''

''An unprecedented fight between nations has crushed the rotten foundations of the Russian Tsarist Empire. All over the Sarmatian plains ruinous anarchy is spreading, threatening to overwhelm in its wake all the nations living in the former Russian Empire. From the West the victorious armies of Germany are approaching in order to claim their share of Russia's legacy and, above all, to take possession of the coastal territories of the Baltic Sea.''

''In this hour, the Estonian National Council, as the legal representative of our land and people, has, in unanimous agreement with Estonian democratic political parties and organizations, and by virtue of the right of self-determination of peoples, found it necessary to take the following decisive steps to shape the destiny of the Estonian land and people.''

''ESTONIA,''

''within his historical and ethnic boundaries, is declared as of today an''

''INDEPENDENT DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.''

''The independent Republic of Estonia shall include Harjumaa, Läänemaa, Järvamaa, Virumaa, with the city of Narva and its surroundings, Tartumaa, Võrumaa, Viljandimaa, and Pärnumaa with the Baltic islands of Saaremaa, Hiiumaa, Muhumaa, and others where the Estonians have settled for ages in large majorities. Final determination of the boundaries of the Republic in the areas bordering on Latvia and Russia will be carried out by plebiscite after the conclusion of the present World War.''

''In the aforementioned areas the only supreme and organizing authority is the democratically supported Estonian Salvation Committee created by the Estonian National Council.''

''The Republic of Estonia wishes to maintain absolute political neutrality towards all neighbouring states and peoples and expects that they will equally respond with complete neutrality.''

''Estonian military troops shall be reduced to the extent necessary to maintain internal order. Estonian soldiers serving in the Russian military forces will be called home and demobilized.''

''Until the Estonian Constituent Assembly, elected by general, direct, secret, and proportional elections, will convene and determine the constitutional structure of the country, all executive and legislative authority will remain vested in the Estonian National Council and in the Estonian Provisional Government created by it, whose activities must be guided by the following principles:''

''1. All citizens of the Republic of Estonia, irrespective of their religion, ethnic origin, and political views, are going to enjoy equal protection under the law and courts of justice of the Republic.''

''2. All ethnic minorities, the Russians, Germans, Swedes, Jews, and others residing within the borders of the republic, are going to be guaranteed the right to their cultural autonomy.''

''3. All civic freedoms, the freedom of expression, of the press, of religion, of assembly, of association, and the freedom to strike as well as the inviolability of the individual and the home, shall be irrefutably effective within the territory of the Estonian Republic and based on laws, which the Government must immediately work out.''

''4. The Provisional Government is given the task of immediately organizing courts of justice to protect the security of the citizens. All political prisoners shall be released immediately.''

''5. The city, county, and township local governments are called upon to immediately continue their work, which has been violently interrupted.''

''6. For maintenance of public order, people's militia, subordinated to local governments, shall be immediately organized and citizens' self-defence organizations established in the cities and rural areas.''

''7. The Provisional Government is instructed to work out, without delay, on a broad democratic basis, bills for the solution of the agrarian problem, and the problems of labor, of food supply, and of finances.''

''ESTONIA!''

''You stand on the threshold of a hopeful future in which you shall be free and independent in determining and directing your destiny! Begin building a home of your own, ruled by law and order, in order to be a worthy member within the family of civilized nations! Sons and daughters of our homeland, unite as one man in the sacred task of building our homeland! The sweat and blood shed by our ancestors for this country demand this from us; our forthcoming generations oblige us to do this.''

''May God watch over thee''
&lt;br&gt;
''And amply bless''
&lt;br&gt;
''Whatever thou undertake''
&lt;br&gt;
''My dear fatherland!''

''Long live the independent democratic Republic of Estonia!''

''Long live peace among nations!''

''The Council of Elders of the Estonian National Council''
&lt;br&gt;
''Tallinn, 21 February 1918''

"FYI" is commonly used in e-mail, instant messaging or memo and messages, typically in the message subject, to flag the message as an informational message, with the intent to communicate to the receiver that he/she may be interested in the topic, but is not required to perform any action.  It is also commonly used in informal and business spoken conversations.

The usage of "FYI" dates back at least as far as 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248803 |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary |website=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable early usage occurs in a 1959 episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', "[[One for the Angels]]."

Among [[Internet Standard]]s, FYIs are a subset of the [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfc-editor.org/fyi-index.html |title=RFC Search Detail |website=Rfc-editor.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet users with a central repository of information about any topics which relate to the Internet.  FYIs topics may range from historical memos on  "Why it was done that way" to answers to commonly asked operational questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F.Y.I. on F.Y.I.|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1150|publisher=[[IETF]]|accessdate=28 January 2012|author=Malkin, G.|author2=Reynolds, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5820">'''FYIFV''' (standing for "Fuck You, I'm Fully Vested") or '''FYIV'''&lt;ref name="mslex"&gt;[http://www.cinepad.com/mslex.htm The Microsoft Lexicon] (Ken Barnes) [https://web.archive.org/web/20051221055440/http://www.cinepad.com/mslex.htm (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a piece of early [[Microsoft]] [[jargon]] that has become an [[urban legend]]: the claim that employees whose [[stock option]]s were fully [[vesting|vested]] (that is, could be [[Exercise_(options)|exercised]]) would occasionally wear [[T-shirt]]s or [[badge|buttons]] with the initials "FYIFV" to indicate they were sufficiently [[financial independence|financially independent]] to give their honest opinions and leave any time they wished.

In internal usage at Microsoft, it was meant metaphorically to describe intransigent co-workers. In press usage and popular culture, it was used to imply a predatory business culture reaching even to the programmers.

Despite many third-hand reports of Microsoft employees wearing "FYIFV" buttons or shirts, there is only one report of an ''actual'' "FYIFV" T-shirt, worn on the wearer's last day at the company.&lt;ref name="Barr"/&gt;

== Origins of the phrase ==

An [[Option (finance)|option]] allows the holder to buy the stock at a later date for the price at which the option was originally granted. Many Microsoft full-time employees were granted stock options at the start of their employment. The options vested gradually over four and a half years. Because Microsoft's stock price rose significantly between September 1986 and January 2000 and [[Stock_split|split]] 8 times in that period, an employee could buy the stock cheap and sell it at a considerable profit, thus reducing or removing their dependence on their Microsoft salary. Many stayed at Microsoft nevertheless because they enjoyed their work.

Adam Barr, author of the book ''Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters'', tracked down a possible origin for the urban legend:&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/16/13635/2730|title=FYIFV: A Microsoft Urban Legend|last=Barr|first=Adam|date=2001-07-16|website=|publisher=[[Kuro5hin]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228022236/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/16/13635/2730|archive-date=16 July 2001|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-09-30|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|... he made a comment to the effect that some person was wearing their FYIFV T-Shirt that day, meaning that that person was being intransigent about something or other. The intended audience apparently understood that this was an entirely metaphorical reference, but someone else, not involved in the conversation, apparently overheard the crack and related it to Bill {{bracket|[[Bill Gates|Gates]]}}, mis-reporting the story by saying that [Person X] had actually made such a T-Shirt ...}}

{{quotation|I only ever saw one actual FYIFV shirt. The person made it themself and wore it only on their final day at MS. This was maybe '92 or so, years after the original incident.}}

Barr notes also that further options were granted each year, thus an employee could never have been "fully vested."

== "FYIFV" in popular culture ==

The first third-party note of the term appears to be by Paul Andrews in the ''Seattle Times'' in 1989, in the context of Microsoft as a place where hard work and long hours were expected and rewarded:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Andrews|title=Inside Microsoft - A 'Velvet Sweatshop' or a High-Tech Heaven?|work=Seattle Times|date=1989-04-23|accessdate=2015-08-18|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/archive-inside-microsoft-a-velvet-sweatshop-or-a-high-tech-heaven/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Stock options during the company's early growth produced numerous wealthy sub-30-year-olds, and for a while buttons showed up on lapels bearing the inscription FYIFV, standing for "F--- You, I'm Fully Vested."}}

Andrews used the term again when coauthoring the book ''Gates'' with [[Stephen Manes]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Manes|first=Stephen|authorlink = Stephen Manes|author2=Paul Andrews|title=Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry - and Made Himself the Richest Man in America |publisher= Touchstone|location= |isbn=0-671-88074-8|quote=A popular button appeared with the initials FYIFV: Fuck You, I'm Fully Vested. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quote became more common as Microsoft's fortunes rose, used with the implication that alleged predatory business attitudes reached even to the programmers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Gleick |authorlink= James Gleick|title=Making Microsoft Safe for Capitalism |url=http://www.around.com/microsoft.html |work=New York Times Magazine |date=1995-11-05 |accessdate=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Accusations that Microsoft's people lie, cheat and steal information are as much a part of the company's lore as its cadre of millionaires with FYIFV ('.... I'm fully vested') buttons.}} 

The phrase was also used with the implication that Microsoft employees were motivated only by money, rather than software quality, ''e.g.'' in a 2000 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' article on ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John|last=Heilemann | authorlink = John Heilemann |title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html |work=Wired ||page= |date=November 2000 |accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|For years, Softies were wont to sport buttons that read FYIFV: Fuck You, I'm Fully Vested.}}

==Related phrases==

Ken Barnes' ''Microsoft Lexicon'' notes also the term "QVD," or "Quietly Vesting Disease": the loss of enthusiasm of an employee as they approach or pass their vesting date.&lt;ref name="mslex" /&gt;

The '''Forest History Center''' is one of 26 sites run by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]]. Located in [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]], the center focuses on displaying the historical and cultural impact that [[Minnesota|Minnesota's]] forests have had on people and the community.  Historically, logging was a large economic driver,  presently there is a large use of Minnesota forests for recreational purposes. The center allows visitors to see this changing relationship through exhibits, films, tours, historical reenactments, and other educational and recreational programs.

The '''Ghent City Museum''' (in Dutch "Stadsmuseum Gent", "'''STAM'''" in short) is a [[museum]] in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] city of [[Ghent]]. The museum exposes the city history and opened its doors on 9 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/gent-maakt-zich-op-voor-feestelijke-opening-van-stadsmuseum/article-normal-195407.html|title=Gent maakt zich op voor feestelijke opening van Stadsmuseum|publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]]|language=nl|date=5 October 2005|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the collection that is shown, the history of this museum goes back to 1833, the year in which the ''Oudheidkundig Museum van de Bijloke'' in Ghent was founded. In 1928 the museum was situated in the ''Bijloke'' abbey - this led to the name ''Bijlokemuseum''.

With the Bijloke collection as base and the Bijloke abbey and Bijloke monastery as buildings, the STAM functions as a modern-day heritage forum. Parts from other collections were added to the Bijloke collection. In connection to the historical buildings a new entrance building was constructed, designed by Ghent's city architect Koen Van Nieuwenhuyse.

The main circuit of the Ghent City Museum serves as a museal and multimedial introduction to a visit to the city of Ghent. The past of the town is illustrated, but also today's life and the future are discussed. The temporary STAM collections describe the phenomenon of "urbanity" by means of contemporary issues. STAM refers the visitor to the city itself and to Ghent's cultural heritage.

The Ghent City Museum was the winner of the 2012 [[Flanders|Flemish]] Museum Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20120522_220|title=Gentse STAM wint MuseumPrijs 2012|newspaper=[[De Standaard]]|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eyecatchers==
Eyecatching parts of the museum are the sky picture of Ghent (300 m² large) on which the visitors can walk around, and software with which Ghent can be viewed in detail and over the course of four centuries. In the Bijloke abbey that can be accessed through a passerelle in glass, the history of the city is told by means of three hundred objects. ''Views on Ghent'' is another multimedial application: a screen shows a city view from the year 1534, floor-plans from 1614 and 1912 and a sky picture from the present. There is also a room for temporary exhibitions.

The '''Hall of Remembrance''' was a series of paintings and sculptures commissioned, in 1918, by the [[British War Memorials Committee]] of the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in commemoration of the dead of [[World War One]]. 

==History==
[[File:Spencer, Stanley (Sir) (RA) - Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing-Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing-Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916'' by [[Stanley Spencer]]]]
The artworks commissioned for the Hall of Remembrance were to be devoted to 'fighting subjects, home subjects and the war at sea and in the air' and were to be displayed in a specially built structure. The building was to be designed to accommodate a series of paintings based upon the dimensions of the large trptych, ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], one part of which is now in the [[National Gallery]].&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 13 November 2008|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/13/gassed-john-singer-sargent#|title = 'Gassed', by John Singer Sargent|format = |publisher = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was initiated by [[Lord Beaverbrook]], the then Minister of Information and echoed the scale of a war art programme he had launched for the government of Canada. Although the architect [[Charles Holden]] completed a design for the building, the plan was abandoned and those artworks that had been completed, along with works donated by [[Muirhead Bone]], [[William Orpen]] and Sir [[John Lavery]] were incorporated into the art collection that was part of the establishment of the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name="WW1Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2008|title=Art from the First World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USmalley"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ulrike Smalley|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-the-british-government-sponsored-the-arts-in-the-first-world-war |title=How The British Government Sponsored The Arts In The First World War  |date=|accessdate=28 September 2016|work=Imperial War Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Holden's plans for the building have been lost, Muirhead Bone described the structure as a "kind of Pavilion", surrounded by a garden, with a main gallery leading to an oratory with a dedication to the "coming Brotherhood of Man for which we all pray."&lt;ref name="BTruth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Cork|publisher=Yale University Press &amp; The Barbican Art Gallery|year=1994|title=A Bitter Truth - Avant Garde Art and the Great War|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre piece of the Hall were to be  four 'super-pictures', each 20 feet long by 7 feet high and each on the theme of cooperation between Britain and its various allies.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merion Harries &amp; Susie Harries|publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |ISBN=0 7181 2314 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Orpen]] was offered the commission for the Britain and its Italian allies picture but refused, as he did not want to leave the Western Front for a trip to Italy. [[Augustus John]] accepted the commission to produce the Anglo-French super-picture but the painting, ''Junction of Our Lines with the French'' never materialised. [[John Singer Sargent]] was tasked with depicting Anglo-American cooperation but failed to find an appropriate scene whilst visiting the Somme and instead presented the picture known as ''[[Gassed (painting)|Gassed]]''. The fourth super-picture, of troops from the Empire, was never commissioned.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

The '''Hull History Centre''' is an archive and local studies library in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], England, that houses the combined collections of both the [[Hull City Council]] and [[University of Hull|Hull University]] archives and local studies resources. This collaboration between [[Hull City Council]], [[University of Hull|Hull University]], and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] made Hull the first city in the UK to unite local council and university collections under one roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/news/10-000-people-visit-Hull-History-Centre/article-1932521-detail/article.html |title=10,000 people visit Hull History Centre |publisher=This is Hull and East Riding |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before the creation of the Hull History Centre, Hull's archives were kept at three separate repositories: the [[University of Hull]], the Local Studies Library, and the Hull City Archives. The partnership that led to the purpose-built history centre in Hull began nearly ten years ago, springing out of a desire to provide greater accessibility to, and better preservation facilities for, the archives. Plans began to develop between [[Hull City Council]] and the [[University of Hull]], and ultimately the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] made the dream a reality by providing the Hull History Centre with a £7.7&amp;nbsp;million grant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/6921745.stm|title=Port to get £7.7m archive centre|date=30 July 2007|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest ever lottery grant for a UK archive project. Building for the centre began in late 2007 and on 25 January 2010, the Hull History Centre was finally opened to the public.&lt;ref name="culture1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%2526+heritage/art74808 |title=£10 million Hull History Centre ready for opening as final archives arrive |publisher=Culture24 |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building itself was designed by architectural firm [[Pringle Richards Sharratt]] with the goals of providing a highly accessible and visible structure, as well as a focus of local pride. The design of the upper floor features an environmentally controlled repository while the ground level features public spaces adjoined by a linear arcade overlooking a new park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkirk |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/hull-history-centre-opens/3156937.article |title=Hull History Centre opens &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Building Design |publisher=Bdonline.co.uk |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Icelandic Encyclopedia A-Ö''''' is an encyclopedia in the [[Icelandic language]] published in 1990 by [[Örn og Örlygur]]. The book is in three volumes, containing about 37,000 tags and 4,500 drawings and maps, and is also the first Icelandic encyclopedia. The editors were [[Dora Hafsteinsdóttir]] and [[Sigrid Harðardóttir]]. Another printing came out in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2694698 |title=Dagur, 11.04.1991 |publisher=Timarit.is |date= |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is based on the Danish [[Fakta, Gyldendals etbinds leksikon]] issued in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismennt.is/vefir/malbjorg/kafli9.htm |title=9 |publisher=Ismennt.is |date= |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contracts on the encyclopedia were reached in 1987 and originally planned to come out in a parallel Danish edition.

'''James Mark Cornette''' is an American [[podcaster]], former [[professional wrestling]] [[Booker (professional wrestling)|booker]], [[Announcer|commentator]], [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], and occasional [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].
As a manager, commentator, member of the booking committee and member of the creative team, he has worked for [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), [[Mid-South Wrestling]] (MSW), [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP), [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and the World Wrestling Federation (now called [[WWE]]), and from 1991 to 1995, was the owner of [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). He has also worked as an on-screen character in an authoritative role; as "Commissioner" of [[Ring of Honor]]  and "Management Director" (and off-screen [[road agent (professional wrestling)|road agent]]) for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]].

==Career==
Born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Cornette always loved wrestling, reportedly installing a ten-foot antenna on top of his house as a youth so he could watch as much regional wrestling as possible. He began working at wrestling events at the age of 14, serving as a photographer, ring announcer, timekeeper, magazine correspondent, and [[public relations]] correspondent. During this time, from attending matches at the Louisville Gardens, Cornette got to know promoter Christine Jarrett, who was also the mother of [[Jerry Jarrett]], promoter of the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (commonly known as the "Memphis" territory). His dedication was such that he timed television shows with a stopwatch and would present her with typed formats for every show.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cornette |first1=Jim |authorlink1=Jim Cornette |last2=Ash |first2=Tim  |date=2010 |title=The Midnight Express 25th Anniversary Scrapbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2016}}

===Continental Wrestling Association (1982–1983)===
By 1982, Cornette was now also writing programs for arena shows, having photos published in wrestling magazines, and contributing to Championship Wrestling Magazine. In August, he travelled to Memphis to see the TV match between [[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Ric Flair]]. After the show ended, Cornette was tapped on the shoulder by promoter Jerry Jarrett, and asked if he wanted to become a manager on television. As Cornette has recalled, despite his presence being tolerated at shows and TV tapings for nearly a decade, the first time he was allowed into the locker room was only after he had become a manager.

Before making his managing debut Cornette decided to go by James E. Cornette in tribute to legendary wrestling promoter [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]]. Cornette made his ringside debut on September 25, 1982, managing future manager [[Sherri Martell]]. Cornette was given the gimmick of a rich kid turned inept manager whose clients kept firing him after one match. The most notable wrestlers in this angle were [[Dutch Mantel]]l and [[One Man Gang|Crusher Broomfield]] (who would later gain fame as The One Man Gang and Akeem,"The African Dream"). Over the next 14 months Cornette also managed [[Jesse Barr]], and the [[Adrian Street|Exotic Adrian Street]]. Other wrestlers included a trio in Nashville consisting of Carl Fergie, Norman Fredrich Charles III, and the Angel, a trio that he called the "Cornette Dynasty". After a short-lived run in Georgia through a deal Jarrett had with [[Ole Anderson]], Cornette returned to Memphis in July 1983, and worked as co-manager alongside [[Jimmy Hart]].

===Mid-South Wrestling (1983–1984)===
In November 1983, Mid-South promoter [[Bill Watts]] recognised his business was down, and was looking to reinvigorate his territory. Watts asked Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler to visit a TV taping and offer their opinions. Jarrett suggested a talent trade, and invited Watts to Memphis to see who he liked. After watching a Memphis TV taping, Watts took singles performers [[Dennis Condrey]] and [[Bobby Eaton]] to create a new tag team, and also took the existing team of [[Ricky Morton]] and [[Robert Gibson (wrestler)|Robert Gibson]] as the [[Rock and Roll Express]]. Watts also noticed the brash young manager in Cornette, and in his own words, recalled "He was so obnoxious I wanted to slap him",&lt;ref name="The Cowboy and the Cross"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watts |first1=Bill |authorlink1=Bill Watts |date=2006 |title=The Cowboy and the Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "I knew he was instant box office if he could get me that riled up".&lt;ref name="The Cowboy and the Cross"/&gt; As the more senior Jimmy Hart was still required by Jarrett, Watts took Cornette to manage his new team, who decided on the name [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]]. Notable wrestlers in the trade who left Mid-South for Memphis included [[Rick Rude]] and [[Jim Neidhart]].

Mid-South Wrestling had to that point been a territory featuring bigger wrestlers, and Cornette has stated that The Midnight Express, the Rock and Roll Express, and himself were probably the five smallest members of the roster when he arrived. The influx of the new talent had an immediate impact, and business first rebounded and then skyrocketed. It was during this time that Cornette acquired his tennis racquet which became his trademark. He has stated he had seen a college movie at the time with an obnoxious rich kid carrying a badminton racquet with him (most likely the 1983 film ''[[Screwballs]]''), so he decided on a tennis racquet. At times Cornette loaded the racquet with a horse shoe to guard against aggressive fans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Feud with Magnum TA and Mr. Wrestling II====
Cornette and The Midnight Express debuted on Mid-South television on November 23, 1983. After the first few weeks in the territory the team faced the Mid-South tag team champions [[Magnum TA]] and [[Mr.Wrestling II]]. At a TV taping for a contract signing for an upcoming championship match, the Midnights and Cornette attacked Magnum TA and tarred and feathered him. The feud continued through to early March 1984, when The Midnight Express won the Mid-South tag team titles after Wrestling II walked out on his partner during a match.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====The Last Stampede====
At a TV taping on March 14, 1984, Cornette and the Midnights staged a celebration for winning the tag team titles, complete with champagne and birthday cake. While Cornette's back was turned, [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] ran in and shoved Cornette's face in the cake. Cornette was enraged afterwards when Bill Watts replayed the incident on TV as he thought it was funny. This led to a heated altercation between the two, which ended with Watts slapping Cornette. In following weeks, the Midnight Express and Cornette attacked and bloodied Watts leading him to come out of retirement. In a series of matches termed "The Last Stampede", Watts and a masked teammate in Stagger Lee (suspected to be [[Junkyard Dog]] under a mask) faced the Midnight Express and Cornette all through the territory. The stipulations were simple; if the Midnights won Cornette would run Mid-South Wrestling for 60 days; if they lost, Cornette would be stripped down and forced to wear either a diaper or a dress (the outfits varied by venue). Over 5 weeks, the Last Stampede series shattered box office records for Mid-South, with a record gate and attendance at the Sam Houston Coliseum in Texas, combined attendance of 20,000 people in Tulsa and Oklahoma City (on the same day), and a crowd of 23,000 people at the New Orleans Superdome.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Rock and Roll Express Rivalry====
Cornette's time in Mid-South was also notable as it marked the beginning of the rivalry with the Rock and Roll Express. Starting in May 1984 immediately following the Last Stampede series, the two teams feuded all through the remainder of the year to packed crowds all through the territory. In particular, the two teams set attendance records in Houston, Tulsa and Oklahoma City, making 1984 the most successful year in Mid-South history, and The Midnight Express and Cornette national stars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Watts' style and influence====
Cornette has consistently acknowledged that [[Bill Watts]]'s philosophy of believable and credible wrestling, with an unwavering emphasis on toughness, athleticism and serious presentation, has had a major impact on how he thinks the business should be promoted. He has described the promotion as a military school for wrestling, where Watts' strict enforcement of [[kayfabe]], exhausting travel schedule and passionate fans made it a learning experience like no other. Cornette maintains enormous respect for Watts as a promoter, citing his ability to attract huge TV ratings and consistently sold out arenas in a low population area, and describing Watts as a genius. At the same time, he acknowledges the grind of constant matches, long drives, and fan riots was a grueling test of endurance. At one point Cornette worked 103 days straight before being ordered by doctors to have two–four weeks' bed rest. As events transpired, he took six days off before returning to action.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In describing Mid-South Wrestling, Cornette has offered the following example: "Two weeks of our lives, fourteen days, we did two one hour TV shows, fifteen house shows, two all day promo sets, drove 4700 miles in a car while doing that, and I can't speak for anybody else, but I made - and I was only 22 years old, and just pleased as punch to be there - $5600 for two weeks. In 1984. Not bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Back to the Territories' w Jim Cornette &amp; Hacksaw Duggan - 5 Minute Free Preview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGNGWgkO-5Y|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=November 25, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Class Championship Wrestling (1984–1985)===
The Midnight Express with Cornette had a short stay in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) in Texas where they feuded mainly with [[The Fantastics]] ([[Bobby Fulton]] and [[Tommy Rogers (wrestler)|Tommy Rogers]]). When opportunities in WCCW looked to go nowhere, The Midnight Express started to look elsewhere for employment and what they found would give the team national and international exposure. Cornette later reflected that they were willing to give Dallas a try, as they welcomed living in a modern city, as well as the easier travel schedule when compared to Mid-South. However the inability to get any rivalry with the [[Von Erichs]] - and therefore main event money - made the decision to leave for Charlotte an easy one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Jim Crockett Promotions/NWA World Championship Wrestling (1985–1990, 1993)===
====Managing The Midnight Express====
With Cornette as manager, the team were two-time [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) World Tag Team Champions and two-time NWA United States Tag Team champions. As a manager, Cornette was known for both his loud mouth and for his ever-present [[tennis racket]],&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=152|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Cornette often used to ensure victory for his wrestlers, with the implication that the racket case was loaded. Cornette was at his best as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] manager; fans loved to see the constantly yelling Cornette and his equally annoying charges beaten and humiliated. He and the Midnights were so hated, in fact, that they had to be escorted by police to and from the ring at the house shows and have a police escort to the city limits for fear of being attacked by overzealous fans.

Additionally, Cornette suffered a severe knee injury during a scaffold match between The Midnight Express and [[The Road Warriors]] at [[Starrcade 1986|Starrcade '86]]. In a shoot interview, Cornette recounted that [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] convinced him to perform a dangerous stunt where he would fall off of the high scaffold, which Cornette estimated was twenty-five feet off the floor of the arena but about five feet less when measured from the ring mat to the top of the scaffold. The idea was that [[Paul Ellering]], the manager of The Road Warriors, would chase Cornette up the scaffold. Once he was there, he would be met by [[Road Warrior Animal]], who would assist him in getting underneath the scaffold, where Cornette would hang and then drop when ready. Cornette, however, suffered from a severe case of [[acrophobia]] and decided that the drop, which he estimated was a total of fourteen feet when he factored in his total body length of eight feet (height plus extended arm length), was, as he put it, "way too Goddamn far."

Condrey, Eaton, and Cornette discussed an alternative: [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bubba Rogers]], another wrestler of Cornette's, would catch the manager. However, as Rogers was wearing dark sunglasses inside the arena he misjudged his position and Cornette actually landed flat on his feet, three feet away from Rogers. Cornette tore all the ligaments in one of his knees, broke a bone and damaged the [[cartilage]]. The injury was so extensive that when Cornette finally saw a doctor to have the knee drained, the amount of [[blood]] and fluid filled an entire [[bedpan]]. Cornette later said that he knew he might get seriously hurt when he was told he would have to fall off a scaffold, but that performing in front of such a large audience was more important than his own health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Cornette &amp; The Scaffold Match |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBit9dfpmRg |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=August 26, 2016 |date=April 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603192947/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBit9dfpmRg |archivedate=June 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Cornette became the color commentator for [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]' nationally syndicated NWA television show, and later took over the same role on the Saturday night [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] broadcasts alongside play-by-play announcer [[Jim Ross]].

In 1989, Cornette became a [[booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] on WCW's creative team. As such, Cornette helped write storylines and shape the format of its television shows. Due to friction and animosity between himself and WCW head [[Jim Herd]], Cornette quit the company after [[Halloween Havoc 1990]].

====Return====
In January 1993 Cornette briefly returned to [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) when WCW was doing a talent trade with [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). [[Bill Watts]], who was the current WCW Executive Vice President, brought [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] back to WCW and billed them as the [[SMW Tag Team Championship|Smoky Mountain tag team champions]]. This incensed Cornette since his team [[the Heavenly Bodies]] ([[Stan Lane]] and [[Tom Prichard]]) were the current champions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pro Wrestling Illustrated, June 1993 issue, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 6, 1993  episode on ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'', Jim Cornette, the Bodies and [[Bobby Eaton]] (who Cornette once again began to manage) confronted the Express during an interview. Bill Watts came out and suggested the Bodies should wrestle the Express. Cornette objected since he claimed that they weren't dressed for it, but the match still took place. The Express won the match by DQ when Eaton interfered in the match, and after the match while Lane held Morton, Cornette put his tennis racket over Morton while Eaton delivered his "Alabama jam" on Morton. Cornette then struck referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]], and then Cornette helped his men beat up the Express.

The following week, Watts came out with the SMW commissioner [[Bob Armstrong]], who stated he was very upset with Cornette's recent actions, and demanded that Cornette come out to apologize for what he had done. Watts stated that the Express was scheduled to wrestle the Wrecking Crew ([[Al Green (wrestler)|Rage]] and [[Marcus Laurinaitis|Fury]]) at [[SuperBrawl III]], but then said the Express should wrestle the Bodies instead. Armstrong agreed with Watts and then told Cornette if his Bodies did not wrestle the Express at SuperBrawl III that he would be heavily fined, the Bodies would be stripped of the title, and that he would be suspended. Cornette was very angry and claimed "That he hated WCW!" and later came out to the ring with his men, and attacked two [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbers]] after a match, one being [[Joey Maggs]]. The Express then came out and attacked Cornette and his gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoky Mountain Invaded WCW First! 1993|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Nvf6kNNG8|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=August 26, 2016|date=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Cornette's second stint in WCW, his Heavenly Bodies teamed with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] and [[Brian Pillman]] in 8-man tag team matches against the Express and the Unified tag team champions [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Shane Douglas]]. The Bodies, Austin and Pillman lost two of those matches, one on a February 27 episode of ''[[WCW Worldwide]]'' by DQ when Cornette interfered, and one by pinfall.&lt;ref&gt;Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between the Bodies and Express would take place in both SMW and WCW. Bobby Eaton would go to SMW where he would team in 6-man tag team matches with the Bodies. In one of these matches, the Express had a person covered by a sheet in their corner, and after the match Cornette with his men came to the ring to see who was under the sheet and began poking, and kicking at the sheeted man. When Cornette pulled the sheet off, it was [[Arn Anderson]], Eaton's former tag team partner in [[The Dangerous Alliance]], who was underneath; Cornette then fell over in shock. Eaton then tried to shake Anderson's hand, but Arn decked him. Arn said the reason for this was because after he was injured by [[Erik Watts]] at a [[Filling station|gas station]], Eaton never once called him to see how he was doing. Cornette belittled Anderson and claimed that his men were far superior to him.&lt;ref&gt;Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, pp.62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton was also very successful in Smoky Mountain, and under Cornette's guidance he won the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship|SMW TV title]].&lt;ref&gt;Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; When the Bodies faced the Express at SuperBrawl III, Eaton came out with Cornette, he was despite Cornette's protests forced to return to the dressing room. Like almost always Cornette tried to interfere in the match. When Cornette climbed onto the ring apron and began to argue with the referee, the Express won the match by pinfall when an illegal outside attempt from Eaton, who had since come back to the ring failed.

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1991–1995)===
A firm believer in "old-school" territorial wrestling, Cornette began the Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion in 1991.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; SMW promoted shows in Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. By this point, however, the nature of wrestling in the U.S. had already changed irrevocably, leading Cornette to seek a working relationship with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] in 1993. This did not change the new national perception that regional promotions were "minor league". The move also did not help the federation's finances, and Cornette closed SMW's doors in November 1995 and sold all SMW rights and videos to the WWF. Cornette later said that he chose the wrong time to start a wrestling federation because the business as a whole was in a [[recession]].

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1993–2005)===
Cornette went to the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1993 while still serving as promoter of SMW. As he had done in other promotions, Cornette held several positions in the WWF, including manager, color commentator and member of the booking committee. Cornette's most notable managerial role in the WWF was as the "American spokesperson" of WWF Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; Cornette joined the WWF full-time in 1996 after the demise of SMW, and had a major role in scouting and developing new talent.

On screen, he led a top heel stable of wrestlers referred to as "[[Camp Cornette]]". At any given time, Cornette's charges consisted of Yokozuna, [[Mantaur]], [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], [[Owen Hart]], and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]]. He also served as the manager of [[Tom Prichard]] and [[Jimmy Del Ray]] during their brief stint in the WWF.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; In 1997, Cornette became a member of the WWF announce team where he served as a color commentator. It was during this time that he also began performing a series of controversial [[Worked shoot|"worked shoots"]] where he would praise what he felt was right and condemn what he felt was wrong in professional wrestling. Although the segments were produced by the WWF, Cornette did not hesitate to give praise to WCW wrestlers that he felt deserved it. Cornette also became active behind the scenes working on the booking committee for several years before being removed after frequently butting heads with head writer [[Vince Russo]]. 

Cornette also was part of the television production staff during this time but eventually left this position as well due in part to constant conflict with producer [[Kevin Dunn]]. Cornette later recounted that things came to a head in Halifax, Nova Scotia in the summer of 1997. During the production meeting for ''Raw'', which was to feature the newly signed [[Del Wilkes|The Patriot]], Cornette repeatedly tried to steer the discussion toward the treatment of what he thought was a new top of the line heroic character. Dunn told Cornette that he found him to be "tiresome" for continuing to harp on the issue, which enraged Cornette to the point where he mocked Dunn's buck teeth and threatened to assault him in front of everyone in the room. He was eventually forced to apologize to Dunn for his actions.

In 1998, Cornette led an [[The NWA (wrestling stable)|NWA invasion]],&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; based on the old Crockett Promotions territory, with a stable including [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Barry Windham]] and [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]]. Later that year, Cornette managed [[Dan Severn]] and [[New Midnight Express|The New Midnight Express]]&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; before he stepped back from managing. Cornette then did some color commentating, primarily on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'', before disappearing from television. Cornette returned to WWF television for one night at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] in [[Houston]], where he took part in the "gimmick battle royal" but was quickly eliminated by [[Hillbilly Jim]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

Cornette later became lead booker and part owner of [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], WWE's lead developmental territory at the time, run by  [[Daniel Briley|"Nightmare" Danny Davis]]. As a talent developer, Cornette had previously been instrumental in developing current and former WWE Superstars such as [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[D'Lo Brown]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]] and [[Al Snow]] during his time running SMW. WWE credits Cornette with helping foster numerous successful superstars including [[John Cena]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Randy Orton]] and [[Brock Lesnar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/jim-cornette|title=Jim Cornette|website=wwe.com|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, Cornette was suspended for several weeks by WWE after slapping OVW developmental wrestler [[Santino Marella|Anthony Carelli]] backstage after Carelli had [[Sell (professional wrestling)#Sell|"no-sold"]] fellow wrestler [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|The Boogeyman]] by laughing at him during a live OVW event. Shortly after Cornette returned from his suspension, a separate incident occurred and the WWE released him from his contract in July 2005. In the spring of 2007, Carelli, who had since been called up to the WWE as Santino Marella, appeared on a Canadian radio program where he publicly challenged Cornette to a match despite Cornette working for rival promotion TNA at the time.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006–2009)===
In 2006, Cornette joined TNA Wrestling as the new face of TNA Management. He held the title of "Management Director" according to the press releases following his premiere at the [[Slammiversary (2006)|Slammiversary]] PPV event on June 18, 2006 in Orlando, Florida. After a brief speech, he departed, but returned at the end of the show in light of the "Orlando Screwjob", taking the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] belt after [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Larry Zbyszko]] and [[Earl Hebner]] successfully executed a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|screwjob]] on [[Christian Cage]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].

As the figurehead "Management Director" of TNA, Cornette did not usually take up more than ten minutes of the show, which can be attributed to both his quick tongue and TNA's lack of desire to create another [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]]. [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]] had also become Cornette's on-screen bodyguard to prevent harm to his physical being, until leaving that post to become a full-time wrestler. Part of Cornette's gimmick was that when multiple situations build up at once, he often takes care of them all swiftly by getting all the TNA wrestlers to come out to the Impact! Zone for a "company meeting" to hear his decisions, or exasperatedly deal swiftly with people who barge into his office. The clear impact of this feature was made evident right from the start, as the first "company meeting" (which aired on the edition of June 29, 2006 of ''[[TNA Impact!]]''), where every wrestler was asked to come out and stand at either ramp, saw Cornette clear up several issues:

*Forcing [[The Latin American Xchange]] to start wrestling again under the threat of [[termination of employment|termination]].
*Booking [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] and Zbyszko in a hair vs. hair match against each other for [[Victory Road (2006)|Victory Road 2006]].
*Disbanding [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] as a result of their overly cheating ways (he would later offer them a match which, if they won, would allow them to stay as a unit, with the winner to get a future shot at the championship of their choice; they would lose the match).
*Firing [[Earl Hebner]] for his role in the "Orlando Screwjob" at [[Slammiversary (2006)|Slammiversary 2006]]. (Hebner had since been rehired, due to a lie detector test on [[Jeff Jarrett]]).
*Booking [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] and [[Gail Kim]] in a match against [[Jaime Dauncey|Sirelda]], [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Christopher Daniels]] in an intergender six-person tag team matchup with Styles and Daniels' [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] on the line.
*Booking a fatal four-way between [[Christian Cage]], [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], [[Scott Steiner]], and [[Samoa Joe]] for [[Victory Road (2006)|Victory Road 2006]].
*Finally declaring Jeff Jarrett the official [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] given that Jarrett defended his title against the winner of the fatal four-way at Victory Road.

Cornette was released from TNA on September 15, 2009. He has said that he was released because he was not "100 percent" behind TNA's creative team, headed by [[Vince Russo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_35554.shtml#.WUyw3ZLytxA|title=TNA News: Jim Cornette says why he was fired by TNA, describes conversation with Dixie Carter on his firing|date=September 22, 2009|last=Caldwell|first=James|accessdate=June 23, 2017|work=PWTorch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to ROH and OVW (2009–2012)===
[[File:Cornette and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Pearce.jpg|thumb|upright|Cornette (right) with [[Adam Pearce]]]]
In 2009, Cornette signed a contract with [[Ring of Honor]] to be their Executive Producer for the ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'' show on [[HDNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/TNA/article1007987.shtml|title=TNA News: Jim Cornette comments publicly for the first time since he was released by TNA|date=September 22, 2009|last=Powell|first=Jason|accessdate=September 22, 2009|publisher=ProWrestling.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornette made his surprise return to ROH at [[Glory By Honor|Glory by Honor VIII: The Final Countdown]] on September 26, announcing he was the new Executive Producer for the show. Cornette made his first appearance on ''Ring of Honor Wrestling'' on the December 7 episode and immediately made waves by putting ROH champion [[Austin Aries]] into a 4-way title match later that night and created the Pick 6 contender series.

On September 8, 2010, [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] announced that Cornette would resume his duties as the head booker of the promotion.&lt;ref name=OVWBooker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_43652.shtml|title=ROH/OVW News: Jim Cornette announced as new OVW matchmaker; "working relationship" announced between ROH &amp; OVW|first=James|last=Caldwell|date=September 9, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornette left OVW in November 2011, when the promotion announced a working agreement with TNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/quicknews/article_54972.shtml|title=Clarifications on TNA-OVW relationship, Cornette's standing with OVW|date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=November 8, 2011|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the edition of January 21 of Ring of Honor television, Cornette announced that chairshots to the head were banned and anyone that did so would be fined $5,000. On the February 4 telecast, Cornette made another ban in which the piledriver—in any form—is banned.

On October 8, 2012, it was reported that ROH had replaced Cornette as the head booker with [[Delirious (wrestler)|Hunter Johnston]], a wrestler who performed under the name Delirious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/72495/big-change-to-roh-creative.html?p=1 |title=Big Change To Roh Creative |publisher=PWInsider.com |date=October 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROH wrote Cornette off television by having him suffer storyline injuries at the hands of [[Jay Lethal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_65878.shtml|title=Indy News: Big DGUSA Title match set, ROH footage of Lethal snapping|date=October 11, 2012|last=Caldwell|first=James|accessdate=October 11, 2012|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2012, it was revealed that Cornette had left the promotion. The reason for Cornette's absence stems from a outburst he had at the November 3 ROH television taping. At the taping, ROH talent [[Steve Corino]] suffered an injury, and no ROH officials were still at the venue to be able to pay for Corino's immediate medical attention or even arrange for an ambulance to be called. This left Corino in pain for hours and Cornette to be the only person there with enough power to handle the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2012/11/30/3711260/jim-cornette-on-sabbatical-from-ring-of-honor-roh-after-temper-tantrum |title=Jim Cornette "on sabbatical" from Ring of Honor (ROH) after temper tantrum |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his departure from Ring of Honor, Cornette decided to take an extended break from professional wrestling to focus on his health and work on personal projects.

===Return to WWE (2017)===
On March 31, 2017, Jim Cornette made his first appearance with WWE in 12 years when he inducted [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] Class of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Melok |first=Bobby |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwe-hall-fame/wwe-hall-of-fame-2017/article/jim-cornette-rock-n-roll-express-wwe-hall-of-fame |title=Jim Cornette to induct The Rock ‘n’ Roll Express into the WWE Hall of Fame |publisher=[[WWE]] |date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornette was also featured in an episode of the WWE Network Original series "Table For 3" alongside Eric Bischoff and Michael Hayes. Since then Cornette made another appearance for WWE, starring in an episode of the WWE Network Original Series "Photo Shoot" in March 2018.

===Return to GFW (2017)===
Cornette returned to the newly rebranded Global Force Wrestling, previously known as both TNA and Impact Wrestling, on August 17, 2017, at [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X]] and fired [[Bruce Prichard]]. Cornette stated that he was put in charge by [[Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment|Anthem]] to resolve the [[Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship]] situation. Cornette made the decision to book [[Low Ki]] as the twentieth entrant in the GFW World Heavyweight Championship gauntlet match. On September 18, Cornette confirmed he was done with GFW. He had been brought in by Jeff Jarrett and the original agreement only included one set of tapings. With Jarrett out of the company, the new GFW creative team was said to be more focused on in-ring action and less on authority figures. According to Cornette, there was no "heat" between him and GFW.&lt;ref name=DonewithGFW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f4wonline.com/tna-news/bound-glory-headed-ottawa-jim-cornette-done-impact-243026 |title=Bound for Glory headed to Ottawa, Jim Cornette done with Impact | last=Meltzer | first=Dave | authorlink=Dave Meltzer |date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cornette and his longtime girlfriend Stacey Goff were married October 31, 2007. Stacey was a former independent wrestling manager who went by the name "Synn". Synn was the OVW manager of the Disciples of Synn which included [[Dave Bautista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2009/01/21/8104131.html|title=Cornette talks highs and lows from today and yesterday|accessdate=January 22, 2009|work=[[SLAM! Wrestling]]|date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, during a podcast interview on ''Who's Slamming Who?'' he voiced his support for President [[Barack Obama]]'s health care reform plans. He also condemned what he considered "fearmongering" from the Republican Party as well as calling former Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] "a useless twat". He acknowledged having voted for Obama in the 2008 election and considers himself a Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lphANmGRhI|title=Jim Cornette Shoots on People Who Complain About His Political Rants|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=October 1, 2016|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political statements have led to media attention, including an appearance on Internet talk show ''[[The Young Turks (talk show)|The Young Turks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOoX4KxY_2s|title=Former WWF Manager Jim Cornette!!|publisher=YouTube|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabecommentaries.com/DVD_YS_Cornette.html|title=YouShoot – Jim Cornette|publisher=Kayfabecommentaries.com|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 2017, Cornette stated that he is a [[democratic socialist]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/TheJimCornette/status/942503165781532672&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knox County, Tennessee]] mayor [[Tim Burchett]] declared November 17, 2014 "Jim Cornette Day" during a Southeastern Championship Wrestling taping in Knoxville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/89627/knoxville-tn-celebrates-jim-cornette-day.html?p=1|title=Knoxville, TN celebrates Jim Cornette Day|work=Pro Wrestling Insider|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, former WWF/WCW/TNA writer [[Vince Russo]] filed a restraining order (EPO) against Cornette for "stalking". They have had a 20-year off-screen rivalry. Cornette then began selling autographed copies of the restraining order on his personal website.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cornette is an [[atheist]]; in the past he had been highly critical of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=552905961741221888|user=TheJimCornette|title=Muslims kill journalists, Christians kill abortionists, bible says God killed EVERYBODY once-us atheists are only ones who don't kill anyone|accessdate=August 26, 2016|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornette has a [[criminal record]] which includes a number of assaults, mostly stemming from incidents involving fights with fans who attacked him while he was a manager in the 1980s. The record has made it difficult for him to work in Canada, which resulted in him being turned away from the border in November, 2010 resulting in a lifetime ban.&lt;ref name=DonewithGFW/&gt;

[[File:Leicester Abbey ruins west of cloister.jpg|thumb|Abby ruins [[Leicester Abbey|St Mary of the Meadows]]]]
'''''Knighton's Chronicon''''' (also ''Knighton’s Leicester Chronicle'', ''Henry Knighton's chronicle'') is an English [[chronicle]] written by [[Henry Knighton]] in the fourteenth century. He referred to it as his "work in hand" that he wrote while at the Augustinian abbey of "[[Leicester Abbey|St. Mary of the Meadows]]", associated with the [[House of Lancaster]], where he was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]].&lt;ref&gt; Martin, p. xv &lt;/ref&gt; 

==The chronicle==

Knighton wrote a four-volume chronicle, first published in 1652, giving the history of England from 959 to 1366. It was originally considered that a fellow canon completed the work in a fifth book, covering the years 1377 to 1395, probably due to Knighton's growing [[blindness]] (see the "Continuator of Knighton", below). The earlier books (to 1337) are simply re-workings of earlier histories. But the latter two books are vital to the contemporary study of the period, since they were written by informed scholars who actually lived through the times they write about. The latter two books give us an exemplary and detailed first-hand insight into the 14th century - such as the effects of the [[Black Death]] and the consequent breakdown of the [[feudal]] system, and precise details of the systems of wages and prices in England. He also reflects the prejudices common among the clergy at the time; notably being against the translation of the [[Bible]] into the common tongue, lamenting the low standards of scholarship among young religious clerks, and being strongly against the rising of the [[Lollards]].

:"This Master [[John Wyclif]] translated into the Anglic (English) -not Angelic-tongue, the Gospel that Christ gave to the clergy and the doctors of the Church, that they might minister it gently to laymen and weaker persons, according to the exigence of their time, their personal wants, and the hunger of their minds; whence it is made vulgar by him, and more open to the reading of laymen and women than it usually is to the knowledge of lettered and intelligent clergy; and thus the pearl of the Gospel is cast forth and trodden under the feet of swine."{{ref|wyclif}}

== Continuator of Knighton's Chronicon ==

The ''Continuator of Knighton'' (or "Knighton's Continuator") was a supposed late 14th century [[continuator]] of ''Knighton's chronicle''.

The Continuator's existence was first supposed by the nineteenth-century historian [[Walter Waddington Shirley]], who noted a lengthy break in events described by the Chronicle, and concluded that the later section had been written by a different and unnamed author, commencing in 1377. Shirley also posited that the Continuator had been a foreigner of [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] sympathies, though with little affection for the English language, who had managed to obtain a position in [[Leicester Abbey]].&lt;ref name=aston28&gt; Aston, p. 28 &lt;/ref&gt;

Shirley's theory was taken up by [[J. Rawson Lumby]], a classicist and Hebraicist who edited ''Knighton's Chronicle'' in the 1880s for the [[Rolls Series]]. Despite some reservations about the Continuator's existence, Lumby also concluded a different author had written the post-1377 sections. His division of the Chronicle's authorship was followed by later authors, with the result that the Continuator was referenced in subsequent historical study footnotes of learned historians that followed him.&lt;ref name=aston28/&gt;

The existence of the Continuator was not questioned until 1957, when the historian [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith]] published an in-depth study of the Chronicle's chronology. In particular, he was able to prove that the section of the Chronicle covering later events, from 1377–95, was actually written ''before'' the earlier section, confirming Knighton's probable authorship of both sections.&lt;ref&gt; Gordon, p. 136-145 &lt;/ref&gt; The current academic view agrees with Galbraith in that the Continuator most likely never existed, and Knighton wrote the entire Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt; Myers, p. 37 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Otheruses|Intimidation}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2015}}
A '''legal threat''' is a statement by a party that it intends to take [[legal action]] on another party, generally accompanied by a demand that the other party take an action demanded by the first party or refrain from taking or continuing actions objected to by the demanding party.

==Nature==
Legal threats take many forms.  Common to all is that the party making the [[threat]] will take some form of action of a legal nature.  Most common is the threatened initiation of a  [[lawsuit]] against the second party.  Other threats might include an [[administrative law]] action or complaint, referring the other party to a [[regulatory]] body, turning the party into the legal authorities over a crime or [[civil infraction]], or the like.  Legal threats are often veiled or indirect, e.g. a threat that a party "shall be forced to consider its legal options" or "will refer the matter to legal counsel."

==Types==

===Cease-and-desist===
{{main|Cease and desist}}
A '''cease and desist''' ('''C&amp;D''') letter is a formalized legal demand that a party stop ("cease") and refrain ("desist") from an activity that the demanding party finds objectionable, generally couched in formal language accusing the activity of violating the law.

The objected-to activity may be most anything, although cease-and-desist letters are particularly common among certain areas of the law:
*alleged [[intellectual property]] infringement (e.g. [[patent infringement]], [[trademark infringement]], [[copyright infringement]], etc.)
*alleged [[defamation]] such as [[libel]] and [[slander]]
*[[harassment]], [[nuisance]], and other [[tort]]s
*violation of certain agreements to not engage in certain commercial conduct (e.g. with respect to competition, territories, etc.)
*where a personal financial and legal administrator (e.g. as commonly appointed in Australia) acting under an Order of a court for a represented person (e.g. a person with an alleged disability) for a specified time, as specified in the Order, continues the administration beyond the anniversary date (end date) of the Order, against the represented person's wishes.

===Demand letter===
{{main|Demand letter}}
[[File:civil demand letter.jpg|thumb|A civil recovery demands letter.]] 
A "demand letter" is a formalized demand by a party that another party pay money or take certain acts, often accompanied by a claim that the second party has engaged in illegal conduct, with an implicit or explicit threat that the demanding party will take some form of legal action.

==Effect==
For the most part, a legal threat is of no legal significance other than a matter of negotiation tactics; however, in certain instances a legal threat does have some legal significance.  Among other things, a legal threat may do the following:
* Establish [[notice]] - the party receiving the threat, and the party making the threat, are "on notice" of the circumstances and cannot later claim they were unaware.
* Constitute [[extortion]], [[blackmail]], or some other crime or tort involving improper threats of harm: for example, it is considered unethical, and in some cases a crime, to threaten to report criminal conduct to the police unless a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] is reached.
* In some circumstances, a claim (veiled or not) that a party will take action based on alleged violation of the law gives rise to a right by the receiving party to bring an action for [[declaratory judgment]] that it has not broken the law: for example, if the holder of a [[trademark]] claims that a party is infringing a trademark, that party may bring suit asking a court to declare that there is in fact no infringement.

In addition to their legal significance, legal threats may create a number of practical results:
* Intimidating a party into acquiescing to the demand, whether or not there is a legal basis for it, out of fear of litigation expense, negative publicity, loss of entitlement (e.g. losing a business license), or other negative consequence
* Alerting a party to illegal conduct it was unaware of, or that it did not realize was illegal or objectionable
* Delaying or disrupting lawful and legitimate activity, as the victim of the threats must devote time to obtaining expensive legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/brampton-council-puts-off-issue-of-misspending-by-mayor-councillors/article20771709/|title=Brampton council puts off issue of misspending by mayor, councillors|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risking public disclosure of the threat, thereby portraying the party making the threat in a bad light (see the [[Streisand effect]]). Threats of frivolous litigation against major news organisations are extraordinarily risky in this regard, as the newspaper will most often report the threat in the paper itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10552">'''Masterpoints''' or '''master points''' are points awarded by bridge organisations to individuals for success in competitive [[duplicate bridge|bridge]] tournaments run under their auspices. Generally, recipients must be members in good standing of the issuing organisation. At the international level, competitions and point awards are administered by the [[World Bridge Federation]] (WBF); its affiliates at the multi-national level, such as the [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL), also issue points as do more local organisations such as the [[English Bridge Union]] (EBU), and the [[Deutsche Bridge Verband]] (DBV) and independent ones such as the [[American Bridge Association]] (ABA).

In general, each organisation has its own scheme for the categorization of competitive bridge events and has a parallel scheme for awarding various categories of points to players who are successful in them. Upon reaching certain thresholds in point accumulation or retention, most organisations bestow a rank on the individual in recognition of their achievements. Points and rankings generally have no monetary value, but have prestige value for some players and are sought after by them over a lifetime of play.

In some cases, the point awarding scheme is an important means of raising revenue for the bridge organisation insofar as they charge entry fees for each tournament where points are awarded and their availability acts as an incentive to participation; the more prestigious the points, the higher the entry fees.

In the past, points were issued in the form of paper certificates, which gave the player a tangible record of his or her achievement, but these are now increasingly replaced by electronic recording.

==Awards of Masterpoints==

Players who achieve a high placing in an event sanctioned by the national bridge organisation (a club game, sectional tournament, regional tournament, etc.) are awarded masterpoints according to their placing and the number of pairs, individuals or teams who played in the event.

Some events have an upper masterpoint limit, meaning that only players with a masterpoint holding under the limit may participate. This allows less experienced players more of a chance to place high, since they will not be playing against players who are significantly more experienced. Additionally, some events are stratified. This means that players with various masterpoint holdings play together, but in the final standings, players receive masterpoints based on their position within their stratum. For example, if you are first in stratum C, second in B and fourth in A, and the upper masterpoint limits are 300 for C, 500 for B and 1000 for A, that means that among players with fewer than 300 masterpoints, you did the best. Among players with 500 points or fewer, you did second best, and among players with fewer than 1000, you did fourth best. With those divisions, a player with 700 points would be able to place in stratum A, but not in B or C.

==American Contract Bridge League==
The ACBL awards several categories of masterpoints, each associated with the type of event and designated by a distinct color:
* Unpigmented - awarded in online club games
* Black - awarded in brick-and-mortar club games
* Silver - awarded in sectional tournaments, as well as Sectional Tournaments at Clubs (STaCs)
* Red - awarded in regional tournaments (for places other than overall and section tops), as well as North American Open Pairs (NAP) and Grand National Teams (GNT) games at clubs
* Gold - awarded for overall and section tops in regionals, as well as in NABCs (North American Bridge Championships) with an upper masterpoint limit of 750 or more
* Platinum - awarded in national-rated events with no upper masterpoint limit

Like most bridge governing bodies, the ACBL assigns ranks to players according to their masterpoint holdings; the requirements for its various ranks are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acbl.org/masterpoints-results/masterpoint-ranks/|title=ACBL Masterpoint® Ranks |author=|date=|website=acbl.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masterpoints are partly a measure of skill, but the system is regarded by many players as a measure of experience and longevity rather than skill.  Experience is often related to skill, but not necessarily.  Over the course of a lifetime, a player can earn many points, just with average play.  For example, the same number of masterpoints, and hence the same rank, may have been achieved by Player A over 2 years and by Player B over 20 years.

When an ACBL member achieves the "Life Master" rank, the first digit of their 7-digit ACBL number is replaced with a letter according to the following chart.  (New membership cards are sent accordingly at that rank.)

"Masterpoint" is a registered trademark of the ACBL in the United States.

==World Bridge Federation Master Points==
In contrast, the World Bridge Federation system of [http://www.worldbridge.org/departments/mps/rules.asp Master Points] annually reduces players' holdings of points older than one year by 15% and uses another classification of points, known as Placing Points, to record players' lifetime accumulation. The WBF also distinguishes between points earned in Open, Women's, Mixed or Senior events and awards its Titles (such as World Grand Master), based upon the accumulation and retention scheme for the particular point classification.
[http://www.wbfmasterpoints.com/masterpoints.asp See WBF Master Point Rules] and [http://www.wbfmasterpoints.com/default.asp WBF Master Point Standings]

==Comparison of Masterpoints between organizations==
It is difficult to compare masterpoints between various organizations as they are not consistent in value.

The ACBL awards new ACBL members 10% of their ABA masterpoints (up to a maximum of 200 ACBL black points) and 20% of their WBF masterpoints.

For tournament seeding, the ACBL uses 50% of a person's ABA masterpoints plus their ACBL masterpoints.

For tournament seeding, the ABA uses 200% of a person's ACBL masterpoints (if less than 5,000) plus their ABA masterpoints. If the player has 5,000+ ACBL masterpoints, they are seeded with 10,000 plus their ABA masterpoints.

==Memory of the World Program Background==
The Memory of the World Register is a compendium of documents, manuscripts, oral traditions, audio-visual materials, library, and archival holdings of universal value.&lt;ref name=strategy /&gt; Inscription on the Register leads to improved conservation of the documentary heritage by calling upon the program's networks of experts to exchange information and raise resources for the preservation, digitization, and dissemination of the material.&lt;ref name=2003_memory /&gt; The program also has the goal of using state-of-the-art technologies to provide wider accessibility and diffusion of the items inscribed on the Register.&lt;ref name=2003_memory /&gt;

Any organization or individual can nominate a documentary item for inscription on the Register. During its meetings, the IAC examines the full documentation of the item's description, origin, world significance, and contemporary state of conservation.&lt;ref name=guidelines&gt;{{cite web | title= Memory of the World: General Guidelines to Safeguard Documentary Heritage | date= February 2002 | url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=6644&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050415154244/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=6644&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2005-04-15 | publisher= UNESCO | accessdate= 2009-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, it seems that only two proposals per country are considered in each cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/32367448/Yamamoto_Document_Registry_2017 Mayumi Yamamoto, "Heritage and Diplomacy: A Cultural Approach to UNESCO's Document Registry Program in East Asia"], ''Annual Journal of Cultural Anthropology'', vol. 11 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and the IAC==
In 1992, the program began as a way to preserve and promote documentary heritage, which can be a single document, a collection, a holding or an archival [[fonds]] that is deemed to be of such significance as to transcend the boundaries of time and culture.&lt;ref name=strategy /&gt; This recorded memory reflects the diversity of languages, people, and cultures.&lt;ref name=2005_memory&gt;{{cite web| title= Twenty-nine new documentary collections inscribed on the Memory of the World Register | date=2005-06-21 |url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=28029&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher=UNESCO Press |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO, the world agency responsible for the protection of the world's [[cultural heritage|cultural]] and [[natural heritage]], realized the need to protect such fragile yet important component of cultural heritage. To this end, the Memory of the World Programme was established with the aim of preserving and digitizing humanity's documentary heritage.&lt;ref name=2007_memory&gt;{{cite web | title=Thirty-eight new inscriptions for Memory of the World Register | author=Jasmina Sopova | date=2007-06-20 | url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=38423&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | publisher=UNESCO Press | accessdate=2009-09-06 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111132741/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D38423%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html | archivedate=2009-11-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|People the world over are creating [memories] in forms that are less and less permanent&amp;mdash;be it sound recordings, film, videotape, newsprint, photographs, or computer-based documents. It must be said that the output of the present century alone is probably greater than the total output of all previous centuries put together; and ironically and tragically, it is being lost faster than ever before. It is a tragedy indeed, for what is at stake is the recorded memory of mankind.|200px||Dato’ Habibah Zon, Director-General of the National Archives of Malaysia|introduction from&lt;br&gt;''UNESCO MEMORY OF THE WORLD PROGRAMME: The Asia-Pacific Strategy'', 17 April 1999&lt;ref name=strategy /&gt;}}
The program is administered by the International Advisory Committee (IAC), whose 14 members are appointed by the UNESCO Director-General.&lt;ref name=strategy /&gt;&lt;ref name=2003_memory /&gt; The IAC is responsible for the formulation of major policies, including the technical, legal and financial framework for the program. Regular meetings were held by the IAC in its interim capacity beginning in 1993 to sustain the momentum gained by the program, culminating in the creation of the Memory of the World Register during its second meeting in 1995,&lt;ref name=strategy /&gt;&lt;ref name=1997_report /&gt; with the inaugural batch of documents being inscribed on the Register in 1997, after the statutes that created the IAC as a standing committee took effect.&lt;ref name=1999_report /&gt;
The IAC also maintains several subsidiary bodies:&lt;ref name=IAC&gt;{{cite web | title= International Advisory Committee | date= 2009-08-11 | url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=2254&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160311102614/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=2254&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2016-03-11 | publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme | accessdate= 2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Bureau'': Maintains an overview of the Programme between IAC meetings and makes tactical decisions in liaison with the Secretariat, reviews the use of the Memory of the World logo, and liaises with national Memory of the World committees and monitors their growth and operation.
* ''Technical Sub-Committee'': Develops, regularly revises and promulgates information guides on the preservation of documentary heritage, and offers advice on technical and preservation matters.
* ''Marketing Sub-Committee'': Develops strategies for awareness raising and for increasing financial support for Memory of the World, implements a marketing plan, and compiles and reviews guidelines for the use of the Memory of the World logo.
* ''Register Sub-Committee'': Oversees the assessment of nominations for the Memory of the World International Register and provides recommendations, with reasons, for their inscription or rejection to each meeting of the IAC.

Following the successful establishment of the Register, UNESCO and the Memory of the World Programme have encouraged the creation of national and regional organizations, presumably in part to streamline applications and fund-raising, as well as national and regional registers, which are to focus on documentary heritage of great regional or national importance, but not necessarily of global importance. In the Asia-Pacific region, in 2014-2015, there were 18 member nations of MOWPAC (6 without national committees), while in 2016, there were 16 national MOW committees. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/32367448/Yamamoto_Document_Registry_2017 Mayumi Yamamoto, "Heritage and Diplomacy: A Cultural Approach to UNESCO's Document Registry Program in East Asia"], ''Annual Journal of Cultural Anthropology'', vol. 11 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is not without controversy. During the 2015 cycle, for example, there was a significant degree of conflict within East Asia, as registry with the MOW Program was becoming viewed as an approval of particular views of contested history, specifically with respect to the Nanjing Incident and the comfort women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/32367448/Yamamoto_Document_Registry_2017 Mayumi Yamamoto, "Heritage and Diplomacy: A Cultural Approach to UNESCO's Document Registry Program in East Asia"], ''Annual Journal of Cultural Anthropology'', vol. 11 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Jikji'' Prize==
[[Image:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|The ''Jikji'' is the earliest known book printed with [[Movable type|movable metal type]] in 1377.]]
The ''Jikji'' Prize was established in 2004 in cooperation with the South Korean government to further promote the objectives of the Memory of the World Programme, and to commemorate the 2001 inscription of the country's ''[[Jikji]]'' on the Register.&lt;ref name=2005_report /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=16050&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO/Jikji Memory of the World Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; The award, which includes a cash prize of $30,000 from the Korean government, recognizes institutions that have contributed to the preservation and accessibility of documentary heritage.&lt;ref name=2005_memory /&gt;

The prize has been awarded biennially since 2005 during the meeting of the IAC.&lt;ref name=2005_memory /&gt;

'''''Nema aviona za Zagreb''''' (''There Is No Plane to Zagreb'') is a 2012 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] film by [[Louis van Gasteren]]. The film is a retrospective of events in the director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also [[Jan de Bont]]'s first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's ''[[Basic Instinct]]''.

In 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, "I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible." Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, "I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) – also inwards (points to his chest) – everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room)."&lt;ref&gt;''No Plane for Zabreb'', 2012 film&lt;/ref&gt;

The film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], France, Canada, [[West Germany]], the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white.  

The film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings. 

==Plot==

As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when "anything was possible." He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not.

We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the [[carousel]] and sees the sights, including a "Fat Lady" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds.

From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote [[Communism]] and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day.

The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in [[Belgrade]]. The two decide to book a flight to [[Zagreb]] on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, ''Nema aviona za Zagreb'' ("There is no plane to Zagreb" in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. "What ''Nema'' expresses is good will and a great incapacity. ''Nema'' and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark." What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth.

He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use. 

Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to [[Millbrook, New York]], to meet the LSD-advocate [[Timothy Leary]]. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master [[Meher Baba]] about LSD and the search for God. 

First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.

From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an [[Opel]] automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. [[Marshall McLuhan]] introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer [[Mal Waldron]] about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poetry in English.
 
:''. . . I make up my mind''
:''Not knowing what my mind is.''

At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a [[flamenco]] singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, "a little angel of God."

At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film.

In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute.

The credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word "nema," as "[[Really and Sincerely]]" by the [[Bee Gees]] plays.

==Reception==

Begun in 1964 when Van Gasteren was 42 years old, ''Nema aviona za Zagreb'' finally premiered at [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] on the occasion of Van Gasteren's 90th birthday, 20 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisvangasteren.nl/english/ Louis van Gasteren Official Site (English)]&lt;/ref&gt; Louis van Gasteren was present at the opening and afterwards was interviewed by journalist Raymond van den Boogaard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rialtofilm.nl/podium/Nema%20aviona%20za%20Zagreb%20–%20documentaire%20in%20aanwezigheid%20van%20maker%20Louis%20van%20Gasteren/ rialtofilm.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30 there was a public interview with the author by television critic Hans Beerekamp from [[NRC Handelsblad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyefilm.nl/nema-aviona-za-zagreb EYE film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228011936/http://www.eyefilm.nl/nema-aviona-za-zagreb |date=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vimeo.com called the film "a journey in spiritual and geographical terms"&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/55436391 Vimeo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and Realtofilm.nl wrote, "The film not only gives a peak into a fascinating era, it is a highly original autobiographical portrait."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rialtofilm.nl/podium/Nema%20aviona%20za%20Zagreb%20–%20documentaire%20in%20aanwezigheid%20van%20maker%20Louis%20van%20Gasteren/realitofilm.nl rialtofilm.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviews were negative. Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as "a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmtotaal.nl/recensie.php?id=28349 Filmtotaal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Principal photography for ''Nema'' began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. [[Jan de Bont]] was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012).

Van Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with [[Meher Baba]] for ''Nema aviona za Zagreb''. In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age'', Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation, Inc., 1986, p. 6528&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gasteren told Baba, "The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Seventy Fourth Family Letter, 1 September 1967, ''82 Family Letters'', Mani S. Irani, Sheriar Foundation, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] on September 17, and at [[Meherazad]] at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman [[Jan de Bont]] and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film.

Filming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.linkedin.com/pub/ilja-lammers/5/48a/869 Ilja Lammers at Linkedin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The 35mm film was digitized by [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyefilm.nl/nema-aviona-za-zagreb EYE Film Netherlands - Nema Aviona Za Zagreb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228011936/http://www.eyefilm.nl/nema-aviona-za-zagreb |date=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion financing was received from [[Netherlands Film Fund]] and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began. The film premiered at EYE on Van Gasteren's 90th birthday. Gasteren was present at the opening.

The film is in Dutch and English, with small amounts of French, Italian, Serbian, and Spanish. Available with Dutch or English subtitles.

'''Neo-Zionism''' is a [[right-wing]], [[nationalistic]] and religious [[ideology]] that appeared in [[Israel]] following the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 and the capture of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. Neo-Zionists consider these lands part of Israel and advocate their [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] by [[Israeli Jews]]. Some advocate the transfer of [[Arabs]] not only from these areas but also from within the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].

The term "[[Post-Zionism]]" entered Israeli discourse following the publishing of a book by Uri Ram in 1993.&lt;ref name ="ram2010"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0JctCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Neo-Zionism+1993&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAiuS91oDOAhXM1CYKHY3vDHIQ6AEIIzAB#v=snippet&amp;q=1993&amp;f=false| title = Israeli Nationalism: Social Conflicts and the Politics of Knowledge | author= Uri Ram|publisher = Routledge| year = 2010|page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same volume, [[Gershom Shafir]] contrasted Post-Zionism with what he termed Neo-Zionism.&lt;ref name =" Shohat2006"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gnjxDigrT_AC&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Neo-Zionism+1993&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuspW414DOAhXCyyYKHf9yAaEQ6AEIUjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Neo-Zionism%201993&amp;f=false| title = Taboo Memories, Diasporic Voices| author= Ella Shohat|publisher = Duke University Press| year = 2006|page = 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a widely cited 1996 essay, sociologist Uri Ram used the term Neo-Zionism to describe a political and religious ideology that developed in Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War.&lt;ref name ="Regev"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kAxLAn6sOb4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=ram+neo+zionism+1996&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEwZ-SiPnNAhXJ5CYKHRX4DWIQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=ram%20neo%20zionism%201996&amp;f=false| title = Popular Music and National Culture in Israel | author= Motti Regev |author2=Edwin Seroussi |publisher = University of California Press| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 18}}&lt;ref name ="Leon"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pyD6-i1cwN8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=uri+ram+neo+zionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTop-1x9jKAhUFHx4KHbYsBiAQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=uri%20ram%20neo%20zionism&amp;f=false| title = Who's Left in Israel?: Radical Political Alternatives for the Future of Israel | author= Dan Leon|publisher = Sussex Academic Press| year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 67}}&lt;ref name ="Lenṭin"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8Legh8u8KiEC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=neo+zionism+in+opposition+to+post+zionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj75O-Vku7JAhWDQCYKHaGvCwQQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=neo%20zionism%20in%20opposition%20to%20post%20zionism&amp;f=false | title = Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah: Reoccupying the Territories of Silence | author= Ronit Lenṭin | publisher = Berghahn Books| year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 218}} He considers it as an "exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend" in Israel&lt;ref name = "Chan57"&gt;Uri Ram "Historiosphical Foundations of the Historical Strife in Israel" in ''Israeli Historical Revisionism: from left to right'', [[Anita Shapira]], Derek Jonathan Penslar, Routledge, 2002, pp.57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; that evolved in parallel with, and in opposition to, the [[left-wing]] politics of [[Post-Zionism]] and [[Labor Zionism]].

==Ideology==
Uri Ram contends that Neo-Zionism is not a new phenomenon, instead arguing that it emerged from the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 and the conquest of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding the Middle East Peace Process: Israeli Academia and the Struggle for Identity|first=Asima|last=Ghazi-Bouillon|publisher=Routledge|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}} Ram contends that Jerusalem is the symbolic capital of Neo-Zionism, while Post-Zionism is orientated around Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name =" Kaplan"/&gt;{{rp|187}} It rose with the anxiety following the near loss of the 1973 war.&lt;ref name = "Chan"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2VVsrUFby04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=greater&amp;f=false| title = Israeli Historical Revisionism: From Left to Right |editor1= Anita Shapira|editor2=Derek Jonathan Penslar| author = Uri Ram | chapter = Historiosophical Foundations of the Historical Strife in Israel | publisher = Psychology Press | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}

Neo-Zionists consider "[[Zionism|secular Zionism]]", particularly the [[labor Zionism|labor version]], as too weak on nationalism and that it never understood the impossibility of Arabs and Jews living together in peace. Neo-Zionists claim that the Arab attitude to Israel is inherently rooted in [[anti-Semitism]] and that it is a [[Zionist]] illusion to think living in peace and together with them is possible. They consider [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arabs in Israel]] to be a [[fifth column]] and to pose a [[demographic threat]] to the Jewish majority in Israel. From their point of view, the only solution for achieving peace is through "deterrence and retaliation" or preferably "transfer by agreement" of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] population of the occupied [[Palestinian Territories]] to neighboring [[Arab world|Arab states]].&lt;ref name = "ram"&gt;Uri Ram, [http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch8.pdf "The Future of the Past in Israel - A Sociology of Knowledge Approach"], in [[Benny Morris]], ''Making Israel'', pp. 210-211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uri Ram characterizes both Neo-Zionism and Post-Zionism as reactions to the post-nationalist environment.&lt;ref name ="ram2013"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BXOMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT246&amp;dq=Neo-Zionism+post+national&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5vqP_3YDOAhUQcCYKHb3GD78Q6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Neo-Zionism%20post%20national&amp;f=false| title = The Globalization of Israel: McWorld in Tel Aviv, Jihad in Jerusalem| author= Uri Ram|publisher = Routledge| year = 2013| page = 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Neo-Zionism, "the weakness of Israeli Nationalism derives from his alienation of Jewish sources and culture (...). Only a new national-religious and orthodox coalition [could] cure Zionism of this [[moral bankruptcy]]".&lt;ref name = "ram"/&gt; Neo-Zionists consider all areas under Israeli military control to be part of "the biblical Land of Israel".&lt;ref name = "Chan"/&gt;{{rp|57}} Neo-Zionists assert that the goal of Jewish statehood is not only about creating a safe refuge for Jews but also about the national-historic destiny of the people of Israel in the land of Israel.

For Uri Ram, Neo-Zionism is a reinterpretation of Zionism that is religious rather than secular. Judaism, instead of being a peripheral cultural tradition, is a core element in his definition.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;{{rp|121}} In Ram's formulation, Post-Zionism is globalist and liberal, while Neo-Zionism is local and ethno-religious. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon challenges Ram's classification of Neo-Zionism as anti-globalist. He instead sees some strains of Neo-Zionism as globalist, similar to Neo-Conservatism and Neo-Nationalism.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Whereas Post-Zionism was a largely unsuccessful direct challenge to Zionism, Neo-Zionism is instead a challenge to Labour Zionism.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Asima Ghazi-Bouillon argues that Neo-Zionism is not entirely an ethno-religious movement but also incorporates a national security discourse.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

[[Ilan Pappé]] sees four currents which have contributed to Neo-Zionism’s rise: The conversion of the [[Haredi Judaism| Haredi]]m [[Haredim and Zionism|to Zionism]]; the settler movement combined with the state funding of Yeshivas; the culturally insular and economically deprived [[Mizrahi Jews |Mizrahi]] community; and finally the integration of Israel into the global capitalist system.&lt;ref name ="Tilley"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4-Mun0HBek4C&amp;pg=RA2-PA155&amp;dq=neo+zionism+temple&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF1aTsof_NAhVIVj4KHXAPDRIQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=neo%20zionism%20temple&amp;f=false| title = The One-state Solution: A Breakthrough for Peace in the Israeli-Palestinian Deadlock| author= Virginia Tilley | publisher = Manchester University Press| page =155| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==

Neo-Zionism ideology was promoted by the banned [[Kach and Kahane Chai]] or the [[Jewish Defense League]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Uri Ram uses the [[Movement for Greater Israel]]&lt;ref name = "Chan"/&gt;{{rp|51–52}} and the [[Gush Emunim]] [[Israeli settlement|settler]] movement founded in 1974 as examples of Neo-Zionism and its precursors, Gush Emunim being a hybrid of religion and nationalism.&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt;{{rp|121}}&lt;ref name = "Chan"/&gt;{{rp|51}} Ram also labels parts of [[Likud]] and the National Religious Party, as well as other, smaller, splinter parties including [[Yisrael BaAliyah]], [[Moledet]], [[Tehiya]] and [[Tzomet]] as Neo-Zionist.&lt;ref name = "Chan"/&gt;{{rp|57}}

In the media Neo-Zionism is associated with [[Arutz Sheva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 19, 2014|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gaa-apologise-jew-punch-tweet-tyrone-1628108-Aug2014/ |title=GAA player apologises over 'punch a Jew' tweet |publisher=TheJournal.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yishai Fleisher, Arutz Sheva director of programming and founder of the [[Kumah (organization)|Kumah]] neo-Zionist lobby, "Zionism is the yearning of the Jewish people to come back to the land of Israel with the creation of the Jewish commonwealth and the era of the third Temple. It's a renewal of lost values, and an answer to post-Zionism. If post-Zionism is the theory that Israel was created and the project is now finished, then neo-Zionism states that we are far from done with the project. The Jewish people are not yet back home, and we have yet to educate Jews to the concept of living a Torah life in the land of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sara Lehmann |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/interviews-and-profiles/we-need-to-put-the-spirit-back-into-the-people-an-interview-with-arutz-shevas-yishai-fleisher/2010/02/10/ |title=We Need To Put The Spirit Back Into The People: An Interview with Arutz Sheva's Yishai Fleisher |newspaper=The Jewish Press |date=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some associations in Israel, such as [[Im Tirtzu]], defend Neo-Zionist ideology. Ronen Shoval, founder of the association states that "We need every Jewish heart and Zionist soul. Coordinators and activists of Im Tirtzu are hereby called to the flag. (...) [W]e will turn the Hebrew University into a Zionist society, and continue the second Zionist revolution!" His aims are "to restore Zionism to the center - for poets to poetize Zionism, for the writers to write Zionism, for academia to support Zionism and for the Ari Folmans (...) to make films about our ethos. Just as there are movies about gladiators, we will have movies about Judah Maccabee. What's wrong with that?"&lt;ref name="Neo-Zionism 101"&gt;{{cite news |author=Cobi Ben-Simhon |url=http://www.haaretz.com/neo-zionism-101-1.277397 |title=Neo-Zionism 101 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

According to Uri Ram, "Neo-Zionism (...) is an exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend, striving to heighten the fence encasing Israeli identity";&lt;ref name = "Chan57"/&gt; a point of view also reported by [[Gilbert Achcar]].&lt;ref name ="achcar"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3q5dFD61V5oC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=Uri+Ram+neo+zionism+1967&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ0b_QmO7JAhUCKCYKHdusDQkQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Uri%20Ram%20neo%20zionism%201967&amp;f=false | title = The Arabs and the Holocaust: The Arab-Israeli War of Narratives | author= Gilbert Achcar | publisher = Macmillan | page = 185| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dana Eyal, "[her] country is hijacked by a group of racist religious Jews, who are much more of a threat to Israel than any Arab or Muslim country, including Iran". She gives the example of children of illegal immigrants born and living in Israel for years and that neo-Zionist groups want to see expelled because their presence is un-Zionistic. She thinks that "[t]his very narrow definition of Zionism dictates that Israel is and will remain a racist Jewish state" but also "that in Israel itself there is a (lazy) majority that is far from this. Zionism for us equals patriotism much like it does to Americans; wanting the best for your country, believing in its principals and defending it when necessary. Only we don't believe in many of the neo-orthodox principals popping out like mushrooms in the rain. For that matter, we no longer feel very Zionistic in an environment that embraces totality and purity of race (a calamitous similarity to things that should not be named)".&lt;ref&gt;Dana Agmon, ''[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-agmon/neozionism-israels-true-t_b_749519.html Neo-Zionism -- Israel's True Threat]'', The Huffington Post, October 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Zionists have argued that Israel must choose between a Post-Zionist future and a Neo-Zionist future.&lt;ref name ="Nimni"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Challenge of Post-Zionism| url =http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol2no3_2003/nimni_postzionism.htm | date = 2003| accessdate= July 19, 2016| publisher = borderlands e-journal: Volume 2 Number 3| author = Ephraim Nimni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Israeli opinion has come to view both "Post-Zionism" and "Neo-Zionism" as pejorative slogans.&lt;ref name =" Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nJQuBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Neo-Zionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_s6vvte7JAhUHHR4KHbPlD-g4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Neo-Zionism&amp;f=false | title = Beyond Post-Zionism | author = Eran Kaplan | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}

'''ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives at the University of Southern California Libraries''' is the oldest existing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) organization in the United States&lt;ref name="Huff 60"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/one-national-gay-and-lesbian-archives-60th-anniversary_n_1937087.html | title=ONE National Gay And Lesbian Archives Celebrates 60th Anniversary | work=Huffington Post | date=October 4, 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest repository of LGBT materials in the world. Located in Los Angeles, California, ONE Archives has been a part of the [[University of Southern California Libraries]] since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives Research Collection Finds Permanent Home at the University of Southern California Libraries|url=http://www.onearchives.org/images/one-usc_pressrelease.pdf|work=Press Release|publisher=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONE Archives' collections contain over two million items including periodicals; books; film, video and audio recordings; photographs; artworks; ephemera, such as clothing, costumes, and buttons; organizational records; and personal papers. ONE Archives also operates a small gallery and museum space devoted to LGBT art and history in [[West Hollywood, California]]. Use of the collections is free during regular business hours.

ONE Archives originated from [[ONE, Inc.]], which began publishing the earliest national homosexual publication in 1952. In 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality, utilizing the term "[[Homophile]] Studies." In 1994, [[ONE, Inc.]] and the International Gay and Lesbian Archives run by [[Jim Kepner]] merged. Since 1994 the organization has operated solely as a LGBT archive.

==Mission==
ONE Archives' mission statement reads as follows: "It is the mission of ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries to collect, preserve, and make accessible LGBTQ historical materials while promoting new scholarship on and public awareness of queer histories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE Archives at the USC Libraries Mission Statement|url=http://one.usc.edu/about/|work=ONE Archives at the USC Libraries Mission Statement|publisher=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[ONE, Inc.]] was founded in 1952 to publish the nation's first wide-circulated, national homosexual periodical, ''ONE Magazine''. In 1953, ONE Inc. became the first gay organization to open a public office in Downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="oac-one001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7290389h/admin/#ref1 | title=Finding aid of the ONE Incorporated records, 1907-2001, bulk 1952-1994 Coll2011.001 | accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original founders include Martin Block, Tony Sanchez (aka Tony Reyes), and Dale Jennings. The corporation's original core members included Martin Block, Tony Reyes, Dale Jennings, Guy Rousseau, Merton Bird, Don Slater, William Lambert (aka [[W. Dorr Legg]]), Eve Elloree (aka Joan Corbin), and Ann Carll Reid (aka Irma "Corky" Wolf).&lt;ref name="oac-one001" /&gt;

In 1955, ONE Inc. held the ONE Midwinter Institute, the first in a series of conferences to bring together experts and community members to talk about gay and lesbian topics.

In 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality under the name of "[[Homophile]] Studies".

In 1957, marking the first time the [[United States Supreme Court]] explicitly ruled on homosexuality, ONE Inc. fought to distribute its magazine by mail, and prevailed. The ruling in the case, ''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]'', not only allowed ONE to distribute its magazine, but also paved the way for other controversial publications to be sent through the U.S. mail.

Also during the 1950s ONE Inc. became an ad hoc community center and began a library.&lt;ref name="oac-one001" /&gt; [[Jim Kepner]] was involved in adding material to this library.&lt;ref name="oac-one001" /&gt;

As the burgeoning [[Gay Liberation]] movement took off and became more closely intertwined with the [[movements for civil rights]] of the 1960s and 1970s, ONE Inc., [[Jim Kepner]] and a growing group of activists were poised to collect original materials from that critical time period.  By the late 1970s and early 1980s, ONE obtained crucial documents chronicling the establishment of the "gay community" and its established and increasingly diverse groups and organizations.

Since the 1980s, the archival collections have grown substantially as gay issues and gay culture became more integrated into the mainstream culture of the United States.

In October 2012 ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding and the printing of ''ONE Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Huff 60" /&gt;

==Organizational timeline==

Since 2008, ONE Archives has operated an exhibition space in [[West Hollywood, California]] dedicated to presenting temporary exhibitions on LGBT art and history. The gallery is located in a city owned building that also houses the [[June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives]].

In 2011, ONE Archives participated in the region-wide [[Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945-1980]] initiative with the exhibition ''Cruising the Archive: Queer Art &amp; Culture in Los Angeles, 1945-1980'' which was presented at the ONE Gallery in West Hollywood, as well as at ONE Archives' main location on West Adams Boulevard and in the Treasure Room at the [[Doheny Memorial Library]] at the [[University of Southern California Libraries]].&lt;ref name="cta-about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cruisingthearchive.org/exhibition/ | title=Cruising the Archive: Queer Art and Culture in Los Angeles, 1945-1980 | publisher=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives | accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition included works by [[Steven F. Arnold]], [[Don Bachardy]], [[Claire Falkenstein]], [[Anthony Friedkin]], [[Rudi Gernreich]], Sister [[Corita Kent]], and [[Kate Millett]], among many other less known or anonymous artists.&lt;ref name="cta-about" /&gt; The only exhibition dedicated to queer content within the PST initiative, this exhibition marked the most comprehensive exhibition of materials from the collections at ONE Archives to date and was accompanied by a scholarly catalogue. The publication included contributions by Ann Cvetkovich, [[Vaginal Davis]], Jennifer Doyle, [[Jack Halberstam]], Catherine Lord, [[Richard Meyer (academic)|Richard Meyer]], Ulrike Müller, and [[Dean Spade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue|url=http://cruisingthearchive.org/catalogue/|publisher=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ONE Gallery has presented solo exhibitions of artwork by [[Steven F. Arnold]] and Joey Terrill, exhibitions of historical materials from the collections at ONE, and highlights from the collections of the [[Tom of Finland Foundation]] and the [[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE Archives Past Exhibitions|url=http://www.onearchives.org/category/past/|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perma.cc''' is a [[web archiving]] [[Web service|service]] for legal and academic citations founded by the [[Harvard Library]] Innovation Lab in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb | title=What the Web Said Yesterday|first= Jill | last= Lepore | authorlink=Jill Lepore | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date= 26 January 2015 | accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Concept==
Perma.cc was created in response to studies showing high incidences of [[link rot]] in both academic publications and judicial opinions. By archiving copies of linked resources, and providing them with a permanent URL, perma.cc is intended to provide longer-term verifiability and context for academic literature and [[caselaw]]. Perma.cc is administered by a network of academic and government libraries.

In 2016, Harvard received a $700,000 grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services to expand development of perma.cc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard’s Perma.cc receives grant to expand its tools for saving sources on the Web|url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/harvards-perma-cc-receives-grant-expand-tools-saving-sources-web-2/|accessdate=February 24, 2018|work=Harvard Law Today|date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Perma.cc initiates page saves by user request only, it does not crawl the web and save pages like the [[Wayback Machine]]. A user account is required to save a page. Its target audience are organizations such as libraries, academic journals, law courts and school faculty. It provides support for organizational membership and administration of user accounts. Metadata such as notes can be added which are viewable to members within an organization. Pages can be made public or private within an organization. In 2017, Perma.cc added a commercial option for non-academic organizations to create institutional accounts. Individual accounts are also available but limited to 10 free page saves per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://perma.cc/sign-up |title=Perma.cc for individual users |work= |author= |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |quote=Anyone can create a free, individual Perma.cc account, which will allow you to create ten links per month.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://perma.cc/terms-of-service&lt;/ref&gt;

Perma.cc saves both a [[Web ARChive]] (or "warc") file format version and a screen-shot version in .png&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://perma.cc/docs/perma-link-creation#about-perma-records |title=About Perma Records |work=Perma.cc |author= |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perma.cc has an API for functions such as adding or deleting pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://perma.cc/docs/developer |title=Perma.cc API for developers |work=Perma.cc |author= |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perma.cc is part of the [[Memento Project|Memento]] network; thus, all public pages can be searched for (by URL) using the Memento API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mementoweb.org/depot/native/perma/ |title=Memento Depot - perma.cc |work=Memento |author= |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Nimitz in Victoria Canada 036.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Aircraft carrier]]s such as the [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)|USS ''Nimitz'']] play an important role in power projection.]]
'''Power projection''' (or '''force projection''') is a term used in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] to refer to the capacity of a [[Sovereign state|state]] "to apply all or some of its elements of national power — political, economic, informational, or military — to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to [[deterrence theory|deterrence]], and to enhance regional stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Military Terms |author=US Department of Defense |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVgtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT957&amp;lpg=PT957&amp;dq=%22power+projection%22+jp3-35&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x3krT4mpDt&amp;sig=e7uSp58DYS2dB-cPtHLZglqaCGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cRHgVLnjC8HZoASWnoKYCA&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22power%20projection%22%20jp3-35&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ability is a crucial element of a state's [[Power in international relations|power]] in [[international relations]]. Any state able to direct its military forces outside the limited bounds of its territory might be said to have ''some'' level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate area). Even states with sizable [[hard power]] assets (such as a large [[standing army]]) may only be able to exert limited [[regional power|regional influence]] so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the [[military logistics|logistical]] difficulties inherent in the [[Military deployment|deployment]] and direction of a modern, mechanized military force.

While traditional measures of power projection typically focus on [[hard power]] assets (tanks, soldiers, aircraft, naval vessels, etc.), the developing theory of [[soft power]] notes that power projection does not necessarily have to involve the active use of military forces in [[combat]]. Assets for power projection can often serve dual uses, as the deployment of various countries' militaries during the [[humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] illustrates. The ability of a state to project its forces into an area may serve as an effective diplomatic lever, influencing the decision-making process and acting as a potential [[deterrence theory|deterrent]] on other states' behavior.

==History==

Early examples of power projection includes Roman dominance of Europe: the ability to project power is tied to the ability to innovate and field such innovations. Roman engineering innovations such as machines ([[pile driver]]), concrete, aqueducts and modern roads provided the footing for an economic engine that powered a military that was unmatched in its day. Examples of Roman power projection include Julius Caesar building the [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|Rhine bridge]] in 10 days to demonstrate the ability to march its 40000 troops as it sees fit: the local inhabitants enjoyed the natural protection of the river and fled when this natural protection was overcome. Although Rome is far from the center of modern-power, its influence can be seen in the architecture of modern capitols around the world (domes, arches, columns). The demonstration of an extraordinary innovative military capability will signal power and when properly applied terminate conflicts summarily.

During the [[Ming treasure voyages]] in the 15th century, the Chinese treasure fleet was heavily militarized to exercise power projection around the Indian Ocean and thereby promote its interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Yuan-kang |title=Responding To China's Rise: US and EU Strategies |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-10033-3 |chapter=The Myth of Chinese Exceptionalism: A Historical Perspective on China’s Rise| pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The modern ability to project power and exert influence on a global scale can be tied to innovations stemming from the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the associated modernizations in technology, communications, [[finance]] and [[bureaucracy]]; this finally allowed the state to create unprecedented amounts of wealth and to effectively marshal these resources to exert power over long distances.

The first such industrial-technological power was the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century. As a maritime power, its strength and ability to project power to further its interests lay in the [[Royal Navy]]. A worldwide system of [[naval base]]s and [[coaling station]]s, a large logistical bureaucracy to oversee shipbuilding, the supply of coal, food, water, and sailors, and an industrial base for the manufacture and technological enhancement of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]] were among the essential ingredients for this capability. During the [[First Opium War]] (1839–42), it was this capacity that enabled a British expeditionary force of 15 [[barracks ship]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, 4 steam-powered [[gunboats]] and 25 smaller boats with 4,000 marines to successfully defend its interests 6,000 miles from the fleet's home port.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|pages=2990–2991|issue=19930|date=15 December 1840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era of [[gunboat diplomacy]] that this inaugurated was an exercise in Western power projection, and was normally used in the defence of commercial and political interests.

[[File:King Tewodros II.png|thumb|A [[John Tenniel]] in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' showing [[Britannia]] threatening the Abyssinian Emperor [[Tewodros II]] over his imprisonment of several missionaries and British government representatives]]
The Anglo-French [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] sent to shore up the [[Ottoman Empire]] against Russian aggression during the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56) was one of the first examples of a planned expeditionary power-projection campaign. It was the first campaign to use modern technology, including steam-powered warships and [[telegraph]] communications.

Another illustrative example of industrial power projection, was the punitive [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]] in 1868 as a retaliation against Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia]]'s imprisonment of several missionaries and British government representatives. The expeditionary force sent was a tremendous logistical and technological challenge at the time. Commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Sir Robert Napier]] of the [[Bombay Army]], [[military intelligence]] was used to estimate the required size of the army and the difficulties of traversing the inhospitable terrain.

A force of over 30,000 was shipped from [[British India]] to [[Zula]] on the [[Red Sea]] on a fleet of more than 280 [[steam ship]]s, while an advance detachment of [[engineer]]s built a large port with two piers, warehouses and a lighthouse, and constructed a 20-mile-long railway towards the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorehead|first=Alan|title=The Blue Nile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_DsNWK_RkYC|publisher=New York: Harper and Row|year=1972|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; A road was also built for the artillery to be moved along with the help of [[elephant]]s. After three months of trekking, the British force repelled an Ethiopian attack and bombarded the fortress of [[Amba_Mariam|Magdala]] into submission; Tewodros committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenson, ''Survival'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBZBWQo3whQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power|last=Ferguson |first= Niall|year=2008|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05, the [[Japan]]ese destruction of the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Imperial Russian Navy's]] Pacific Fleet demonstrated [[Imperial Russia]]'s inability to project force in the [[Far East|East]]. This immediately diminished Russia's diplomatic sway in that region. At the same time, Russia's western armies became less credible, as [[mobilization]] exposed organizational flaws and threw the western armies into chaos. This led analysts in Europe, such as [[German Empire|German]] [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] Count [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], to conclude that Russia would prove inept at projecting force in Europe, thus demoting Russia in European diplomatic relations.

Many other actions can be considered projections of force. The 19th century is full of incidents such as the 1864 [[Bombardment of Kagoshima]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. More recently, the [[Falklands War]] provided an example of the [[United Kingdom]]'s ability to project force far from home. Other recent examples of power projection include the U.S.-led [[Invasion of Iraq]] and the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. The ability of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the British [[Royal Navy]], and the [[French Navy]] to deploy large numbers of ships for long periods of time away from home are notable projection abilities.

==Elements==
[[Image:Gulf War C-5A reserve aircraft.jpg|thumb|The cargo hold and intercontinental flight capabilities of the [[C-5 Galaxy]] make it a major asset for deploying military equipment around the globe.]]
The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] defines power projection as the "ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power—political, economic, informational, or military—to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability".&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;United States Department of Defense. ''J1-02: Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms.'' [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/p/04211.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt;

As distance between a fighting force and its headquarters increases, [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] inevitably becomes more difficult. Modern-day power projection often employs high-tech communications and [[information technology]] to overcome these difficulties, a process sometimes described as the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]".

While a few long-range [[weapon]]s such as the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) are capable of projecting deadly force in their own right, it is [[military logistics]] that is at the heart of power projection. The ability to integrate [[naval]] and [[air force]]s with land [[army|armies]] as part of [[joint warfare]] is a key aspect of effective power projection; [[airlift]] and [[sealift]] capabilities facilitate the deployment of [[soldier]]s and [[weapon]]s to a distant [[theater (warfare)|theater of war]].

The [[carrier strike group|aircraft carrier strike group]], [[strategic bomber]], [[ballistic missile submarine]], and [[strategic airlift]]er are all examples of power projection platforms. Military units designed to be [[Light infantry|light]] and mobile, such as [[airborne forces]] ([[paratrooper]]s and [[air assault]] forces) and [[amphibious assault]] forces, are utilized in power projection. [[Forward basing]] is another method of power projection, which, by pre-positioning military units or stockpiles of arms at strategically located [[military base]]s outside a country's territory, reduces the time and distance needed to [[mobilization|mobilize]] them.

==Types==
Scholars have disaggregated military power projection into nine different categories based on political goals and level of force. Four of these employ "soft" military power (securing [[sea lane]]s of communication, [[non-combatant]] evacuation, [[humanitarian]] response, and [[peacekeeping]]) and the rest are primarily concerned with "hard" military power ([[wikt:show the flag|show the flag]], compellence/deterrence, punishment, armed intervention, and conquest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig III|first1=Walter C.|title=India and Military Power Projection: Will the Land of Gandhi Become a Conventional Great Power?|journal=Asian Survey|date=November–December 2010|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1162–1183|doi=10.1525/as.2010.50.6.1162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft power===
{{Main|Soft power}}
Examples of soft power projection include:

* Securing sea lanes of communication: the protection of shipping lanes from attack by hostile states or irregular threats.
* Non-combatant evacuation operations: the evacuation of citizens or friendly third-country civilians from a foreign country when they are endangered by war or civil unrest.
* Humanitarian response: the use of military forces abroad to assist in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
* Peacekeeping: military operations designed to support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement to an ongoing dispute.

===Hard power===
{{Main|Hard power}}
Examples of hard power projection include:

* Showing the flag: the symbolic deployment of military forces to a region for the purposes of demonstrating political interest, resolve, or willingness to take more forceful military action.
* Compulsion/deterrence: the use of the threat of military force against another state to either induce it into or dissuade it from pursuing a given policy. In this form, power projection acts as a diplomatic tool, attempting to influence the decision-making process of foreign actors.
* Punishment: the punitive use of force against another state in response to their pursuit of a given policy.
* Armed intervention: the movement of military forces into another nation’s territory for the purposes of influencing the internal affairs of the target country short of outright conquest.
* Conquest: the offensive use of military assets to forcibly occupy territory controlled or claimed by another state.

The '''Prague Manifesto''' (in Russian: Пражский Манифест) was a document written by several members of the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia]] (KONR), an [[anti-communist]] coalition of former Soviet military and citizens who aimed to overthrow [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and establish a non-communist government in [[Russia]], in alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]]. The manifesto was published on 14 November 1944.

==About the manifesto==
The Manifesto opened with a preamble that strongly criticized Stalin for crimes against the people of the [[USSR]], including genocide via repression and engineered famines, and suppression of personal freedoms. However, the same preamble also accused the Allies, referred to in the text as "the [[plutocracy|plutocracies]] of the United States and England", of collaborating with Stalin in trying to conquer, rather than liberate, Europe.

The authors later justified some of the more objectionable parts of the Manifesto by claiming that they had been included to appease the Nazi propagandists. Although anti-Allied sentiment was included, the authors refused to include [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric, despite heavy pressure from the Nazi propaganda department.

General [[Andrey Vlasov]], the chair of the KONR and the commander of the [[Russian Liberation Army]], had criticised the extermination of the Jews to German commanders (as noted in [[Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt]]'s memoirs, ''Against Stalin and Hitler''), and had several close collaborators who were Jewish, including his speech writer Mileti Zikov, Captain Boyarskiy, and General [[Boris Shteifon]] of the Russian Corps. Interviewed by a neutral journalist about his views on the "Jewish problem", [[Georgii Malenkov]], General of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] and KONR committee member, remarked that "we do not feel that Russia has any Jewish problem that needs to be addressed".

The Manifesto focused on uniting not only ethnic Russians but all the nationalities inhabiting the Soviet Union, such as [[Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Balts]], [[Kalmyks]], [[Armenians]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Circassians]], and others. Many representatives from these nationalities were a part of the Committee and signed the Manifesto.

A central part of the Manifesto is the 14 points upon which a new democratic Russia would be built. These points guaranteed the freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, conscience, equal rights for women and all peoples of Russia (and the rights of the latter for [[self determination]]) &amp;ndash; in other words, many of the same rights that were already guaranteed by the text of the existing Soviet Constitution, but routinely disregarded by Stalin's government. Unlike the Soviet Constitution, however, the Prague Manifesto was anti-communist, calling for the abolition of [[collective farm]]s, among other things. Many aspects of the Manifesto closely resemble the political program of the Russian emigré organisation, the [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]] (NTS), of whom several of Vlasov's key allies were members, such as General [[Feodor Trukhin]].

The Manifesto specified that an "honorable peace" with Germany "not disturbing the honor" of Russia would be achieved. It also stated that the help of Germany was welcome as it provided "the only realistic possibility" of removing Stalin from power.

General Vlasov proclaimed the Prague Manifesto on 14 November 1944, at the [[Prague Castle]]. The city was chosen because all major Russian cities at this point were already under Soviet control, and Prague was a [[Slavs|Slavic]] city. Six months later the first division of the Russian Liberation Army participated in the liberation of Prague from the Nazi occupying forces in co-operation with Czech [[Partisan (military)|partisans]].

===The Fourteen Points===

The fourteen points, excerpted from the manifesto:

''As the basis for a new government for the peoples of Russia the committee set down the following major principles:

# The equality of all peoples of Russia and a real right for national development, self determination, self rule, and governmental independence.
# The confirmation of a popular worker front, before which the interests of the government are subordinate to the goals of raising the well-being and development of the nation.
# The preservation of peace and the establishment of peaceful relations with all nations of the world, an all round development of international collaboration.
# Wide ranging government actions for the strengthening of the family and marriage. A true equality for women.
# The liquidation of forced labor and the granting to the laborers a real right to free labor which creates their material well-being, the confirmation of a wage for all types of labor in an amount that can support an appropriate standard of living.
# The liquidation of collective farms, the free return of land to the private ownership of farmers. The freedom to determine labor land usage. The freedom to use the products of one's personal labor, the abolition of forced requisitions, and the cancellation of all debts to the Soviet government.
# The establishment of protected private labor ownership. The reestablishment of trade, crafts, domestic industry, the granting of the right of private initiative and an opportunity for it to participate in the economic life of the nation.
# Granting the intelligentsia the opportunity to freely create for the well-being of their people.
# Granting social justice and defense of laborers from any exploitation, regardless of their origin and former activities.
# The creation for all without exception the real right for free education, medical care, vacation, and senior welfare.
# The destruction of the regime of terror and force. Liquidation of forceful repopulations and mass exiles. The establishment of a true freedom of religion, conscience, speech, assembly, press. A guarantee of the protection of person, property, and home. The equality of all before the law, the independence and clarity of the court.
# The liberation of political opponents of Bolshevism and the return to the motherland from the jails and camps of all who were repressed for their battle against Bolshevism. No revenge and persecution for those who stop their battle for Stalin and Bolshevism, regardless of whether this was done by necessity or by conviction.
# The reestablishment of national property ruined during the war – cities, villages, factories, and plants at cost to the government.
# Government support of invalids of the war and their families.

== Criticism ==

The manifesto and the committee were criticised for having being created under the sponsorship of the Nazi regime. Critics argue that collaboration with this regime automatically discredits the movement's goals and aspirations. Defenders of the manifesto claim that the sponsorship of the Nazi government was accepted reluctantly, but was necessary as the movement could not be sustained in the conditions that were prevalent at the time. General Vlasov said during a speech to Eastern Workers that "the assistance of Germany is the only realistic option for us to succeed", while support from democratic regimes was impossible as they were collaborating with Stalin at the time.

A '''private view''' is a special viewing of an [[art exhibition]] by invitation only, normal at the start of a public exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Alice-Azania Jarvis, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/how-to-behave-at-a-private-view-956358.html How to behave at a private view...], ''[[The Independent]], 10 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically wine and light refreshments are served on the form of a reception. If the artworks are by a living artist, it is normal for them to attend the private view.

An opening of an art exhibition which is open to the public is known as a [[vernissage]].

This includes identifying, classifying, storing, securing, retrieving, tracking and destroying or permanently preserving records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ARMA International |title=Glossary of Records and Information Management Terms, 3rd Edition |publisher=ARMA International |url=http://archive.arma.org/standards/glossaryw2/index.cfm?id_term=373 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023837/https://archive.arma.org/standards/glossaryw2/index.cfm?id_term=373 |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 15489 Information and documentation -- Records management|15489-1: 2001]] standard ([[ISO 15489 Information and documentation -- Records management|"ISO 15489-1:2001"]]) defines ''records management'' as "[the] field of management responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposition of records, including the processes for capturing and maintaining [[evidence]] of and [[information]] about [[business]] activities and transactions in the form of records".&lt;ref name="ISO15489"&gt;{{cite web | author = International Organization for Standardization – ISO | title = ISO 15489-1:2001 – Information and Documentation – Records Management – Part 1: General | year = 2001 | publisher = International Organization for Standardization – ISO | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31908 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140402205215/http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31908 | archivedate = 2014-04-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization's records preserve aspects of institutional memory. In determining how long to retain records, their capacity for re-use is important. Many are kept as evidence of activities, transactions, and decisions. Others document what happened and why.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Megill|first=Kenneth|title=Corporate Memory: Records and Information Management in the Knowledge Age|edition=2nd|place=Munich|publisher=K.G. Saur/Thomson|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of records management is part of an organization's broader function of [[Governance, risk management, and compliance]] and is primarily concerned with managing the evidence of an organization's activities as well as the reduction or mitigation of risk associated with it.&lt;ref name="GRC_Tarantino"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aUyqPxYw10C |title=Governance, Risk, and Compliance to the Handbook |author=Anthony Tarantino |isbn=978-0-470-09589-8 |date=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts of record==
The concept of '''record''' is variously defined. The [[ISO 15489 Information and documentation -- Records management|ISO 15489-1:2016]] defines ''records'' as "information created, received, and maintained as evidence and as an asset by an [[organization]] or [[person]], in pursuit of legal obligations or in the transaction of business".&lt;ref name="ISO15489"/&gt; While there are many purposes of and benefits to records management, as both these definitions highlight, a key feature of records is their ability to serve as evidence of an event. Proper records management can help preserve this feature of records.

Recent and comprehensive studies have defined records as "persistent representations of activities" as recorded or created by participants or observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeo|first1=Geoffrey|title=Concepts of Record (1): Evidence, Information, and Persistent Representations|journal=American Archivist|date=2007|volume=70|issue=2|pages=315–343|doi=10.17723/aarc.70.2.u327764v1036756q|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.17723/aarc.70.2.u327764v1036756q|ref=yeo2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transactional view emphasizes the importance of context and process in the determination and meaning of records. In contrast, previous definitions have emphasized the evidential and informational properties of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schellenberg|first1=T. R.|title=The Appraisal of Modern Records|journal=Bulletins of the National Archives|number=8|date=October 1956|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/appraisal-of-records.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124094248/https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/appraisal-of-records.html|archivedate=2016-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In organizational contexts, records are materials created or received by an organization in the transaction of business, or in pursuit of or in compliance with legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.arma.org/standards/glossaryw2/index.cfm?id_term=369 |title=Glossary of Records and Information Management Terms, 3rd Edition |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=ARMA International |access-date= |author= |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927121231/https://archive.arma.org/standards/glossaryw2/index.cfm?id_term=369 |archivedate=September 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearce-Moses|first1=Richard|title=Record|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/record|website=Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=23 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124094018/http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/record|archivedate=24 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organizational definition of record stems from the early theorization of archives as organic aggregations of records, that is "the written documents, drawings and printed matter, officially received or produced by an administrative body or one of its officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muller|first1=S.|last2=Feith|first2=J.

==Key records management terminology==
{{globalize|date=March 2016}}
Not all documents are records. A ''record'' is a document consciously retained as evidence of an action. Records management systems generally distinguish between records and non-records (convenience copies, rough drafts, duplicates), which do not need formal management. Many systems, especially for electronic records, require documents to be formally ''declared as a record'' so they can be managed. Once declared, a record cannot be changed and can only be disposed of within the rules of the system.

Records may be covered by ''access controls'' to regulate who can access them and under what circumstances. Physical controls may be used to keep confidential records secure – personnel files, for instance, which hold sensitive personal data, may be held in a locked cabinet with a control log to track access. Digital records systems may include role-based access controls, allowing permissions (to view, change and/or delete) to be allocated to staff depending on their role in the organisation. An ''audit trail'' showing all access and changes can be maintained to ensure the integrity of the records.

Just as the records of the organization come in a variety of formats, the storage of records can vary throughout the organization. File maintenance may be carried out by the owner, designee, a records repository, or clerk. Records may be managed in a centralized location, such as a records center or repository, or the control of records may be decentralized across various departments and locations within the entity. Records may be formally and discretely identified by coding and housed in folders specifically designed for optimum protection and storage capacity, or they may be casually identified and filed with no apparent indexing. Organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed. The inefficiency of filing maintenance and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records.

An ''inactive record'' is a record that is no longer needed to conduct current business but is being preserved until it meets the end of its [[retention period]], such as when a project ends, a product line is retired, or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached. These records may hold business, legal, fiscal, or historical value for the entity in the future and, therefore, are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration. Records are managed according to the retention schedule. Once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending, it is authorized for final disposition, which may include destruction, transfer, or permanent preservation.

A ''[[disaster recovery plan]]'' is a written and approved course of action to take after a disaster strikes that details how an organization will restore critical business functions and reclaim damaged or threatened records.

An ''active record'' is a record needed to perform current operations, subject to frequent use, and usually located near the user. In the past, 'records management' was sometimes used to refer only to the management of records which were no longer in everyday use but still needed to be kept – 'semi-current' or 'inactive' records, often stored in basements or offsite. More modern usage tends to refer to the entire '[[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]]' of records – from the point of creation right through until their eventual disposal.

The format and media of records is generally irrelevant for the purposes of records management from the perspective that records must be identified and managed, regardless of their form. The ISO considers management of both physical and electronic records.&lt;ref name="ISO15489"/&gt; Also, section DL1.105 of the [[United States Department of Defense]] standard [[Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications|DoD 5015.02-STD]] (2007) defines Records Management as "''the planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other managerial activities involving the life cycle of information, including creation, maintenance (use, storage, retrieval), and disposal, regardless of media.''"&lt;ref name="DODStd5015.2"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Department of Defense Standard 5015.02 (DoD Std 5012.02), Electronic Records Management Software Applications Design Criteria Standard |publisher=United States Department of Defense – US DOD |author=Assistant Secretary of Defence for Networks and Information Integration, Department of Defence Chief Information Officer |date=April 25, 2007 |url=http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/cgi/rma/downloads/p50152stdapr07.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222000753/https://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/cgi/rma/downloads/p50152stdapr07.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Records Management Theory ==

=== Records life-cycle ===
{{Main|Records life-cycle}}
The [[records life-cycle]] consists of discrete phases covering the life span of a record from its creation to its final disposition. In the creation phase, records growth is expounded by modern electronic systems. Records will continue to be created and captured by the organization at an explosive rate as it conducts the business of the organization. Correspondence regarding a product failure is written for internal leadership, financial statements and reports are generated for public and regulatory scrutiny, the old corporate logo is retired, and a new one – including color scheme and approved corporate font – takes its place in the organization's history.

Examples of records phases include those for ''creation'' of a record, ''modification'' of a record, ''movement'' of a record through its different states while in existence, and ''destruction'' of a record.

Throughout the records life cycle, issues such as security, privacy, disaster recovery, emerging technologies, and mergers are addressed by the records and information management professional responsible for organizational programs. Records and information management professionals are instrumental in controlling and safeguarding the information assets of the entity. They understand how to manage the creation, access, distribution, storage, and disposition of records and information in an efficient and cost-effective manner using records and information management methodology, principles, and best practices in compliance with records and information laws and regulations.

=== Records continuum theory ===
{{Main|Records Continuum Model}}
The records continuum theory is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities in relation to multiple contexts over space and time.

==Records management practices and concepts==
A Records Manager is someone who is responsible for records management in an organization.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Section 4 of the [[ISO 15489 Information and documentation -- Records management|ISO 15489-1:2001]] states that records management includes:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

* setting policies and standards
* assigning responsibilities and authorities
* establishing and promulgating procedures and [[guideline]]s
* providing a range of services relating to the management and use of records
* designing, implementing and [[Administration (business)|administering]] specialized systems for managing records
* integrating records management into business systems and processes

Thus, the practice of records management may involve:

* planning the information needs of an organization
* identifying information requiring capture
* creating, approving, and enforcing policies and practices regarding records, including their organization and disposal
* developing a records storage plan, which includes the short and long-term housing of physical records and [[Digital data|digital]] information
* identifying, classifying, and storing records
* coordinating access to records internally and outside of the organization, balancing the requirements of business confidentiality, [[information privacy|data privacy]], and public access.
* identification and maintenance of records per a specified [[retention period]]
* executing a retention policy on the disposal of records which are no longer required for operational reasons; according to organizational policies, statutory requirements, and other regulations this may involve either their destruction or permanent preservation in an [[archive]].

Records-management principles and automated records-management systems aid in the capture, classification, and ongoing management of records throughout their lifecycle. Such a system may be paper-based (such as [[Index card|index]] cards as used in a [[library]]), or may involve a computer system, such as an electronic records-management application.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Defensible solutions ===
A ''defensible solution'' is one that can be supported with clearly documented policies, processes and procedures that drive how and why work is performed, as well as one that has clearly documented proof of behavior patterns, proving that an organization follows such documented constraints to the best of their ability.&lt;ref name="Defensible_Solutions"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118027248.html|title=Performance-Based Certification: How to Design a Valid, Defensible, Cost-Effective Program|author=Hale, Judith|date=December 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-1-118-02724-0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927151031/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118027248.html|archivedate=2013-09-27|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''defensibility'' applies to all aspects of records life cycle, it is considered most important in the context of records destruction, where it is known as "''defensible disposition''" or "''defensible destruction''," and helps an organization explicitly justify and prove things like who destroys records, why they destroy them, how they destroy them, when they destroy them, and where they destroy them.&lt;ref name="Defensible_Disposition"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hulme, Tony|date=June 2012|title=Information Governance: Sharing the IBM approach|url=http://bir.sagepub.com/content/29/2/99.short|deadurl=no|journal=Business Information Review|publisher=Sage Journals|volume=29|issue=vol. 29 no. 2|pages=99–104|doi=10.1177/0266382112449221|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130925190729/http://bir.sagepub.com/content/29/2/99.short|archivedate=2013-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
Records managers use classification or categorization of record types as a means of working with records.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Such classifications assist in functions such as creation, organization, storage, retrieval, movement, and destruction of records.

At the highest level of classification are physical versus electronic records. (This is disputable; records are defined as such regardless of media. ISO 15489 and other best practices promulgate a functions based, rather than media based classification, because the law defines records as certain kinds of information regardless of media.)

'''Physical records''' are those records, such as paper, that can be touched and which take up physical space.

'''Electronic records''', also often referred to as '''digital records''', are those records that are generated with and used by [[information technology]] devices.

Classification of records is achieved through the design, maintenance, and application of [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], which allow records managers to perform functions such as the categorization, tagging, segmenting, or grouping of records according to various traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeremy C. Maxwell |author2=Annie I. Antón |author3=Peter Swire |author4=Maria Riaz |author5=Christopher M. McCraw |issue=Volume 17, Issue 2|title=A legal cross-references taxonomy for reasoning about compliance requirements|publisher=Springer Link|date=June 2012|pages=99–115|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00766-012-0152-5|doi=10.1007/s00766-012-0152-5|volume=17|journal=Requirements Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enterprise records ====
''Enterprise records'' represent those records that are common to most enterprises, regardless of their function, purpose, or sector. Such records often revolve around the day-to-day operations of an enterprise and cover areas such as but not limited litigation, employee management, consultant or contractor management, customer engagements, purchases, sales, and contracts.

The types of enterprises that produce and work with such records include but are not limited to for-profit companies, non-profit companies, and government agencies.

==== Industry records ====
''Industry records'' represent those records that are common and apply only to a specific industry or set of industries. Examples include but are not limited to medical industry records (e.g., the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]]), pharmaceutical industry records, and food industry records.

==== Legal hold records ====
''[[Legal hold]]'' records are those records that are mandated, usually by legal counsel or compliance personnel, to be held for a period of time, either by a government or by an enterprise, and for the purposes of addressing potential issues associated with compliance audits and litigation. Such records are assigned ''Legal Hold'' traits that are in addition to classifications which are as a result of enterprise or industry classifications.

Legal hold data traits may include but are not limited to things such as legal hold flags (e.g. Legal Hold = True or False), the organization driving the legal hold, descriptions of why records must be legally held, what period of time records must be held for, and the hold location.

=== Records retention schedule ===
{{Main|Retention schedule}}
A records retention schedule is a document, often developed using [[Archival appraisal]] concepts and analysis of business and legal contexts within the intended jurisdictions, that outlines how long certain types of records need to be retained for before they can be destroyed. 

==Managing physical records==

Managing physical records involves different disciplines or [[:wikt:capability|capabilities]] and may draw on a variety of forms of expertise.

; Identifying records
: If an item is presented as a legal record, it needs to be authenticated. Forensic experts may need to examine a document or [[:wikt:artifact|artifact]] to determine that it is not a [[forgery]], and that any damage, alteration, or missing content is documented. In extreme cases, items may be subjected to a [[microscope]], [[x-ray]], [[radiocarbon dating]] or chemical analysis. This level of authentication is rare, but requires that special care be taken in the creation and retention of the records of an organization.

; Storing records
: Records must be stored in such a way that they are accessible and safeguarded against environmental damage. A typical paper document may be stored in a filing cabinet in an office. However, some organisations employ file rooms with specialized environmental controls including [[temperature]] and [[humidity]]. [[Vital record]]s may need to be stored in a disaster-resistant safe or vault to protect against fire, flood, earthquakes and conflict. In extreme cases, the item may require both [[disaster]]-proofing and public access, such as the original, signed [[US Constitution]]. Civil engineers may need to be consulted to determine that the file room can effectively withstand the weight of shelves and [[file cabinet]]s filled with paper; historically, some [[military]] vessels were designed to take into account the weight of their operating procedures on paper as part of their [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] [[equation]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (modern record-keeping technologies have transferred much of that information to electronic storage). In addition to on-site storage of records, many organizations operate their own [[off-site records center]]s or contract with commercial records centres.

; Retrieval of records
: In addition to being able to store records, enterprises must also establish the proper capabilities for retrieval of records, in the event they are needed for a purpose such as an audit or litigation, or for the case of destruction. Record retrieval capabilities become complex when dealing with electronic records, especially when they have not been adequately tagged or classified for discovery.

; Circulating records
: Tracking the record while it is away from the normal storage area is referred to as circulation. Often this is handled by simple written recording procedures. However, many modern records environments use a computerized system involving [[bar code scanner]]s, or radio-frequency identification technology ([[RFID]]) to track movement of the records. These can also be used for periodic auditing to identify unauthorized movement of the record.

; Disposal of records
: Disposal of records does not always mean [[wikt:destroy|destruction]]. It can also include transfer to a historical archive, [[museum]], or private individual. Destruction of records ought to be authorized by law, statute, regulation, or operating procedure, and the records should be disposed of with care to avoid inadvertent disclosure of information. The process needs to be well-documented, starting with a records retention schedule and policies and procedures that have been approved at the highest level. An inventory of the records disposed of should be maintained, including certification that they have been destroyed. Records should never simply be discarded as refuse. Most organizations use processes including pulverization, [[paper shredding]] or incineration.

Commercially available products can manage records through all processes active, inactive, archival, retention scheduling and disposal. Some also utilize RFID technology for the tracking of the physical file.

== Managing digital records ==

The general principles of records management apply to records in any format. Digital records, however, raise specific issues. It is more difficult to ensure that the content, context and structure of records is preserved and protected when the records do not have a physical existence. This has important implications for the authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness of records.

Much research is being conducted on the management of digital records. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724092026/http://www.interpares.org/welcome.cfm International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Project] is one example of such an initiative. Based at the [[School of Library, Archival and Information Studies (University of British Columbia)|School of Library, Archival and Information Studies]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the InterPARES Project is a collaborative project between researchers all across the world committed to developing theories and methodologies to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and authenticity of digital records.

Functional requirements for computer systems to manage digital records have been produced by the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]],&lt;ref name="DODStd5015.2"/&gt; [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The United Kingdom's National Archives]] and the European Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= European Commission | title = MoReq2010, modular requirements for records systems, Core services &amp; plug-in modules, version 1.1, Volume 1 | publisher = European Commission |date=2011 | isbn=978-92-79-18519-9 | doi=10.2792/2045 | url = http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/modular-requirements-for-records-systems-pbKAAF11S01/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[MoReq2|MoReq]] ([[MoReq2|Model Requirements for the Management of Electronic Records]]) specification has been translated into at least twelve languages funded by the [[European Commission]].

Particular concerns exist about the ability to access and read digital records over time, since the rapid pace of change in technology can make the software used to create the records obsolete, leaving the records unreadable. A considerable amount of research is being undertaken to address this, under the heading of [[digital preservation]]. The [[Public Record Office Victoria (PROV)]] located in Melbourne, Australia published the [[Victorian Electronic Records Strategy (VERS)]] which includes a standard for the preservation, long-term storage and access to permanent electronic records. The VERS standard has been adopted by all Victorian Government departments. A digital archive has been established by PROV to enable the general public to access permanent records. Archives New Zealand is also setting up a digital archive.

;Electronic tax records
Electronic Tax Records are computer-based/non-paper versions of records required by tax agencies like the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. There is substantial confusion about what constitutes acceptable digital records for the [[IRS]], as the concept is relatively new. The subject is discussed in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf Publication 583] and [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb97-13.pdf Bulletin 1997-13], but not in specific detail.

Businesses and individuals wishing to convert their paper records into scanned copies may be at risk if they do so. For example, it is unclear if an [[IRS]] auditor would accept a [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], or [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format scanned copy of a purchase receipt for a deducted expense item.

==Current issues==

; Compliance and legal issues
While public administration, healthcare and the legal profession have a long history of records management, the corporate sector has generally shown less interest. This has changed in recent years due to new compliance requirements, driven in part by scandals such as the [[Enron Corporation|Enron]]/[[Arthur Andersen|Andersen]] affair and more recent problems at [[Morgan Stanley]]. Corporate records compliance issues including [[retention period]] requirements and the need to disclose information as a result of litigation have come to be seen as important. Statutes such as the US [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] have resulted in greater standardization of records management practices. Since the 1990s the shift towards electronic records has seen a need for close working relations between records managers and IT managers, particularly including the legal aspects, focused on compliance and risk management.

; Security
[[Privacy]], data protection, and [[identity theft]] have become issues of increasing interest. The role of the records manager in the protection of an organization's records has grown as a result. The need to ensure personal information is not retained unnecessarily has brought greater focus to retention schedules and records disposal.

;Transparency
The increased importance of transparency and accountability in public administration, marked by the widespread adoption of Freedom of Information laws, has led to a focus on the need to manage records so that they can be easily accessed by the public. For instance, in the United Kingdom, Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 required the government to publish a Code of Practice on Records Management for public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/planning/records-management-code/|title=Records management code|work=The National Archives|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202091457/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/planning/records-management-code/|archivedate=2016-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, European Union legislation on Data Protection and Environmental Information, requiring organisations to disclose information on request, create a need for effective management of such records.

; Adoption and implementation
Implementing required changes to organisational culture is a major challenge, since records management is often seen as an unnecessary or low priority administrative task that can be performed at the lowest levels within an organization. Reputational damage caused by poor records management has demonstrated that records management is the responsibility of all individuals within an organization.

An issue that has been very controversial among records managers has been the uncritical adoption of [[Electronic Document and Records Management System|Electronic document and records management systems]].

; Impact of internet and social media
Another issue of great interest to records managers is the impact of the internet and related social media, such as [[wiki]]s, [[blog]]s, [[discussion forum|forums]], and companies such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], on traditional records management practices, principles, and concepts, since many of these tools allow rapid creation and dissemination of records and, often, even in anonymous form.

; Records life cycle management
A difficult challenge for many enterprises is tied to the tracking of records through their entire [[Information Lifecycle Management|information life cycle]] so that it's clear, at all times, where a record exists or if it still exists at all. The tracking of records through their life cycles allows records management staff to understand when and how to apply records related rules, such as rules for legal hold or destruction.

; Conversion of paper records to electronic form
As the world becomes more digital in nature, an ever-growing issue for the records management community is the conversion of existing or incoming paper records to electronic form. Such conversions are most often performed with the intent of saving storage costs, storage space, and in hopes of reducing records retrieval time.

Tools such as [[Image scanner|document scanners]], [[optical character recognition]] software, and [[Document management system|electronic document management systems]] are used to facilitate such conversions.

==Education and certification==
Many colleges and universities offer degree programs in library and information sciences which cover records management. Furthermore, there are professional organizations such as the [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]] ([http://www.rimpa.com.au RIMPA]) and the [[Institute of Certified Records Managers]] which provides a separate, non-degreed, professional certification for practitioners, the Certified Records Manager designation or CRM. Additional educational opportunities in the form of a certificate program are also available from AIIM International, [[ARMA International]], and from the [[Information and Records Management Society]] in Great Britain and Ireland. Education and training courses and workshops on scientific and technical records full life-cycle management and the Quality Electronic Records Practices Standards (Q-ERPS) are available from the Collaborative Electronic Notebook Systems Association.

The University of South Australia offers a Graduate Certificate, a graduate diploma, and an MSc in Business Information Management and Library and Information Management with a specialist stream in records management. The Australian National University offer a six-week e-learning course worldwide, in Electronic Document and Records Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP7420/ ''COMP7420: Electronic Document and Records Management'', Tom Worthington, Australian National University, from February 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219230346/http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP7420/ |date=February 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Columbia University offers its Masters of Science in Information &amp; Digital Resource Management (IDRM).

Schools in Canada also provide specialized education opportunities in records management. The [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto]] allows students in the Master of Information program to concentrate their studies in Archives and Records Management. The [[McGill University School of Information Studies|School of Information Studies]] at McGill University also includes an Archival Management stream that is enriched in records management coursework. The University of British Columbia offers a Masters of Archival Studies including a concentration in Records Management.

==Electronic records management systems==
An [[Electronic Document and Records Management System]] is a [[computer program]] or set of programs used to track and store records. The term is distinguished from [[Document imaging|imaging]] and [[document management system]]s that specialize in paper capture and document management respectively. Electronic records management Systems commonly provide specialized security and auditing functionality tailored to the needs of records managers.

The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) has endorsed the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] standard 5015.2 as an "adequate and appropriate basis for addressing the basic challenges of managing records in the automated environment that increasingly characterizes the creation and use of records."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/records_management/policy_and_guidance/automated_recordkeeping_requirements.html&lt;nowiki/&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409004941/http://www.archives.gov/records_management/policy_and_guidance/automated_recordkeeping_requirements.html |date=April 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Records Management Vendors can be certified as compliant with the DoD 5015.2-STD after verification from the [[Joint Interoperability Test Command]] which builds test case procedures, writes detailed and summary final reports on 5015.2-certified products, and performs on-site inspection of software.&lt;ref&gt;http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/recmgt/register.html&lt;nowiki/&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316041126/http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/recmgt/register.html |date=March 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The National Archives (UK)|The National Archives]] in the UK has published two sets of functional requirements to promote the development of the electronic records management software market (1999 and 2002).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/electronicrecords/function.htm&lt;nowiki/&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213220355/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/electronicrecords/function.htm |date=February 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran a program to evaluate products against the 2002 requirements. While these requirements were initially formulated in collaboration with central government, they have been taken up with enthusiasm by many parts of the wider public sector in the UK and in other parts of the world. The testing program has now closed; The National Archives is no longer accepting applications for testing. The National Archives 2002 requirements remain current.

===Commercial records centers===

Commercial records centers are facilities which provide services for the storage for paper records for organizations. In some cases, they also offer storage for records maintained in electronic formats. Commercial records centers provide high density storage for paper records and some offer climate controlled storage for sensitive non-paper and critical (vital) paper media. There is a trade organization for commercial records centers (for example, PRISM International), however, not all service providers are members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="941">In '''''Rubin v Botha''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], Botha purported to lease to Rubin and his partner a piece of land for a period of ten years. No money was to pass, but the purported lessee was to erect a dwelling house, a stable and a fowl-run, for which no compensation was to be claimable at the end of the lease.

The court held that Rubin was indeed a tenant, as the compensation for the use and occupation of the land was the fact that the parties intended that the buildings erected should become the property of the lessor at the expiration of ten years.

'''Sarah Preston Monks''' (1841–1926) was an American naturalist, educator, scientific illustrator, and poet, based for much of her career in [[San Pedro, California]]. She was the first zoology instructor at [[Los Angeles State Normal School]], a precursor to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where she taught for over 20 years, and published on diverse topics including reptiles, amphibians, spiders, and marine biology.

==Early life and education==
Sarah Preston Monks was born in [[Cold Spring, New York]], the daughter of John Monks and Sarah Charlotte Monks (née Jolly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Monks, John Austin Sands |title=Who's Who in New England|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaITAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=1909|publisher=A.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">The '''Slovak National Council's Declaration of Independence of the Slovak Nation''' was a resolution of the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|Slovak National Council]] on 17 July 1992, by which members of the Council demanded Slovakia's independence. This event was part of a process, which finished with the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] and creation of an independent [[Slovakia]] on 1 January 1993.

The text of the declaration in Slovak:

My, demokraticky zvolená Slovenská národná rada,

slávnostne vyhlasujeme,

že tisícročné úsilie slovenského národa o svojbytnosť

sa naplnilo.

V tejto historickej chvíli deklarujeme prirodzené právo slovenského národa na sebaurčenie tak, ako to zakotvujú aj všetky medzinárodné dohody a zmluvy o práve národov na sebaurčenie.

Uznávajúc právo národov na sebaurčenie, vyhlasujeme, že aj my si chceme slobodne utvárať spôsob a formu národného a štátneho života, pričom budeme rešpektovať práva všetkých, každého občana, národov, národnostných menšín a etnických skupín, demokratické a humanistické odkazy Európy a sveta.

Touto deklaráciou Slovenská národná rada vyhlasuje zvrchovanosť Slovenskej republiky ako základ suverénneho štátu slovenského národa.

We, the democratically elected Slovak National Council,

solemnly declare

that the thousand years' struggle of Slovak nation for independence ("self-standing") has been fulfilled.

In this historical moment, we declare the natural right of the Slovak nation for self-determination, as embodied by all international agreements and treaties about the right of nations for self-determination.

Recognizing the right of nations for self-determination, we declare, that we also want to freely create the way and form of national and state life, while respecting the rights of everybody, all citizens, nations, national minorities, ethnic groups, the democratic and humanist legacy of Europe and of the world.

By this declaration, the Slovak National Council declares sovereignty of the Slovak Republic as a basis for a sovereign state of the Slovak nation.

Bratislava, 17 July 1992

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8537">The '''Smithsonian Ocean Portal''' is an [[educational website]] created and maintained by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, DC. The website features regularly updated, original content from the museum's research, collections, and Sant Ocean Hall as well as content provided by a number of collaborating organizations.
According to the site's statement of purpose, the Ocean Portal was created to "help increase public knowledge about the ocean and marine science, raise public awareness of the ocean's importance to all life, and inspire millions of online visitors to become caring ocean stewards."&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Ocean Portal, Statement of Purpose, February 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by private donations, the Ocean Portal is designed to appeal to a broad audience, but the primary audiences are young adults, ocean enthusiasts, educators, and children ages 9–13.

The Ocean Portal represents the third pillar of the National Museum of Natural History's Ocean Initiative, created to further the museum's mission to increase ocean awareness and stewardship. The other pillars of the initiative include the Sant Ocean Hall, the museum's largest exhibition to date, and the Sant Chair for Marine Science, currently filled by marine biologist Dr. [[Nancy Knowlton]]. The National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) cares for an estimated 126 million specimens, approximately 94% of all Smithsonian collections. About one-third of NMNH collections and staff focus on the marine realm. NMNH houses the world's largest marine collection, originating from marine research efforts that date back 160 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/images/Documents/20100615/testimony_coddington.pdf |title=Testimony of Dr. Jonathan Coddington Associate Director of Research and Collections Before the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans and Wildlife Committee on Natural Resources U.S. House of Representatives Hearing on Ocean Science and Data Limits in a Time of Crisis: Do NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have the Resources to Respond? |author= |date=June 15, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] |accessdate=30 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707221304/http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/images/Documents/20100615/testimony_coddington.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In a first for any Smithsonian Institution website, the Smithsonian Ocean Portal is built on a [[LAMP architecture]] using the free, open-source software called [[Drupal]]. The New York-based web developer [[Funny Garbage]] designed and built the Smithsonian Ocean Portal. The Beta version of the website went live in December 2009. Three months later, in March 2010, the [[National Museum of Natural History]] launched ''What Does It Mean to Be Human?'', its second Drupal website and the online companion to the [[David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins]].
For several months in early 2010 the Ocean Portal site was tested among specific audiences while development continued. The Beta site launched to the broader public on June 2, 2010 as part of the celebration of [[World Oceans Day]] on June 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-unveils-new-webby-award-winning-website-dedicated-ocean-education-and-stewardsh |title=Smithsonian Unveils New Webby Award-Winning Website Dedicated to Ocean Education and Stewardship |author=Pressroom of the Smithsonian Institution |date=June 7, 2010 |work= |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lebprincess.jpg|thumb|left|Recreated costume of a Lebanese princess from the nineteenth century, including a tantur]]

The '''tantour''' (tantoor) was a form of cone-shaped woman's headdress similar to the [[hennin]], popular in the [[Levant]] during the nineteenth century, but seldom seen after 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://almashriq.hiof.no/general/600.technology/640/646/costumes_of_the_Levant/19th.html | contribution = 19th Century Lebanese Princess |title= Almashriq | publisher= Hiof | place = NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.trmkt.com/tantour.htm |title= The Tantour or Shihabbiyeen |publisher= TRMKT | accessdate= 2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tradition persisted longer in Lebanon among the [[Druze]], as evidenced by the 1870s photograph to the right. 

The tantour was held in place by ribbons tied around the head.  A silk scarf was wound around the base with a white veil attached to the peak.  The height and composition of the tantour were proportional to the wealth of its owner, with the most splendid tantours made of gold and reaching as high as thirty inches. Some were encrusted with gems and pearls. 

The tantour was a customary gift presented to the bride by her husband on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://almashriq.hiof.no/general/600/640/646/costumes_of_the_Levant/origin.html | title = Almashriq | contribution = Origin of Levantine Costumes | publisher = Hiof | location = NO| accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funk is known for the longevity of his career – which has spanned more than 50 years and includes multiple short-lived retirements – and the influential [[hardcore wrestling]] style he pioneered in the latter part of his career.&lt;ref name="slambio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/ResultsArchive/Wrestlers/funk-terry.html|title=Terry Funk|publisher=[[Quebecor Media]]|author=Engler, Craig|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grasso2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Grasso|title=Historical Dictionary of Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUsJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|date=6 March 2014|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7926-3|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his career, Funk has wrestled for numerous major promotions, among them [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], the [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]], [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]], the [[United States Wrestling Association]], [[World Championship Wrestling]], the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and multiple [[National Wrestling Alliance]] territories including [[World Class Championship Wrestling|Big Time Wrestling]], [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] and [[Stampede Wrestling]]. He was the promoter of the [[Amarillo]], [[Texas]]-based [[Western States Sports]] promotion.

[[Championship (professional wrestling)|Championships]] held by Funk include the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]], [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship]], [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]], and [[ECW World Television Championship]].

Funk has been inducted into multiple halls of fame, among them [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWE]], [[WCW Hall of Fame|WCW]], and the [[NWA Hall of Fame|NWA]].

==Early life==
Funk was born on June 30, 1944 in [[Hammond, Indiana]]. He is the son of Dorothy (Culver) and [[Dory Funk]], a professional wrestler and [[professional wrestling promotion|promoter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/020209/obi_obits3.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153747/http://amarillo.com/stories/020209/obi_obits3.shtml |archivedate=2018-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the family relocated to [[Amarillo, Texas]], where Terry and his brother [[Dory Funk, Jr|Dory, Jr.,]] grew up in the professional wrestling business. After graduating from high school, Funk attended [[West Texas A&amp;M University|West Texas State University]] (now West Texas A&amp;M University), where he competed in [[amateur wrestling]] and [[American football|football]].&lt;ref name="Solomon2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Solomon|title=Pro Wrestling FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the World's Most Entertaining Spectacle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5DqCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT280|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-1-61713-627-6|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===NWA Western States Wrestling (1965–1979)===
{{main|Western States Sports}}
Funk started his career in 1965, working in his father [[Dory Funk]]'s, [[Western States Sports]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Solomon2015"/&gt; He and his brother, [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], quickly rose up the ranks as a team and in single matches against top names like Ernie Ladd and Hank James. They became big money wrestlers by the end of the decade.

===NWA Championship Wrestling from Florida (1970–1982)===
[[File:Terry Funk NWA Champion.jpg|thumb|Funk as [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] in 1976]]
In 1975, Terry defeated [[Jack Brisco]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in Miami, when Dory failed to appear for a title shot. He began a fourteen-month title reign defending the title against Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Carlos Rocha, Giant Baba and Pat O`Connor. In addition to North America, he defended the belt in Australia, Japan and Singapore. The historic reign ended in [[Toronto]] when he was defeated by "Handsome" [[Harley Race]], who had earlier beaten Dory, Jr., for NWA World Heavyweight Championship before losing it to Jack Brisco. Race lifted Funk for a shinbreaker and then trapped him in an Indian death leglock. When Funk failed to respond to referee [[Fred Atkins]] the match was stopped.

During 1981, Terry spent some time in the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] feuding with [[Jerry Lawler]]. The most memorable match in this feud happened in April 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. The match took place in the empty arena, with only [[Lance Russell]], a cameraman, and a photographer present. Funk had challenged Lawler to this match at this time because he felt he was getting unfairly treated in Memphis.  The confrontation only lasted a few minutes, and ended with Funk trying to put Lawler's eye out with a broken 2x4. But Lawler kicked Funk's elbow, causing him to hit himself in the eye. The tape aired on April 25, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2peOLg5gqKY&lt;/ref&gt;

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1972–1991)===
Terry and Dory, Jr. also made a name for themselves in [[Japan]]. Terry became a star in the eyes of the Japanese fans with his over the top mannerisms, sometimes colorful get-ups, and his brawling ability. In Japan, the Funks were heels until they faced The Sheik and Abdullah The Butcher in Tokyo. The two later faced Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, and Giant Baba in memorable feuds as well.

===World Wrestling Federation (1985–1986) ===
Terry Funk made his [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) debut in 1985 after a brief run in the AWA. In his televised debut on ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'', he not only beat [[Aldo Ortiz|Aldo Marino]], but he also beat on ring announcer Mel Phillips. Funk attacked Phillips, after Phillips made the mistake of putting on Funk's cowboy hat. Funk also had a gimmick of carrying a [[Livestock branding|branding iron]] with him to ringside and using it to "brand" his fallen opponents. The attack on Phillips lead to a feud with Junkyard Dog. In the mid-1980s, Funk teamed with Dory (calling himself "Hoss" Funk) and [[Ferrin Barr Jr.|Jimmy Jack Funk]], a storyline "brother." They were managed by [[Jimmy Hart]]. At the time, he had a heated rivalry with the [[Junkyard Dog]] which led to a match between Terry Funk and Hoss Funk and the team of [[Tito Santana]] and Junkyard Dog at [[WrestleMania 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry also had a series of WWF title matches against Hulk Hogan.

===World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990, 1994)===
Funk joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1989 and became part of the [[J-Tex Corporation]]. He began feuding with [[Ric Flair]], who had defeated [[Ricky Steamboat]] at [[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Funk, who was one of three judges for the main event, challenged Flair to a title match. Flair refused, saying that Funk was "spending time in Hollywood" instead of focusing on wrestling. Funk then attacked, [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriving]] Flair on a ringside table. This put the champion, Flair, out of action until the [[Great American Bash (1989)|Great American Bash]] where he faced Funk. Flair won the match by reversing a small package into one of his own, but shortly after was attacked by [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] and [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]]. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] came to aid Flair and the two brawled with Funk and Muta to close the show. Funk got injured but returned to continue feuding with Ric Flair. The two then had an [["I Quit" match]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions IX: New York Knockout|Clash of the Champions]]'', which Funk lost after yelling "Yes, I quit!" after Flair put on the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|Figure four leglock]]. This match received a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] from [[Dave Meltzer]]. A notable part of the feud occurred when Funk used an actual plastic shopping bag to suffocate Flair on television after Flair and Sting defeated Muta and [[Dick Slater]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions VIII: Fall Brawl|Clash of the Champions]]''. After losing a ''Clash of Champions'' match against Flair, he shook Flair's hand, and was attacked by Gary Hart's stable. Soon after he became a color commentator and the host of his own segment ''Funk's Grill'' where a tuxedo clad Funk would amiably interview the top stars of WCW, both face and heel. This did not last long and he left soon after for the USWA.

In 1994, Funk reappeared in WCW and wrestled [[Tully Blanchard]] to a double disqualification at [[Slamboree 1994]] and later that night, he became a member of [[Robert Fuller (wrestler)|Colonel Robert Parker's]] [[Stud Stable]].&lt;ref name=Stud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/stud-stable.html|title=Stud Stable|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Bunkhouse Buck]], [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]], the stable would focus their energies on [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]], as well as [[The Nasty Boys]], culminating in a [[War Games match]] at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]].

===IWA Japan and the King of the Death Match tournament (1994–1995)===
In 1994, Terry Funk would join the fledgling [[IWA Japan]] wrestling promotion. Funk would go on to be a participant in IWA's most famous event the King of the Death Match Tournament, held on August 20, 1995 in Kawasaki. Funk would first defeat Leatherface and Tiger Jeet Singh in extreme-style matches which featured barbed wire covered boards, glass, and chains before moving on to the finals of the tournament. In the finals, Funk was defeated by protégé Cactus Jack, later known by US audiences as [[Mick Foley]], in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Exploding Barbed Wire Boards &amp; Exploding Ring Time Bomb Death Match. Besides "The King Of the Death Match" show. Terry in the same promotion, IWA Japan, would participate in some of the most dangerous matches in the world at the time. Terry put on fire death matches, and very intense barbed wire matches. Terry and Mick Foley battled in a fire no roped barbed wire death match in early 1995. The event was titled " The Duel Of The Wilds " which could debated in terms of violence compared to " The Kawasaki dream " death match tournament.

===NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–1997)===
Later in Funk's career, his style changed from wrestling traditional southern style wrestling matches to the more violent style of [[hardcore wrestling]]. In 1993, after a special appearance against Blanchard at World Championship Wrestling's Slamboree, Funk promised to help the fledgling Eastern Championship Wrestling (later renamed [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] or ECW) by lending his talent and notoriety to the promotion. On July 16, Terry and Dory Funk lost a barbed wire match against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. Funk maintained a regular schedule of wrestling for ECW in its early days while also competing in Japan. He had many feuds and wrestled programs with wrestlers such as [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], [[Shane Douglas|"The Franchise" Shane Douglas]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], and Terry's own protege, [[Tommy Dreamer]].

Funk further elevated ECW by headlining their first pay-per-view, [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]] on April 13, 1997, winning the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. Earlier in the night, he defeated The Sandman and [[Stevie Richards]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], thus earning him the match with Raven. He was later defeated for the title by Sabu in a barbed wire match at ''Born to Be Wired'', in which the ropes of the ring were taken down and replaced with barbed wire. Both men had to be cut out of the wires at the end of the match. Sabu had his biceps visibly torn open by the barbed wire – as a result, the wound was taped up and the match continued. In September of that same year, a show was held in Funk's hometown of Amarillo. It was called "WrestleFest – 50 Years of Funk" and was both his own show and a celebration of the careers of Terry, his father, and his brother. Terry lost to then [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bret Hart]] in the main event, a non-title match. However, before the match, ECW owner Paul Heyman presented Terry with a belt, paid for through a collection taken up by wrestlers on the ECW roster, that declared him the ''Lifetime ECW World Heavyweight Champion''.

===Return to WWF (1997–1998)===
Funk's retirement lasted just three months before he began taking bookings again. After several independent matches, most notable ones against Rik Ratchet that drew many fans on the east coast, Funk returned on the December 29, 1997 episode of ''Raw''. Funk returned to WWF as '''Chainsaw Charlie''', although his true identity was soon acknowledged by the announcers, teaming with [[Mick Foley]], who was wrestling under his Cactus Jack persona. Charlie and Jack would enter a feud with [[The New Age Outlaws]], where they were defeated by them on the January 26, 1998 episode of ''Raw'' by disqualification. The following week on ''Raw'', Charlie and Jack would have a match against each other, with the match ending in a no contest after the Outlaws would attack both men, placing them both in a dumpster and then pushing it off the stage. At [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House]], Charlie and Jack would team with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Owen Hart]], defeating the team of [[Triple H]], [[Savio Vega]] and the Outlaws. At [[WrestleMania XIV]], Charlie and Jack would defeat the Outlaws in a [[professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Dumpster match]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/mar29_wrestlemania.html|title=Austin wins WWF World Title at WrestleMania|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-10-29|date=March 30, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following night, on the March 30 episode of ''Raw'', Charlie and Jack would lose the titles back to the Outlaws in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]].

On the April 13 episode of ''Raw'', Funk would begin wrestling as himself, and forming a tag team with [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. The team would be short lived, with them defeating the likes of [[The Quebecers]] and [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The New Midnight Express]].

{{About|the British official publications generically known by the name of The Nautical Almanac|other uses including other nautical almanacs|Nautical almanac (disambiguation)}}

'''''The Nautical Almanac''''' has been the familiar name for a series of official British [[almanacs]] published under various titles since the first issue of ''The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'', for 1767:  this was the first [[nautical almanac]] to contain data dedicated to the convenient determination of longitude at sea. It was originally published from the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="HMNAO history"&gt;{{cite web

Since 1958 (with the issue for the year 1960), [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]] and the [[US Naval Observatory]] have jointly published a unified ''Nautical Almanac'', for use by the navies of both countries.&lt;ref name="USNO almanac history"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate =  11 October 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

The changing names and contents of related titles in the series are summarised as follows. (The issue years mentioned below are those for which the data in the relevant issue were calculated—and the issues were in practice published in advance of the year for which they were calculated, at different periods of history, anything from 1 to 5 years in advance).

(For many years, official nautical almanacs and astronomical ephemerides in the UK and the USA had a linked history, and they became merged in both titles and contents in 1981.)&lt;ref name="ESAA" /&gt;

In the UK, the official publications have been:&lt;ref name="ESAE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ESAE 1961, see esp. sect.1B.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1767–1959==

* For 1767–1959, ''The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'' contained both astro-navigational and general astronomical data (this complete publication was often referred to, for short, especially in the earlier years, as just ''The Nautical Almanac'').  From 1832, responsibility for publication was transferred to [[HM Nautical Almanac Office|Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]].

The main distinctive feature of the inaugural issue for 1767 was the tabulation of lunar distances as a tool to facilitate the determination of longitude at sea from observations of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;D Howse, ''Nevil Maskelyne – The Seaman's Astronomer'', Cambridge, 1989, esp. at p.87; also, on p.90, Howse points out that the idea of an almanac with lunar distances had previously been proposed in France, by [[Lacaille]], e.g. in a paper annexed to the French almanac 'Connaissance des Temps' for 1761 (published 1759).  Lacaille had provided a sample table of pre-computed lunar distances for fourteen days of July 1761, tabulated at 4-hour intervals, and promised more to come, but the proposal was not further implemented there.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a few years, the publishers of almanacs of other countries began to adopt the practice of tabulating lunar distances.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Boistel, ''Astronomie Nautique au XVIIIeme siecle en France'' (2001), vol. 1, p. 264, showing for example that [[Jérôme Lalande|Lalande]] in Paris incorporated lunar distances into the long-established 'Connaissance des Temps' as from the issue for 1774 (published 1772) – initially as a copy of the English lunar-distance data, and still based on the Greenwich meridian as in the Nautical Almanac itself, moving later to lunar-distance data independently calculated for the meridian of Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lunar distances continued to be published in the UK official almanacs until 1906, by which time their use had declined in practice.  For some time thereafter, in the issues for the years 1907–1919, examples of how to calculate them were given instead.&lt;ref&gt;ESAE 1961, sect. 7D, p.190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Time:  The issues for 1767 to 1833 gave their ephemeris tabulations in terms of Greenwich apparent (not mean) time.  This was on the grounds that an important class of user was the 'Mariner', and that 'apparent Time' was "the same which he will obtain by the Altitudes of the Sun or Stars in the Manner hereafter prescribed". Mean time at Greenwich (i.e. mean solar time) was adopted as from the issue for 1834 and continued to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;ESAE 1961 at pp. 3–5, sect.1B.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the issue for 1924, the time argument for Greenwich Mean Time was counted from 0h starting at Greenwich mean noon (on the civil day with the same number), and starting with the issue for 1925 the commencement point of the time argument was changed so that 0h became midnight at the beginning of the civil day with the relevant number, to coincide for the future with the civil reckoning.

During parts of the period 1767–1959, separate subsidiary titles dedicated to navigation were also published:
* For 1896–1913: Part 1 of the ''Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'' (containing the astro-navigational data) was also published separately as ''The Nautical Almanac &amp; Astronomical Ephemeris, Part 1''.
* For 1914–1951: the former Part 1 (after redesign) was renamed ''The Nautical Almanac Abridged for the Use of Seamen''.
* For 1952–1959: after further redesign, it was again renamed, as ''The Abridged Nautical Almanac'' (and renamed yet again for 1960 onwards as simply ''The Nautical Almanac'').

==1960–1980==

* From the issues for 1960, the official titles were redesigned and unified (as to content) between the UK and USA, under the titles (in UK) ''The Astronomical Ephemeris'' and (separately) ''The Nautical Almanac''.

Time:  A major change introduced with the 1960 issue of ''The Astronomical Ephemeris'' was the use of [[ephemeris time]] in place of mean solar time for the major ephemeris tabulations.&lt;ref&gt;ESAA 1992, p.612.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the ''Nautical Almanac'', now continuing as a separate publication addressed largely to navigators, continued to give tabulations based on mean solar time (UT).

==1981 to date==

* For 1981 to date, the official titles have been unified in UK and USA (as to title as well as (redesigned) content): ''The [[Astronomical Almanac]]'' and ''The Nautical Almanac''.&lt;ref name="ESAA" /&gt;

==The British ''Nautical Almanac'' in the United States==

In the US, an official (and initially separate) series of [[ephemeris]] publications began with the issue for 1855 as ''The [[American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac]]'';  but before that, the British ''Nautical Almanac'' was commonly used on American ships and in the United States&lt;ref&gt;ESAE (1961), sect.1B&lt;/ref&gt; – sometimes in the form of an independently printed American 'impression' instead.&lt;ref&gt;G W Blunt White Library at the Mystic Seaport Museum, Mystic, Connecticut, CT 06355, USA, for a copy of an independent 'Second American impression' of (the British title) ''The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'' for 1804, e.g. at https://library.mysticseaport.org/initiative/ImPage.cfm?PageNum=1&amp;BibId=21382&amp;ChapterId=1{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} (retrieved Feb 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern alternative data sources==

Almanac data is now also available online from the [[US Naval Observatory]].&lt;ref name="USNO celnavdata"&gt;

[[File:Cambridge University, Chapel, King's College, King's Parade.jpg|thumb|right|King's College Chapel]]
'''''The Night Climbers of Cambridge''''' is a book, written under the pseudonym "Whipplesnaith", about [[Night climbing|nocturnal climbing]] on the colleges and town buildings of [[Cambridge]], England, in the 1930s. The book remains popular among [[Cambridge University]] students and is hard to find. It is often credited with popularising and inspiring the first generation of [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] and night climbers.

==History==
After extensive research, it was revealed that "Whipplesnaith" is a pseudonym for  Noël Howard Symington, who feared retribution for his work. Eric Waddams either took or featured in most of the photographs. 

The book was originally published in October 1937 by [[Chatto and Windus]] and proved popular. The book was revised in November 1937 and reprinted in 1952 and 1953, selling out each time. The second edition contains a reordered selection of photographs and a missing diagram explaining the escape from the roof of the Marks and Spencer, as well as other useful information on night climbing.

The book was sought after, especially in Cambridge itself where it was regarded as one of few "guidebooks" to the routes onto the roofs of the town's ancient buildings. Famous climbs documented in the book are the [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] chapels and the "[[Senate House, Cambridge|Senate House]] leap" across [[Senate House Passage]] between [[Gonville and Caius College]] and the Senate House. ''The Night Climbers of Cambridge'' is often credited with inspiring the next generation of urban explorers and spawned many [[University of Cambridge legends]] and traditions. Since its publication several climbs of King's College Chapel have been completed.

A new authorised edition&lt;ref&gt;''Night Climbers of Cambridge'', Oleander Press, Cambridge, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1909349551}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published on 26 October 2007 by Oleander Press, Cambridge, to mark the 70th anniversary of the original edition. The new edition was updated and has proved popular among [[Oxbridge]] students and urban explorers.

==Similar projects==
In addition to ''The Night Climbers of Cambridge'', an omnibus edition of ''The Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity''&lt;ref&gt;''Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity'', Omnibus edition, Oleander Press, Cambridge, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was published on 11 July 2011 by Oleander Press. Its introduction contains further details about Symington and his book. In addition it included not before seen information on night-climbing and urban exploring in Cambridge and the surrounding towns, villages and country houses.  The ''Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity'' has remained popular, though it is easier to find in bookshops than the original ''Night Climbers''.

Given its sometimes clandestine nature, some Cambridge students have described ''The Night Climbers of Cambridge'' as a modern day [[Marauder's Map]] of [[Harry Potter]] fame. In 2014, a team of Cambridge engineers designed an online app called the "Cambridge Marauders Map", which allowed friends to view their movements within the colleges of Cambridge and identify potential hazards. The Marauders Map app included many climbing and urban exploring features taken from ''The Night Climbers of Cambridge''. The app is no longer publicly available.

==Legacy==
Symington stood for [[Harborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Harborough]] in  [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]] as an independent [[Oswald Mosley|Mosleyite]] candidate, receiving 273 votes. In 1958 he published the book ''Return to Responsibility: A New Concept of the Case for Fascism in the Post-War World''.

''The Night Climbers of Cambridge'' is repeatedly referred to in ''The Bad Quarto'', a mystery novel by [[Jill Paton Walsh]]. Her novel mentions a supposed additional chapter regarding night climbing in [[List of fictional Cambridge colleges|St Agatha's College]], the fictional Cambridge setting for most of Walsh's story's about Imogen Quy, college nurse at St Agatha's. Night climbing plays a central role in ''The Bad Quarto'', along with a production of the 1603 quarto version of ''Hamlet''.

'''''The Worship of the Serpent''''' by [[John Bathurst Deane]] is an 1833 study of [[snake worship]] and specifically the snake mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]], leading her to convince [[Adam]] to do the same.

==Overview==
A number of [[Gnostic]] texts, some only discovered recently such as those from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] expound on an idea of knowledge and how the serpent gave knowledge to man. Deane draws a number of conclusions and makes certain guesses regarding snake worship, not just confined to Europe, but indeed all over the world. Deane goes on in his title to list a number of associations to the serpent such as the [[dragon]] and the [[leviathan]]. So thorough (albeit outdated) is his research, that he has "traced THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT from Babylonia, east and west, through Persia, Hindûstan, China, Mexico, Britain, Scandinavia, Italy, Illyricum, Thrace, Greece, Asia Minor, and Phœnicia." (Ch VIII)&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd,''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World'' (2006), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sumerian-akkadian lexicon Louvre AO7662.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|16th tablet of the ''Urra=hubullu'', [[Louvre Museum]]]]

The '''''Urra=hubullu'''''  ({{Cuneiform|𒄯𒊏  𒄷𒇧𒈝}} {{transl|Xsux|ur&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-ra — ḫu-bul-lu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is a major Babylonian [[glossary]] or "[[encyclopedia]]".
It consists of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[lexical lists]] ordered by topic. The canonical version extends to 24 tablets. The conventional title is the first gloss,  ''ur&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-ra'' and ''ḫubullu'' meaning "interest-bearing debt" in Sumerian and Akkadian, respectively. One bilingual version from [[Ugarit]] [RS2.(23)+] is Sumerian/[[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] rather than  Sumerian/Akkadian.

A partial table of contents:

* Tablet 4: naval vehicles
* Tablet 5: terrestrial vehicles
* Tablets 13 to 15: systematic enumeration of the names of domestic animals, terrestrial animals, and birds (including bats)
* Tablet 16: stones
* Tablet 17: plants.
* Tablet 22: [[Babylonian star catalogues|star names]]

The bulk of the collection was compiled in the Old Babylonian period (early 2nd millennium BC), with pre-canonical forerunner documents extending into the later 3rd millennium.

Like other canonical glossaries, the Urra=hubullu was often used for scribal practice.
Other Babylonian glossaries include:
*Ea:  a family of lists that give the simple signs of the cuneiform writing system with their pronunciation and Akkadian meanings. (MSL volume 14)
*"Table of [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Measures]]":  conversion tables for grain, weights and surface measurements. Again, it is not clear how these tablets were used.  
*[[LÚ|Lú]] and Lú=ša, a list of professions (MSL volume 12)
*Izi, a list of compound words ordered by increasing complexity 
*Diri "limited to compound logograms whose reading cannot be inferred from their individual components; it also includes marginal cases such as reduplications, presence or absence of determinatives, and the like." (MSL volume 14)
*Nigga, Erimhuš and other school texts

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">[[File:RM513378 Haarlem - Grote Houtstraat 1.jpg|thumb|right|Verwey hall from the Grote Houtstraat looking north. The street level is in use by shops and a restaurant, and the upper levels are accessible from the entrance near the [[Vleeshal]]. Along the top of the facade are the words "Modern Art" and the names of Haarlem artists [[Isaac Israëls|Israëls]], [[Herman Kruyder|Kruyder]], [[Jan Sluyters|Sluyters]], [[Jacobus van Looy|Van Looy]], [[Mari Andriessen|Andriessen]], [[Otto B. de Kat|De Kat]] and [[Leo Gestel|Gestel]].]]
The '''Verweyhal''' is an exhibition space next to the [[Vleeshal]] on the [[Grote Markt, Haarlem]]. The Verweyhal was built in the 19th century as a gentlemen’s society of the former drama society, later a cultural social club, [[Trou moet Blycken]].

In the second half of the 19th century the earlier building of the drama society, which was on the same spot, was too small. In 1876 the society held a competition for a new design. The [[Amsterdam]] architect [[A.J. van Beek]] won, and his plan was carried out with the help of local builder A. Raasveld.&lt;ref name=Rijks&gt;Rijksmonument report&lt;/ref&gt; The building was occupied in 1880. The building is in the Eclectic style that was very popular at the end of the 19th century in Haarlem, but later fell out of fashion. In the first half of the 20th century, the building received a great deal of criticism. It was considered much too large and pompous. ‘An object of general contempt,’ according to the description of the distinguished gentlemen’s society.

Almost immediately, the gentleman's society had financial problems.  Perhaps the building project had been a bit too prestigious.  The gentlemen initially tried to alleviate the situation by raising their membership contribution.  That did not help, because the number of members declined.  As the increased contribution did not solve the problem, the ground floor was rented out as a shop.  This income did not help either, and in 1922 the gentlemen were forced to sell the building to the city, which became the new owner for 125,000 [[guilder]]s, and they moved to their [[Trou moet Blycken|current premises]] further down the [[Grote Houtstraat]] at number 115.&lt;ref name=Rijks/&gt;

The society building was converted in 1924 into the ''Spaarnebank''. The safe was on the ground floor; offices were set up on the first floor. The building was called ‘an unsuccessful box of blocks’ in 1947 by the engineer G. Friedhoff, who wanted to demolish the building and replace it with traditional façades. 

More renovations were carried out in 1978 when the first floor was remodelled to house the Department of Cultural Affairs, the local City Planning Authority and the office of the City Architect.

Fourteen years later, in 1992, the building was renovated again as a future exhibition hall to house the collection of the Haarlem artist [[Kees Verwey]].  With support from his newly formed [[Kees Verwey Foundation]], the first floor received a new name: the Verweyhal. The former city architect [[Wiek Röling]] made a design for the new layout together with architect [[Jan Bernard]]. 

Opinions about the building changed in the 1970s, and for the first time, words of praise were heard. Today, the building is an official monument and still has a museological function.

The entrance today to the upper exhibition floors is through [[Museum De Hallen, Haarlem]] on the Grote Markt and no longer through the original main entrance on the Grote Houtstraat.
